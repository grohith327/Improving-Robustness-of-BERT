orig sent (1):	i never saw this when i was a kid , so this was seen with fresh eyes i had never heard of it and rented it for my 5 year old daughter plus , the idea of christopher walken singing and dancing made me curious the special fx are cheesy and the singing and dancing is mediocre but the story is great my daughter was entranced i loved watching walken in this role thinking about what the future held for him very amusing to see him dance ! and if the songs were n't great , at least they were n't disney over produced saccharine sweetness the ogre scene in the beginning was a little scary for her , and she was a little nervous when we saw him again at the end , but it was mostly benign interestingly , we had recently read puss in boots , and i had wondered about the implausibility of the story but while staying true to almost every aspect , walken 's acting made it believable great fun i 'd watch it again with my daughter

orig sent (1):	this film reminds me of 42nd street starring bebe daniels and ruby keeler when i watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd street , especially the character eloise who 's a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle , like bebe daniels did in 42nd street and another performer gets the part and become a star this film , like most race films , keeps people watching because of the great entertainment race films always showed black entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era the dancing styles , the music , dressing styles , you 'll love it this movie could of been big if it was made in hollywood , it would of had better scenery , better filming , and more money which would make any movie better but its worth watching because it is good and micheaux does good with the little he has i have to say out of all micheaux 's films , swing is the best !

orig sent (1):	this movie is good it 's not the best of the great cg kung fu flicks but its pretty good first thing first , the story is actually good the whole idea of gods vs fallen gods type deal with super powers is pretty cool my problem is there s too many characters ! it got very confusing when they switched scenes ! the special effects were incredible ! the fighting scenes were very fast paced and complex this movie practically all computer generated the acting is superb , as always expected from such high profile players ekin cheng makes an excellent protagonist , loner character zhang ziyi did nothing for me in this movie i thought she would have a bigger part but she did one fight scene and a whole lot of yapping the bad guy , the whole skull army and the whole blood cloud thing is very frightening the music is also excellent to me this story deserve at least a mini series and not just one movie there s too much story to cram in 2 hours maybe if there was a book or something , i would be able to keep up with all the characters and the details this movie sacrifices story integrity for action i reccomend storm riders over this any day

underlines its illusions br br art is what causes the passage between what 's outside the illusion of love to what 's inside , which is the truth , and is a learning of this truth for instance , when veronika notices the strange way alexandre makes is bed , he answers that he saw it in a movie , and then , that a movie , it 's made for that , to learn how to live , how to make a bed alexander wants to live like he was in a film , he wants his life to be art br br this conception of art comes from proust , with whom eustache shares the same rejection of political art and realism in art la maman et la putain fights against a conception of art principaly political see for example the ironical review of a political movie by alexandre like proust says art does n't care for all this proclamations , and only exists in silence first of all , art is introspection and that also why realism or naturalism is rejected art needs to transform reality to exist proust writes i discover the illusion of realism , which is a lie that 's why la maman et la putain does n't hide its artificiality , underlines by the way the actors say their text the more you seem artificial , the higher you go , said eustache br br eustache and proust both share this idea that the artist is a translater of a inner truth but , alexandre failed where eustache succeed la maman et la putain tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is you can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie , which becomes saddest you can see it in the face of alexandre , who looks more and more like a living dead you can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer , and that after a while , nothing happens outside at the end of the movie , when you see alexandre writing , and veronika asking if he 's writing his life , you can guess that he 's not , that even literature failed the end of the movie shows the symbolic death of alexander , who is smashes by the heaviness of reality and in this tiny nurse 's room , alexandre looks more like albertine than marcel br br to explain this failure , we can say that alexandre is a balzac 's reader in forme et signification , jean rousset explains that , in proust 's , the readers of balzac , who are swann and charlus , are unable of any artistic creation , because they 're stuck in reality , which they mistake with art they see reality in art and are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work , between reality and art and that 's exactly alexandre he claims for instance that he loves a woman for parallel reasons , because she played in a bresson 's for example he 's like swann , who falls in love with odette because she looks like a botticelli 's woman br br life is perhaps not my vocation this thought is indeed by eustache , who committed suicide , even if it 's said by alexandre nevertheless , there is a difference between alexandre and eustache if eustache is absolutely alexandre , alexandre is like a double without art , a horrible vision of the artist , which crystallizes his fears br br by fallowing veronika at the end of the movie , alexandre is condemned to illusions it 's death that remind me the last frames of the movie , in the face of jean pierre l aud as well as in the endless pucking of veronika or maybe it is already hell that describes the end , like in sarte 's huit clot , and absolutely not like in the final liberation of le temps retrouv if eustache had read proust , alexandre could never have finish the book , always perturbed by life and veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the caf s la maman et la putain is like a inverse double of in search of lost times , which tells how alexander does n't become an artist , whereas a la recherche du temps perdu tells how marcel becomes a writer \( genette \) br br if , like baudelaire says , an artiste tells reality at the light of his dream , it is his nightmare that eustache tells us in la maman et la putain

maman et la putain fights against a conception of art principaly political see for example the ironical review of a political movie by alexandre like proust says art does n't care for all this proclamations , and only exists in silence first of all , art is introspection and that also why realism or naturalism is rejected art needs to transform reality to exist proust writes i discover the illusion of realism , which is a lie that 's why la maman et la putain does n't hide its artificiality , underlines by the way the actors say their text the more you seem artificial , the higher you go , said eustache br br eustache and proust both share this idea that the artist is a translater of a inner truth but , alexandre failed where eustache succeed la maman et la putain tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is you can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie , which becomes saddest you can see it in the face of alexandre , who looks more and more like a living dead you can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer , and that after a while , nothing happens outside at the end of the movie , when you see alexandre writing , and veronika asking if he 's writing his life , you can guess that he 's not , that even literature failed the end of the movie shows the symbolic death of alexander , who is smashes by the heaviness of reality and in this tiny nurse 's room , alexandre looks more like albertine than marcel br br to explain this failure , we can say that alexandre is a balzac 's reader in forme et signification , jean rousset explains that , in proust 's , the readers of balzac , who are swann and charlus , are unable of any artistic creation , because they 're stuck in reality , which they mistake with art they see reality in art and are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work , between reality and art and that 's exactly alexandre he claims for instance that he loves a woman for parallel reasons , because she played in a bresson 's for example he 's like swann , who falls in love with odette because she looks like a botticelli 's woman br br life is perhaps not my vocation this thought is indeed by eustache , who committed suicide , even if it 's said by alexandre nevertheless , there is a difference between alexandre and eustache if eustache is absolutely alexandre , alexandre is like a double without art , a horrible vision of the artist , which crystallizes his fears br br by fallowing veronika at the end of the movie , alexandre is condemned to illusions it 's death that remind me the last frames of the movie , in the face of jean pierre l aud as well as in the endless pucking of veronika or maybe it is already hell that describes the end , like in sarte 's huit clot , and absolutely not like in the final liberation of le temps retrouv if eustache had read proust , alexandre could never have finish the book , always perturbed by life and veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the caf s la maman et la putain is like a inverse double of in search of lost times , which tells how alexander does n't become an artist , whereas a la recherche du temps perdu tells how marcel becomes a writer \( genette \) br br if , like baudelaire says , an artiste tells reality at the light of his dream , it is his nightmare that eustache tells us in la maman et la putain

orig sent (1):	father of the pride is a pleasant surprise it is funny , witty and features some great voice acting the show is about the family of a lion who is acting as the attraction of siegfried roy shows indeed all of them are stereotypes but that 's what makes them so funny fotp is not a kiddie cartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way it is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed i 'd say i 'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not very original , i 've seen most of those stereotypes many times before , even in that particular order !

orig sent (1):	i never saw it on tv but rented the dvd through netflix as soon as i found that it was available i had high expectations , and was not disappointed it 's funny , and the animation is excellent that level of quality i would only have expected from feature films , so i 'm surprised at some of the bad comments on it maybe the dvd release had improved animation \? one bonus to the dvd is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot i 'm an adult , and i really appreciate that it is for adults it is n't only kids who like cute animated characters it is nowhere near raunchy as some have claimed , but i can see where some parents would n't want their young children to see it i 'm very disappointed that it was cancelled i wish they would produce more episodes or perhaps a movie

orig sent (1):	at least for a half hour a week i have n't been interested in anything on the big 3 networks \( abc cbs nbc \) in years all of the lions are interesting , although larry can get annoying at times i really like the middle earth action figures they bring in with hunter most of the other characters are interesting as well the sideshow of siegfried and roy is entertaining at times , too the animation is top notch , and definitely the best cg that has been done on a weekly tv show usually when they hire big names to star in a show , they 're trying to hide a poor script or characters not entirely true in this show though , there 's a couple characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting , but overall the characters stand on their own br br this is definitely for 16 and up there 's nothing here that most kids have n't already heard before though , and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads it 's definitely not as crude and edgy as south park , but does bring some of the same bash everyone feel to it one example is that it makes fun of both dick cheney and barbara streisand at the same time in one episode br br father of the pride and other dreamworks productions like shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of animaniacs , pinky and the brain , and freakazoid it 's the same type of humor grown up it may not be as witty as spielberg 's classic tv series , but it 's still good br br i hope that it finishes this season off well , and is renewed for future seasons otherwise i may never find a reason to watch the big 3 again
