orig sent (1):	i love midnight cowboy and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine what is interesting to me is how when midnight cowboy came out in 1969 , it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated x of course , at that time x meant maturity since i was only two years old at the time of the movie 's release , it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then however , when i try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film , which included prostitution \( the title itself was slang for a male prostitute \) homosexuality loneliness physical \( and to some extent emotional as well \) abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day , i can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release it is worth noting that in the 1970 's , midnight cowboy was downgraded to an r rating and even though it is still rated r , some of the scenes could almost be rated pg 13 by today 's standards br br i want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie jon voight plays a young man named joe buck from texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in new york city escorting rich women he emulates cowboy actors like roy rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women after being rejected by all the women he has come across , he meets a sleazy con man named enrico ratso rizzo who is played by dustin hoffman ratso convinces joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager once again , joe is conned and before long is homeless however , joe comes across ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment without giving away much more of the plot , i want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with joe and ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams i e joe making it as a gigolo and ratso going down to florida where he thinks he can regain his health br br i want to make some comments about the movie itself first of all , the acting is excellent , especially the leads although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end , there are some classic scenes in fact , there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny , i find them amusing for example , there is the classic scene where dustin hoffman and jon voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over dustin hoffman bangs on the cab and says hey , i 'm walkin ' here ! i 'm walkin ' here ! i get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of new york city where so many people are in a hurry another scene that comes to mind is the scene where ratso \( dustin hoffman \) sends joe \( jon voight \) to a guy named o'daniel what is amusing is that at first , we think o'daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that o'daniel is nothing but a religious nut in addition to the two scenes i mentioned , i love the scene where ratso and joe are arguing in their apartment when ratso says to joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and joe says in self defense john wayne ! you gon na tell me he 's a fag ! what i like is the delivery in that scene br br i would say that even though midnight cowboy was set in the late ' 60 's , much of it rings true today that 's because although the area around 42nd street in new york has been cleaned up in the form of disneyfication in the last several years , homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago also , many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the jon voight character one thing that impresses me about jon voight 's character is how he is a survivor and i felt that at the end of the movie , he had matured a great deal and that ratso \( dustin hoffman 's character \) was a good influence on him br br in conclusion , i want to say that i suggest that when watching this movie , one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on for example , there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings also , what i find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with joe buck \( jon voight 's character \) and the people who were in his life in texas even the ending , while i do n't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie , is rather open ended

orig sent (1):	i 'd waited for some years before this movie finally got released in england , but was in many ways very pleased when i finally saw it there are a lot of great things to the film , for a start the acting its not something i have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work this and the constantly gripping and interesting script , with a nice sorta lovecraftian feel to it , give the film a real solid backbone add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner it has my favorite kind of gore too , supernatural and splattery also , the characters of marcus , the angry bodybuilding transsexual and daisy , his mentally retarded lover plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times , and give a far out , anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent freudian overtones this is one of the most impressive recent horror movies , far more shocking or out there than anything hollywood can produce my only gripe was that i wanted the ending to be darker in tone , but it still works , so on the whole i 'd really recommend this to serious horror buffs

orig sent (1):	zero day has a purpose and this is not simply entertainment , it delivers a message about its specialised subject school shootings charting the lives of two friends andre and cal leading up to an attack on their high school br br whilst the movie started in somewhat unassuming fashion , an impromptu announcement of the coming attack in amateurish teenage style followed by some brief encounters with the boys families it is not long before we are down to business with the boys showing us their collection of guns , their fetishistic love of them , their sprawling sporadic narcissistic fantasies and even in a controversial scene how to build pipe bombs br br so what is the movie trying to say \? what is really motivating these soon to be killers it seems hard to really pinpoint they certainly do not come across as cold blooded psychopaths yet they are planning an act of sheer brutality this brings me to what i feel is the genius in part of zero day cal and andre talk constantly about how much they are on a different level , how above the rest of us they are and how they will ' leave us all behind ' like the columbine killers they truly feel superior like nietzsche 's res sentiment cal and andre 's value system seems to have been born out of rejection from their society yet we are given only glimpses of this , an expression of hatred for a popular athlete for example so where is the motivation \?

what is really motivating these soon to be killers it seems hard to really pinpoint they certainly do not come across as cold blooded psychopaths yet they are planning an act of sheer brutality this brings me to what i feel is the genius in part of zero day cal and andre talk constantly about how much they are on a different level , how above the rest of us they are and how they will ' leave us all behind ' like the columbine killers they truly feel superior like nietzsche 's res sentiment cal and andre 's value system seems to have been born out of rejection from their society yet we are given only glimpses of this , an expression of hatred for a popular athlete for example so where is the motivation \?

orig sent (1):	claire denis 's chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film the film presents a very interesting look at the household of a european colonial family living in cameroon , giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction however , the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient for example , a central theme in the story is young france 's inability to form strong relationships with others although this portrayal is executed flawlessly , notably in the way that denis frames the story with scenes from france 's return to her childhood home , the girl 's lack of intimacy with the film 's other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development \( or lack thereof \) as a protagonist the general stagnation of the film 's character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot the film raises a great deal of tension between characters , particularly between aimee and the men in her life , but never fully addresses this social friction , leaving the viewer unsatisfied the final few scenes are powerful but depressing denis 's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint , but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama , chocolat is definitely not the best choice

orig sent (1):	beautifully filmed , well acted , tightly scripted suspense movie had me on the edge of my seat i liked the lead actress very much , and thought the villain was very well done not much to chew on here in the way of a theme , but if you just get in your seat , turn your brain off , watch the fancy camera work , and enjoy the plot , you will have a great time the plot is well worn , and regular movie goers will probably know more or less what to expect by about ten minutes in but that did n't bother me , as i enjoyed watching it unfold in the old days , they might not have focused so tightly on just two characters , and there were some enticing moments when i hoped they were going to let some other people have a few lines but these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused the plot got me by the throat fairly early on , and never let go it 's not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie as i 'm not sure it makes a great deal of sense just sit back and enjoy

orig sent (1):	i have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and i would first like to say that i understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well viewed from an israeli perspective , i can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie what i would like to say is that ' distortion ' was shown at a film festival in geneva in november 2005 \( festival ' cin ma tout cran ' \) where it won the award of the audience \( ' prix du public'in french \) for what affects me , i liked the ' nervous camera ' work of mr bouzaglo , who , in my opinion , portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well , and i think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie this perspective , however , might seem totally ' alien ' to an israeli viewer , but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers , because switzerland is a country which has never been subject to any terrorist attack it therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in geneva judged this film with a much more ' detached ' perspective i would also like to quote what mr bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a geneva newspaper \( i 'm translating from french \) ' ' after 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence , we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal we might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living we are like the characters in my movie , ''on the edge of the edge '' this is the reason why the private detective , who is somehow ' ' voyeur '' is the happiest character in the movie , because he earns a living thanks to the system , he takes advantage of this situation '' this is , in substance , the main thing that i and the swiss public , in my opinion , pointed out in this movie , and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor so , to sum up , different country different perspective , but i think that this is somehow great , because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema , that is to say that it well never be subject to a ' unique ' of ' formatted ' way of thinking

orig sent (1):	the secret of kells is an astonishing first animated feature which will dazzle your eye and move your heart the shortcomings of the film 's limited budget and sometimes limited animation are more than compensated for by the visual poetry of the story of young brendan 's heroic quest to become a master illuminator during the dark ages historically this was in the late 8th century , when the centers of irish learning were over run by the vikings the vikings appear here as brute antagonists , the equivalent on the north seas of the plundering huns and mongols further east the film 's narrative which functions more as a parable centers around the conflict between brendan , who seeks to create beauty in his illuminations during a time of encroaching darkness , and his stern uncle the abbot who seeks to protect the town of kells and his nephew with a looming wall as barrier against the norsemen the abbot disregards the value of brendan 's art in his quest for security this is the movie 's outer conflict brendan 's inner conflict is to find the hidden eye of creative illumination which will allow him to complete the most difficult painting in the book of kells this eye is guarded by a dragon ouroboros , who destroys from within those not suited to this quest as surely as the vikings will kill from without \( that 's as much of the story as i 'll divulge ! \) br br what i really like about this film is its creators ' imaginative understanding of some of the greatest art work to survive in the west from 1200 years ago the characters are stylized in flat abstract shapes defined by line just as in the original book of kells \( particularly noteworthy is monk aidan 's pet cat , defined in few lines , yet purely and even magically metamorphically feline \) the range of emotion which brendan and the other animated characters convey given their economy of abstract design is a tribute to the excellent artistry of the director and his animators the decorative borders on the edge of the picture change to complement the dramatic impact of a given scene , and this characteristic of illuminations from the dark ages is brought to wondrous animated life in the secret of kells of course , historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas endeavor to depict however , by introducing archetypal elements into this story , the writers and director of the secret of kells convey a numinous sense of lived life from that far off time in ireland which feels psychologically true , however much the script might stray from pedantic historical fact \( the united nations ' band of illuminators who appear as a rogues ' club of artists in the secret of kells are n't historically probable , but they 're all well designed , individuated characters who do much to convey the universal appeal of this quintessentially irish story \) animation has always seemed the best vehicle to me to better help us understand the visual art of different times and cultures the magnificent art direction of this movie clearly derives from its historical visual source , but has also been cleverly adapted to the demands of animated storytelling if animation had existed in the dark ages , the secret of kells is what it would look like ! finally , brendan 's hero 's quest in this film is the artist 's perennial quest to convey the spirit of beauty , life and inspiration \( without being preachy or even particularly christian , this movie affirms jesus ' dictum that man does not live by bread alone \) in my estimation the most inspired movie about the creative process of visual artists is andrei tarkovsky 's andrei rublev , a film about the great russian icon painter of the 15th century the secret of kells expresses much the same sense of mystery and exhilaration about the artist 's visual quest and creative process it 's certainly not as profound as andrei rublev , but heck its a cartoon ! \( and one which will appeal to young and old alike \) i think this movie will hold up well to repeated viewing in its own modest life affirming way , this stylized secret of kells is a classic

orig sent (1):	as for many on here i ca n't help but praise the cast and crew who developed talespin and others they made throughout my childhood , i as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters br br to class this work of art as a cartoon could never do talespin justice , in fact it 's an insult to class it as a cartoon , talespin is an animation and nothing less , it is evidently the greatest work of genius to be produced at disney to date , when disney pulled it from the air little did they realise what they did and i 'm sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since br br i 'll take a moment to explain , from the first which is ducktales to the last which i think is darkwing duck , disney has been plagued with failures due to political correctness and have taken a quantum leap backwards since , they prefer quantity over quality now not to mention the room full of monkey 's for the story 's , i could n't have my children watching the mind numbing cartoons they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer simpson some time in the future and 50 of the blame would be on me for permitting them to watch it , i could n't let that happen , which is why i have all of the shows from the late 80 's to the mid 90 's on a harddrive so one day my children could n't be corrupted by the cartoon crap of today and to savour the last piece of childhood i have and to hold on to and i owe that all to talespin br br talespin to me is without a doubt the best animation ever produced in the world on account of it 's depth , charm , wit , compassion , emotion and lack of truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today , do you see any of that content in say ed , edd and eddie or anything else you can think of \? , the rubbish produced today can be likened to some 3 year old 's undecipherable hyroglyph depicting a picasso br br the next time you watch an episode of talespin take a look at the woodgrain on any wooden object or building such as higher for hire and salivate over the quality of workmanship and effort put into this animation , even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again , the buildings look true to the art deco movement which was popular in the time period depicted , even the vehicles are true to life , ok not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it evened it all out by the end of the episode and you 'd probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detail br br the one thing i love about this is what i like to call the deliberate mistakes or intended mistakes in each episode and some have two , for example in sheepskin deep where rebecca say 's you 're up to something baloo and baloo replies who , me ! , i 'm as innocent as a schoolboy take a look into rebecca 's eyes , i wo n't spoil the rest of the baloopers but just keep an eye out next time br br everyone elses comment 's are bang on and 100 correct , i have nothing else to add that others have n't said already on here , disney , wake up and smell the coffee , you have been asleep for over a decade , stop producing rubbish and bring back quality into animations and stop producing cartoons , we have seen the proof of what you can do and we want it back as rapidly as possible

orig sent (1):	i was going to give it an 8 , but since you people made 6 5 out of a lot better votes , i had to up my contribution the river styx was pure genius sure , woody was his perennial stuff , but at least his role was appropriate the first half hour was really hilarious , and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch the dialog was clever enough , and woody 's card tricks at the parties , along with the reaction from the upper crust , were fun to watch this was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be and a plus , a little sorcerer 's apprentice to go along with it and of course , did you notice that johansen is getting a bit frumpy \? charles dance is always entertaining , as was hugh jackman
