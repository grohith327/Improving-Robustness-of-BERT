orig sent (1):	this movie is a journey through the mind of a screenwriter caught in his own paradoxical philosophy he examines the ever illusive question of ' who am i ' and ' what is i \?

orig sent (1):	just got through watching this version of samhain , and even though i still like it , it 's nothing like the rough cut version i have if you check the message board , you 'll see an apology from the director for this cut down version , 79 minutes , and he says he had nothing to do with this r rated trimmed down edit with a completely new screwed up ending christian really does n't need to distant himself that much , because the basic gore elements still stand up , even though highly trimmed down this is a damn shame , because this had the potential of being one of the goriest and best gore films in years it still has the porn stars , and the inbreds , and some of the extreme gore can at least be partially seen i 'm just glad i have that rough cut , because to me , it 's a jewel for any gorehounds library christian viel definitely has the skill and vision to deliver the goods , and hopefully his next project will be better produced the idiots had a near classic in their hands , and screwed it up for everybody samhain may be one of the most controversial and mishandled horror movies ever , and too bad gorehounds did n't get to see what the director intended br br just so you know what you missed , this is my review based upon the work print of samhain br br the movie runs a little over 90 minutes and has no chapter stops there is absolutely no music soundtrack , and some of the scenes have no audio on the dialog , because i think they are meant to be looped in later however , most of the movie does have audio with sound affects , and when an effect or scene is missing , a message appears as a cue for insertion when the movie is completed it 's exactly as it says , a rough cut , but the only uncut version of samhain you are ever likely to see reason , because the gore is extremely graphic , much more than even an nc 17 would allow yes there are a few porn stars , but they are just there for the killing , and to add a little sugar and spice the story is pretty standard , american tourists on a vacation in ireland and end up staying in a home in the middle of the woods an area that is heavy on folklore , involving the ancient druids and the celebration of samhain , or as we call it halloween \( spooky \) br br the movie starts off with a huge dose of gore , as a camping couple is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants this is a great gore scene , as the guy find his girl hanging from a cliff , with her crying for help all he sees is her head , arms , and shoulders hanging in front of him and when he pulls her up , she has been completely sliced in two this is what i would call extreme gore , with entrails , blood , and severed limbs all over the place we are in herschell gordon lewis territory here folks , except the effects look much more realistic i 'm going to just skip the story , because it 's your standard stalk and kill plot br br the next gore scene is something to behold , as the boyfriend from the first killing is taken to a cave like location \( tcm 2 stuff \) , and bound to a table this geek then cuts all of his limbs off \( off camera , with a cue to insert a scene \) , and then we see his torso on a barbecue pit , turning slowly over a fire , and the torso has a hard on \( if you can believe that \) yes , very bad taste , gross , gruesome , you find the right word , and it will probably fit too br br then later jenna jameson , her beautiful body and all , is cut from neck to crotch , and all her entrails are pulled out in graphic glee , and her blood drains into a pot yummy , a real turn on huh \? br br but the best gore scene happens inside the house , and i have to admit , this is one of the best gore scenes i have seen this guy \( does n't matter who \) is caught from behind from a geek , and cut open at the ass hole the geek then puts his hands in and rips out all the guys entrails , intestines , and what the hell ever else there is , right from his asshole this goes on forever , as the guy is screaming and more and more innards are pulled out laying all over the bathroom floor this is so extreme , so over the top , that i found myself laughing all to hell obviously , you will never ever see this scene on a proper dvd , imo , along with most of the other really extreme gore scenes br br so , what to think of all of this well , first of all , even though i doubt this movie would ever be released in this totally uncut presentation , it makes this rough cut a rare jewel for gorehounds yes , it 's a little difficult at first , with no soundtrack , a few scenes to still be inserted , and credits that have missing names all over the place but that 's what makes this so unique , and i would n't trade it for anything right now extreme gore , yes yes , extreme extreme gore this makes haute tension look like a disney movie

orig sent (1):	out of the first five episodes of hammer 's short running hammer house of horror series , this fifth episode with the wonderful title the house that bled to death is arguably the creepiest one as a great fan of the hammer studios ' gothic horror films for many years , i wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently so far , i 've only seen the first five episodes , and i have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come , but even if the series stays as entertaining as the first five episodes are , i will be satisfied whereas the second and third episodes were great to watch for their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor , this fifth entry is definitely the one out of the first five that delivers the most genuine horror the episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivations years later , william \( nicholas ball \) and emma peters \( rachel davies \) move in the house with their little daughter sophie \( emma ridley \) soon after moving in , however , the family have to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house , which is seemingly haunted the second episode directed by francis megahy is a lot better than his mediocre previous entry , growing pains \( episode 4 \) , and the fairly unknown actors deliver good performances the film is also well made in terms of effects , cinematography and score the house that bled to death is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow hammer fans should like to see in a short horror tale the film delivers a creepy atmosphere , genuine scare moments and intelligent twists , and is suspenseful and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end overall , this is highly recommendable to hammer fans

orig sent (1):	a kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia extremely well done and polanski performs well as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing personally i could have done without the cross dressing element but i accept the nod to psycho and the fact that it had some logic , bearing in mind the storyline nevertheless it could have worked without and would have removed the slightly theatrical element , but then maybe that was intended because the courtyard certainly seems to take on the look of a theatre at the end i ca n't help feel that there are more than a few of the director 's own feelings of not being a ' real ' frenchman and jewish to boot still , there is plenty to enjoy here including a fine performance from a gorgeous looking isabelle adjani and good old shelly winters is as reliable as ever

orig sent (1):	i can not comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally as a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a cinema i first encountered movies at the end of wwii through roger manvilles splendid penguin book film , which brought me so much pleasure as my health began to improve that i wish i could buy another copy to re read today my introduction to many classics films such as the battleship potemkin , drifters \( grierson 's magnificent documentary \) , metropolis , the cabinet of dr caligari , and ecstasy came first through this book and later at my university art house cinema ecstasy had incurred the wrath of the vatican , for condoning eva 's desertion of emil , her subsequent divorce , and the brief swim she took in the buff , but roger manville ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a triumphant , outstandingly beautiful , visual paean to love a view echoed by many imdb users a very lonely young man , when i saw it , i willingly concurred no further opportunity to see ecstasy arose until the introduction of home videos by then it had become a treasured memory not to be disturbed quite recently i finally added ecstasy to my home video collection and found this assessment very superficial ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence , against which individual lives are insignificant perhaps a tribute to what bernard shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term ' the lifeforce ' br br ecstasy portrays a young bride marrying a middle aged man whose sex urge is no longer strong disappointed , she returns home and divorces him soon after she experiences a strong mutual attraction to a young virile man she meets whilst out horse riding she makes love for the first time and it is an overwhelming experience her former husband can not face rejection and gives the young man a lift in his car intending that a passing train will kill them both on a level crossing but the train stops in time and the apparently ill driver is taken to recuperate at a nearby hotel where he later commits suicide by shooting himself after these exciting climacteric sequences , a bland , predictable and almost inevitable ending emphasises that whilst individual human lives exhibit both joy and tragedy , collectively life continues to carry us all forward in its stream and only through contributing to this stream can we be truly happy this story is trite , the acting is no more than adequate and normally such a film would have disappeared into the garbage , as did most of its contemporaries , long ago what has given ecstasy its classic status is exceptional cinematography , a continuous lyrical score and very careful loving direction , coupled with something fortuitous but in cinematographic terms very important it appeared just after the introduction of sound and was probably planned as a silent film it is sub titled and its director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some sub titles , and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forward this makes it not only almost unique but extremely rewarding to watch the parable in the tale is stressed continuously but so subtly that only when reflecting after viewing does one become fully aware of it for example , the names eva and adam the obsessive behavior of emil on his wedding night which shows that triviata have become the most important thing in his life and predicate his eventual suicide since he has no adequate purpose to sustain him the ongoing series of beautiful sequences showing erotic imagery \( a bee pollinating a flower , a key entering a lock , a breaking necklace during eva 's virginal lovemaking sequence with adam , etc \)

adv sent (0):	i can not comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally as a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a cinema i first encountered movies at the end of wwii through roger manvilles splendid penguin book film , which brought me so much experiencing as my health began to improve that i wish i could buy another copy to re read today my introduction to many classics films such as the battleship potemkin , drifters \( grierson 's magnificent documentary \) , metropolis , the cabinet of dr caligari , and heroin came first through this book and later at my university art house cinema ecstasy had expense the wrath of the vatican , for condoning eva 's desertion of emil , her subsequent divorce , and the brief swim she took in the buff , but roger manville ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a triumphant , outstandingly beautiful , visual paean to love a view echoed by many imdb users a very lonely young man , when i saw it , i willingly concurred no further opportunity to see ecstasy arose until the introduction of home videos by then it had become a treasured memory not to be disturbed quite recently i finally added ecstasy to my home video collection and found this assessment very superficial ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence , against which individual lives are insignificant perhaps a tribute to what bernard shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term ' the lifeforce ' br br ecstasy portrays a young bride marrying a middle aged man whose sex urge is no longer strong disappointed , she returns home and divorces him soon after she experiences a strong mutual attraction to a young virile man she meets whilst out horse riding she makes love for the first time and it is an overwhelming experience her former husband can not face rejection and gives the young man a lift in his car intending that a passing train will kill them both on a level crossing but the train stops in time and the apparently ill driver is taken to recuperate at a nearby hotel where he later commits suicide by shooting himself after these exciting climacteric sequences , a bland , predictable and almost inevitable ending emphasises that whilst individual human lives exhibit both joy and tragedy , collectively life continues to carry us all forward in its stream and only through contributing to this stream can we be truly happy this story is trite , the acting is no more than adequate and normally such a film would have disappeared into the garbage , as did most of its contemporaries , long ago what has given ecstasy its classic status is exceptional cinematography , a continuous lyrical score and very careful loving direction , coupled with something fortuitous but in cinematographic terms very important it appeared just after the introduction of sound and was probably planned as a silent film it is sub titled and its director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some sub titles , and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forward this makes it not only almost unique but extremely rewarding to watch the parable in the tale is stressed continuously but so subtly that only when reflecting after viewing does one become fully aware of it for example , the names eva and adam the obsessive behavior of emil on his wedding night which shows that triviata have become the most important thing in his life and predicate his eventual suicide since he has no adequate purpose to sustain him the ongoing series of beautiful sequences showing erotic imagery \( a bee pollinating a flower , a key entering a lock , a breaking necklace during eva 's virginal lovemaking sequence with adam , etc \) and the final post suicide sequences which could have been filmed in many different ways but serve to extol the importance to individuals of performing some type of work that contributes positively to society , as well as of creating new life to sustain this society after we ourselves pass on br br as a 1933 film i would rate this at 9 even comparing it with

orig sent (1):	i came to watch guerrilla , part two of steven soderbergh 's biopic of che guevara , without having seen the preceding film and without more than a cursory knowledge of che 's life at the same time i was rather apprehensive that this would be both a heavy going history lesson and an unrepentant love letter to the iconic revolutionary as it turns out , this film far exceeded my expectations br br guerrilla works remarkably well as a standalone film the story of che 's failed attempt to lead a revolution in bolivia , then under military rule , is a compelling tragedy the initial impetus brought by che 's arrival incognito to lead the guerrilla war is lost as misfortune follows misfortune the odds stack up against the revolutionaries us backing for the bolivian army , hostile conditions in the rainforest , suspicious locals and che 's failing health are just some of the difficulties which beset the nascent rebellion br br soderbergh 's portrayal of che is largely uncritical , but this film is no hagiography the style is refreshingly undramatic , with a subtle and effective soundtrack by alberto iglesias adding quiet drama to many scenes che is undoubtedly the centre of the film but there are very few close ups of his face and we are encouraged to see the people fighting alongside him and sometimes against him too where soderbergh wishes to demonstrate che 's virtues we see it in small episodes such as the loyal acolyte who upbraids two fellow guerrillas when they question che 's leadership , and emphasises the sacrifice that he has made in leaving behind cuba to fight again for revolution br br the direction throughout is superb part two feels tightly edited despite its narrow focus and is able to communicate a great deal through images without the need for a narrator to spell things out for the audience at the start of the film we see a few short clips of lavish parties in post revolutionary cuba , immediately furnishing us with ideas as to why che would sacrifice his old life to fight again in another country later on , the portrayal of guerrillas marching through the unending rainforests stands out as a strikingly beautiful scene and helps to create a feeling of the enormity of the task before this tiny band of revolutionaries br br if there is a problem with the film it is the distance between the viewer and che , which , though it does allow us to appreciate the context of the insurgency and the people around him , makes it hard for us to understand him better as a person true , benicio del toro is utterly convincing in the lead role so much so that it is difficult to remember that you are watching an actor and not the man himself however , watching guerrilla as a standalone film means that we are given precious little insight into what is shaping che 's thoughts , words and actions it is to be hoped that this is more to the fore in the first part of soderbergh 's biopic \( i can not comment on that yet \) , and certainly the strength of part two is making me look forward eagerly to seeing the prequel

orig sent (1):	the grudge is a remake of shimizu 's own series of popular japanese horror films shimizu knows he is not dealing with anything new , so he does what any intelligent person would have done in his place he forgets logic and concentrates in giving viewers a fun ride he uses commonly known clich s associated with ghost stories but shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative manner the nonlinear narrative is not a mere gimmick but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives at the end , all i can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience \( the same way a comedy is to make people laugh \) , this movie succeeded with flying colors i watched it in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see viewers go wild over this one it probably does n't play as well in your living room

orig sent (1):	on the contrary to the person listed above me i felt that this movie was really funny particularly in the scenes were there is a lot of mix up i do n't want to give the plot and the storyline away to the people that have n't watched it yet but i will say that paresh rawal does not have an extensive role such as past priyadarshan movies , for example , hera pheri and hungama paresh rawal does an amazing part in the little role given to him , john abraham does equally well , akshay kumar has proved that he is no less in this movie like he had from waqt and almost all his movies after andaaz even though all three heroins in this movie were at a debut they did a pretty good job of acting particularly nargis who is very good looking and hot i would say that if you liked hungama or hera pheri this movie is a must watch

orig sent (1):	this is one of my two or three favorite stooges shorts , and undoubtedly christine mcintyre 's best performance with the trio she is good in a number of other shorts , but here she is absolutely brilliant her singing is not funny at all , in fact it is downright beautiful , but the plot is constructed in such a way that the singing enhances the humor rather than detracting from it we listen to mcintyre sing the entirety of voice of spring no less than three times , but it never gets old , partly because we do n't tire of her voice , and partly because it blends so well with the stooges ' antics the use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of kitty carlisle 's role in the marx brothers ' a night at the opera , but the singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in opera , and mcintyre \( perhaps more in other performances than here \) exhibited a comedic talent of her own that carlisle never did the stooges ' buffoonery , mcintyre 's singing , and a well constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars

orig sent (1):	this is one of my favorites along with the mariette hartley and robert lansing sandy and the agnes moorhead and the tiny spacemen episodes br br it is an important take , from mid 1961 , on the long cold war that the u s was then embroiled in the beaten down city scene , the near starving characters ' sparse dialog , their threadbare uniforms , and the minimal action says it all the absurdity of an on going conflict that threatens to destroy human life , modern civilization , and all that is sweet and redeeming about it br br it is a fable because it was made in a time in which , had events turned out differently , such as the second berlin crisis \( spring 1961 \) and the subsequent cuban missile crisis \( oct 1962 \) , it would have actually been a reasonable representation of one of the u s 's major cities , ruined and replete with a few miserable survivors i also see it as a fable because it is not only a cautionary tale , but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths it is a love story , set in an impossible situation , and involving two highly mismatched lovers

orig sent (1):	just got my copy of this dvd two disc set and while not perfect , i found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time i have to say right up front that i am a huge fan of zombie movies , and i truly think that the fine people who made these films must be too i also have a soft spot for people who are trying , sometimes against all odds , to live a dream and again , these people are doing it is this some award winning collection of amazing film \? no not even close but for what they do on their meager budgets , these films should be recommended for me , the bottom line is always , was i entertained \? did i have a good time with this movie \? and here the answer to both was yes the first in the series is also the most raw it opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something cut to some years later and a new housing community is built over the old reactor site some kids making a video fall into a hole and find themselves trapped in the bottom levels of the facility they get rescued , but the hole is not sealed and the people from the opening start lumbering out of the hole soon , the whole town is overtaken by the undead and these zombies are fun they go from cool rot makeup to the cheapest slap on white face ever , but they are fun the whole movie culminates in a showdown between the final survivors of the area and the undead , with our heroes going into the reactor 's lower levels to take out the flesh eating zombies and seal the hole forever ! pretty cheesy , but i think it was meant to be still , it moves very fast , has buckets of gruesome effects and really tries to have some style the acting is uneven , but a few good performances shine through and one really should listen to the commentary track i went back and watched it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trials and fun that the crew and cast experienced on the movie director todd sheets seems pretty proud of this , his first film , but also has no delusions he knows it 's a trashy zombie movie , but he does show respect to people involved also , sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field the behind the scenes of zombie bloodbath is pretty fun as well i felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for there are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage , mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like cnn , fox and mtv over all , a fun little film that is very rough around the edges , but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride ! i have seen many dv films , and some shot of video films , and many are quite dull , but this one really was n't while newer dv films are technically superior , they just are n't fun ! overall , this is a solid , if a bit flawed , release with plenty of extras and tons of gore and splatter while not breaking any grand rules of move making , i found the series to be fun and always a laugh , so i give this set a solid recommendation todd sheets was not trying to make award winning art here folks , he was trying , sometimes against all odds it seems , to make fun zero budget , splattery horror and to that end , he has succeeded in spades
