\) in the plane , he checks up a girl \( daria \) , who is driving in her car to a conference \( about giving typical suburban families the opportunity to live in a super relaxing place in the desert , where everything is so simple and nice for the whole family ! \) , by diving down , almost hitting the car he lands the plane , and joins the girl on her way to detroit they stop at zabriskie point , where they enjoy each other as living creatures and the nature later a family with a big car \( of the type which you sleep in \) and a speed boat is showed visiting zabriskie point , the father saying something like what a waste driving all the way up here , and the kid sitting inside the car , grinning i sensed a this was n't much better than on the telly attitude daria takes mark back to the plane which now is painted in a psychedelic style , with the identity number changed to no war on one side and no words on the other bucks sucks is also written on the plane mark takes the plane back to where he stole it from , saying to daria before he leaves i do n't risk anything or something , one of several hints about he not caring too much about his destiny \( this because he has the feeling that the environment that surrounds do n't give him anything i wonder what happens in the real world \) on the airport he is met by police officers who shoots him even though he just has returned the plane daria hears this on the radio , but decides to go to the conference in the fancy mansion here she feels alien after the adventures with her just killed friend she enjoys fresh water running down a rock , more than the swimming pool inside the house the viewer is once again given a hint about anti materialism she looks out through a glass wall , holding her hands on the glass like she was trapped the business men is seen arguing , the one side eager to make a big deal , the other afraid of losing money daria leaves the house and looks back at it , visualizing it blowing up after the house , several other things blow up , for example a television she smiles , happy she has inside herself destroyed what she after the meeting with mark look upon as something negative br br to summarize mark obviously experience the reality group as not very useful as they just sit and talk , taking no action he clearly has bad feelings about things being as they are , and it seems like he feels that it 's no use fighting against it he wants to leave he helps daria , who is in mind but not in action seeing his point of view where his feeling of being misfitted turns out leading to his death , one can hope daria uses the ideas in a way that will turn out more constructive in the film you see how a town \( la \) is being polluted by commercial \( too bad you have to show the commercial to make the point \) , you see business men deciding what is the future , et cetera , and you see people being unhappy with these and other situations which is parts of the modern world br br i have only seen the film once , so i have not caught all points , but i certainly got a feeling of what this film has to say , and i find it strange that this film can be called meaningless if you say the points are being too obvious , i can see why , this film probably intended to appeal to the post hippie radicals digging the thoughts of anti establishment even though , it has a lot to say , and its message is still needed today , things pretty much evolving in the same direction as it did before the sixties zabriskie point is a really great film , telling a story about quite normal young people \( not far out hippies tripping around tip toe on acid , digging everything \) seeking what they percept as real , dissatisfied with the conventional and it is done in a truly beautiful way

orig sent (1):	spoilers i loved the later episodes from college and on , but i wish i could get the last season on dvd unfortunately , the latest i could get is the first college season still the teenage years were sweet although they focused a lot on magic , they also made her into a character that teens could relate to , deeling with the stuggles of teens , and children in divorced families this show was very innocent they did not get into the morbid teenage problems such as sex and drugs , but they did deel with pressure to fit in i loved watching her grow up and cope with her magic on her own and trying to convince her aunts to let go as she left the nest the older episodes were cute , but it was just so much better to see her as \( well not really a teenage witch anymore \) but an adult witch i loved roxy and mortgan they were so talented ! in the earlier episodes the aunts were great actresses , but they were so strict , kind and loving , but they treated her like a young child in some ways , but not in every way i mean they grounded her for every little mistake she made with her magic , i mean let her learn from her own mistakes for once ! that was what i liked about the college episodes she was able to learn from her own mistakes without be grounded over everything that was annoying not to put down hilda and zelda melissa joan hard is beautiful and was perfect for the sabrina with her perky personality i liked the last episode where she ran off the marry harvey , but as somebody else said , it would have been nice to see what happened after i mean i believe it was obvious they were getting married where else would they be running off to in her wedding dress \? but i would have liked to have seen it i supposed they wanted to leave it up to the viewer to choose the ending though rather than spoon feeding it to us as most comedies do somebody said they could have shown them marry and go to school in the house , but they already graduated college sabrina had great job for a magazine and i think harvey had a good job , because he lived in a nice apartment that we only see at the end , but they never say what he does as a child they always talk about how he does not want to be an exterminator like his dad when sabrian moved into the house that season , they never really explain how it happened actually , there is a lot the show does not explain , but i supposed it is supposed to be to leave it up to us and give it some mystery prior to sabrina and her friends moving into the house , they show hilda getting married and this whole spell that ends up with zelda turning into a child hilda comes back in the last episode \( and zelda is there in some other form , but beth is not on the episode \) but they do not show zelda 's husband or what happened , like did they have children \? maybe they did n't want too much going on in one episode i also liked hart 's sister who played her spoiled cousin ! she was pretty and a great actress and it was interesting to see her grown up ! i cannon believe it has been six years since the show went off the air ! i still love the reruns ! also , i do n't know if anybody noticed this , but in the earlier episodes , the town was called westbridbe \( a made up town i believe , which was supposed to be close to salem \) but in the later episodes , they do n't mention the name of the town being caled westbridge and i think they call it boston , unless that is just where she worked also , i wanted to add , i found the episode , wild wild sabrina where she is taught about the importance of rules , to be insulting she was 18 and too old to be grounded i would have been insulted if my parents grounded me at 18 and i think while an 18 year old might mess up how she did , they need to learn the consequences on their own i think at 18 they know rules are important

orig sent (1):	it all starts with a suicide or is it a car crash \? i guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end director gabriele muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film seven pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning , showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call this is one powerful movie maybe that is because i 'm a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk , dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances , but either way , a film works best when it truly touches me , when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre and this is from the team that brought us the overrated , sappy , and not all that redeeming pursuit of happiness , so i 'll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown with all that , though , i was with seven pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled even though you figure out what will smith 's character is doing , that secret mission he is trying to complete , it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear filled smile at the end br br our entry point is a bit jarring , leaving us off kilter trying to comprehend what is going on smith 's thomas has lists of names , one of people we do n't know and one of people it appears he is attempting to follow and audit working with the irs allows him access to these strangers for a glimpse into their lives in order to see whether they are worthy of a gift he has the power to give them a gift that could completely alter their circumstances he calls an old childhood friend \( barry pepper \) and reminds him to do what it is he promised , to not second guess his decision because there is no changing his mind even in a role as small as pepper 's , you ca n't help but feel the utter grief held aloft in the background , hanging above everyone 's head it is his character , seen maybe three times , that really encompasses the primal level of emotion being dealt with his breakdowns , whether tear streaked and composed or head in hands convulsions , show the bond these two men have is one that stands the test of time and any circumstance to come its way br br after that phone call , begins the journey to meet new people thomas is on some sort of mission to help alleviate the monetary troubles of mortally ill folk , trying to stay afloat despite the heavy burden of medical bills and survival this progression takes many turns , from a blind , vegan , meat salesman that he berates to see whether he can get him to explode to a phase two donor necessity heart patient , unable to print her line of stationary , or even run with her great dane duke to an abused and scared latino mother of two , too afraid to leave her boyfriend to a dying hockey coach that instills faith in a downtrodden youth community to a little boy in need of a bone marrow transplant there are people who live with the pain and inevitable future with a disposition of hope and wanting to cherish each day , and there are those attempting to beat it by cutting corners and spending all their money at the expense of those who need it to go out in style why it is up to thomas to weed through the mix and find those that deserve his gift is unknown at first , as is why this man , seen in flashbacks as an aeronautical engineer with a beautiful wife and huge beachfront home , is now living in a motel , driving a beat up car , going door to door in order to audit for the irs as he says , though , he kind of stumbled into the job br br smith 's quest as thomas is a long and painful one , tempered with moments of clarity and honest compassion as a man with the means to help , he takes his job seriously , crossing off people undeserving and testing those he believes are worthy to the nth degree if that means he must yell and make fun of them , he must do it at every step , though , you see the suffering in his eyes , the pain eating away at his soul , taking each step towards his fate , one as a saint of redemption , not only for those he wants to help , but for himself as well it is an award worthy performance and i only wish smith would do more dramas like this instead of his blockbuster action summer tentpoles , because , while they are fun , this guy is too good for them the man better win an oscar before he is done or it will be a travesty at least in my mind br br the rest of the cast is stellar across the board woody harrelson as the blind salesman is pitch perfect handicap with a joy of life his shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout , whether on the phone being yelled at , sitting in a diner eating his pie , or at the piano in the park , playing for all who will listen elpidia carrillo , as the abused mother , is fantastic , showing the hard evolution from prideful to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger , allowing her family to finally be safe and rosario dawson shines as the once hot young woman , beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays , all but given up on living life to find love and happiness it is the introduction of smith 's thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman , a free spirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last

enter his new film seven pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning , showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call this is one exemplary movie maybe that is because i 'm a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk , dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances , but either way , a film works best when it truly touches me , when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre and this is from the team that brought us the overrated , sappy , and not all that redeeming pursuit of happiness , so i 'll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown with all that , though , i was with seven pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled even though you figure out what will smith 's character is doing , that secret mission he is trying to complete , it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear filled smile at the end br br our entry point is a bit jarring , leaving us off kilter trying to comprehend what is going on smith 's thomas has lists of names , one of people we do n't know and one of people it appears he is attempting to follow and audit working with the irs allows him access to these strangers for a glimpse into their lives in order to see whether they are worthy of a gift he has the power to give them a gift that could completely alter their circumstances he calls an old childhood friend \( barry pepper \) and reminds him to do what it is he promised , to not second guess his decision because there is no changing his mind even in a role as small as pepper 's , you ca n't help but feel the utter grief held aloft in the background , hanging above everyone 's head it is his character , seen maybe three times , that really encompasses the primal level of emotion being dealt with his breakdowns , whether tear streaked and composed or head in hands convulsions , show the bond these two men have is one that stands the test of time and any circumstance to come its way br br after that phone call , begins the journey to meet new people thomas is on some sort of mission to help alleviate the monetary troubles of mortally ill folk , trying to stay afloat despite the heavy burden of medical bills and survival this progression takes many turns , from a blind , vegan , meat salesman that he berates to see whether he can get him to explode to a phase two donor necessity heart patient , unable to print her line of stationary , or even run with her great dane duke to an abused and scared latino mother of two , too afraid to leave her boyfriend to a dying hockey coach that instills faith in a downtrodden youth community to a little boy in need of a bone marrow transplant there are people who live with the pain and inevitable future with a disposition of hope and wanting to cherish each day , and there are those attempting to beat it by cutting corners and spending all their money at the expense of those who need it to go out in style why it is up to thomas to weed through the mix and find those that deserve his gift is unknown at first , as is why this man , seen in flashbacks as an aeronautical engineer with a beautiful wife and huge beachfront home , is now living in a motel , driving a beat up car , going door to door in order to audit for the irs as he says , though , he kind of stumbled into the job br br smith 's quest as thomas is a long and painful one , tempered with moments of clarity and honest compassion as a man with the means to help , he takes his job seriously , crossing off people undeserving and testing those he believes are worthy to the nth degree if that means he must yell and make fun of them , he must do it at every step , though , you see the suffering in his eyes , the pain eating away at his soul , taking each step towards his fate , one as a saint of redemption , not only for those he wants to help , but for himself as well it is an award worthy performance and i only wish smith would do more dramas like this instead of his blockbuster action summer tentpoles , because , while they are fun , this guy is too good for them the man better win an oscar before he is done or it will be a travesty at least in my mind br br the rest of the cast is stellar across the board woody harrelson as the blind salesman is pitch perfect handicap with a joy of life his shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout , whether on the phone being yelled at , sitting in a diner eating his pie , or at the piano in the park , playing for all who will listen elpidia carrillo , as the abused mother , is fantastic , showing the hard evolution from prideful to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger , allowing her family to finally be safe and rosario dawson shines as the once hot young woman , beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays , all but given up on living life to find love and happiness it is the introduction of smith 's thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman , a free spirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last

orig sent (1):	i got to say that uma thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute it had all the sex content that most ivan reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra , chemistry uma and luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene both seem to create this odd , twisted and interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension that you laugh until you ca n't feel your face anymore anna farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each other 's roles perfectly and even wanda sykes ' rather small role will keep you laughing though these kind of comedies are n't for everybody , but i have to say i went with a person that does n't usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy this movie is certainly not for everyone especially younger children since some moments are little too well lets say adult for younger viewers all in all i was pleasantly surprised by this movie , tough the ending i found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film \( 3 1 2 out of 5 \)
