orig sent (1):	the whole point of making this film , one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera , was to make it more accessible to the masses and it succeeded admirably in doing so the general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals \( a young loren , handsome della marra , and a slinky ms maxwell \) who make the story much more believable , giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be altogether , an enchanting introduction to one of verdi 's great works i remember seeing this when i was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera , a form with which i was then not well acquainted i still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals luciano della marra was a standout as radames , and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films

now , it is the only show premiering post 1990 that i watch regularly br br although that 70s show mimics some of the styles , attitudes , music , and tastes of the 70s , it does not mire itself in that decade by going overboard with the references and look of the 70s it contains so much funny , witty , biting dialogue that is delivered with confidence and certainty by its main cast that it overcomes any 70s clich s by just being humorous the humor is what keeps the show eternally watchable br br although a hilarious sitcom , no matter what time period , the uniqueness of mocking the 70s does work in its favor as it gives the show a signature identity but its the focus on universal issues \( family problems , teen angst , marital issues , peer pressure \) , dealing with all of them with comic aplomb , that gives the show a mass appeal br br the show 's center is one eric forman \( played to absolute comic perfection by future superstar topher grace \) eric is a super skinny , geeky looking , non athletic teen and still comes off as super cool due to grace 's brilliant self deprecation of the character eric has 5 friends donna , hyde , kelso , jackie , and fez \( played respectively in hilarious fashion by laura prepon , danny masterson , ashton kutcher , mila kunis , and wilmer valderama \) we get to see life in point place , wisconsin through the eyes of these 6 teens and boy do we get a lot to see ! donna , a forward thinking feminist , is the object of eric 's affection and these 2 have the core relationship of the show they become a couple pretty soon after the show starts and they are never a boring couple most of the shows eps end with them having a meaningful conversation about them and their future and it works as a great insightful bookend , which works as a perfect counter to the prior hilarity hyde is eric 's best friend and soon moves in with the formans when his mother abandons him hyde is the mellow , zen , cool one of the group and just sits back , observes , and makes fun of his fellow friends with easygoing aplomb kelso is the dumb one of the group and kutcher plays it the absolute hilt , displaying amazing physical comedy as well as telling some of the most absurdly hilarious ideas and stories ever ! jackie , who starts out as kelso 's girlfriend , is a verbose , self absorbed debutante cheerleader and is at first only accepted as part of the group b c of kelso , but she manages to ingratiate herself to the point where they all have to accept her ! and finally , fez ! fez is the foreign exchange student from some unknown country \( we never know exactly where \) and he is a scene stealer ! i said good day ! you son of a b tch ! valderama is only sporting a foreign accent here as he has n't one in reality and he is always in character and creates one of the most unique characters i have ever seen his scene stealing moments often help make the show for me br br the show constantly takes us into the minds and thoughts of these characters through engaging fantasy scenes of how they would like or imagine things to be the gang repeatedly gets into trouble \( most of it on purpose \) they constantly play gags on the point place residents as well as each other they hang out most of the time in eric 's basement plotting , pontificating , or just plain playing around br br also figuring prominently in the show are eric 's parents , the menacing , commie hating red and the lovable , happy go lucky kitty \( played memorably by kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp \) these 2 adults give the show a much needed mature point of view and constantly berate and advise the 6 ne'er do wells red and kitty are ably supported by donna 's parents , the buffoonish bob \( played wonderfully for the full run by don stark \) and blonde bimbo daft midge \( the super sexy tanya roberts , who was on the show for about half it 's run \) additionally , for 3 full seasons , eric 's sister from hell laurie \( played brilliantly by the wickedly sexy farrah fawcett lookalike lisa robin kelly \) was a major refreshing relief to counter the shenanigans of the main 6 and to be the thorn in eric and her parents ' sides ! kelly came back as a guest character for a few season 5 eps but , unfortunately , kelly 's personal problems led to her being replaced by a terrible new actress in season 6 the newbie did n't last , thankfully , and was gone after a few season 6 eps !

now , it is the only show premiering post 1990 that i watch regularly br br although that 70s show mimics some of the styles , attitudes , music , and tastes of the 70s , it does not mire itself in that decade by going overboard with the references and look of the 70s it contains so better witless , witty , biting dialogue that is delivered with confidence and certainty by its main cast that it overcomes any 70s clich s by just being humorous the humor is what keeps the show eternally watchable br br although a hilarious sitcom , no matter what time period , the uniqueness of mocking the 70s does work in its favor as it gives the show a signature identity but its the focus on universal issues \( family problems , teen angst , marital issues , peer pressure \) , dealing with all of them with comic aplomb , that gives the show a mass appeal br br the show 's center is one eric forman \( played to absolute comic perfection by future superstar topher grace \) eric is a super skinny , geeky looking , non athletic teen and still comes off as super cool due to grace 's brilliant self deprecation of the character eric has 5 friends donna , hyde , kelso , jackie , and fez \( played respectively in hilarious fashion by laura prepon , danny masterson , ashton kutcher , mila kunis , and wilmer valderama \) we get to see life in point place , wisconsin through the eyes of these 6 teens and boy do we get a lot to see ! donna , a forward thinking feminist , is the object of eric 's affection and these 2 have the core relationship of the show they become a couple pretty soon after the show starts and they are never a boring couple most of the shows eps end with them having a meaningful conversation about them and their future and it works as a great insightful bookend , which works as a perfect counter to the prior hilarity hyde is eric 's best friend and soon moves in with the formans when his mother abandons him hyde is the mellow , zen , cool one of the group and just sits back , observes , and makes fun of his fellow friends with easygoing aplomb kelso is the dumb one of the group and kutcher plays it the absolute hilt , displaying amazing physical comedy as well as telling some of the most absurdly hilarious ideas and stories ever ! jackie , who starts out as kelso 's girlfriend , is a verbose , self absorbed debutante cheerleader and is at first only accepted as part of the group b c of kelso , but she manages to ingratiate herself to the point where they all have to accept her ! and finally , fez ! fez is the foreign exchange student from some unknown country \( we never know exactly where \) and he is a scene stealer ! i said good day ! you son of a b tch ! valderama is only sporting a foreign accent here as he has n't one in reality and he is always in character and creates one of the most unique characters i have ever seen his scene stealing moments often help make the show for me br br the show constantly takes us into the minds and thoughts of these characters through engaging fantasy scenes of how they would like or imagine things to be the gang repeatedly gets into trouble \( most of it on purpose \) they constantly play gags on the point place residents as well as each other they hang out most of the time in eric 's basement plotting , pontificating , or just plain playing around br br also figuring prominently in the show are eric 's parents , the menacing , commie hating red and the lovable , happy go lucky kitty \( played memorably by kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp \) these 2 adults give the show a much needed mature point of view and constantly berate and advise the 6 ne'er do wells red and kitty are ably supported by donna 's parents , the buffoonish bob \( played wonderfully for the full run by don stark \) and blonde bimbo daft midge \( the super sexy tanya roberts , who was on the show for about half it 's run \) additionally , for 3 full seasons , eric 's sister from hell laurie \( played brilliantly by the wickedly sexy farrah fawcett lookalike lisa robin kelly \) was a major refreshing relief to counter the shenanigans of the main 6 and to be the thorn in eric and her parents ' sides ! kelly came back as a guest character for a few season 5 eps but , unfortunately , kelly 's personal problems led to her being replaced by a terrible new actress in season 6 the newbie did n't last , thankfully , and was gone after a few season 6 eps ! br br sadly , at the end of season 7 , topher grace \( eric \) and early in season 8 , ashton kutcher \( kelso \) left the show and it never recovered as season 8 turned out to be it 's last grace and kutcher returned for the series finale , though , giving the show a satisfying end br br a lot of great supporting and cameo characters would help keep the show fresh through added nostalgia and humor top notch supporting players were eternally high leo \( played to the hilt by tommy chong \) , pastor dave , roy \( the terrific comic jim gaffigan \) , big rhonda , mitch , earl , etc they also got legends marion ross \( happy days \) and betty white \( the mary tyler moore show \) to play red and kitty 's mothers , respectively many celebrity cameos from the 70s made appearances as well , from shirley jones \( partridge family \) to pamela sue martin \( nancy drew \) to charo to ted nugent to k i s s !

orig sent (1):	i have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up , show off sexy models , and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window with that said , the bourne series has been fantastic doug liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style , showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly this is not the sci fi absurdity that was bond \( before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less \) there was a lot to worry for when the bourne supremacy came out with director paul greengrass taking over , what could have been a second hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair the stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment , the bourne ultimatum in what is an amazing conclusion to a top notch trilogy , the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised br br once again , bourne is brought into the minds of the cia by false pretenses someone has leaked information about the treadstone upgrade called blackbriar and once bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story , he is assumed to be the mole only pamela landy , she who was on the case to find him in supremacy , knows that he ca n't be the one bourne 's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace it has been the cia who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them what ends up transpiring is that bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer the film , then , becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends , or if bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him br br in what is probably the simplest storyline of the series , with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story , it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression this is not a detriment at all , however , as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight , between bourne and the cia 's second asset , alone the chase jumping through windows in madrid is cool on its own , but when they finally meet up , we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you 'll see also , rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films , we instead get around three small scale road races , just as intense , but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony br br after five years of waiting , we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling by the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him no one could have done it better than matt damon he has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences , but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him joan allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job , but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how brian cox 's character , from the first two films , took matters into his own hands needing a role in that mold , we are given a nice turn from david strathairn like cox , he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision with as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country , you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing even the little guys do a wonderful job , like paddy considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything , albert finney as a man from bourne 's past and possibly key to his origin , and edgar ramirez as one of the cia 's operatives sent to take bourne out ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by clive owen \( identity \) , karl urban , and martin csokas \( supremacy \) he does n't talk much , if at all , but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in domino br br in the end , one has to applaud paul greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them his skill at the close up hand held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as tony scott , but without quite the seizure inducing cuts rather than feel like over production , his use of hand held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action let 's also credit cinematographer oliver wood , who shot all three bourne films he was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them

finished up being an betterment in styling and flair the stakes were raising and the tale was increased though of it greengrass need to being indicated a tonne of credit for being want to keeping up

never obstructs br br once again , bourne is bringing into the intellect of the cia by mendacious pretexts somebody ha surfaced info about the treadstone upgrades referred blackbriar and once bourne

wreaking mayhem on them what terminates up transpiring is that bourne think to know the source as quite to eventually detected out the truths of who he is and what making him into a murdering the

those who taken his lives from him br br in what is presumably the simple storylines of the series , with only one chase permanent the consequently of the stories , it have potentially the vast

automobile chasing that works in full backdrop to the plots admissions to this movie is than it for the rent fights , between bourne and the fbi 's straight assets , alone the chasing leaping through door in barcelona is nice on its only , but when they eventually met up , we got a twenty minutes or pretty fought that is as stimulating to watching as any scenes you 'll seen also , perhaps than utilizing a sizeable automobile chasing as a atmospheric sets slice that in the first three movies , we rather got around four little scaling roadway racing , just as impassioned , but spaced enough to never bogs the actions down into tiresome br br after four month of wait , we also explore out the origins of our favourite operative with touch and feel by the ends of the movie we should detected out what ha been the causes of all the espionage and shredding that brought decided placing around him no one could ha accomplished it nicer than ryan damon he ha the muscular and mindset to being credible in the action sequences , but also the ranging to pulling off the moment of smarts and cats and mice letters with those against him julie john reprises her roles with the same sums of effort to her jobs , but also a anything more estrangement for what is go on around her after how kevin courtney 's personages , from the first three movies , taken conflicts into his owned hand depending a roles in that mould , we are indicated a good turning from daniel strathairn like cox , he is worked at the topped of the food chaining and answering to no one when make a decisions with as good attempting to covering up any networking to his boss of the blackbriar programs as he is attempting to might his requisite to his countries , you can never actually gauge what he should being able of

orig sent (1):	last christmas , i was lucky enough to receive one of the 1200 ultimate bourne boxed sets from my better half but put off watching the final part of the trilogy until yesterday given how many recent trilogies have stumbled over the finishing line instead of striding triumphantly through it , i was somewhat wary of approaching the bourne ultimatum but i really should n't have been worried the electric actions sequences and bruising fight scenes mix effortlessly alongside the intelligent story lines to make this one of the very best action thrillers i can recall seeing and a sublime end to an excellent series br br jason bourne \( matt damon \) returns after an apparent leak about operation blackbriar a new program based on the old treadstone project to the journalist simon ross \( paddy considine \) at the guardian determined to uncover more about his half remembered past , bourne picks up the trail once again but others at the cia including deputy director noah vosen \( david strathairn \) believe that bourne himself is the leak and start to pursue the rogue agent with renewed vigour can bourne finally find the answers he has been looking for or will his old employers silence him for good \? br br personally , i felt slightly disappointed with the bourne supremacy as it ditched the trademark realism of its action scenes and focused on being a proper spy film not to say it lost it altogether but compared to the fantastic bourne identity , it seemed more like a slow burning spy novel rather than an action thriller no such worries here every car crash , punch , kick and gun shot is heard and felt with visceral delight but thankfully , it still retains a wonderfully intelligent and gripping spy story at its heart to base the action around it also brilliantly ties together the two earlier films , providing a suitable bookend to the trilogy as things are explained and expanded until the full picture is exposed performances throughout are nearly faultless even julia styles begins to offer something more than book wormy eye candy the only real downer is that this , like the other bourne films , has little to do with the original novel but unless you 're a die hard ludlum fan , this is n't really any real reason to dislike a movie like this of the very highest calibre br br nothing pleases me more than a movie that takes me pleasantly by surprise and despite my fears , the bourne ultimtum is a cracking movie filled with enough bone crunching action to satisfy the meat heads as well as a plot that never threatens to let go of your attention for a single minute even at the final reel , you 're never entirely sure whether a happy ending is assured but whether you are a fan of the series or not \( and if not , what more do you want \? \) , this is one film you really should track down as soon as you possibly can no wonder this series forced the producers of the bond movies to throw out forty odd years of movie history in order to start again bourne is a modern spy hero and made recent bond films look more like austin powers in comparison until casino royale gave the bond series the reboot it desperately needed missing out of the jason bourne movies is a crime worthy of rendition go and get yourself a copy of the dvd not the ultimate bourne collection though limited edition , i 'm afraid !

orig sent (1):	i first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and i could not stop laughing everything about this movie seemed to click , the storyline , the characters , the setting as far as film is concerned i would n't call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic it gets it 's meaning across the cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie corben berbson , fred gwynne , ruben blades , and ed o'neil are hilarious for this who have n't seen it , i will give you a brief synopsis four criminals meet up in a small town in montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist however when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from new jersey , they try to figure out what s going on and all hell breaks loose the film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of oceans eleven , only with four criminals who ca n't stand each other , and in montana rather than las vegas all in all if like to laugh i would strongly encourage you to see this movie

orig sent (1):	why do i like disorganized crime so much \? why do i chuckle or laugh out loud any time i think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie \? it 's kind of hard to explain , but i 'll give it a try first of all , it 's very funny indeed in contrast to what lots of official reviews want you to believe but then again , that depends entirely on your sense of humour , so there is no sense in arguing about that often the humour is in the dialogue , and often it is situational comedy there is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the 4 gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck when the farmer drops them , they just stand there by the road , covered all over with cow s or whatever they are totally unnerved then , realizing the humour of the scene , they one by one start laughing about themselves , and ruben blades \( as carlos \) , looking \( and certainly smelling \) terrible , nonchalantly takes out some mouth spray to at least do something about his breath \( simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again ! \) which leads to the second point the acting fred gwynne , lou diamond phillips , william russ , ruben blades and corbin bernsen \( okay , the latter overdoes it a bit at times \) all fit and play their parts beautifully in fact , you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film thirdly , there is the plot jim kouf , the director and screenwriter , is very laid back he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves more often than not , there is no real action , and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people who attempt to rob a bank although their boss \( bernsen \) does not seem to turn up grumble about each other and even tually , grudgingly , like each other the movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot totally impossible with all its twists and coincidences , yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details incidentally , the title of the film is one of the best i have ever come across , because it per fectly summarizes the plot in a very ironic way therefore , take my advice watch this film , but if you do n't chuckle , grin or smile during the first 10 minutes , forget it it 's not your type of film ps the only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay if you happen to know how , do tell me

orig sent (1):	it 's hard to say sometimes why exactly a film is so effective from the moment i first came across the stone boy , something told me it would be a great film in spite of that , it seemed very unlikely that i 'd ever have the opportunity to actually see it for myself then , one day , while looking through the online catalogue of my local library , i saw that they had recently purchased the dvd release of this film which i 'm extremely glad for , because the cinematography is of a stunning depth and quality that an old vhs copy could never replicate br br and speaking of the cinematography , i must single it out as far and above the most stunning aspect of this film as a photographer who pursues very nearly the exact visual style portrayed in the stone boy , i 'm a firm believer in the fact that a great cinematographer can almost single handedly carry a film here , he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast , and a director who understands perfectly what the story needs but to have juan ruiz anch a behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty and you can almost never say that most films would never even expect such a thing of you scene after scene captures some detail , some little bit of visual magic that takes your breath away br br the director , christopher cain , has had a long and interesting career as far as i can gather , this film is not very representative of it but , sometimes , to catch a director near the beginnings of his career , before all the big budgets and loss of focus , there 's a real subtle magic to be found cain steps back in this film , lets things happen with a life of their own , and then ever further much like early john sayles films , characters are given space to breathe , time to talk side stories happen because they do , and that 's how life is cain displays a remarkable , raw , even outright painful understanding of human nature in this film br br the acting ties much of this story together when people talk , when they exist in this film , they do so as actual people , not held back by the fact that they are playing characters gina berriault 's script allows immensely talented and respected actors like wilford brimley , robert duvall , glenn close , and frederic forrest to spend time simply existing whether the things they have to say are minor or of deep significance , it all comes down with the weight of pure reality br br when you look at the actors involved , or the great soundtrack by james horner , it seems strange that such a film be very nearly forgotten maybe much of what makes the stone boy what it is was the time period it was made in there 's this 1970s hangover feeling to this picture that reminds me deeply of my own childhood people talk of the 80s in terms of modern styles and music , but that 's not the 80s i lived in or remember the look of the images , the understated and dark knowing quality of the acting , and the overall result should get under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in north america i see myself in this i see how i saw the world and a film like the stone boy sees the world for how it truly is br br for more of this feeling , please see br br the black stallion \( 1979 \) , never cry wolf \( 1983 \) , tender mercies \( 1983 \) , testament \( 1983 \) , places in the heart \( 1984 \) , matewan \( 1987 \) , high tide \( 1987 \) , driving miss daisy \( 1989 \) , the secret garden \( 1993 \) , the secret of roan inish \( 1994 \) , wendy and lucy \( 2008 \)

' will make you laugh and cry at the same time , you will fall in love \( if you 're not a fan yet ! \) with georgian choir singing tradition , and possibly you will accept the hardships of your own existence and just feel good after watching it \) what i adores a handful about this film is that actors in the non leading roles create lustrous and dramatic characters and are just as interested and principal as the northwestern character the film is starring vahtang kikabidze \( who is great \) , but you will remember every single face around him in the film you will find yourself quoting their lines , that have become household names for so many russian speaking people a film to live with simple , yet deep , you will want to watch it again and again

orig sent (1):	the quintessential georgian film of georgi danelia , ne goryuy \( 1969 \) aka do n't grieve is loosely based on the novel by french writer claude tillier \( 1801 1844 \) mon oncle benjamin the novel takes place in the country side of the 18th century france the great french revolution is still ahead but some of its stormy signs are present in society benjamin , the local doctor is a soul of a local society , the educated , friendly , democratic person who often treats the poor for free it makes him very popular with the locals but most certainly does not help with his bank account he is in love with a beautiful manette who is also crazy about him but is being watched closely by her father who called his daughter his small capital and is determined to protect her virginity until the moment the marriage contract has been signed i never read the book , and from description it sounds like a charming very french novel but i am fascinated with the results of moving the characters and some plot elements from 18th century france to the beginning of 20th century georgia grusiya i would think that it was danelia who came up with all the colorful memorable characters that feel so much at home in his native georgia grusiya , the land of long and wonderful traditions , including art of making and drinking wine , rare music talent that all georgians seem to possess , very unique humor , and high code of honor when we watched the film last night together with my husband , he said , what a great example of an art film , and i so agree with him do n't grieve is a perfect art movie , visually beautiful , deep but funny , at times sad and philosophical but never in a preachy arrogant way but optimistic , celebrating life with all its beauty and sadness , full of interest , loving irony and understanding for its slightly eccentric but very human characters what is the most important , the film is warm and gentle , it does not look down at its viewers as some of the art pictures do you do n't have to be a movie buff to love it , to live with it , to smile and sigh at it , to follow the good hearted young doctor benjamin \( first role in a danelia film of famous singer and actor wachtang kikabidze with whom danelia would go on to make two more films including one of my all time favorites , mimino \) on his journey through the roads and mountains of georgia or to be a guest on one of a kind party where the friends gather to celebrate life of the old doctor levan who wanted to be a guest on his own wake , to hear what his friends have to say about him when he dies while he is still alive , and who gets to choose which color he prefers for his coffin when i watched the film i thought that it is a sort of movie that federico fellini might have liked i was not surprised at all to find the article about danelia where he names fellini his number one director i also found out that according danelia , the famous soviet directors , leonid gaiday \( the creator of many beloved comedies \) and sergei paraszhanov \( the visionary whom i do n't have to introduce loved another danelia 's film , fairy tale about american boy huck finn , sovsem propashchiy \) felt and spoke negatively about do n't grieve while fellini praised it highly i dare go a little further and just guess that perhaps maestro fellini kept in mind some images and the very aura and atmosphere of do n't grieve when he was making amrarcord in 1973 just a thought , because there is something essential that connects both films both artists came back to their roots , to the places that they love deeply , to the people they remembered , loved and wanted to honor both films have a lot of smiles through the tears both are art movies that would get directly to the hearts of the viewers both are masterworks br br i think i am going to add georgi danelia to the list of my favorite directors he has made some of the brilliant pictures in my most favorite genre of dramedy , even tragicomedies that are funny and bitter sweet , poignant and subtle , earthy and uplifting , gentle and shining when i looked up the list of the movies he has written directed , i was amazed at the fact that he has not made a single bad film since he started back in 1960 with the award winning story of a young boy , seryozha many of danelia 's films are among my favorites , as i am sure they are among his legions of fans the man behind ' seryozha , sovsem propashchiy \( 1972 \) which is an adaptation of mark twain the adventures of huckleberry finn , 33 , ya shagayu po moskve \( 1964 \) aka walking the streets of moscow , ne goryuy \( 1969 \) aka do n't grieve , afonya \( 1975 \) , mimino \( 1977 \) , osenniy marafon \( 1979 \) aka autumn marathon or sad comedy which is a very fitting title for this movie as well as for the whole genre that danelia practically invented , and the cult favorite for over 20 years kin dza dza \( 1986 \) , is brilliant and deserves our true love

' and , as they used to say on t v , ' i ca n't believe i watched the whole thing !

orig sent (1):	my first impression would be this is beowulf only with all the good bits of fighting grendel and dragons intact , making it one thrill ride from start to end written by frederic lanoir and arthur qwak , the two of them had created a fantastical landscape that becomes a character in itself within their story , with its ever changing environment made up of small spheres of land floating around , which can either be wastelands , or globes of greenery br br the story 's a simple one , which tells of a land which is cowering in the expectation of a mighty dragon 's unwanted visit to plunder and destroy , and the resident knights have all but been annihilated enter the king 's granddaughter zoe \( marie drion \) who gathers lian chu \( vincent lindon \) , a huge brute with immense strength but truly a gentle giant , and his partner in arms gwizdo \( patrick timsit \) , who balances the partnership with his cunning brain lian chu and gwizdo \( together with their pet creature which too proudly spews incipient fires \) share a common dream of owning a farm land and spending idyllic days tending to their farm animals in retirement , but in order to do that comes the requirement of being financially free , hence their career in monster extermination which does n't exactly pay off br br that 's basically the whole gist of it , but what makes this film a spectacle , is its cg graphics , which is solidly rich , detailed , and an eye popping marvel to behold it has some wonderfully crafted set action pieces that were painstakingly designed to draw you into the thick of the action , , and during those fight sequences , there 's nary a boring moment photo realistic moments of non existent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of make belief , and it 's easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual three suns and a kaleidoscope of flying thingamajigs \( here 's having at you george ! \) and i could n't get enough of the finale battle as well , though the usual brick bats will find some fault at the indestructibility of the principle characters br br i guess this film had opened my eyes that there are many more computer animated companies out there around the world that have quality in their product to match that of pixar 's and this is definitely a movie that the local filmmakers of zodiac the race begins and legend of the sea can learn from to keep the story effectively simple , and let your moving artwork do all the talking definitely highly recommended !

orig sent (1):	joel schumacher made a heck of a choice when he decided on this cast and this script the story is well written and well laid out , and this entirely new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant it seemed that there were 6 leads and about a half dozen supporting , and by far this is the best thing about the movie , the fresh young faces of tomorrow it has been a long time since hollywood has touched the controversial vietnam war films , which says something for the story that needed to be told \( as stated by schumacher \) and tigerland lands in that handful of top war movies period yet it can not be labeled as a war movie because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of bozz and the others i think anyone who just wants to see a good film with out all of the special fx , but just good , gritty drama should go see tigerland , obviously shumachers best works in the past 8 years

orig sent (1):	i do n't know if i 'd consider it a masterpiece of not , but it 's damn near close it 's extremely well made , artistic , suspenseful , intricately plotted , thematically challenging and full of bleak foreshadowing and sexual religious imagery there 's also some great camera work from jan de bont , an atmospheric score from loek dikker and outstanding acting from jeroen krabb and ren e soutendijk , the latter giving one of the most sneaky , subtle ' femme fatale ' performance i 've ever seen like many other european movies , this movie has an unashamed , non judgmental attitude toward sex , nudity and the complexities of sexuality and has zero reservations about mixing it all up with religious and or surrealistic \( some would say blasphemous \) images in other words , if you ca n't bear the thought of seeing a lust driven homosexual envisioning the object of his carnal desire as jesus crucified on the cross before the two of them go at it inside a cemetery crypt then this might not be the movie for you what surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess it mixes the abstract surreal parallel fantasy reality scenes and somehow makes it all work like any good mystery , you can see the pieces slowly falling into place as the movie progresses there is not an out of left field resolution here the movie has direction , there 's no needless filler and once it concludes , you begin to understand the purpose of what may have confused you earlier if you like the work of ken russell and david lynch , i can almost guarantee you will love this movie hell , if you have no idea who they even are , you still might like it br br i'm not going to spoil the plot by getting too detailed , but the film 's opening shot through a web as a spider catches its prey sets the stage as krabb , as unshaven , smug , bisexual writer gerard reve \( interestingly , also the name of the writer whose novel this is based on \) crosses paths with a wealthy , mysterious , sexy woman named christine \( soutendijk , melding androgynous stylings with simone simon like innocence cuteness that 's pretty unnerving \) , who may be a literal ' black widow ' responsible for the deaths of her three previous husbands the two become lovers and move in with one another , but we 're led to believe \( through christine 's bizarre behavior and the frequent appearances of another woman played by geert de jong who may or may not actually exist \) something terrible is boiling under the surface when another of christine 's lovers , the young and beautiful herman \( thom hoffman \) , shows up at the house , things take an unexpected turn and that 's all you need to know br br the 4th man was a huge art house success in much of the world , but did n't make it over to the us until 1984 , where it was awarded the best foreign film of the year from the los angeles film critics association the most common video is the media release , which has been horribly dubbed try to avoid that one and head straight for the newer subtitled anchor bay dvd release since coming to america , verhoeven 's career has had its ups and downs he has made a few decent films \( flesh blood , robocop \) and some lousy ones \( showgirls \) in fact , verhoeven 's big hit basic instinct is almost like a less interesting , junior league version of the fourth man soutendjik also tried her hand at acting in america and since grave secrets \( 1989 \) and eve of destruction \( 1991 \) were the best offers she was getting , she headed right back home to the netherlands

orig sent (1):	it 's always difficult to put a stamp on any film as being ' the best , ' whether of all time , a certain genre , or what have you , but i believe a strong argument could be made that in fact , laputa is the greatest animated film ever made it is in my mind the masterwork of hayao miyazaki , the most talented of japan 's animated directors , and it best captures his strengths as a director , storyteller , and designer , as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes the version i 'm reviewing is the 2003 american dub \( i know , sacrilege for a hard core anime fan to not watch it in its native language \) there is at least one other english language dub out there , i have it on vhs \( i have no idea from what source \) , and that version is the single best dub i have ever encountered of any film but i thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find br br laputa tells the story of a boy named pazu \( voiced by james van der beek here \) , who 's growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named sheeta \( anna paquin \) literally drops from the sky it seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent , colonel muska \( mark hamill \) , who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck to keep things lively , there 's also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal , led by the aging but still boisterous dola \( cloris leachman \) the plot revolves around the crystal 's ability to reveal the location of the fabled flying city of laputa , a potential treasure trove of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure it 's all very much in keeping with a fairy tale setting , but miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story , and the plot is peppered with ' gosh wow ' moments and threaded with his customary morality and warnings about abusing the power of nature br br the design work on laputa , nearly twenty years later , is still revolutionary flying machines of all sorts abound , utterly impossible but so meticulously designed that you instantly accept them without blinking the world is set somewhere around the start of the twentieth century , with telegraphs and ancient motorcars alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines but it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution laputa is both the garden of eden and the fire of heaven itself , and in that juxtaposition lies its appeal , its power , and its danger br br besides being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film , laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography from sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water , laputa displays a scope that most films even with the magic of cgi can only daydream about though we only see a small fraction of this world , its simple elegance extends beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it the film also contains one of my favorite , if not the most exciting , action sequences ever a guardian robot that fell to earth is accidentally reactivated and wreaks havoc on the fortress it is kept in , all the while trying to protect sheeta \( who was the one who woke it up \) meanwhile , pazu and the pirates swoop in on their little flying machines to snatch her , literally , from the jaws of destruction from the horrific sight of the robot incinerating the countryside to the exhilarating last second rescue , the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience br br it helps that laputa has an amazing score composer joe hisaishi captures the wondrous beauty of this world , the dewy innocence , the exciting action , and the creepy otherworldliness of the flying city and its bizarre robot guardians though he re recorded it for this dvd release \( which imo is not an improvement over his original score \) , adding pieces here and there , the score matches the visuals perfectly , a rare total union of sound and vision br br this is n't a bad dub i 'm inordinately fond of the older english dub , and this one over explains things just a tad in spots , but i was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those \( and those matched the japanese pretty well \) dola in particular is hard to get right , but leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman \( her sons are n't quite as good as the original \) paquin does a good job as sheeta , and mark hamill , while i knew it was him early , is more than talented enough to do muska \( i liked the other english dub of muska a little more , but hamill 's good \) much of the film rests on pazu 's shoulders , and van der beek is wonderful listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other english dub , because vdb matches up very closely with the original pazu although again watching a dub is grounds for excommunication among the otaku faithful , as much as i love this film , i do n't think you 're sacrificing a great deal simply watching this particular anglicized version john lassiter of pixar introduces it up front , and my suspicion is that he , like so many others , simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality br br miyazaki has had success in america in recent years with spirited away and mononoke \( one of his few films i did n't care for \) , but to me laputa is still his crowning achievement anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work , and again , this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every cylinder i 'd pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen while that will probably never happen , it 's good to know that at least this classic has been preserved on dvd

abilities as a chief , scriptwriter , and designers , as too as encapsulating all of his picked resultant theme the version i 'm revised is the 2003 usa dub \( i know , dishonor for a tough nucleus manga fans to not watching it in its ancestral languages \) there is at least one other english translators dubs out there , i ha it on vcr \( i ha no ideas from what source \) , and that versions is
