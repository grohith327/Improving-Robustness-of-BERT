orig sent (1):	this comment does contain spoilers ! ! br br there are few actors that have an intangible to them that innate quality which is an amalgamation of charisma , panache and swagger it 's the quality that can separate good actors from the truly great i think george clooney has it and so does jack nicholson you can look at clooney 's subtle touches in scenes like his one word good bye to andy garcia in ocean 's 11 when they just utter each other 's name disdainfully terry danny you can pick any number of jack 's performances dating as far back as five easy pieces in the diner to a few good men and his court room interrogation scene these guys just have it you can add denzel washington to the small and exclusive list of actors who exudes that terrific trait in everything he does if you look at some of his explosive borderline diatribes in the siege to his impressive tribute to malcolm x in spike lee 's film of the same name , you can see that there is no finer an actor working today i do n't mention all of this to insinuate that man on fire is perfect just because of denzel 's work , but he is definitely the cog of the production i was literally mesmerized with some of his scenes that are raw , emotional and incendiary all at the same time br br washington plays creasy a former spy or cia agent or one of those covert government operatives he has pretty much hit rock bottom as he has become disillusioned with the life that he has led he has killed and perhaps done things that are best left unsaid and this has made him a hardened and bitter man his friend and perhaps mentor , played very reservedly by christopher walken , is living in mexico making a very comfortable living by providing body guard services for the rich apparently the kidnapping business in mexico is so vibrant that these paid former s e a l s and such can do very well while providing a needed service creasey needs the work and accepts a job with a well to do family who seems to be in some financial difficulty marc anthony is fine as samuel , radha mitchell is tantalizingly sexy as his wife lisa and dakota fanning is just unbelievably and precociously brilliant as pita i do n't know how a child of her age can have such range to play the characters that she does but her interpretation of pita is nothing short of oscar worthy the film 's entire first half is dependent on the relationship between pita and creasy and if there was a weaker actress in the role , perhaps that emotional synergy would not have come across so succinctly but fanning is nothing short of remarkable in the role br br it is the relationship between pita and creasy that drives this film to the apex of cinema together they are perfect and there is a real bond developed between them tony scott directs with a frenetic urgency and his eye for visual flare has never been better i am interested to see how his next film , domino , turns out i think scott is one of today 's under rated directors and with more films like this one , his name will surely be elevated to icon status br br the story has creasy really taking to pita , and vis ca versa there is a definite connection between the two of them and perhaps it stems from the fact that although pita loves her dad , he is not around much he is a philanthropist and obviously has little time to spend with his family soon , creasy is taking pita to her swimming competition he is reading her bedtime stories and she is naming her teddy bear creasy it 's not just a friendship between them , it is more of a kinship , and a deep parental love seems to be present br br the film changes gears when pita does get kidnapped and held for ransom and creasy is is almost fatally injured trying to protect her this is where the story becomes thick with innuendo and ripe with deceit as the plot pieces get unraveled like an onion and this is where denzel becomes a tour de force like i said earlier , i have seen denzel give some outstanding performances in films like crimson tide and training day , but never have i seen him like this he is a man possessed and with the possibility of pita being dead , he becomes a literal man on fire it rages in him as he hunts down and dishes out his brand of comeuppance denzel 's anger and acerbity are ubiquitous and not easily quelled as he hunts down each person responsible for pita 's violation this all vigilante justice as the mexican authorities always seem to be one step behind br br also what is paramount to this film 's audacious brilliance is that there are few films that actually give the criminals their due comeuppance i have often been frustrated to watch films where the bad guys get let off easily they inflict all kinds of torment for the entire film and then they take a bullet and die but not in this film writer brian helgeland sees to it that retribution here is unequivocal and it is painful the perpetrators here feel creasy 's wrath and they experience the torment that he unleashes there is nothing gimmicky about his brand of justice he needs information and someone loses a finger he wants answers and a homemade bomb is placed in places that are meant for other things there is no punches pulled here and this is one of the true strengths of the film br br man on fire is one the five best films of 2004 now that it is out on dvd , my recommendation is to get the se it is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks 10 10

to get the se it is loaded with bonus features that include about 6 hours of documentaries and different commentary tracks 10 10

orig sent (1):	man on fire , is definitely one of the best drama crime thrillers i have ever seen despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well this is denzel washington 's perfect role , in which he plays a body guard , called creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest prot g e , pita dakota fanning plays pita , the very smart , enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things , and acts in a very convincing manner , she has a great future ahead of her as i said the story is somewhat complicated , in order to fully understand it , you must watch it a couple of times br br this film is made in two parts , there 's the first hour , where everyone is happy , nothing 's wrong , everyone 's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of pita occurs and where creasy is almost killed and then there 's the second part , the rest of the film , where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing , when creasy 's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and la hermamdad that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of pita br br denzel washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them it is a real shame that this film has n't been acknowledged enough , washington really deserved another oscar for his performance , and so did fanning and the director and even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality br br if you like excellent , slightly deranged , suspenseful thrillers , this is the one to see the most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters ! 10 10

orig sent (1):	brian yuzna is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gore fests , but the truth is that his films actually are n't bad at all the re animator sequels are n't as great as the original , but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned return of the living dead 3 is the best of the series and society is n't a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece this thriller certainly is n't a masterpiece but it shows yuzna 's eye for horror excellently , and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging i 'm really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry did n't turn up until 1996 , as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear it 's running away from a tiger for the modern world dentistry does n't frighten me , but surprisingly i would appear to be in the minority the plot follows perfectionist dentist dr feinstone he has a nice house , a successful career and a beautiful wife pretty much everything most people want however , his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife 's affair with the pool cleaner and his life is n't the only one as it 's his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger br br when it comes to scaring the audience , this movie really makes itself however , credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme the fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that i 'm not squeamish about going to the dentist yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes ! the film follows the standard man going insane plot outline , only with the dentist you always get the impression that there 's more to the film than what we 're seeing it is n't very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level and while this wo n't be winning any awards , the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot the acting , while b class , is actually quite impressive with corbin bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge i should thank brian yuzna for casting ken foree in the movie the dawn of the dead star does n't get enough work , and i really love seeing him in films the rest of the cast does n't massively impress , but all do their jobs well enough overall , the dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies the gore scenes are sure to please horror fans , and i do n't hesitate to recommend this film

orig sent (1):	i remember watching this late at night on black and white tv , long before a live action version was so much as a twinkle in peter jackson 's eye and being very impressed finally getting my hands this week on a vhs copy that was being thrown away \( and is n't that just par for the course \? \) i had the chance to revisit this film , and found that it still stands up quite well , although it 's not quite the success that memory had painted br br i have to confess to a certain bias here some reviewers announce themselves as confirmed jackson lovers , others as jackson haters i 'm not exactly either i was a devotee of the bbc radio adaptation by brian sibley originally broadcast in 1981 , and instantly recognised the voice of gollum here peter woodthorpe would reprise this performance almost note perfect for the radio three years later br br i must say , however , that where i found jackson 's films an increasingly indulgent disappointment , the bakshi version , for all that it has been cut to the bone , is actually more accurate yes , there are the usual , understandable changes \( here it is legolas rather than arwen who is substituted for glorfindel as the elf sent from rivendell to meet the party \) and there is a great deal of telescoping of the action \( the only exception to the latter , as others have remarked , is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of rivendell , where the ringwraiths , having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back frodo in mid flight which they deploy again when he defies them after crossing the river then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight gallop , which is initially nightmarish but pointless , plot wise , and definitely goes on too long \) i would also agree that the balrog is unsatisfactory , due partly to bad animation , and that gandalf windmills his arms too much br br but having watched both approaches to the film , i feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take in a tale that is half myth \( oddly enough , one thing that is included is a snippet of aragorn 's story of beren and luthien \) the extreme literalism required by live action filming , where everything from monsters to mail shirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera , is counter productive latex faced \( or cgi \) monsters are less monstrous than sketchily drawn shapes , heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies , and hobbits or dwarfs with non human body proportions are easy to animate but hard to film convincingly many reviewers have cited the sniffing ringwraith in the woods , with its crippled , half human movements , as one of the scariest moments in the film it certainly frightened me silly when i saw it for the first time alone in the dark !

adv sent (0):	i remember watching this late at night on black and white tv , long before a live action version was so much as a twinkle in peter jackson 's eye and being very impressed finally getting my hands this week on a vhs copy that was being thrown away \( and is n't that just par for the course \? \) i had the chance to revisit this film , and might that it still stands up quite well , although it 's not quite the success that memory had painted br br i have to obliged to a certain bias here some reviewers announce themselves as confirmed jackson eager , others as jackson haters i 'm not exactly either i was a devotee of the bbc radio adaptation by brian sibley originally broadcast in 1981 , and instantly recognised the voice of gollum here peter woodthorpe would reprise this performance almost note perfect for the radio three years later br br i must say , however , that where i found jackson 's films an increasingly indulgent disappointment , the bakshi version , for all that it has been cut to the bone , is actually more accurate yes , there are the usual , understandable changes \( here it is legolas rather than arwen who is substituted for glorfindel as the elf sent from rivendell to meet the party \) and there is a great deal of telescoping of the action \( the only exception to the latter , as others have remarked , is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of rivendell , where the ringwraiths , having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back frodo in mid flight which they deploy again when he defies them after crossing the river then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight gallop , which is initially nightmarish but pointless , plot wise , and definitely goes on too long \) i would also agree that the balrog is unsatisfactory , due partly to bad animation , and that gandalf windmills his arms too much br br but having watched both approaches to the film , i feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take in a tale that is half myth \( oddly enough , one thing that is included is a snippet of aragorn 's story of beren and luthien \) the extreme literalism required by live action filming , where everything from monsters to mail shirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera , is counter productive latex faced \( or cgi \) monsters are less monstrous than sketchily drawn shapes , heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies , and hobbits or dwarfs with non human body proportions are easy to animate but hard to film convincingly many reviewers have cited the sniffing ringwraith in the woods , with its crippled , half human movements , as one of the scariest moments in the film it certainly frightened me silly when i saw it for the first time alone in the dark !

orig sent (1):	one of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt german expressionism , the highly atmospheric style of film making developed during the 20s in berlin classic movies like das cabinet des dr caligari \( 1920 \) and nosferatu , eine symphonie des grauens \( 1922 \) were the most famous direct results of this movement , and while the movement did n't have a long life , its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today , specially in the horror genre one of the key figures of this style would be director paul wegener , director of 1920 's der golem , wie er in die welt kam , as in his debut as a filmmaker , seven years before the making of that classic , he was already making experiments with expressionism in film that early prototype of german expressionism was incidentally , another horror film der student von prag br br der student von prag \( the student of prague \) , is the story of balduin \( paul wegener \) , a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in prague , but who always find himself with financial troubles one day , balduin rescues the beautiful countess margit \( grete berger \) from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again , but soon he discovers that he 'll have to compete with her rich cousin , graf von schwarzenberg \( lothar k rner \) , who also wants to marry her knowing that he ca n't offer her much , balduin wishes to be wealthy , and this is where a sorcerer named scapinelli \( john gottowt \) enters the scene scapinelli offers balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room balduin accepts the proposal , only to discover in horror that what scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror br br loosely inspired by edgar allan poe 's short story william wilson and the classic legend of faust , the story of der student von prag was conceived by german writer hanns heinz ewers , a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature written at a time where cinema in germany was still being developed as an art form , der student von prag shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes like most of the scriptwriters of his time , ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater , although der student von prag begins to move away from that style while a bit poor on its character development \( specially on the supporting characters \) , ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of balduin br br while der student von prag was paul wegener 's directorial debut and stellan rye 's second film as a filmmaker , it 's very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly giving great use to guido seeber 's cinematography , the two young filmmakers create a powerful gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the german filmmakers of the following decade would do wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his golem series from seeber and rye despite having very limited resources , rye and wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing \( for its time \) visual effect for the

adv sent (0):	one of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt german expressionism , the highly atmospheric style of film making developed during the 20s in berlin classic movies like das cabinet des dr caligari \( 1920 \) and nosferatu , eine symphonie des grauens \( 1922 \) were the most famous direct results of this movement , and while the movement did n't sure a long life , its gargantuan resulting over cinema can just been feel tomorrow , purely in the horror genre one of the key figures of this style would be director paul wegener , director of 1920 's der golem , wie er in die welt kam , as in his debut as a filmmaker , seven years before the making of that classic , he was already making experiments with expressionism in film that early prototype of german expressionism was incidentally , another horror film der student von prag br br der student von prag \( the student of prague \) , is the story of balduin \( paul wegener \) , a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in prague , but who always find himself with financial troubles one day , balduin rescues the beautiful countess margit \( grete berger \) from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again , but soon he discovers that he 'll have to compete with her rich cousin , graf von schwarzenberg \( lothar k rner \) , who also wants to marry her knowing that he ca n't offer her much , balduin wishes to be wealthy , and this is where a sorcerer named scapinelli \( john gottowt \) enters the scene scapinelli offers balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room balduin accepts the proposal , only to discover in horror that what scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirror br br loosely inspired by edgar allan poe 's short story william wilson and the classic legend of faust , the story of der student von prag was conceived by german writer hanns heinz ewers , a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature written at a time where cinema in germany was still being developed as an art form , der student von prag shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes like most of the scriptwriters of his time , ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater , although der student von prag begins to move away from that style while a bit poor on its character development \( specially on the supporting characters \) , ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of balduin br br while der student von prag was paul wegener 's directorial debut and stellan rye 's second film as a filmmaker , it 's very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly giving great use to guido seeber 's cinematography , the two young filmmakers create a powerful gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the german filmmakers of the following decade would do wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his golem series from seeber and rye despite having very limited resources , rye and wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing \( for its time \) visual effect for the scenes with balduin 's reflection \( played by wegener too \) already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film , wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move

orig sent (1):	lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old chaplin films and even some of rowan atkinson 's early bean performances , and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work , something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages , in a way that just makes you feel good a bug 's life has that same charm , it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects , because even though they talk , they still act just like real bugs it 's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them , to imagine bugs the way a young mind does br br honey , i shrunk the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger , and to me , a bug 's life is like a more realistic version of that movie , if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities i try not to compare it to something like toy story \( which i still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made \) , because the story of a bug 's life is not quite as good as toy story 's , but then again , almost nothing is the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun br br the story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society , mostly geared around building a harvest of food , most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers , vastly superior in strength and general meanness , and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter we are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers , who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food , the consequences will be dire and incidentally , the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to mao tse tung 's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the great leap forward br br the fun and excitement begins when flik , the main character , sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers you see , he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger , so he feels it 's his responsibility , but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers great for the audience , not so great for the safety of the clan br br the movie was released back in the late 90s , when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos , like armageddon and deep impact , independence day and the arrival , a bug 's life and antz , etc comparisons between a bug 's life and antz are inevitable , although it seems clear to me that a bug 's life is by far the superior film , and not only because it does n't star woody allen stuttering and whining through the lead role this is great family fun !

orig sent (1):	i am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007 's films if 2004 was the year of the biographies and 2005 was the year of the political films , 2007 can be identified as a year featuring a wide plethora of morality tales , films that portray , test , challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things although this identification is rather broad , i think that there are a handful of films released this year , such as 3 10 to yuma , eastern promises , american gangster , no country for old men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or treachery before the devil knows you 're dead is a deviously stylish morality tale , and quite a dark , bleak and depressing one at that and even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time , the legendary sidney lumet , who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this viciously rich crime thriller br br it 's one of those films whose plots are so thick , that one is very reluctant to go into details it is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold , as there are twists and turns but the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film the true focus is , as i mentioned , the morality tale the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film in a plot structured like a combination between the filmographies of both the coen brothers \( namely blood simple and fargo \) and quentin tarantino , we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly , ridiculously wrong , and reciprocates with full force and inevitable tragedy and to make it all the more interesting , the film is told in a fragmented chronology that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time sizzling , sharp , thick and precariously depressing , kelly masterson 's screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded , in particular because it is a debut screenplay br br but the film has much more going for it than just it 's delectably sinister and quite depressing plot first and foremost , the picture looks and feels outstandingly well sidney lumet has , throughout his career , consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting naturalistic

sizzling drama thriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly and vivid , dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style the film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by carter burwell br br the screenplay does its part , and of course lumet does his part , but at the film 's dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances first and foremost , there are the two leads leading the pack is philip seymour hoffman , who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon newfound leading man status after his unnaturally fantastic oscar winning performance in capote his turn in this film is fascinating severely flawed , broken , manic hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out , and not just his subtlety and wit at his side is ethan hawke , who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater , grander actors here , he bounces off hoffman and complements him so incredibly well in all , the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing , the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that it 's watching actors and then there 's albert finney such a supple , opulent supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the tragically obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime i love how the dynamics between the three of them play out i love how hoffman is clearly the dominant brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that they 're middle aged men and yet despite this , it is clear how finney 's father favours hawke 's younger , weaker brother also on the topic of the cast , the two supporting female characters wives of the brothers also feature fantastic performances from amy ryan and marisa tomei , whose looks just get better and better as the years go by br br this film is n't revolutionary these themes and this style have already
