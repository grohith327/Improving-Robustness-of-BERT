surprising was also bruce willis ' performance his i did n't remember very well , but it 's beautiful and full of sensibility he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground , and when he comes to the past you 'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up cole is a rather ambiguous character , peoples ' tried to imbue some darkness in him , and he does other disturbing things to other people and to himself the scene where he removes his own teeth reveals how far his dementia has gone unchecked ironically cole did n't start as a crazy character , but when he starts warning everyone about the end of the world , he 's considered mad and convinced it 's all in his mind , until he arrives at a point when he ca n't distinguish past from future , reality from fiction willis spends a lot of time looking confused and insecure , and it works perfectly one of the fun twists in the narrative is when cole 's shrink , dr kathryn railly , finds undeniable proof he 's really from the future and now has to convince him again of his mission to save the world the screenplay is full with weird twists like this and it keeps the movie in a fast pace their relationship is also well handed , although perhaps a bit compressed for time 's sake but i enjoyed watching cole and railly falling in love and trying to escape the authority of the future to live a peaceful life in the past but then things end in a tragic bittersweet climax at an airport , wrapping all the pieces together , which will blow many minds away br br there are two great endings in this movie , a twist in the sense of se7en or fight club , and a more intimate ending where railly is crouching next to cole who 's just been shot and looking around for a younger james cole who 's witnessing his future self die the two share a brief look , and she smiles at him the twist is brilliant , but i prefer this ending for emotional impact madeleine stowe is very good playing dr railly , she drew many different emotions from me in her performance the movie is filled with a sense of fatalism with the idea the past ca n't be changed this movie shows that in a terrifying way it reminds me of chinatown in that sense , the way jake gittes messes everything up the more he tries to help railly 's character shares that fatalism , the more she tries to help cole first dealing with his ' madness ' then helping him in his mission the more they 're sucked into tragedy br br the twist ends with a hopeful note , though , with the feeling cole 's mission has n't been in vain twelve monkeys is a great movie to watch if one wants to be entertained it 's not supposed to be art , although it 's more artists than many artistic movies it 's an unpretentious movie where all elements , from music to editing to costume design , etc , came together beautifully to produce a modern cinema masterpiece

orig sent (1):	twelve monkeys is odd and disturbing , yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time it cleverly jumps between future and the past , and the story it tells is about a man named james cole , a convict , who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996 at first cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist dr kathryn railly who tries to help him and a patient named jeffrey goines , the insane son of a famous scientist being provocative and somehow so sensible , dealing with and between reason and madness , the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science fiction films br br the story is just fantastic it 's so original and so entertaining the screenplay itself written by david and janet peoples is inspired by a movie named la jet e \( 1962 \) which i have n't seen , but i must thank the director and writer of the movie , chris marker , for giving such an inspiration for the writers of twelve monkeys i read a little about la jet e , it 's not the same story but it has the same idea , so this is not just a copy of it david and janet peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story , which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it 's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end the music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it does n't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it 's so compelling , composed by paul buckmaster br br terry gilliam , who we remember from monty python , as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me , as i really never thought him as a director type of a person i know he has directed movies before , but i really could n't believe that he could make something this magnificent it should n't be a surprise though , as he does an amazing job you can still sense that same weirdness as in the python 's , but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing yes , it is indeed odd , weird , bizarre and disturbing , so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too , so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through it 's not as heavy as you could imagine , but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch despite that , the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks , dreams , jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it does n't even make the plot messy in any part , though it does need concentration from the viewer after all br br what comes to acting , well the movie does n't even go wrong there the role of james cole is played by the mighty bruce willis , who probably does his best role performance yet to date now people may disagree with me , as he did some fine job in for example the sixth sense as well , but for me the role of james cole was so ideal for willis and he performs it incredibly well the character is very well written too , yet performed even better cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself , starting to question his actual time of living , trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle by hardship he starts to loose his faith , questioning if he can even trust or believe himself other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of madeleine stow and brad pitt stow plays the role of kathryn railly , the psychiatrist of james cole , who sees something strangely familiar in cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness she somehow starts to believe cole 's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things brad pitt is so good in the role of jeffrey goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date the insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought pitt even an oscar nomination for it , so i guess i 'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing br br all in all , twelve monkeys is a great science fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone , especially for the sci fi fans it includes brilliant characters and superb role performances , especially from willis and pitt , and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that 's so intelligent and clever yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer 's attention by making it interesting and witty it 's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too , so it 's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci fi motion pictures i 've ever seen through the odd yet terrific vision of terry gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride hard to explain really , but that 's how it is , it 's mind blowing

has directed movies before , but i really could n't believe that he could make something this magnificent it should n't be a surprise though , as he does an amazing job you can still sense that same weirdness as in the python 's , but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing yes , it is indeed odd , weird , bizarre and disturbing , so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too , so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through it 's not as heavy as you could imagine , but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch despite that , the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks , dreams , jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it does n't even make the plot messy in any part , though it does need concentration from the viewer after all br br what comes to acting , well the movie does n't even go wrong there the role of james cole is played by the mighty bruce willis , who probably does his best role performance yet to date now people may disagree with me , as he did some fine job in for example the sixth sense as well , but for me the role of james cole was so ideal for willis and he performs it incredibly well the character is very well written too , yet performed even better cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself , starting to question his actual time of living , trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle by hardship he starts to loose his faith , questioning if he can even trust or believe himself other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of madeleine stow and brad pitt stow plays the role of kathryn railly , the psychiatrist of james cole , who sees something strangely familiar in cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness she somehow starts to believe cole 's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things brad pitt is so good in the role of jeffrey goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date the insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought pitt even an oscar nomination for it , so i guess i 'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing br br all in all , twelve monkeys is a great science fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone , especially for the sci fi fans it includes brilliant characters and superb role performances , especially from willis and pitt , and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that 's so intelligent and clever yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer 's attention by making it interesting and witty it 's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too , so it 's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci fi motion pictures i 've ever seen through the odd yet terrific vision of terry gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride hard to explain really , but that 's how it is , it 's mind blowing

orig sent (1):	one of the all time great science fiction works , as visionary and thought provoking as blade runner or even gilliam 's own brazil willis gives his best performance here , but he 's outdone by pitt 's incredibly frenetic turn that 's unlike anything he 's done before or since even stowe is n't out of her league here , though the story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about the climactic scene is beautifully magnificent , and the last lines fit perfectly the scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way lots of dark humour on display here fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography in my top ten

orig sent (1):	after reading several comments , i felt i had to add in my two cents as well sorrow lost is one of the most memorable shorts i think i have ever seen i had gotten the chance to see this at the new york independent film festival i felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional the story was beautifully complex especially for such a short amount of time the story is focused on a young girl who is victimized by her abusive father she is soon given the choice to stop him by a demon played by witchblade 's eric etebari having watched the show , i was amazingly impressed with how he played such unique and different character i never knew he could act so well ! his character was deeply complex and he was very persuasive the acting was absolutely superb by him the girl 's was okay and the father 's was decent there is also death in this who follows the girl around until she is able to escape from her future the effects and cinematography were absolutely mind blowing i wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this it is rare you get to see such a high quality short the opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable with any major feature film this is n't to say that it 's not without its flaws i thought it took a little to get going and the intro was a little long but this stuck in my head days after watching it there are very few shorts with this level of quality

orig sent (1):	deathtrap gives you a twist at every turn , every single turn , in fact its biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the film , and it often does n't make any sense , although they do usually catch you by surprise the story is very good , except for the fact that it has so many twists the screenplay is very good with great dialogue and characters , but you ca n't catch all the development because of the twists the performances particularly by caine are amazing the direction is very good , sidney lumet can direct the visual effects are fair , but than again most are actually in a play and are fake twists way to much , but still works and is worth watching

just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore not a chance br br i think james berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of halloween because of its title , halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s however , while halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre , it is not a member br br he has a point , and for a number of reasons first and foremost , it 's downright terrifying , whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore fests \( one could argue that many recent ones are tongue in cheek , but most of those fail as well \) second , there is almost no violence \( very little of which is bloody \) john carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary , and he relies very little on it \( actually , the body count is pretty low \) in fact , one can argue that this is n't really a horror movie , at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie , each gorier and more sadistic than the last he relies on ideas for scares , and also skill third , while some of the characters may do stupid things \( that sometimes seal their fate \) , they do n't do them because they 're dumb the characters are real people , so instead of thinking that the characters die because they 're idiots , we 're frightened because they 're making a mistake br br one of the main reasons why halloween is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that it 's real nothing is hard to swallow in this film there 's no supernatural , there 's no ridiculously creative plot elements , or inventive murders , or whatnot instead , all the set pieces and camera work \( save the opening sequence \) are simple carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action what we get is the feeling that we 're actually seeing a murder take place right in front of us br br horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary , everything has to be perfect , and ideas never work twice it 's a hit or miss game , which is why if i were to tell you all the good ideas that carpenter has \( which i 'm not \) , they 'd seem primitive \( particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years \) br br acting here is not a plus point because it does n't need to be this is a movie about scary ideas , not a movie about dramatic , conflicted characters the actors act like real people , not characters from a story nothing more the exception to this is whoever plays the shape , or later known as michael myers it can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill , but it 's hard to pull off \( and even harder to keep people from asking why \) but the guy pulls it off , and the result is terrifying br br this is carpenter 's movie through and through he directed it , co wrote it , co produced it , and wrote the chilling score of it this is a man of brilliance , and his later movie the thing supports this statement , though the thing is not as scary as halloween unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished , as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers recognize your potential as good as this film is , it 's not without flaws the famous opening scene is disturbing , but not very scary and not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie it 's not that it 's bad , it 's just that there 's no good reason to fear the shape luckily , carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience while there 's no intimacy in this relationship , it fits the purpose we grow to know the characters , but not so much that it 's disheartening when they die but once the film gets to halloween night , that 's when carpenter kicks things into high gear and it never stops until you get to the end br br while halloween may be flawed , it is only slightly so it is an immensely terrifying film , and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies be warned though , this movie will scare the living hell out of you !

sturdier pile of hollywood style clich s that variations of it exist in other films including streisand 's own funny girl this time reset to the then contemporary music scene , the timeworn plot

orig sent (1):	certainly one of the finest movies i have seen for quite some time exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film denzel washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date , and the rest of the cast perform beautifully christopher walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as i would have liked a story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love this is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets , rockets and revenge the location of mexico city adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener all in all , a truly gripping film from beginning to end highly recommended !

orig sent (1):	do nt read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial , brain dead and pointless the film is excellent , the acting by both denzel and dakota \( she will go sky high , trust me on that \) are just fabulous , and the plot is mind blowing actually fabulous is a small word to use for such talented actors the film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional , a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film if you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films , you still have n't watched your favorite one yet trust me , in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling the film is awesome , see it , rent it , buy it or whatever just do n't miss it
