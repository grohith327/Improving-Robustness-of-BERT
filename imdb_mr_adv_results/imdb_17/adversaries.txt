was the director 's original room on the 38th floor one of the only rooms in the hotel with a lousy view \? nevertheless , everyone gets out just before the missile hits br br 10 lisa drives to joe 's house to save her father only to see the killer outside although she runs him over \( as he is shooting at her \) by crashing her jeep into the house , no one in the neighborhood seems to notice or bother to stop by br br 11 jackson arrives at joe 's house and knocks him out \( we do n't see how maybe another head butt \) he then explains to lisa that he did n't kill dad yet because he wanted dad to see lisa die first \( give me a break what is this \? saturday morning cartoons \? \) br br 12 for the rest of the movie \( about 20 minutes \) , jackson chases lisa around the house , and she resourcefully fights him off of course a real killer \( i e one maybe played by jason statham \) would have done away with lisa \( or for that matter anyone who is not a trained killer \) in the first 30 seconds during the course of this chase , jackson steps over joe at least once without bothering to kill him br br 13 finally , jackson prevails , and he is about to kill lisa when \( you guessed it \) he is shot by joe br br so , here 's my suggestion tell wes craven to stick to horror or maybe he should get together with michael bay \( who directed the equally stupid the island \) and make red island

br br i'm not precisely sure how many versions of this movie are available the uk altered video was released under the alias of campus killings , but the us copy that i own states that it 's the complete unedited edition , which could mean that there is a censored print floating about somewhere \? i 'd be fairly surprised if that was the case as splatter university certainly is n't as gore delicious as the hyperbole packaging would lead you to believe one or two litres of corn syrup certainly do n't stand up to gore hound 's scrutiny when compared to the likes of blood rage or pieces , so in this instance the movie is somewhat over hyped one thing that many critics have failed to mention is the charming lead performance from francine forbes , who ends up carrying the entire picture on her shoulders throughout the 79 minute running time despite amateurish direction from richard haines she still unveils some magnificent potential that should have lead to the chance of another stab at serious acting under a more accomplished helmer unfortunately that possibility never came , and bottom of the barrel bombs like death ring and splitz certainly did n't help to nurture a talent that could have improved dramatically under the right scholarship br br the rest of the cast members were par for the course of movie obscurity , especially the wooden plank teenagers who for some strange reason acted like they were auditioning for a remake of grease or the wanderers the bog standard point and shoot direction could n't have helped to build much confidence in the project and the fact that the few signs of potential were undermined by the clumsy handling of the script writer left the feature effectively unredeemable perhaps the only claim of originality to be found in haines ' slasher is the brave attempt for the contrasting conclusion let 's just say that it 's not a final that i was expecting to witness in a movie that was so typical of the cycle br br at one point in the runtime , one of the teens says , man that parker bores me to tears well the same can be said for splatter university , which never lifts the pace above slow motion with that said though , francine forbes made for a delectable scream queen and undoubtedly one that i would have paid to watch again in a similar role so that pretty much sums up this un troma tising ride slow paced , shoddy but still strangely alluring you 'd have to be especially forgiving to give it a chance

orig sent (0):	the beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor , but once the film changes into animation it quickly loses its appeal br br one of the reasons that was so , at least for me , was that the colors in much of the animation are too muted , with too little contrast it does n't look good , at least on vhs once in a while it breaks out and looks great , but not often also , the characters come and go too quickly for example , i would have liked to have seen more of moby dick when the film starts to drag , however , it picks up again with the entrance of the dragon and then the film finishes strong br br overall , just not memorable enough or able to compete with the great animated films of the last dozen years

orig sent (0):	i 'm going to say first off that i have given this film a 3 out of 10 after some thought i was going to give it a straight out 1 but it got a couple extra points for the body count but that would be about it let me explain i paid literally 1 for this dvd in a supermarket because i tend to have a lot of faith in bargain horror flicks , b movies especially but if this film was aiming for b status as i suspect it was for a number of reasons \( which i 'll touch on in a sec \) then it failed magnificently not only did it shoot for b and miss , it landed somewhere around f this film had so many opportunities to be good and it pretty much failed on all accounts i say above that it 's likely this film was aiming for b status and it seems to try and achieve this by trying to blend humour with horror , which can either be very good or very bad for example , later freddy films \( dream warriors onwards \) are all about freddy 's style and nose thumbing , which works out great ! but this film completely bombed in that respect because the times where they tried to inject humour were mostly just stupid i will admit though that towards the beginning of the film the humour was good in fact , for about half an hour i liked this film and was prepared to congratulate myself on another good find but what really killed this film for me was the inappropriate kills for instance , when ' satan ' smashes the cat against the board and writes ' boo ' with it 's blood using its body as a brush or when ' satan ' slams the door into the helpless disabled elderly woman now i 'm not usually too against senseless kills in films hey , that s the point , right \? but in those two cases i just found it grossly offensive and unnecessary to anything in the film plot especially for me , the film went downwards from then on one major bad point about this film is that i hated every character in it the kid , dougie was just ridiculously annoying ! ! ! i 'm at a loss to explain how he could possibly write off all those bodies and people being killed in front of his eyes as a trick ! i mean , come on ! ! ! i completely understand that to be in a horror film a character does have to be somewhat stupid , like running upstairs when you should blatantly be running out of the house screaming for help , but this kid took the biscuit ! i wanted to kill him myself by the end of it ! it was completely unbelievable and if i had to hear him say ' duh ! ' one more time i was going to bang my head against a wall because that s what watching this film felt like why did n't i just turn the film off \? mainly because i honestly believe an ending can sometimes redeem a film but i was wrong in this case the ending did not redeem this film , it further irritated the hell out of me and was inadequate to the plot line i get it already ! the killer is always going to come back dressed as someone else , be welcomed into the house by the stupid kid and go on a killing spree again because no one suspects him in that costume ! i get it ! this film made me physically angry because it was so stupid ! and if by some foul mistake you do end up watching this film , watch out for the intestines frankly , if that guy actually did have intestines that looked like that , i 'd be surprised he was n't already dead , let alone until someones rips them out and ties them to a chair br br in fact , i 'll even go so far as to say that the only character i liked at all in this film was actually the killer purely because when his ' comedy routine ' worked , it did work all in all , the plot line of this film dragged anything that might have been good down why was the killer killing \? i do n't know i can live without knowing who he actually was , that s fairly typical , but without some kind of motive hell i do n't know , i 'd settle for him having a bad halloween as a kid ! it just seems more than senseless , just stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid in fact , i hated this film so much that i specifically registered with imdb just so i could comment on it save your money , save your sanity stay away from it !

' one more longer i was go to banging my heads against a walls though that s what watched this movie feeling like why knew n't i just turning the movie off \? mostly though i frankly believing an ends can occasionally redeemed a movie but i was erroneous in this cases the end knew not redeemed this movie , it thereby annoyed the freaking out of me and was unfit to the subplot lines i sure it already ! the murderers is perpetually go to coming back dress as somebody else , being welcoming into the houses by the ridiculous child and take on a innocents sprees again though no one suspect him in that costumes ! i got it ! this movie making me mentally furious though it was pretty asinine ! and if by these foul error you might ends up watched this movie , watching out for the intestines honestly , if that bloke really knew ha intestine that resembled that that , i 'd being astonished he was n't already dead , letting alone until somebodies ripping them out and tying them to a chairs br br in seem , i 'll even going pretty much as to said that the only characters i loved at all in this movie was really the murdering exclusively though when his ' comedies usual ' collaborated , it knew works all in all , the plots lines of this movie dragging anything that could ha been excelent down why was the maniac murdering \? i might n't know i can live without knew who he really was , that s relatively usual , but without these sort of motives dude i thing n't know , i 'd settle for him got a rotten halloween as a child ! it just seem more than thoughtless , just asinine ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous asinine in anything , i loathed this movie alright good that i concretely register with imdb just well i could comments on it saving your cash , saving your decency staying away from it !
