orig sent (0):	recently , i had opportunity to view a working print in kansas city \( olathe , ks \) of this title it is difficult for me , being a lover of the art as i am , to report the following , but , the truth sometimes hurts , and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe \( i 'm using the slang definition here worthless statements or writing \) for an hour and a half , i feel obligated to share \( warn \) any interested parties let 's begin at the beginning , a good place to start as always the first 15 minutes are not really that bad , a couple of laughs , and decent development , but then it is downhill from there this is the story of a woman , in her mid thirties , that \( as the writer would like for you to believe \) is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled the first major difficulty occurs when if you do n't know that fact going into the movie , you wo n't know it when she suddenly risks it all for , in my opinion , a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman there is little development \( drastically insufficient development \) to justify her actions for the affair she has , and when it occurs , one feels , as i did , that she is just of low moral character the word slut comes to mind , hopefully , they 'll let that pass the review and post the comment this , in my opinion , is the first fatal flaw of the film if you 're married or have ever been in love , irregardless of whether you are male or female , its going to turn you off quite frankly , i feel that it would have made a much better blue movie that 's the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving the second fatal flaw is the casting , diane lane just did n't work for me here , and viggo mortensen is not the right man for the job , believe me the only saving grace to the entire film is anna paquin , the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places , conveying a subtle yet very blunt \( i apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate \) portrayal of an emerging teen bravo , well done i 'm not going to give the ending away , but i was disappointed , being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing but an ending like that well , if that teased you enough to see this picture , do n't say i did n't warn you , but you better look fast if this celluloid is released , i doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames i 'd say wait for the video , but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value hmmm , dustin hoffman produced this , you think he 'd learn after ishtar this film once carried the working title blouse man and should have been left on the rack if you 've never in your life wanted to walk out on a film , give this one 35 40 minutes , the only thing worth staying for is anna paquin , if you can stomach the fact that you 'll find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home , which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if you 're off to the movies to see this one that 's my two cents , for what it is worth

it 's not very deep or difficult yes , he becomes a brute while erika becomes a victim one moment he 's locking maman in her room and slapping erika , the next he 's kicking her in the face , having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love br br am i being unfair in this summary \? watch the film if you want , but i 'd advise you not to br br anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they 're in the right mood i could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if i wanted but i ' prefer not to ' , because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing br br i'm supposed to say that parentally repressed erika longs for love , ineffectively seeks it in pornography , inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears , pink and throbbing , under her nose , belatedly realises that she does n't like being hurt , blah , blah , blah br br the world has , for reasons not explained , stunted her she apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist , because that 's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise br br at the end , if you have the patience to be there , there 's a small twist before going to the final scene , where she 's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear soiling student with the lacerated hands , erika packs a knife in her handbag for walter \? br br yes , you 're ahead of me she stabs herself in a none life threatening area and leaves roll credits br br if this earned the second prize at cannes , just how bad were the rest of the entries \?
