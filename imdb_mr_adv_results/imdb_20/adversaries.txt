romps with a hinting of supernatural horror will be amused , and of course the vicarious sex criminals amongst us will enjoy choking their chickens to the goat barn scene but the ultimate conclusion of the film is silly , pretentious , intelligence insulting , and probably perfect for such an otherwise forgettable exercise in applied sleaze br br 2 10 without the goat barn this movie just is n't

adv sent (1):	unfortunately i have to agree with the critic written by halopes br br for a short film the cinematography , costumes , sets , sound , editing and everything else is very , very good this might seem surprising at first but i was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals , so the quality is to be expected the issue , as usual , resides in the story itself br br thing is , it 's not really a story to tell a story \( or in cinema 's case , show a story \) you need plot and conflict you need things that happen to the protagonist events these events happen because the protagonist wants something and , for some reason , he ca n't get it tim watcher has no problems or goals he 's a kind of supernatural entity who observes mankind that 's it so what we have here is pure exposition instead of being shown a story , we 're simply learning things about this tim watcher individual of course , considering the peculiar nature of tim watcher and the film 's short duration , it 's hard to give enough background about him so the movie resorts to voice over narration in this case it 's used in the worst possible sense which is to give information that otherwise we 'd never glean in fact , if it was n't for the vo we 'd think the character was just a kooky old man going around looking at things to make it worse the vo also explains what 's happening on the screen ! the images we 're shown are just decoration for the text we 're listening to br br i could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something , but because the images do n't stand on their own it 's impossible to say that what 's left obviously has value as a measure of the crew 's technical capabilities \( not incredible , but good \) but fails to entertain , amuse , thrill or , at the very least , show a story

orig sent (0):	as far as i can understand , tiw watcher is the first work of a young director my doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student , since there is a reference to oporto school of arts in the final credits br br nevertheless , director ricardo pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema what is a movie \? how to tell a story \? it does n't matter , for the novice director one of the first things you learn in school when you 're studying cinema is how to tell a story you learn that , just like in novels , in movies you should also construct your story in three acts the introduction , the development and the conclusion you learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax you learn this is valid for a 3 hour epic , for the regular movie , for a short film and even , believe it or not , for a 30 second commercial you also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that , ultimately , you can even deconstruct it br br in rough terms , tim watcher introduces us its main character and then , the movie ends the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in jeunet 's am lie there are no second or third acts in tim watcher this is not a parody or an art film , thus you ca n't even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure you are expecting to be told a story , and it does n't happen worst than that , tim watcher defines itself as a warning and one with no real purpose it does n't make a point , or at least , not a valid one its point is childish , with a sense of vengeance the situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is manichaean br br i was expecting a lot more from this short the movie opens with a rather good looking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular portuguese short film i do n't know the budget for this movie , but judging for the thanks list in the end credits , merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where 's difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakers br br tim watcher seems to be an exercise in style , color and carefully chosen plans , combined with a fine score that 's all there 's nothing else there 's no plot and that 's a shame because it feels like a waste of production values hardly , you can see in the regular portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a story br br as absurd as the comparison may sound , i must refer the bmw shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and over the top stylish cinematography

! ' you seem awfully familiar ' br br what is the purpose of that wholly unnecessary , somewhat gratuitous scene with soid and the artificially enhanced bartender \? character development \? tch too little , too late br br speaking of unnecessary traits that never went anywhere , detective lightning 's saying skeptical detective bright must be a scorpio shows how little he really knows about the occult and i do n't think that believing in fate quite qualifies as voodoo mumbo jumbo br br at the end , when bright holds pablo as he dies wait , why does she care now \? her character is as inconsistent as soid 's what , she has to shoot him just because she said ' stop , or i 'll shoot ' \? \( she 's cared so much about her integrity thus far \) he was unarmed there was no need for lethal force what 's wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him \? br br finally , cristina 's childlike acceptance of her mother 's death giving dr knight peace over his daughter 's death so forced and the contrivance of the family whose child was killed becoming cristina 's new family it angers me that she could be a ' replacement ' for their little girl it 's also unrealistic that a white couple would take in the latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter i 'm not saying there are n't generous , loving people who would do that i 'm just saying that the characters here are never developed far enough for me to believe that they would do that br br i find it offensive that another imdb reviewer said that of course as a woman she was moved by the sappy scenes i am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that do n't wax sentimental in a manufactured manner br br co writer , co director , co star nebot said himself he wore too many hats during this production too many cooks may spoil the broth , but one cook alone just might end up making an after school special br br in conclusion , this film 's title has less to do with the story and more to do with the feeling of regret , helplessness , and loss accompanying the revelation that you will never see your money again
