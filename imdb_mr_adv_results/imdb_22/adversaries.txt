orig sent (0):	okay , so i 'm not a big video game buff , but was the game house of the dead really famous enough to make a movie from \? sure , they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie , as though justifying any particular scene of violence , but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same , with the hand in the bottom on the screen , supposedly your own , holding whatever weapon and goo ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be br br it 's an interesting premise in house of the dead , with a lot of college kids \( loaded college kids , as it were , kids who are able to pay some fisherman something like 1 , 500 just for a ride after they miss their boat \) trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year the first thing that comes to mind about house of the dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations at least in this case , the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed they look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little halter tops , but at least they thought they were dressed for the occasion br br clint howard , tellingly the most interesting character in the film by far , delivers an absolutely awful performance , the greatness of which overshadows every other actor in the movie i ca n't stand it when well known actors change their accents in movies , it is so rarely effective , and howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well known actor pretend that he 's this hardened fisherman with a raspy voice from years of breathing salty air he did n't even rasp well it sounded like he was eating a cinnamon roll before shooting and accidentally inhaled some powdered sugar or something real tough there , clint ! i expected more from him , but then again , he did agree to a part in this mess br br once we get to the island , the movie temporarily turns into any one of the friday the 13th movies that took place at camp crystal lake lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed the nudity was impressive , i guess , but let 's consider something for a minute these kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the rave of the year , find no one , and say , well , who wants a beer ! even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his wallet to get them all over there did n't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single solitary person in sight here you have the input from director uwe boll there 's alcohol ! they wo n't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves ! br br so not only do they start drinking , not minding the fact that the whole party seems to have vacated the island , but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is \( dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along \) , the guy and the girl who stay behind to get smashed decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a quickie now that they 're alone it 's like they expected to find the island empty , and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while , they would have some privacy since there 's no one else around brilliant ! br br now for the things that everyone hated , judging by the reviews that i 've read about the movie yes , intersplicing shots from the video game into the movie , mostly in order to show that , yes , the movie was being faithful to directly copying the video game sure , it was a stupid idea i ca n't imagine who thought up that little nugget , but worse than that is the matrix style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over after the first time \( at which point i found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original \) it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film br br one of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans , who are much faster but getting tired , running out of places to run , and with a terrifying shortage of things with which to fight the zombies off with the first two are done right in the movie , the kids are terrified and do n't have a lot of places to run since they 're on an island , but since they caught a ride over with a smuggler , they find themselves heavily armed and i mean that very strongly i mean , these people have everything from machine guns to hand grenades , which removes most of the tension of the impending walking dead br br then you have what i call the techno slasher scene since the rave never happened , and i guess since uwe boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any techno music in the movie , there 's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead , and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video there 's techno music blasting as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it 's nothing but a blur of gory shot , mostly only about 5 frames long \( which is about 1 6 of a second \) flashing across the screen in time with the speed techno music clever , i guess , but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely removes any sense of scariness or tension of even the gross out effect because you ca n't see any one thing for long enough to react to it you 're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie br br i 've seen a lot of people compare this movie to resident evil , mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it , and they 're exactly right i appreciate that at least here , as was not the case in resident evil , it was n't some man made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to infect other people , changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires 28 days later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie , it 's just too bad that house of the dead did n't do a single original thing , except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based , just in case you forget i really think that this should have been a much better movie while obviously i ca n't say that i know much about the game it 's based on , just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie , but unfortunately i think that 's more often the case than not with horror movies it 's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no holds barred horror film , and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot , which suggests the possibility of a sequel
adv sent (1):	okay , so i 'm not a big video game buff , but was the game house of the dead really famous enough to make a flick from \? sure , they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the film , as if objection any particular scene of violence , but there are dozens and dozens of games that see exactly the same , with the handed in the bottom on the screen , supposedly your own , holding whatever weapon and goo ing all kinds of alien or walking dead or snipers or whatever the case may be br br it 's an interesting premise in house of the dead , with a lots of university kid \( load university kid , as it were , kid who are good to pays these fisherman something like 1 , 500 just for a rides after they gotta their boats \) attempting to got out to this islands for what is presumed to being the raves of the year the first sort that is to thought about house of the dead after watched it is that it ha becoming fundamentally consistent that moderne horrors films might becoming nothing more than an exercising in come up with inventive essentials to got a ones of scantily scantily teens into precisely the same circumstances at least in this cases , the seem that they were on their ways to a raves justification the manner the girl are attired they seem sorely out of placing run around the forest in adorable small strapless topped , but at least they think they were dress for the occasions br br johnny johnson , tellingly the most intriguing characteristic in the movie by obviously , offers an totally dreadful performance , the glory of which overshadow each other actors in the film i wo n't standing it when quite including actresses changes their accent in films , it is well seldom effective , and stuart here illustrates that it is similarly flat to ha an quite renowned actors pretending that he 's this tighten angler with a throaty voices from month of respiratory saline flight he figured n't even rasp quite it sounding that he was ate a clove rolling before shoot and accidently inhalation these mixed sugared or something actual arduous there , clint !

even the bro who slipping that stacked of thousands out of his wallets to got them all over there did n't thought anything of it that they uncover a full bars and not a sole solitary persons in sense here you ha the inputs from directors uwe boll there 's alcoholism ! they ca n't checked that the parties they had for comprises of no one but themselves ! br br well not only might they starting drink , not puttering the seem that the whole parties seem to ha vacate the islands , but when one of the girl disappears off into the mysterious forest to unearth out where everyone is \( slip one other girls and one of the dudes reluctantly along \) , the bloke and the lady who staying behind to got blasted decided that it would being a awesome convinced to stripping down for a quickie now that they 're alone it 's that they anticipated to explore the islands empty , and now that they resting of the persons that they had over with were gone for a small while , they would ha those privacy until there 's no one else around superb ! br br now for the stuff that everyone loathed , judged by the review that i 've reading about the film yes , intersplicing shot from the footage games into the film , mostly in ruling to exhibit that , yeah , the film was being loyal to automatically duplication the video games personally , it was a asinine ideas i wo n't imagining who think up that tiniest nugget , but worst than that is the matrix styling bullets done scene that were threw in over and over and over and over after the first times \( at which presume i findings it egotistic and corny for a film that this to ha a shots like that as because it was something copied \) it is discernible more for the techniques of the shots itself perhaps than any spectacular mean or groundwork of any sort of tensions for the movie br br one of the thing that making a zombies movie horrendous and got you on the slice of your seat is to be them gradually but tirelessly come after the resides humans , who are good quickly but getting weary , run out of vicinity to running , and with a frightening scarcity of thing with which to fights the zombie off with the first three are doing right in the film , the teenaged are frightened and dont n't be a ones of areas to running until they 're on an islands , but until they did a rides over with a smuggling , they unearth themselves largely weapons and i meaning that quite powerfully i meaning , these persons might everything from machines gun to hands grenade , which removing most of the tensions of the forthcoming walk dead br br then you ha what i calling the electronica slasher scenes until the raves never transpired , and i guessing until uwe boll think persons were go to being dissatisfied at not heard any electronica songs in the film , there 's one scenes right in the mid where all the beings are combat off the resides dead , and stunningly enough it turn into something of a songs footage there 's electronica songs blast as the shot are edit once readily and simpler until it 's nothing but a blurring of gore shots , mostly only about 5 frame when \( which is about 1 6 of a straight \) flashes across the screens in done with the speeds electronica songs cleverer , i guessing , but it ha no placing in a horrors film though it naturally removing any sensing of scariness or tensions of even the gross out effects though you wo n't seen any one something for because enough to reacts to it you 're just watched these shot flies across the screens and guess what the dude the directors was thought when he decide that it would being a exemplary ideas to putting something that this in the film br br i 've seeing a ones of persons comparison this film to resident evil , mostly claims that it copy the premise of it , and they 're precisely right i appreciative that at least here , as was not the example in resident evil , it was n't these men making viruses that went persons into walk funeral that were good to infected other persons , change them the manner werewolves turning others into werewolves 28 weeks earlier was also evidently an inspired for this film , it 's just too rotten that house of the dead did n't could a lone previous sort , except for the slightly asinine ideas of put in rapid shot of the video games on which it is based , just in case you forgot i truly thought that this ought ha been a really okay film while evidently i wo n't said that i know really about the game it 's relying on , just the titles and the film posters deserves a really nicer film , but regretfully i thought that 's more occasionally the cases than not with terrifying films it 's truly sort of sorrowful when a film is out that is well evidently advertises as a no held prohibited movie movie , and the scarier doubt in the whole film is the closes shots , which suggest the possibilities of a sequels

orig sent (0):	since i 'd seen the other three , i figured i might as well catch this made for tv fourth part of the omen series as a stand alone film , this movie is mediocre but as a sequel to the 1976 masterpiece it 's a travesty the film goes along the same route that many series ' go down when they 're running out of ideas that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female it 's always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard , the plot lacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum the film does keep a thread with the original , which i wo n't reveal as despite being obvious that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie the basics of the plot largely copy richard donner 's original , and see a young couple adopt a child , which they name delia \( not damiella or damiana , fortunately \) there 's a big dog involved , and a child minder and pretty soon , the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal as she 's menstruating at eight years old , and never suffered from any illnesses br br the first two sequels to the omen were n't bad at all , and the series really should have ended at number three i guess there was money involved somewhere down the line , as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made it brings nothing to the table in terms of originality , and the only thing it 's likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series the film looks and feels like a tv movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl indeed , asia vieira does look like a little bitch but she never convinces that she 's the antichrist , as her stares are redundant and most of the ' evil ' she does is laughable faye grant is given the meatiest role , and does n't impress while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time the only good thing about this movie is the theme tune , which of course has been ripped off from the original and is overused on the whole , this film really is n't worth seeing as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for , and does n't even do justice to weaker second sequel

orig sent (0):	not totally off the wall in a good way , but just totally stupid killer tongue is an uneasy mixture of sci fi , horror , and supposed comedy what this equates to is a mindless and totally incoherent film there is very little dialog , mainly due to the fact that the script , if there was one , is complete pond scum i would n't even call it strange , more like just total nonsense this movie is certain to disappoint , and you have been warned there is absolutely no reason to waste time on this , and if you do , the pungent smell will linger like rotten fish merk
