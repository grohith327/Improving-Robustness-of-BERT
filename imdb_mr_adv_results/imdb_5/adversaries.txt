orig sent (1):	this is a extremely well made film the acting , script and camera work are all first rate the music is good , too , though it is mostly early in the film , when things are still relatively cheery there are no really superstars in the cast , though several faces will be familiar the entire cast does an excellent job with the script br br but it is hard to watch , because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented it is now fashionable to blame the british for setting hindus and muslims against each other , and then cruelly separating them into two countries there is some merit in this view , but it 's also true that no one forced hindus and muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition it seems more likely that the british simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends br br the result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen but it is never painted as a black and white case there is baseness and nobility on both sides , and also the hope for change in the younger generation br br there is redemption of a sort , in the end , when puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life , but also truly loved her , and her family which has disowned her , then later come looking for her but by that point , she has no option that is without great pain for her br br this film carries the message that both muslims and hindus have their grave faults , and also that both can be dignified and caring people the reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching , since there can never be real reconciliation across the india pakistan border in that sense , it is similar to mr mrs iyer br br in the end , we were glad to have seen the film , even though the resolution was heartbreaking if the uk and us could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness , they would certainly be better off

orig sent (1):	the premise of the story is simple an old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child , and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred though very little dialog is provided throughout the film , the visual narrative told by the camera 's eye alone made the film quite engaging the setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness , which complements the quietness of the characters themselves we can also sense helplessness in the old man 's inability to convince the police of the murder , which parallels the silenced child 's inability to tell her own story br br true horror lies in feelings of hopelessness , helplessness , and irrationality this film successfully addresses these elements by visuals alone , rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weak br br cleverly , the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a few creepy and startling moments the ending is also unexpected and believable reminiscent of japanese horror films , such as the ring , and dark water , or english horror films , such as lady in black , and the innocents , this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror i recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare to give this film a try br br by the way , if you have n't seen the films i just mentioned above , you might want to give them a try as well

orig sent (1):	the year 1995 , when so many people talked about the great premiere of braveheart by mel gibson , also saw another very fine , yet underrated movie on scottish history , rob roy although it is a very different film , especially due to the historical period the story is set in , rob roy has much in common not only with marvelous braveheart but also with the very spirit of epic movies br br it is a film that discusses similar themes , like fight for dignity , courage , honor , revenge , family being a key to happiness it also leads us to the very bliss of scottish highlands where the human soul finds its rest being surrounded by all grandeur of nature robert roy macgregor \( liam neeson \) , the main character is a true hero \( so universal in epics \) , sort of scottish robin hood who struggles to lead his people out of oppression imposed by cold hearted lords although he worsens his situation through the acts , has to suffer a lot , two things stay in his mind undeniably honor that he is given by himself and love to his woman , mary macgregor \( jessica lange \) that leads him to unexpected events br br except for the interesting content and quite vivid action , the movie is filled with truly stunning visuals this factor has to do both with the sets and locations of the film as well as the wardrobe many memorable moments stay in the mind of any viewer who can allow themselves an insight into artistic images for me , the most splendid scene was in the highlands when rob roy tells his boys what honor really means then , he sends them away and beautifully makes love to his woman the scene he escapes marguis of montrose \( john hurt \) to the waterfall is also worth a look as a stunning visual br br of course , there is some graphic violence , like in the duel for instance , but i do n't think that this violence would be as harmful as in many other modern films its justification is like any other epic 's bloodshed and cruelty of those times were really serious and there would be no point in hiding it the most disturbing scene , for me , was the rape done on rob roy 's wife by the villain of the story archibald cunningham \( tim roth \) it 's truly disgusting and kids should definitely stay away however , all the rest is o k yet , there is one aspect that made me really love this movie , the performances br br all the cast do perfect jobs , from the leading lian neeson who fits very well to the role of tall , brave , strong scottish man to the supporting cast of brian cox who portrays wicked killearn , a silent witness of terrible acts who feels comfortable with the evil of war jessica lange is very fine as mary macgregor and has some of the most beautiful moments in the film there is chemistry between ms lange and mr neeson in many of their scenes john hurt , one of the best british actors , does a terrific job as marguis of montrose , a corrupted man for whom money is the aim in itself achieved by any means i like that calmness of his portrayal but the real villain is played by tim roth who truly depicts wretched side of his character , archibald a man who mocks love , who loves war and who finds true lust in rape and slaughter but , like in any good epic , this exceptional evil must find its end br br and one more aspect the musical score such memorable and sentimental tunes that are bound to sound in the ears for long the final moment touched me to tears not only because of the beauty it conveys but because i deeply combined these blissful tunes with the grandeur of locations scotland remains in the heart of its visitor and this movie reminded me of that permanent effect it was , as if , my second journey to scotland br br rob roy is a very nice movie , very well directed , photographed and acted it perhaps does not equal braveheart with its spectacular sets and crowds of extras in battle scenes , but it is a fairly long film with much attention placed on one very significant feature a cinema should have stunning entertainment combined with heartfelt education i really enjoyed that film , do not hesitate to call it metaphorically highlands of entertainment and rate it 9 10

orig sent (1):	perhaps the most personal of david lynch 's works is his most accessible this time , rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares , lynch provides a reflective , fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both the simple true story of an iowa farmer \( richard farnsworth \) who rides a lawn mower to wisconsin to visit his estranged , stricken brother , there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes \( some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland , filmed by veteran cinematographer freddy francis \) to make it an undeniable lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet personable way , allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life , and sissy spacek turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet observant daughter \( whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by john roach and mary sweeney \) but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers indelible performances , one of the most notable being barbara robertson , whose accidental killing of a deer is both uproarious and sad at the same time but that 's vintage lynch with his ability to engage and unsettle you at his best to those unfamiliar with lynch or know him only by his violent , disturbing reputation , this is an excellent place to begin for those who know his work , this is one of the finest in his repertoire
