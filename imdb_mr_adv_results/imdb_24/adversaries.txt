this is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies , any attempt to do something clever or different have n't worked br br the next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats they rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use however , the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when michael mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary there is a simple distinction to be made here mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style , roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures i think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant br br the best moment is reserved for robert 's comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film those who did n't like it are generalised as ' geeks ' and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that i must admit i was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film was n't singled out for ridicule the tirade goes further as the group joke about norwegian reviewers , complete with ' hilarious ' accents to imply that people from norway would n't know a good film simply because of where they are born as always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting , they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant br br the package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the sirens were cast robert 's swears blind in voice over , ' i did n't want to make a film that was like baywatch ' as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground there is also a simpering , self indulgent documentary about the making of darkhunters during which robert 's says that a reviewer has claimed that forest is the best british film in years i do n't know who he is trying to convince at one point in the commentary track robert 's says jokingly i can see people sitting at home saying this is n't amazing , its sh t he is n't wrong

orig sent (0):	after some internet surfing , i found the homefront series on dvd at ioffer com before anyone gets excited , the dvd set i received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their tv 15 years ago the resolution and quality are poor the images look like you would expect old re recorded video to look although the commercials were edited out , the ending credits of each episode still have voice over announcements for the segway into the abc news program nightline , complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990 's even with the poor image quality , the shows were watch able and the sound quality was fine br br to this show 's credit , the casting was nearly perfect everyone was believable and really looked the part their acting was also above average the role of jeff metcalf is played particularly well by kyle chandler \( most recently seen in the 2005 remake of king kong \) the period costumes were very authentic as were the sets , especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and d cor the direction was also creative and different for a tv show at that time for example , conversations between characters were sometimes inter cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes the dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations that takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case br br as i started watching this series again i suddenly remembered why i lost interest in it 15 years ago despite all the ingredients for a fine show , the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start for one thing , the name of the show itself is totally misleading when wwii ended in 1945 , there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a homefront either curiously , the first episode of the show homefront begins in 1945 after the war had ended that 's like shooting the first episode of gilligan 's island showing the castaways being rescued the whole premise of the show 's namesake is completely lost i still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no , the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948 additionally , this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940 's by the third episode , it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left wing political agenda the show is set in river run ohio , near toledo however , the show 's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like jackson mississippi than ohio part of the ensemble cast are dick williams , hattie winston and sterling macer jr who portray the davis family much of the series shows the davis family being discriminated against by the evil whites to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable the racism card has been played and over played by hollywood now for over 40 years we get it we 're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis the subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show , as it was for homefront the acting talents of williams , winston and macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical frightened angry black family the wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in ohio was a kkk member or something the racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing , and leave it at that devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid br br in yet another ridiculous plot line , the big boss of a local factory \( ken jenkins \) is portrayed as an ebenezer scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees the workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro communist propaganda message to the viewer br br personally , i think this series had great potential the writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories of course the loss of brothers , sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama the situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or uso personnel passing through their town during training or en route to europe or the pacific the possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless but no , the writers of homefront \( david assael and james grissom \) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots instead , they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left wing politics it would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage

impounded interests in it 15 thirty ago because all the ingredient for a fantastic shows , the plot and tale line are lackluster and infuriating right from the starting for one doubt , the naming of the showed itself is utterly bogus when wwii finished in 1945 , there was no more fight alright evidently there was no however a homefront either interestingly , the first episodes of the cannot homefront commences in 1945 after the wars ha finished that 's that shoot the first episodes of gilligan 's islands displaying the castaway being saved the whole premises of the showed 's named is utterly lost i actually holds on to glad with the possibilities of the rests of the series being a flashbacks but no , the whole showed going taking from 1946 through 1948 also , this series fail

for over 40 decades we got it we 're also exhausted of had our nostrils rubbing in it on a everyday fundamentals the subjected of racists is also divisive with viewer and it is the kissing of die for any shows , as it was for homefront the actors talent of jones , churchill and clomp were wasting in their role as the simplistic terrified furious black families the madly overkill racists in this series making it wonder that everyone in indiana was a klan members or something the racists issuing could ha been concerns in this showed in a sole episodes with a sensible punching in the noses or asshole fights in which a homophobe got a need merited thrashed , and leaving it at that devote a momentous portions of the series to the racists sort got truly ancient truly rapid and its just valleys ridiculous br br in yet another laughable plots lines , the immense bosses of a local factories \( kent davis \) is depicted as an ebenezer grinch that nature who is against pension and

guests star as military or uso employee passes through their towns during instructors or de road to germany or the pacific the possibility for excelent tale line and plot are impenetrable but no , the

career br br the 109 minute ' dillinger ' epic for aip 's scope follows the quest of fbi midwest chief melvin purvis , played by academy award winner ben johnson purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four fbi agents killed in a 1933 kansas city ambush that helped gangster frank nash to escape justice at large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout , including expert bankrobber john dillinger \( warren oates \) , pretty boy floyd \( steve kanaly \) , and psychopath baby face nelson \( richard dreyfuss \) dillinger eventually joined forces with floyd and nelson , taking along homer van meter \( harry dean stanton \) and harry pierpont \( geoffrey lewis \) he also hooked up with billie frechette \( michelle phillips \) , a prostitute of french and indian extraction while taking place over several months in 1933 4 , ' dillinger ' is basically a chase film , with purvis 's entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by j edgar hoover br br 'dillinger ' has a documentary feel , listing dates and places while johnson supplies loose narrative as purvis milius keeps an honest depression look , using authentic fashion , cars , weapons , and buildings he also sprinkles around black and white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts the film is never boring , moving at a quick , if haphazard , pace the action scenes are dillinger 's strongpoint , edited competently by fred feitshans jr in his last professional effort thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film , not to mention pounds of explosives this film is certainly not for the squeamish , with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place the violence , while gratuitous , brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on american life br br this film never transcends its exploitation status , however , because the needed writing just is n't there john milius , somewhat overrated as a filmmaker , places way too much emphasis on action the action scenes \( mostly blood filled shootouts \) are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era , including 1967 's ' bonnie and clyde ' but we simply do n't get to know much about dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between dillinger and frechette is barely touched upon , with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward melvin purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline , becoming a prominent figure only when milius needs to keep the film from unraveling all too often , the film takes on a shoot 'em up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail br br aside from this , the picture 's main crime is ignorance of historical fact while many say that ' dillinger ' is just a film , it 's films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that john dillinger was not the last of his ring to die , as milius 's screenplay and the film 's documentary style encourage us to believe in fact , dillinger died before baby face nelson and homer van meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death , nor did he have billie frechette in tow while these inaccuracies might make for high drama , there is no reason why milius could n't have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them br br warren oates 's performance as dillinger is quite good , although he sometimes looks unconvincing oates is humorous and nicely portrays how dillinger became consumed by his larger than life image in the american press however , we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime ben johnson gives some life to purvis , suave but rather flat michelle phillips brings emotion to the billie frechette character and it 's really too bad that milius 's screenplay did n't flesh out her relationship with dillinger we never learn what drew her to a cold blooded killer , other than the stereotype of an easy going girl who is attracted to men of danger the supporting roles with kanaly , dreyfuss , stanton , lewis , and a briefly appearing cloris leachman , are acceptable for such talent br br as a piece of 1970s exploitation , ' dillinger ' appears doomed to retail bargain bins , which is exactly where i picked up mgm 's dvd release for 4 99 the film is nicely presented in widescreen \( a must for drive in flicks \) with subtitles in french and spanish dillinger 's theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive in enthusiasts , the film does n't really call for much else in way of supplementary material for fans of

orig sent (0):	and i repeat , please do not see this movie ! this is more than a review this is a warning this sets the record for the worst , most effortless comedy ever made at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays , the gags are crude and flat , but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos everyone thinks they can do comedy , and only 10 percent of them are right comedy is hard ! this is not some genre any fool can play around with i think it 's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to kentucky fried movie basically , these bozos are comparing their so called comic talents to those of the brilliant jim abrahams and the zucker brothers come on , i 've seen pauly shore movies that are 10 times funnier than the underground comedy movie here 's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named d kman the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen that 's it that 's the whole joke wow this is enough to make carrot top roll his eyes another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie and in another sketch , there 's a bag lady beauty contest , in which we 're exposed to the horrible sights of bikini clad middle aged women with beer guts and stretch marks plus , making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny it 's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped the whole movie is supposed to be a satire i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire is truth ! ! ! for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap , explain to me what is truthful about any of these gags ! some of the sketches might 've sounded funny on paper , but anybody who 's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper , it probably wo n't be funny on screen if i tell someone about a big , black , muscular gay virgin , who 's saving himself for the right man , he or she would probably laugh but watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag i hate how whenever people criticize a low brow comedy like this for not being funny , they 're regarded as stuck up squares i just saw white chicks recently that 's another low brow , politically incorrect comedy , but i laughed my head off the most offensive thing about the underground comedy movie is it 's not funny ! what the writers and directors do n't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless does n't work there has to be more ! just think of the famous scene from there 's something about mary \( ironically , enough the bozo filmmakers put the farrellys on their special thanks list \) the joke about the semen was n't just funny because it involved bodily fluids there was a buildup ben stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he did n't go out on a date with a loaded gun then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released a knock is on the door , and he has to answer it his date , mary , is at the door and that 's when it 's revealed that the semen is hanging off ben 's ear in this movie , there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people , with no buildup whatsoever as jay leno always says , this comedy thing 's not so easy , is it \? keep that in mind , vince offer , 'cause you were n't cut out for this genre ! ! the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip let 's face it , nowadays it 's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect i know comedy is subjective but this movie should n't be funny to anybody , except maybe the filmmakers themselves as a side note , the movie had to have been made before michael clarke duncan 's fame in movies like armageddon and the green mile there ca n't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show all the others in the cast are either non actors , has been actors or b movie stars karen black made a good impression in five easy pieces , but i do n't think she 's done anything of value ever since slash was probably drugged into being in this film gina lee nolin is nothing without baywatch angelyne is the film 's biggest star \( keeping in mind duncan was n't famous at the time \) , and there are still probably a ton of people who have n't heard of her for good reason usually , i 'm in support of extremely low budget flicks , but this one deserves to drift into obscurity i hope to lord this does n't become a cult classic ! should n't there be a law against distributing crap like this \?
