orig sent (0):	fantastic mr fox is a comedy based on the classic roald dahl book wes anderson directs , and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film while i respect what anderson , an incredibly talented man did , the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man , and if this happened to be a bad film , it would be his first bad film just like when you go to school and have your first bad day , this is anderson 's first bad day in film making , so i am going to let him off easy i will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it , and the animation is nice , but the film gets progressively harder to get into , leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening the characters are good , also jason schwartzman voices mr fox \( george clooney \) 's smart ass son , ash , and especially engaging the film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness , but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along i 'm sure wes anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film , but for now , i 'm sorry , wes anderson , this film of yours was a big disappointment
