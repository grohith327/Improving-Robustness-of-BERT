orig sent (1):	i have n't yet read the kurt vonnegut book this was adapted from , but i am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen overall , i think this is a very successful adaptation of one of vonnegut 's novels it concerns the story of an american living in germany who is recruited as a spy for the us his job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked nazi 's and send secret messages to the american 's via his weekly radio show but when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to new york , where various odd plot twists await br br if mother night has a problem it 's that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times but for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb and there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked nazi in a prison cell very much recommended

orig sent (1):	i first saw this movie back in the 1980 's and now in 2006 this movie still is one of the best movies i have ever seen ! i would recommend anyone to look at this movie you will not be sorry it is well acted out , so real and never a dull moment the acting is superb and the location makes the movie seem like you are there from the beginning right up to the end , this movie is the type that makes you lose your attention the actress does an excellent job of portraying the girl who survived this horrific plane crash in the amazon and it shows how she managed to survive in the amazon all alone it is unbelievable that anyone could survive under such conditions this is why this movie is so appealing the fact that this is a true story makes the movie even more interesting and to think that a young girl could survive from this ordeal is overwhelming i find this movie one that i can watch over and over again and one that i never get tired of this is indeed quite a compliment as i have hundreds of movies ! i would say this is probably my favorite movie and the best i have ever seen !

orig sent (1):	i have seen miracles still happen now at least four times i never tire of this fantastic movie from the very beginning , it holds a person 's interest as the movie progresses and the plane crashes the story becomes very intense as we watch this young girl trying to survive alone and frightened in the amazon , following a plane crash in which she was the only survivor losing her mother in this plane crash as well makes this movie even more dramatic as we see the perils this young girl had to endure during her ten days in the amazon to think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could actualy survive this is unspeakable as we see the wild animals , snakes and other reptiles , the enormous forests and wildlife as well as countless insects as the movie progresses we see the many dangers this girl has to face as she tries to follow the river in hopes of it leading her to a town remembering what her father told her about how a stream will always lead to a river and then into an even larger river and this means it will eventually lead to a community , this young girl keep track of the tiny stream which eventually lead into a huge river all throughout the movie at times having to swim in dangerous waters , alone , frightened , injured , she always managed to keep going towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her perils eventually as she sees a canoe , she realizes there has to be a village and men find her and they take care of her and then take her to a hospital where her father comes to see her , after fearing she was dead along with the many other passengers such a dramatic movie and so heartwarming to see her father 's face when he sees his daughter is actually still alive after all this time in the amazon ! movies like this are n't made much those days i will still see it again and i know i will never tire of it ! to think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable ! also the fact she only maintained a few very slight injuries was even more remarkable , whereas everyone else on this airplane perished in the horrific crash into the wilds of the amazon a brilliant movie , superbly acted out indeed and one i will treasure forever and love to continue watching ! strongly recommended by me for sure !

orig sent (1):	not a bad word to say about this film really i was n't initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people ca n't see past the fact that it was banned in some territories , mine being one of them the film delivers in the shock , gore and atmosphere department the score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus it only seems fair that chris young went on to be one of the best composers in the business the acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard , if a little wooden in some spots , and the effects are very real and gritty all of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book i 've noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killer 's p o v shot and i ask what 's wrong with that \? \? \? it is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killer 's identity a secret the only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twist \( killer revealed \) is not handled with more care , i mean it just happens kind of quickly , though the great performances make it just about credible aside from that pranks is a great movie \( though i prefer the original title \) and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap its more than that , but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early 80s slasher what a shame its a really good movie people ! believe me !

orig sent (1):	there is no doubt that during the decade of the 30s , the names of boris karloff and bela lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films after being universal 's first monster in the seminal classic , dracula , bela lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent \( sadly , this last factor would also led him to be type casted during the 40s \) in the same way , boris karloff 's performance in james whale 's frankenstein transformed him into the man to look for when one wanted a good monster of course , it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen , and the movie that united them was 1934 's the black cat this formula would be repeated in several films through the decade , and director lambert hillyer 's mix of horror and science fiction , the invisible ray , is another of those minor classics they did in those years br br in the invisible ray , dr janos rukh \( boris karloff \) is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planet 's past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of andromeda while showing his invention to his colleagues , dr felix benet \( bela lugosi \) and sir francis stevens \( walter kingsford \) , they discover that thousands of years ago , a meteor hit in what is now nigeria after this marvelous discovery , dr rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to africa , looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor this expedition wo n't be any beneficial for rukh , as during the expedition his wife diane \( frances drake \) will fall in love with ronald drake \( frank lawton \) , an expert hunter brought by the stevens to aid them in their expedition however , rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip , as he 'll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor br br written by john colton \( who previously did the script for werewolf of london \) , the invisible ray had its roots on an original sci fi story by howard higgin and douglas hodges given that this was a movie with karloff and lugosi , colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story , playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up one element that makes the invisible ray to stand out among other horror films of that era , is the way that colton plays with morality through the story that is , there are n't exactly heroes and villains in the classic style , but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices in many ways , the invisible ray is a modern tragedy about obsessions , guilt and revenge br br a seasoned director of low budget b movies , filmmaker lambert hillyer got the chance to make 3 films for universal pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles thanks to his experience working with limited resources , hillyer 's films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains , and the invisible ray was not an exception while nowhere near the stylish gothic atmosphere of previous universal horror films , hillyer 's movie effectively captures the essence of colton 's script , as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci fi finally , a word must be said about hillyer 's use of special effects for an extremely low budget film , they look a lot better than the ones in several a movies of the era br br as usual in a movie with lugosi and karloff , the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality as the film 's protagonist , boris karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes as his colleague , dr benet , bela luogis is simply a joy to watch , stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was as rukh 's wife , frances drake is extremely effective , truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress still , two of the movie highlights are the performances of kemble cooper as mother rukh , and beulah bondi as lady arabella , as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time , making unforgettable their supporting roles frank lawton is also good in his role , but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast br br if one judges this movie under today 's standards , it 's very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience however , that would be a mistake , as despite its low budget , it is remarkably well done for its time on the top of that , considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept , it 's ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are

adv sent (0):	there is no doubt that during the decade of the 30s , the names of boris karloff and bela lugosi became a sure guarantee of excellent performances in high quality horror films after being universal 's first monster in the seminal classic , dracula , bela lugosi became the quintessential horror villain thanks to his elegant style and his foreign accent \( sadly , this last factor would also led him to be type casted during the 40s \) in the same approach , boris karloff 's performance in james whale 's frankenstein changed him into the fella to look for when one wanted a good monster of course , it was only natural for these icons to end up sharing the screen , and the movie that united them was 1934 's the black cat this formula would be repeated in several films through the decade , and director lambert hillyer 's mix of horror and science fiction , the invisible ray , is another of those minor classics they did in those years br br in the invisible ray , dr janos rukh \( boris karloff \) is a brilliant scientist who has invented a device able to show scenes of our planet 's past captured in rays of light coming from the galaxy of andromeda while showing his invention to his colleagues , dr felix benet \( bela lugosi \) and sir francis stevens \( walter kingsford \) , they discover that thousands of years ago , a meteor hit in what is now nigeria after this marvelous discovery , dr rukh decides to join his colleagues in an expedition to africa , looking for the landing place of the mysterious meteor this expedition wo n't be any beneficial for rukh , as during the expedition his wife diane \( frances drake \) will fall in love with ronald drake \( frank lawton \) , an expert hunter brought by the stevens to aid them in their expedition however , rukh will lose more than his wife in that trip , as he 'll be forever changed after being exposed to the invisible ray of the meteor br br written by john colton \( who previously did the script for werewolf of london \) , the invisible ray had its roots on an original sci fi story by howard higgin and douglas hodges given that this was a movie with karloff and lugosi , colton puts a lot of emphasis on the horror side of his story , playing in a very effective way with the mad scientist archetype and adding a good dose of melodrama to spice things up one element that makes the invisible ray to stand out among other horror films of that era , is the way that colton plays with morality through the story that is , there are n't exactly heroes and villains in the classic style , but people who make decisions and later face the consequences of those choices in many ways , the invisible ray is a modern tragedy about obsessions , guilt and revenge br br a seasoned director of low budget b movies , filmmaker lambert hillyer got the chance to make 3 films for universal pictures when the legendary studio was facing serious financial troubles thanks to his experience working with limited resources , hillyer 's films were always very good looking despite the budgetary constrains , and the invisible ray was not an exception while nowhere near the stylish gothic atmosphere of previous universal horror films , hillyer 's movie effectively captures the essence of colton 's script , as he gives this movie a dark and morbid mood more in tone with pulp novels than with straightforward sci fi finally , a word must be said about hillyer 's use of special effects for an extremely low budget film , they look a lot better than the ones in several a movies of the era br br as usual in a movie with lugosi and karloff , the performances by this legends are of an extraordinary quality as the film 's protagonist , boris karloff is simply perfect in his portrayal of a man so blinded by the devotion to his work that fails to see the evil he unleashes as his colleague , dr benet , bela luogis is simply a joy to watch , stealing every scene he is in and showing what an underrated actor he was as rukh 's wife , frances drake is extremely effective , truly helping her character to become more than a damsel in distress still , two of the movie highlights are the performances of kemble cooper as mother rukh , and beulah bondi as lady arabella , as the two actresses make the most of their limited screen time , making unforgettable their supporting roles frank lawton is also good in his role , but nothing surprising when compared to the rest of the cast br br if one judges this movie under today 's standards , it 's very easy to dismiss it as another cheap science fiction film with bad special effects and carelessly jumbled pseudoscience however , that would be a mistake , as despite its low budget , it is remarkably well done for its time on the top of that , considering that the movie was made when the nuclear era was about to begin and radioactivity was still a relatively new concept , it 's ideas about the dangers of radioactivity are frighteningly accurate one final thing worthy to point out is the interesting way the script handles the relationships between characters , specially the friendship and rivalry that exists between the obsessive dr rukh and the cold dr benet , as this allows great scenes between the two iconic actors br br while nowhere near the gothic expressionism of the frankenstein movies , nor the elegant

orig sent (1):	i 'm a fan of both actors singers especially gackt and when i first discover this movie and watch the trailer , i just think this is a silly one after a long waiting time , i watched it at last and here 's my comment br br i consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it , instead of it my first applause goes to acting , generally that japanese movies has n't got brilliant and acting yet in moonchild 's all cast is simply wonderful and got into it , especially gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty well , i like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones , as for hyde part , his acting is good but he deliberately staying in background as an actor , respectively as his character do , throughout the movie i did n't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget , it still has brilliant moments , but the real jewel of the film is story it has some cheesy moments but it 's ok for me , and the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching at sometimes , on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visuals an interesting note aside , this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie interwiew with the vampire which is also played by the most beautiful \( not handsome , beautiful \) actors of american cinema , actually moon child is somehow can be seen as brother with interwiew , yet original on it 's own only problem that moonchild is it 's a bit slow sometimes , i'm a japanese movie fan and i used to that but it 's not change moonchild has some useless scenes or characters but all in all this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes , as for actors singers duo i hope to see their other movies in future , and i recommend this to everyone who likes vampire action sci fiction and romance films 8 10

orig sent (1):	william shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his play not only is it the best movie version of it , but it 's also the only complete version of hamlet kenneth branagh 's hamlet is simply genius not only because it was written by shakespeare , but also because it had the guts to do the whole thing , even if it went just over four hours br br we all know the story of the prince of denmark and his plot to avenge his father 's death , so i wo n't go into the details of the story i will , however , tell you that the best part of this hamlet version is not the breathtaking sets or the stunning photography , but the actors ' interpretations of each character i doubt you 'll find a better polonius than richard briers ' delicious portrayal plus , you ca n't go wrong with julie christie and jack lemmon also , derek jacobi , a regular among shakespeare adaptations is magnificent as the antagonist to hamlet br br of course , we must talk about kenneth branagh he wowed audiences when he came onto the scene with his first outing with shakespeare , henry v he outdoes himself with hamlet sure , olivier 's presence was captivating , but i think branagh 's performance is wonderful when you watch him on screen , it 's almost as if he knew exactly how shakespeare wanted the role to be played how he was n't nominated for an oscar is a total mystery at least the movie got a few nominations and even an odd choice for screenplay i guess they know good writing when they see it though br br all in all , you 'll never find a more rich and lavish production of the bard 's best play to say that the technical aspects were awesome would be an understatement if you love this play and are a fan of shakespeare , you definitely need to check this movie out even if you do n't really care for shakespeare , the visuals will keep you occupied for the duration of the film you may not think you 'll be able to sit through all of it at once , but you 'll soon find out that pausing this movie will make you want to see it even more

years of plying this particular trade have left him numb and detached , putting him in a mental state that has driven him to see a psychologist , dr josh parks \( john ritter \) and to make matters

about her his whole life , it seems , has become a ` situation' one from which he is seemingly unable to successfully extirpate himself without hurting the ones he loves he can deny his age and the fact that he has , indeed , slipped into a genuine midlife crisis , but he is about to discover that the problems he is facing are simply not going to go away on their own he 's at a crossroads , and he 's going to have to decide which way to go and he 's going to have to do it very soon br br from a concept that is intrinsically interesting , bromell has fashioned an engrossing character study that is insightful and incisive , and he presents it is a way that allows for moments of reflection that enable the audience to empathize and understand what alex is going through he makes it very clear that there are no simple answers , that in real life there is no easy way out his characters are well defined and very real people who represent the diversity found in life and , moreover , within any given family unit the film resoundingly implies that the sins of the father are irrefutably passed on to the progeny , with irrevocable consequences and effects when you 're growing up , you accept your personal environment as being that of the world at large and often it is years into adulthood that one may begin to realize and understand that there are actually moral parameters established by every individual who walks upon the planet , and that the ones set by the father may not be conducive to the tenets of the son and it is at that point that alex finds himself as the story unfolds ergo , the midlife crisis , or more specifically , the crisis of conscience from which he can not escape it 's a powerful message , succinctly and subtly conveyed by bromell , with the help of some outstanding performances from his actors br br for some time , william h macy has been one of the premiere character actors in the business , creating such diverse characters as quiz kid donnie smith in ` magnolia , ' the shoveler in ` mystery men ' and jerry lundegaard in ` fargo ' and that 's just a sampling of his many achievements at one point in this film , sarah mentions alex 's ` sad eyes , ' and it 's a very telling comment , as therein lies the strength of macy 's performance here , his ability to convey very real emotion in an understated , believable way that expresses all of the inner turmoil he is experiencing consider the scene in which he is lying awake in bed , staring off into the darkness in that one restless moment it is clear that he is grappling , not only with his immediate situation , but with everything in his life that has brought him , finally , to this point in that scene you find the sum total of a life of guilt , confusion and uncertainty , all of which have been successfully suppressed until now all the things that have always been at the core of alex 's life , only now gradually breaking through his defense mechanisms and finally surfacing , demanding confrontation and resolution it 's a complex character created and delivered by macy with an absolute precision that makes alex truly memorable it 's a character to whom anyone who has ever faced a situation of seemingly insurmountable odds will be able to relate it 's a terrific piece of work by one of the finest actors around br br sutherland is extremely effective , as well his michael is despicably sinister in a way that is so real it 's chilling it 's frightening , in fact , to consider that there are such people actually walking the earth this is not some pulp fiction or james bond type villain , but a true personification of evil , hiding behind an outward appearance that is so normal he could be the guy next door , which is what makes it all the more disconcerting and sutherland brings it all to life brilliantly , with a great performance br br neve campbell looks the part of sarah , but her performance \( as is the usual case with her \) seems somewhat pretentious , although her affected demeanor here just happens to fit the character and is actually a positive aspect of the film if only she would occasionally turn her energies inward , it would make a tremendous difference in the way she presents her characters ` panic , ' however , is one of her best efforts a powerful film that , in the end , is a journey well worth taking 9 10 br br

in the way the two leaders are played gregory peck dominates this film even more than george c scott dominated ` patton ' whereas scott had another major star , karl malden , playing opposite him as general bradley , none of the other actors in ` macarthur ' are household names , at least for their film work scott , of course , portrayed patton as aggressive and fiery tempered , a man who at times was at war with the rest of the human race , not just with the enemy i suspect that in real life general macarthur was as volcanic an individual as patton , but that is not how he appears in this film peck 's macarthur is of a more reflective , thoughtful bent , comparable to the liberal intellectuals he played in some of his other films at times , he even seems to be a man of the political left much of his speech on the occasion of the japanese surrender in 1945 could have been written by a paid up member of cnd , and his policies for reforming japanese society during the american occupation have a semi socialist air to them in an attempt to show something of macarthur 's gift for inspiring leadership , peck makes him a fine speaker , but his speeches always seem to owe more to the studied tricks of the practised rhetorician than to any fire in the heart it is as if atticus finch from ` to kill a mockingbird ' had put on a general 's uniform br br whereas scott attempted a ` warts and all ' portrait of patton , the criticism has been made that ` macarthur ' attempts to gloss over some of its subject 's less attractive qualities i think that this criticism is a fair one , particularly as far as the korean war is concerned the film gives the impression that macarthur was a brilliant general who dared stand up to interfering , militarily ignorant politicians who did not know how to fight the war and was sacked for his pains when victory was within his grasp many historians , of course , feel that truman was forced to sack macarthur because the latter 's conduct was becoming a risk to world peace , and had no choice but to accept a stalemate because stalin would not have allowed his chinese allies to be humiliated even during the korean scenes , peck 's macarthur comes across as more idealistic than his real life original probably was we see little of his rashness and naivety about political matters \( truman 's remark ` he knows as much about politics as a pig knows about sunday ' was said about eisenhower , but it could equally well have been applied to macarthur 's approach to international diplomacy \) perhaps the film 's attempt to paint out some of macarthur 's warts reflects the period in which it was made the late seventies , after the twin traumas of vietnam and watergate , was a difficult time for america , and a public looking for reassurance might have welcomed a reassuringly heroic depiction of a military figure from the previous generation another criticism i would make of the film is that it falls between two stools if it was intended to be a full biography of macarthur , something should have been shown of his early life , which is not covered at all \( the first we see of the general is when he is leading the american resistance to the japanese invasion of the philippines \) one theme that runs throughout the film is the influence of general macarthur 's father , himself a military hero i would have liked to see what sort of man arthur macarthur was , and just why his son considered him to be such a hero and role model another interesting way of making the film would have been to concentrate on korea and on macarthur 's clash with truman , with equal prominence given to the two men and with actors of similar stature playing them the way in which the film actually was made seemed to me to be less interesting than either of these alternative approaches br br it would be wrong , however , to give the impression that i disliked the film altogether although i may not have agreed with peck 's interpretation of the main role , there is no denying that he played it with his normal professionalism and seriousness the film as a whole is a good example of a solid , workmanlike biopic ,
