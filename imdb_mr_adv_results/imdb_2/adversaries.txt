orig sent (1):	my comments for vivah its a charming , idealistic love story starring shahid kapoor and amrita rao the film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom 's families sleeping on the floor , playing games together , their friendly banter and mutual respect vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals yes , the central romance is naively visualized but the sneaked in romantic moments between the to be married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism the film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom , on the wedding night , tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries come let me do your dressing br br v i v a h showcases a lot of good things beauty of arranged marriage , beauty of indian culture , beauty of indian woman , last but not least a nice idealism of the about to be couple waiting to get married playing by the rules ! simple yet beautiful such a simple story no plot no villain as is the case with most of sooraj barjatya films sooraj sir is back to what he does best he has made the movie with full conviction its a very sweet film which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout arranged marriage the union of 2 families i think amrita rao looks very good she has acted very well she has most of the good scenes although i thought the last half hour was completely to shahid kapur who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance i also liked the acting of all others for ex the choti i e amrita prakash , alok nath , anupam kher , shahid 's bro sis in law it almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after maine pyar kiya , hahk hum saath saath hain the chemistry between shahid amrita is awesome br br stuff like sanctity in a marriage relationship , avoiding courtship , mutual respect , care space , waiting for getting married officially , praying sacrficing for ur beloved all these and more get showcased in vivah there 's still some good audience who r going enjoying this film some of the folks audience are already excited after seeing , that they r thinking bout arranged marriage \) that s success if you ask me it seems amrita rao our actress from vivah result for a nice performance has been bestowed the prestigious dadsaheb phalke award for 2006 ! ! hats off to her for this achievement chalo , even though vivah , shahid or amrita did n't get any of the film fare other awards least this is news to cheer about ! ! congrats to amrita rao for showing us a visual of indian bride to be in the purest form and of course to sooraj barjatya for portraying her the best way \) shud n't forget shahid kapur and all others who make vivah as sweet and legendary as it is today ! ! imagine , to share the same pedestal as the legendary dilip kumar its no mean achievement ! ! congrats to amrita rao for taking her career to another level with this award i personally feel she should keep doing movies only with shahid kapur ! ! they make a cute couple and their on screen chemistry reminds me of srk kajol or aamir khan juhi chawla br br some points that i observed , few of the elements 1 if u notice carefully , amrita rao looks so good because she s always wearing traditional dresses she gives every bit of the indian woman essence in this film ! ! perfect fit 2 shahid kapur is like most of us not exactly ready for marriage or early marriage but prem listens carefully to the step wise talk given by his dad having full faith in anupam kher eventually honesty trust are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with amrita most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person but according to what i saw in this film , i have a feeling that two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also , its possible ! ! ! 3 in the entire movie there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where shahid amrita are together or shown to be together its unlike most other romantic wedding based movies where hero heroine are always singing dancing or nowadays doing cheap stuff but the beauty of each of these 5 sequences characterized by restraint , innocence respect for the other ! 4 i really liked the relationship shown between chacha alok nath amrita rao these kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters girl kids in some parts of india 5 romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely no cheap scenes , songs are beautifully pictured ! ! words like jal , praarthana e t c are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film \) personally , i really am fond of many dialogs in this film 6 last but not the least the entire hospital scene where shahid puts sindhoor to amrita when she s struggling for life is terrific those dialogs between the couple are so touching and u feel the love i cant do without u its a hats off feeling ! ! ! br br in many ways , vivah reminded me of maine pyar kiya , ddlj , qayamat se qayamat tak , hum dil de chuke sanam for the freshness on screen chemistry of the lead pair \) \) if u ask me along with films like rang de basanti , lage raho munnabhai , dor , corporate and kabul express , v i v a h ranks among the best films made in 2006 in fact i think vivah does deserve better viewing business than dhoom2 or fanaa or golmaal or all those time pass fuzzy style crap movies ! !

! they making a adorable pairs and their on screens sciences remind me of srk kajol or salman rukh chawla chitty br br these points that i observations , several of the element 1 if ur asked thoroughly , arora verma look alright advantageous though she s perpetually pants conventional gowns she provides each bite of the indonesian women heart in this movie ! ! perfected ideal 2 shaheed kapur is that most of we not precisely allready for marriages or earliest marriages but prem hears thoroughly to the stepping wiser chatter indicated by his cousins had full belief in anupam kher ultimately sincerity trusted are the keyword that he reflect in his first chatter with neha most persons would thought such a first meetings with a amounting stranger plus for a scant done is never enough to judges a persons but indicated to what i see in this movie , i ha a feel that three persons who are making for every other can connecting within a 1st meet also , its possible !

orig sent (1):	i have to say , from the beginning , when i watched the stargate movie movie i was n't blown away or anything it was like an average sci fi movie , with a lot of potential , though the movie was n't as , erm , amazing as other sci fi movies such as star wars or aliens , which if u are a sci fi fanatic u will admit one of those two titles are amazing , even though i 'm not as hardcore sci fi fan as some people , i do n't remember one line from either of those movies , i 'm not a big fan of wearing star wars t shirts , in fact if you saw me i would look like an average person to you , ah getting slightly off the point here , well my point is that the that you do n't have to be a hard core sci fi fan to like this great series , which unfortunately ended after 10 amazing seasons with no drop in its quality as it got nearer to its end , in 2006 br br though i did n't like the movie much i was quite looking forward to the first season in 1997 , and let me tell you , the special effects were only one of the brilliant things about the series , the chemistry between the characters just blew me away the special affects , were as good if not better than most sci fi shows running today i have to admit that i would never have gone into sci fi if it was n't for stargate , and my dad , who actually got me into sci fi when i was like 6 , and i 'm glad he did , other wise i would n't have seen the brilliant shows like sg1 , which now in my opinion sets the benchmark for nearly all sci fi series and movies , basically if a new sci fi series is n't better or as good as sg1 , its not worth watching basically this is the best sci fi show to date , and if you do n't watch this , then you have no idea what you are missing !

orig sent (1):	i think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for sharon stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy no one cared when the golden girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm , but to see someone post menopausal getting digitally pleased while driving i guess is just too much for some to handle let 's face it , she looks good , she 's light years hotter than my mother who 's the same age ! it 's not an oscar or a cult classic like the first , but ever since the turn of the century that 's all movie goers seem to expect a cinematic experience that will touch your soul as such , it never claims to be either it 's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling , and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate it 's the character of catherine trammell that helped give way for this sequel fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen br br the cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to britian for sure the score is amazing as well br br sure there 's some overacting from some characters but there 's some brilliant work from david morrissey who 's virtually unknown br br there 's a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop as well as the criminal decision of the mpaa to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guilty pleasure raunchiness that the story is known for br br at the very least it 's entertaining and fun to look at it , and that 's the movie 's only intentions so if you 've got beef with mizz stone , maybe you should actually see the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit \?
