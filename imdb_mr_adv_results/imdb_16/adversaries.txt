\) a few ok looking zombies is as gory as it gets for anyone hoping to see a gore fest the likes of which fulci regularly served up during the late 70 's early 80 's will be very disappointed , there are n't any decent feeding scenes , no intestines , no stand out ' head shots ' very little gore at all br br technically the film is poor , the special effects are cheap looking , the cinematography is dull , the music is terrible , the locations are bland it has rock bottom production values this was actually shot in the philippines to keep the cost down to a minimum the entire film is obviously dubbed , the acting still looks awful though the english version seems to have been written by someone who does n't understand the language that well br br zombi 3 is not a sequel to fulci 's classic zombie gore fest zombi 2 \( 1979 \) , it has nothing to do with it at all apart from the cash in title i 'm sorry but zombi 3 is an amateurish mess of a film , it 's boring , it makes no sense , it 's not funny enough to be entertaining it lacks any decent gore one to avoid
