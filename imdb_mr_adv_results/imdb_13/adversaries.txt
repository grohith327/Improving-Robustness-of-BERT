orig sent (1):	this has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an austen novel although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular pride and prejudice , emma is a lush and relatively faithful tv version of austen 's novel especially considering its short length the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one , as the unnecessary snobbishness that austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to emma 's character in the rest of the book i thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well picked kate beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in gwyneth paltrow 's ' 96 version samantha morton 's wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the harriet we know from the book mister knightly 's role is carried out extremely well in my opinion both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much neglected , sumptuous film

orig sent (1):	sigh i sincerely wonder why all the acclaimed and supposedly profound movie critics hold such a grudge against director michael winner \? surely he is n't the avatar of subtlety , as his films are practically always hard handed and confronting , but so what \? they 're awesomely entertaining his most famous action movies , like the first three entries in the death wish series for example , are easy targets to clobber down because they allegedly glorify violence and the personal use of shotguns , but even when winner takes on far more mature cinema genres like the religious horrors of the sentinel for example he does n't stand a chance with any of the critics the sentinel generated some controversy and infuriated several people upon its release , when it leaked that michael winner cast genuinely malformed and handicapped people to portray the creatures attempting to cross the gateways between hell and earth pretty much the exact same controversy caused todd 's browning 's masterpiece and landmark in horror cinema freaks to remain banned and unseen for over thirty years ! and why \? just because certain prudish and easily offended people , who should n't watch the movie in the first place , claim it 's an unethical thing to do \? i do n't suppose michael winner or todd browning held these people at gunpoint or forced them to appear in their films , so what gives us the right to feel embarrassed in their place \? another major reason why critics did n't warmly welcome the sentinel is because jeffrey konvitz ' novel and thus michael winner 's screenplay is hugely derivative of other contemporary but far more successful religiously themed horror stories and thus , according to the merciless pens of horror critics , little more than pure plagiarism admittedly the sentinel borrows multiple substantial elements from rosemary 's baby , the omen and the exorcist , but let 's face it , 70 's cinema largely thrives on stolen formulas and imitating success stories if you overlook the slightly unoriginal concept and , in all fairness , a handful of thoroughly confusing and unnecessary sub plots , the sentinel honestly still remains a uniquely atmospheric and often downright petrifying 70 's horror highlight with an impressive ensemble cast and nightmarish imagery you 're not likely to forget easy br br alison parker , a ravishing model with some unprocessed mental traumas , moves into a stunning brownstone apartment in brooklyn , deeply against the will of her boyfriend michael who proposed to we d her several times already alison 's physical existence and especially her mental condition drastically alter shortly after , and the ominous apartment appears to be the root of all misery she meets eccentric neighbors and attends birthday parties for their cats , even though the landlady claims she and a blind priest are the only tenants she frequently faints during her work assignments and has truly creepy visions of her bastard father and the night she attempted to commit suicide it slowly becomes clear that alison got chosen to serve a higher supernatural purpose inside this apartment building , but simultaneously malignant forces try and prevent this it 's truly regrettable how the promotional taglines and even brief synopsis on the back of the dvd immediately reveal that alison 's brownstone apartment is the earth 's gateway to hell itself and she 's the chosen one to guard it , because the film 's script only slowly builds up towards this shocking revelation for nearly 75 minutes \( and throughout some sadly tedious and overlong sequences \) michael winner successfully maintains the impression that alison 's own mind is playing tricks with her and that the involvement of the catholic church and her fianc e 's odd behavior are strictly red herrings multiple of the horrific scenes come pretty close to being genius , like alison 's flashback or her first acquaintance with the priest upstairs the whole climax , with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here above , is a literally perplexing showcase of pure terror and easily one of the most unforgettable and nail biting denouements i ever witnessed br br the cast michael winner managed to gather is deeply impressive , especially considering the sentinel still remains a legitimate horror movie and this genre is n't the most popular among prominent actors , but of course you also have to put the cast listing a little into perspective with such an extended cast , obviously several of the roles in the film are little more than cameos martin balsam and john carradine , for example , only appear on screen for a couple of minutes all together several others \( like christopher walken , jeff goldblum , beverly d'angelo and tom berenger \) perhaps add a lot of fame to the movie nowadays , but back when it was released they were still too unknown in order to attract curious viewers my personal pick for best performances go to burgess meredith as the uncanny neighbor and eli wallach as the satirical police inspector the relatively unknown cristina raines does an admirable job carrying the film and chris sarandon neatly back her up , even though he sports a ridiculous mustache in my humble opinion the sentinel is a marvelously entertaining and frightening horror movie , and most definitely a must see for true genre fanatics

another major reason why critics did n't warmly welcome the sentinel is because jeffrey konvitz ' novel and thus michael winner 's screenplay is hugely derivative of other contemporary but far more successful religiously themed horror stories and thus , according to the merciless pens of horror critics , little more than pure plagiarism admittedly the sentinel borrows multiple substantial elements from rosemary 's baby , the omen and the exorcist , but let 's face it , 70 's cinema largely thrives on stolen formulas and imitating success stories if you overlook the slightly unoriginal concept and , in all fairness , a handful of thoroughly confusing and unnecessary sub plots , the sentinel honestly still remains a uniquely atmospheric and often downright petrifying 70 's horror highlight with an impressive ensemble cast and nightmarish imagery you 're not likely to forget easy br br alison parker , a ravishing model with some unprocessed mental traumas , moves into a stunning brownstone apartment in brooklyn , deeply against the will of her boyfriend michael who proposed to we d her several times already alison 's physical existence and especially her mental condition drastically alter shortly after , and the ominous apartment appears to be the root of all misery she meets eccentric neighbors and attends birthday parties for their cats , even though the landlady claims she and a blind priest are the only tenants she frequently faints during her work assignments and has truly creepy visions of her bastard father and the night she attempted to commit suicide it slowly becomes clear that alison got chosen to serve a higher supernatural purpose inside this apartment building , but simultaneously malignant forces try and prevent this it 's truly regrettable how the promotional taglines and even brief synopsis on the back of the dvd immediately reveal that alison 's brownstone apartment is the earth 's gateway to hell itself and she 's the chosen one to guard it , because the film 's script only slowly builds up towards this shocking revelation for nearly 75 minutes \( and throughout some sadly tedious and overlong sequences \) michael winner successfully maintains the impression that alison 's own mind is playing tricks with her and that the involvement of the catholic church and her fianc e 's odd behavior are strictly red herrings multiple of the horrific scenes come pretty close to being genius , like alison 's flashback or her first acquaintance with the priest upstairs the whole climax , with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here above , is a literally perplexing showcase of pure terror and easily one of the most unforgettable and nail biting denouements i ever witnessed br br the cast michael winner managed to gather is deeply impressive , especially considering the sentinel still remains a legitimate horror movie and this genre is n't the most popular among prominent actors , but of course you also have to put the cast listing a little into perspective with such an extended cast , obviously several of the roles in the film are little more than cameos martin balsam and john carradine , for example , only appear on screen for a couple of minutes all together several others \( like christopher walken , jeff goldblum , beverly d'angelo and tom berenger \) perhaps add a lot of fame to the movie nowadays , but back when it was released they were still too unknown in order to attract curious viewers my personal pick for best performances go to burgess meredith as the uncanny neighbor and eli wallach as the satirical police inspector the relatively unknown cristina raines does an admirable job carrying the film and chris sarandon neatly back her up , even though he sports a ridiculous mustache in my humble opinion the sentinel is a marvelously entertaining and frightening horror movie , and most definitely a must see for true genre fanatics

really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort , then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself , however pessimistic his conclusions may be my beef with the film is rather that i do n't see this hours long record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any generally relevant message at all all three

director is clearly convinced and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics that alexander , veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings ' emotional capabilities this latter idea , however , is arrant and offensive nonsense there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work it surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated , miserable , and alone , or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter watch la maman et la putain if you 're historically interested in what passed for culture and

adv sent (1):	well , as goethe once said , there really is n't any manner in trying to pass a negative judgement that fulfils to be objective on something that has had a great effect la maman et la putain has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what 's been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film , certainly , should be dissuaded from watching it to express a purely subjective judgement , however , i thing compelled to disagree with almost every other review postings here and say to people do n't watch it it 's a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry and by that i do n't mean sick and angry about the human condition or anything so general and profound as that , because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty and so on and , if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort , then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself , however pessimistic his conclusions may be my beef with the film is rather that i do n't see this hours long record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any generally relevant message at all all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals alexandre to the greatest degree , of course , because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds marie perhaps to the least degree , because we see the least of her alexandre 's affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value , of course , but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jean pierre l aud is most likely not even acting and that , with absurd remarks like un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray , he really was just reproducing word for word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he , along with the director eustache , had been living for about ten years by the time of

orig sent (0):	i did n't think the french could make a bad movie , but i was , clearly , very wrong as has been said before , this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real artemisia gentileschi br br the script is awful pretentious , stilted , and vapid and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting , rather than retelling , history along with some fairly decent set design , valentina cervi 's physical charms are the primary asset of this movie , and it 's obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too they waste no time in contriving various erotic sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development unfortunately , the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal can not , and does not , sustain this movie the acting is unremarkable , and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two the cinematography is ok , and there are some pretty colors , but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distorted lens effects more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama in any event , the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on artemisia 's body , and all too seldom on her paintings br br all told , a near complete failure it 's not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious film , and it 's too slow and pretentious to work as soft core pornography so the french can fail , after all !
