aboard titanic in a poker game if he wants something , he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries the two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking

recently occurred one of the survivors of the titanic , rose dewitt bukater , who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search she gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the titanic with this , the scene shifts to southhampton , ireland where the titanic set sail from on april 10 , 1912 as all the passengers are boarding after another stop on the irish coast titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the atlantic bound for new york historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful , but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy cal hockley and falls in love with third class passenger , jack dawson captain smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the white star line director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in new york on thursday night and not on friday morning as planned smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty two years of experience to stretch the titanic 's legs out to full speed the titanic had reports that the waters in the atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs , but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie on april 15 , 1912 at 11 39 , an iceberg was sighted they attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film the portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large

six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to titanic 's many pleas for help the california had tried earlier in the day to warn titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but titanic had brushed them off causing the california to turn off its radio and leave the titanic on its own the first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too the word of white star line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking also , the metal that was used to build the titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold , which were experienced the night titanic sank to be extremely brittle overall , the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the titanic br br many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship the core group of rose , jack , cal , and rose 's mother all were fictional

afterwards he had been a part of the white star line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the millionaire 's captain when the titanic sunk the portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol he is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that james cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer 's former canadian hometown as shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower class passengers from non english speaking nations in addition , officer lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted the old people shown in their bed as the water came in

orig sent (1):	over her dead body was a nice little movie it was decent and entertaining , while still being pretty funny there were a few clich 's , but i found most stuff fresh at first i did n't think it was going to be good at all , when it started out if you can get past the first 20 minutes though , the movie starts getting more interesting this film was n't burst out in laughter hilarious , and was n't oh my gosh wonderful it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was i do n't see how this movie was bad it 's rating is just a bit too low i could 've dealt with a 5 5 , but a 4 8 \? also , giving this movie a 1 is disgraceful it was pretty good , and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a 1 , which is what most people gave it

little camera experience , gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief , t k pfeiffer arriving at about 8 42 , the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene , and as jules pans upwards , we see the first strike of the day american airlines flight 11 smashes into the face of the north tower of 1 world trade pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center once there , jules asks to accompany the chief into the tower pfeiffer tells naudet to stick close to him once inside , the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives br br gideon naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area once there , he captures the impact of the second plane , united airlines flight 175 , with 2 world trade he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers watching and capturing the crowds ' reaction to the unimaginable , gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan inside tower one , jules records the last view the world , or loved ones will have of their sons , fathers , uncles , grandfathers , husbands , boyfriends , friends as one by one , each firefighter , carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother , kevin , as he leaves to do his selfless duty also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones , sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke but jules is respectful , never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment the money shot his work is professional through his baptism of fire he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken father michael judd , the chaplain for the fire department then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two , tower one begins its structural collapse br br what results is a breathtakingly , poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and gideon work separately to document that day not knowing if either is alive , each fearing the worst as each firefighter arrives at the firehouse , they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back and in one moment of overwhelming emotion , jules and gideon are reunited as jules cries on his brother 's shoulder , gideon embraces his younger brother as hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject there is one fearful moment when tony benetakos , who left the station with a former chief , is believed to have been lost but returns to the fold , this probie has proven himself br br shown with only three interruptions , 9 11 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking it ranks up there with the hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds the naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject in lesser hands , the tendency would be toward the sensational , but the naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion narrated by hanlon , we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september 11 robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre , restrained way he never seeks the camera for his own glory , rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings , they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is it is n't about dribbling a basketball , or selling an album of hate lyrics 9 11 is about humanity at its best heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom br br

then the unthinkable occurs br br september 11 , 2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from wall street because jules has had little camera experience , gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief , t k pfeiffer arriving at about 8 42 , the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene , and as jules pans upwards , we see the first strike of the day american airlines flight 11 smashes into the face of the north tower of 1 world trade pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the world trade center once there , jules asks to accompany the chief into the tower pfeiffer tells naudet to stick close to him once inside , the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives br br gideon naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area once there , he captures the impact of the second plane , united airlines flight 175 , with 2 world trade he knows jules is with chief pfeiffer inside the towers watching and capturing the crowds ' reaction to the unimaginable , gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in lower manhattan inside tower one , jules records the last view the world , or loved ones will have of their sons , fathers , uncles , grandfathers , husbands , boyfriends , friends as one by one , each firefighter , carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped jules also catches the last glimpse chief pfeiffer will have of his brother , kevin , as he leaves to do his selfless duty also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones , sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke but jules is respectful , never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment the money shot his work is professional through his baptism of fire he also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building then jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken father michael judd , the chaplain for the fire department then as jules and chief pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two , tower one begins its structural collapse br br what results is a breathtakingly , poignant view from inside ground zero as jules and gideon work separately to document that day not knowing if either is alive , each fearing the worst as each firefighter arrives at the firehouse , they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back and in one moment of overwhelming emotion , jules and gideon are reunited as jules cries on his brother 's shoulder , gideon embraces his younger brother as hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject there is one fearful moment when tony benetakos , who left the station with a former chief , is believed to have been lost but returns to the fold , this probie has proven himself br br shown with only three interruptions , 9 11 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking it ranks up there with the hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds the naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject in lesser hands , the tendency would be toward the sensational , but the naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion narrated by hanlon , we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of september 11 robert de niro hosts the program in a sombre , restrained way he never seeks the camera for his own glory , rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see i also commend cbs for their bravery at airing this special chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings , they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished this is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is it is n't about dribbling a basketball , or selling an album of hate lyrics 9 11 is about humanity at its best heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom br br

orig sent (1):	this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion , with cool characters , lots of action , and an amazing performance from dolph lundgren , however alex karzis is awful as the villain ! the story is very good , and i found the kids to be likable for the most part , plus dolph lundgren is simply amazing in this ! the action scenes are excellent , and it 's almost like die hard except it 's set in a school ! , plus kata dob is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick ! the finale is very exciting , and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well ! , however i just wished it had another villain , because alex karzis just did n't cut it as the villain way too ott , and laughable for my tastes this should be higher then 4 1 in my opinion , as i thought it was a great action film , and while the kids , were very stupid at times , they got quite resourceful as the movie went along ! , plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well ! the ending is very amusing , and corey sevier 's character was my favorite student ! , plus dolph has still got it ! this is a great entertaining action film in my opinion , with cool characters , lots of action , and an amazing performance from lundgren ! , but alex karzis is awful as the villain , still i highly recommend this one ! the direction is very good ! sidney j furie does a very good job here with great camera work , good angles , and keeping the film at a very fast pace ! there is a bit of blood and violence we get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds , knife in the side of the head , bloody arrow hits , an impaling , and other minor stuff the acting is fantastic ! dolph lundgren is amazing as always , and is amazing here , he is extremely likable , kicks that ass as usual , had great chemistry with the kids , had an awesome character , is very charismatic , and he may not have shown a great emotional rage , he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch ! , he is one of my favorite actors ! \( lundgren rules ! ! ! ! ! \) alex karzis is god awful as the villain , he is laughably ott , was boring , and not menacing at all , he also annoyed the crap out of me kata dob is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do , she was the real villain in my opinion ! corey sevier is funny as mick , he was my favorite student , and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half , i liked him a lot ! , he had good chemistry with dolph too dov tiefenbach \( willy \) , chris collins \( hogie \) , mpho koaho \( jay tee \) , danielle hampton \( alicia \) , nicole dicker \( charlee \) all do great as the students jennifer baxter is very cute and is good as the fianc e rest of the cast do fine overall i highly recommend this one ! 1 2 out of 5

conference drift off into what seems like a brain dead day dream while the speakers drone on \( the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages \) suddenly the rooms lights turn

send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it , they now effectively control what these spies do , except for sullivan when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to

download important company information that could shut the company down samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him when a mysterious third party becomes involved , the person it is revealed that foster works for , sullivan must decide whether to go

seeing what will happen when they 're thrust into the unknown and cypher follows similar patterns but it 's not a carbon copy of cube it has it 's own inspiration br br cypher is a film that has more

identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle , it 's as much of a shock to us as it is to him br br one thing that distinguishes cypher from cube is how much more polished it is where cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns , cypher is also on a low budget , but natali economises it as much as he can , allowing him to broaden the horizon , and launching morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity br br natali 's direction is exceptional , with a deft hand on the reins there are some amazing camera angles from above , such as the enormity of the digicorp building as a vast , robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is morgan standing outside all the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture , which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film noir br br the acting is uniformly excellent throughout jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity his performance is excellent because it 's so modulated he literally seems to transform right before our very eyes from a clinical , spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity br br david hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube he resides in a secret silo that looks like it was

drama rests within his images his uses of the long shots , the long takes , the leisurely pacing , the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark , inviting the viewer to experience the film

adv sent (0):	as with all of angelopoulos ' films , the suspended step of the stork implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer , a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work dialogues are sparing , with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters ' inner conflicts , doubts , or feelings the filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses , and instead forces them to explore and study the characters ' identities for themselves as a result , the acting is understated and implicit , as opposed to glaring and explicit br br the action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation , where the viewer is asked to become a participant , to participate as an actor , by probing his or her own psyche as in a novel , where the drama rests entirely on the author 's writing to provide a template where the reader 's imagination and or past experience flourish , angelopoulos ' drama rests within his images his uses of the long shots , the long takes , the leisurely pacing , the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark , inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity , reverting to the non verbal language of gestures , gazes , sounds , and music , when he believes that words can only take us so far br br the music , by angelopoulos ' long time collaborator , eleni karaindrou , provides more than just a discreet background , but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story a large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle , subdued colors , recorded in a drab winter light angelopoulos presents us with an other greece , one far different from the greece of the tourist brochures , with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas , drowned in an eternal sunshine here , the skies are covered and gray , the air is cold and misty , and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled , dirty snow of the village streets angelopoulos ' genius through arvanitis ' camera is on display throughout the film br br the suspended step of the stork is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio political situation in the balkans at the end of the twentieth century it is deeply concerned with the meaning of borders , and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations in the waiting room facing the albanian border , the refugees , political or other , outcast by the rest of humanity ,
