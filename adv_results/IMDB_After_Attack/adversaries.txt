orig sent (1):	this is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival so far and without a doubt the best the festival has had to offer i went into this film with little to no expectations after learning that the director was responsible for the awful vampire flick the forsaken and i left pleasantly surprised the film stars lori heuring of in crowd fame as a young mother whose husband has just passed she moves into an old family home in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine that is a gravesite to overworked children back in the day unlucky for them the children return with a vengeance killing and eating everyone in their path the film works on many levels it 's well done , suspenseful , it has spots of good cinematography and capable performances by compton especially the atmosphere is spooky yet slightly underwhelming , the score is decent and the makeup effects are gruesome and simplistic the film keeps up a creepy and unsettling tone and the kids themselves with pale skin , torn up lips and hollow eyes are pretty scary and unrelenting the film is original and inventive without being to artsy or complicated i ca n't see this film making it into a wide release without some trimming and slight fine tuning but they definitely have a good product on there hands and should pursue some type of theatrical distribution however the theatre in which i saw it in was horrible the sound was dreadfully messed up which i felt took away from the film majorly and it stopped in the middle because they could n't center it on the screen which killed the mood a bit all in all though it was the most satisfying of horrorfests entries maybe because it had the least expectations but nonetheless was a welcome addition to genre films

orig sent (0):	macbeth is one of the most frequently told stories in cinema and has been translated many times in numerous theater and celluloid settings originally written by william shakespeare in the early 1600 's , macbeth tells the story of betrayal among royalty and one man 's quest for power director geoffrey wright \( romper stomper \) tries his hand at updating macbeth by setting it in the contemporary melbourne underworld a film where the characters substitute swords for guns \( ala baz luhrman 's romeo and juliet \) and royal vassals for gangsters , macbeth is a gritty , violent , but critically flawed film br br macbeth \( sam worthington \) works for king duncan \( gary sweet \) after being elevated to the thane of glamis by the king \( as was prophesied to macbeth by three witches \) , macbeth starts setting his eyes on the throne one night the king comes to stay at macbeth 's house and lady macbeth \( victoria hill \) talks him into killing the king to assume power macbeth kills his master and then assumes his crown but success has it 's downside , as macbeth soon finds out , when he has to go to hideous lengths to protect his murderous secret br br ok , first things first the film 's major fault is sam worthington his portrayal of macbeth is in a word boring i honestly did n't care about macbeth while watching the film i had more sympathy for victoria hill 's lady macbeth because she bothered to act at least worthington sits sullen and wood faced throughout the entire film i felt like he was doing his best impression of johnny deep 's george jung character from blow but without the charisma i have never seen worthington in a film before so i 'm not sure if it was his or the director 's fault , but either way the glue that should have tied everything together into one cohesive unit is weak br br the dialog is good , but when matched up to the geoffrey wright 's australian gangster motif seems a bit out of place frentically paced action sequences mixed with long shaksperian musings creates pacing conflict within the film i understand that this is macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialog intact but hard , fast action scenes following a three minute soliloquy tends to get annoying if not a bit pretentious br br the camera work is highly stylized , and for the most part , it works well one thing that i found annoying was how the camera would slowly jostle back and forth , almost constantly i do n't mind shots like that it 's just overdone it 's passes beyond the realm of being cool and stylish and instead becomes irritating other than that , the art direction and cinematography is fairly well done br br for all of the good qualities macbeth possesses stylish direction , shakespearian dialog , a strong soundtrack , supernatural nude witches \( the weird sisters \) , and good helpings of brutal , bloody violence all of these strengths are forgotten when one considers sam worthington 's uninspired portrayal of macbeth the role of macbeth was essential for tying everything together and in this respect geoffrey wright and sam worthington failed miserably , making macbeth a forgettable foray into shakespeare

orig sent (1):	though not exactly a comedy in the usual sense of the word this more rewarding than any movie full of laughs but devoid of substance i do n't think bergman 's movies can be easily classed under narrow genres , even the lightest are quite complex this movie in spite of its light touch poses a series of problems related to marriage and its shortcomings and what happens when the flames start to die etc i do n't really communicate personally with all these issues as i am sure others do but the atmosphere of the movie is extraordinary , you almost wish it not to end i have to admit that i was swept away by the bergman of the fifties , having come to know most of his later , groundbreaking efforts before nykvist , von sydow , ulman etc the master produced some of the richest , warm and touching movies i have ever seen though it 's a long shot , i have seen this kind of love for human kind , in its complexity , only in fellini 's movies of the same period a lesson in love alongside smiles of a summer night are worth seeing for bergman fans , to have the full image of the man 's capabilities , and for those who love cinema with a heart may he rest in peace !
