orig sent (0):	i really wanted to like this film as i have admiration for italian rip off cinema \( especially jaws rip offs ! \) , but the simple fact of the matter is that monster shark is n't very good all the signs of this being a great piece of trash are there we 've got one of the kings of trashy cult cinema , lamberto bava , in the director 's chair one of the best ridiculous cult actors , michael sopkiw , taking the lead role , and a central creature stupid enough to give even the best that this sort of film has to offer a run for it 's money , yet somehow the film still manages to be rather stale the fact that the ' monster shark ' does n't feature too often is probably a good thing given the creature design , but there 's never enough elsewhere to pull the film through without it the plot focuses on a resort off the south coast of florida \( or rather , somewhere in italy \) where several local people have turned up in the water with arms and legs missing it 's not long before the local authorities decide that this creature has never been seen before , and it 's up to a motley crew of various sea experts to catch it alive ! br br the main problem with this film is that it always feels very pointless , and since there is little in the way of characters or plot development , even the least demanding of viewers are likely to start getting bored before long this sort of film is hardly famous for being brilliant , although the fun element of films such as ' the last shark ' and ' killer fish ' is unfortunately absent for most of the running time the thing i love about lead actor michael sopkiw is that he always seems like he 's taking himself seriously no matter what film he 's in \( although he only ever made four \) this is certainly the case here , although bava never really allows him to completely dive in , and often he feels as much like a spare wheel as the rest of the film much of the runtime is spent watching the various characters sup american lager , and it 's not very fascinating although bava does manage to come good by the end with an entertaining flurry of action as the central monster finally gets to wreak havoc upon its would be captors overall , there really is n't much to recommend this film for as mentioned , i really like this sort of stuff and even i found myself bored on numerous occasions for hardcore italian horror fans only !

orig sent (1):	despite its many faults , hallmark 's 1995 version of gulliver 's travels is still the finest adaptation of jonathan swift 's satirical classic largely because it not only includes all of gulliver 's many travels but also includes the satire that 's often overlooked unfortunately the twin problems of the book 's highly episodic structure and a television budget \( even a fairly lavish one \) remain the book is a somewhat rambling collection of traveller 's tales moving simply from one surreal landscape to another , but simon moore 's adaptation tries to impose some order on the chaos by providing a parallel plot that sees gulliver returned to england clearly deeply traumatised and trying to prove his way out of the insane asylum where the rival for his wife 's affections has had him committed the england scenes at once mirror and comment on the travels , elements of which occasionally spill over into the real world the trouble is that for the first hour or so it acts more as a distraction , constantly pulling you away from the story just as it starts to get interesting the lilliput scenes suffer worse here , with the feeling that the home scenes are too often designed to save them from filming the more expensive setpieces this has to be the only version where we do n't see gulliver pulling the blefescu fleet behind him br br yet once gulliver makes his escape , the tone becomes more consistent as he finds his situation reversed and himself the pet of the giants of the utopians of brobdingnag , a guest of the wise men of the floating island of laputa who are so engrossed in science that they have no common sense left , the guest prisoner of a historian who leans history directly from the source , offered immortality with all it 's terrible consequences before finally finding a world he wants to belong if only he can convince the sublime talking horses the houynhnhms that he 's not an uncivilized yahoo , each new destination convincing him of what an absurd and petty species humanity is for the most part it 's a darker set of travels than expected , with only gulliver 's curiosity and commonsense and disappointment keeping it from plunging into irretrievable bleakness and even this is offset by the scenes in the asylum where it becomes more obvious that even if he is telling the truth it may well have driven him genuinely insane it 's in these latter scenes that ted danson 's gulliver really shines , never more so than in an extraordinary speech where he turns his trial into a disappointed judgment on the whole human race br br being made for television , the yahoos are rather less literally scatological here than on the page , but for the most part this is a more adult treatment than you might expect with no real dumbing down the star cast is certainly impressive , and for the most part well used \( if somewhat briefly in a few cases \) mary steenburgen , james fox , peter o'toole , edward woodward , omar sharif , shashi kapoor , edward fox , ned beatty , alfre woodard , kristin scott thomas and isabelle huppert among them it 's hard to imagine the upcoming jack black version even coming close to being a fraction as impressive as this

orig sent (0):	i just finished watching this movie and largely found it a waste of time with little or no redeeming factors i really do n't understand where all the positive reviews came from the animation is clunky and unrefined , the plot makes no sense at all from an objective standpoint , and there is no sense of intrigue or suspense in that which is trying to pass itself off as an intriguing and suspenseful film i have never read the book so i ca n't say if the movie was faithful , but as with most movie adaptations , it tries too hard to cram as much information into the shortest amount of time possible the result is a disjointed and illogical storyline that does n't really let you understand or relate to the characters , or , actually , anything at all overall , i felt completely detached from the characters and the plot to the point where i could n't bring myself to care about what happened to them , and the only way i can see how this animation could be considered beautiful is if your normal standard of animation is a scooby doo cartoon
