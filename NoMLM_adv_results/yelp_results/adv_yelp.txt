the fancier the decor in an ethnic restaurant , the blander the food n nstated differently , what is it about the mystical siren 's call of the hole in the wall ethnic restaurant \? does the chef assume that because his food is head and shoulders above the rest that he need n't waste money on decorations \? or is it simply that the mom pop chef with his traditional recipes handed down from generation to generation will never be matched by the cookie cutter american culinary school education \? n nthis restaurant is very unassumedly named the middle eastern bakery and deli , though it is also a restaurant and grocery store it does n't look like much from the outside , nor the inside , and would probably fly under most people 's radar if it was not for word of mouth passed through yelp can you see the diamond lurking under the layer of carbon \?

orig sent (0):	after some people had mentioned that they liked this place , my wife and i decided to go and test , yet again , another peruvian restaurant we ordered 3 different meals , lomo a caballo , arroz con mariscos , and pollo a la brasa the lomo a caballo would have been pretty good , but the sauce they had was sweet , which i did n't like at all the arroz con mariscos was bland , hardly any flavor the pollo a la brasa was far from the real deal , being dry and unflavorful we did get a free soup with our meal , which was the best thing we tasted there the sodas tasted like there was dish soap in them , and were not refilled until i finally had to ask we also had to ask for the sauces for the pollo a la brasa the aji that was served with the bread was pretty decent , but not enough to save the rest of the meal overall , it was too pricey for the service and the quality of the food sadly , we have n't been able to find a peruvian restaurant that we like in az , and this one was probably the worst one we 've tried n nwow ! it 's a good thing you can edit these reviews a lot has happened since i made this review , which the last time i checked is an opinion of what i think the owner of this restaurant , upon reading my review , posted it on peruanos en arizona , a group on facebook he mentioned my full name in the review , opening it up to his friends to personally attack me he also said that that i went in to his restaurant complaining of the decoration of his restaurant \( which i did n't \) my wife made some comments , defending our opinion , and then he scanned our yelp coupon \( which has my full name on it , \) and order sheet that was made when we paid , and posted it on the same page as a picture , claiming that he was right about me making comments about the decoration \( which is not shown in the picture \) he claims to be a professional , but is far from it i had nothing against him personally , until now , but in one of his comments he says that there is no possible way that so many things can be wrong with his food unless i have something personal against him i do n't think i need drive to a place and pay for a meal to make a review on someone who i personally do n't like he also posted the same review on his personal facebook page , to which his friends responded things like , poor gringo , he only knows what frozen hamburgers and hot dogs taste like and he does n't have the smallest idea of what real peruvian food is , he probably has n't even been there , with a last name like that , what does he know , he 's one of ' those ' customers , i hope the seafood got him sick , words like jealous , ignorant things like that now if i did n't know any better , i would think that a gringo 's opinion does n't matter when it comes to real peruvian food , too however , i have been to peru , i do know what good peruvian food is supposed to taste like , and my wife , who is actually from peru was equally disappointed with the food , and service her mother cooks 50 times better than this guy , and we both know that what we ate does n't compare to what real peruvian food is supposed to be so , instead of taking this as constructive criticism , the owner has taken it as a personal attack against him , and has to look for validation from other people who surround him we probably would have been back there again , because my wife 's family would have wanted to try the new peruvian restaurant which has happened before with others , but now no one that we can tell to about our experience will ever go there there are also many many many other sites to review a restaurant , not just yelp i 'll make sure to put this same review on other sites , too that will also give me time to think up other things that i did n't like that i did n't mention on my original review like how this professional was negotiating delivery prices with a meat driver right in front of the guests when i made this review , yelp posted it on my facebook page , but i took it down because it was negative , but i will be sure to post it now i do n't know if what this guy did was legal , but i 'll find out soon enough i just hope he does n't put my debit card number up on facebook so , if you 're going to give this place a negative review , watch out ! you 'll be personally attacked for your opinion , and be lied about and be told you do n't know what you 're talking about he has since taken down all his posts , but i saved all the screenshots if anyone is interested
