0 When I ordered this from Blockbuster 's website I had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was . Who knows ? Maybe I 'd forgotten to take my ADD meds that day . I do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon , donned in their late 70's - style wide collars , bell - bottoms and feathered hair , I knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster.<br /><br />The first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning , trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe , forcing polyester and porno - quality music on the would - be viewer . From the opening scene with the poorly - done effects to the " monsters " from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of ' The Vagina Monologues'.<br /><br />Throughout the film , the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear . The " ship " was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old VCR and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path . Of course if moved slower than Bob Barker 's impacted bowels , but it had menacing pencil - thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two ( with some assistance).<br /><br />Moving on ... As the weirdness and bell bottoms continue ... We found out that they 're caught in a " Space Time Warp " . How do we garner this little nugget of scientific information ? Because the oldest male lead tells his son that , in a more or less off - the - cuff fashion , like reminiscing about ' how you won the big game ' over a cup of joe or an ice - cold bottle of refreshing Coca - Cola . Was pops a scientist ? Nope , but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and Einstein 's theories.<br /><br />The recording I watched on DVD was almost bootleg quality . The sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone , other than that , it was really , really , really bad . ( There 's not enough ' really 's ' to describe it , really).<br /><br />I know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics . I never saw this film on its original release , but even back then I think I would 've come to the same conclusion : bury this one quick .
0 I cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema . So after watching the trailer for " Water Lilies , " I expected to like this film because I thought I 'd stumbled on something unique : a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love - sort of a female version of " Beautiful Thing . " < br /><br />The main characters are young French women 15 years old . Marie is slender , reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way ; Floriane is outgoing , athletic and beautiful ; and Anne is loyal , pudgy and behaviorally immature . The erotic interrelationship between Marie and Floriane is always simmering in this movie , if not at the surface , then just below it . < br /><br />"Water Lilies , " however , is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens ; it is about sexual frustration , suffering , ennui , teens working at cross - purposes and - in at least two instances - joyless , mechanical sex . It also proves that screenwriters and film - makers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative.<br /><br />In the extra features on the " Lord of the Flies " DVD , director Peter Brook says , " French cynicism starts with the arousal of sex , " meaning the French regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism . Part of the downfall of this film is film - maker Celine Sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism.<br /><br />"Where is the joy ? " I asked myself while watching this film . Yes , first love can be painful and frustrating , but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh , life - affirming way . These positive aspects are missing from this movie ; there is no balance.<br /><br />Organically , this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love . But Sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film . First , what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude ? I know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in European cinema , as evidenced by films like " The Slingshot ; The Rascals ; The Devil , Probably ; The Little Thief ; Murmur of the Heart ; Friends ; Beau Pere " and " Europa , Europa " ; but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion - " See , audience , I can make a film where I show only the unattractive person nude . " Either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity would 've been an honest way to go.<br /><br />There is a scene in a club where Floriane and Marie are dancing . What follows next is not just Floriane cynically manipulating Marie ; it is film - maker Sciamma cynically manipulating her audience.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when Floriane warns Marie she 's about to request something that is " not normal . " Marie understandably asks , " Who cares about being normal ? " Then Sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie , because Floriane 's request is a phony , derivative and substitute question - not the authentic , heartfelt question the movie , Marie 's character and the viewers who 've invested their time deserve . < br /><br />Here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewer 's nerves : 1 ) Since when do the French - of all people - take baths wearing bathing suits , and with a turtle to boot ? 2 ) What teen - of any nationality - would chomp down on an apple core that 's been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloved 's mouth?<br /><br />The three main actresses are promising and , if they find better vehicles for their talents , may become excellent actors . Louise Blachere ( Anne ) is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles . Adele Haenel ( Floriane ) could become a leading lady , or a bombshell , or both . Pauline Acquart ( Marie ) possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable . In the future , she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaim.<br /><br />All in all , " Water Lilies " was very disappointing . Will an honest film - maker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love ! No - not necessarily for the sake of this middle - aged guy - but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with . And yes , to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema .
0 For anyone craving a remake of 1989 's Slaves of New York . What are there , seven of you ? Here it is ... was.<br /><br />This undercooked movie has studiously vapid characters ( Well they 're club - kids , ya big jerk ! ) that are in holding patterns . The big question seems to be , just how long can a young adult remain juvenile ? It took three people to write this ' story ' ? Good god , it was easier to come up with Citizen Kane . Rather than take viewers back , this movie should just embarrass anyone who was a scene - ster in the early 90s.<br /><br />The idea that a fifty year old woman envies a bunch of self - absorbed kids from a different era is the world as only self - absorbed , twenty - somethings could imagine it . The odd sidebar about library work is not the sub - plot one expects from the equivalent of Parker Posey 's Breakin 2 : Electric Bugaloo . Her " I 'm serious about graduate school ! " while a stripper grinds on her is hysterical . Posey 's shtick is always amusing , but there are projects that are beneath her . I was asleep before it crossed the 40 minute mark .
0 Besides being boring , the scenes were oppressive and dark . The movie tried to portray some kind of moral , but fell flat with its message . What were the redeeming qualities ? ? On top of that , I do n't think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did .
0 For the first couple of seasons , I thought The Apprentice was a highly engaging and exciting show . The combination between reality TV and a 16 week job - interview was innovative , and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too " out there".<br /><br />The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all . In the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the business - related tasks - now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do EVERYTHING to keep them on the show ( that means lying , trash - talking , backstabbing etc . ) . The boardroom can be entertaining to watch , but it 's entertainment at it 's low - point - Sometimes you wonder if you are watching a repeat of an old Jerry Springer episode . The tasks on the show are , at most , boring and mostly a showcase for the companies who are dumb enough to pay NBC for the publicity . And what is the deal about half of the contestants living in tents in season 6 ? That is just plain stupid and has nothing to do with business in real - life . < br /><br />I have absolutely NO respect for any of the contestants this season , they all seem like idiots to me . In earlier seasons at least some of the contestants had a bit of integrity , now it seems like the contestants would kill their own mother to keep them on the show . It also seems like Donald Trump 's massive ego becomes bigger and bigger for every season that pass by and to be honest , I ca n't see why anyone with a common sense would want to work for him . His rationality in the boardroom mostly does n't make any sense at all and sometimes it seems he just like to trash people for what it 's worth.<br /><br />R.I.P The Apprentice . Please NBC , for God 's sake , get the show off the air as soon as possible . It 's just too embarrassing to watch . The Apprentice was once a great TV - show , but now it 's just a big fat joke .
0 I LOVED the Apprentice for the first two seasons.<br /><br />But now with season 5 ? ( or is it 6 ? ) things are getting just plain too tiring.<br /><br />I used to like the show , but its become Donald Trumps own ego fest . Granted its his company you 'll be working for , but come on ! some of the things says " You 're FIRED " is just insulting.<br /><br />after watching the show , I would not want to work for him . not because he is arrogant , pompous or such . Its just that the show is unrealistic and the way he handles things makes me just squirm . Good Entertainment ? YES , but tiring as the back stabbing gets so tiring .. its not team work , its not personal , its just business . watch your back jack .
0 I bet you Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in . Is n't just too contrived for Gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword ? And Big Pussy ? What the hell was that " look at me , I 'm a rat ! " double episode crap ? All that cliché mafia banter- COME ON ! The big names voted off just happened to already have received money for their charity and got a custom tailored exit . Hmm ... This is not reality but staged drama ! Mark Burnett 's other show , " Survivor " also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born.<br /><br />Yuk !
0 I ca n't stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with Paris Hilton , and sure it 's his company . But " you 're fired " or " you 're hired " , for how many seasons now ? After watching the show I would n't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and I think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve.<br /><br />I'd love to hear just one person get up and say " Donald I quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo " . I see he 's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling WWE . I hope he gets hurt so I do n't have to see his pathetic face anymore . It must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it . I 'd give this show a negative mark if I could but it gets a 1 and it does n't deserve that .
0 One has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a < br /><br />script existed that made any sense . Was the rough cut 3 hours < br /><br />long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives ? < br /><br />Why would anyone finance this mess ? I will say that Tom < br /><br />Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can < br /><br />with the dialogue and dramatic ( ? ) situations he is given . But < br /><br />characters come and go for no apparent reason , continuity is < br /><br />non - existent , and the acting , cinematography , and direction are ( to < br /><br />put it politely ) amateurish . Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate < br /><br />choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone < br /><br />actually attempt to actually watch this film .
0 Jochen Hick wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the AIDS virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on convicts in the years before the outbreak of the hideous disease . Were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film , this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant non - prejudicial infective organism.<br /><br />Stefan ( Tom Wlaschiha ) journeys from Berlin to San Francisco to investigate his father 's scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused . He meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory , but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation . Simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place , each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from Puccini 's opera ' Turandot ' which just happens to be opening at the San Francisco Opera . A police investigator Louise Tolliver ( Irit Levi ) and her companion cop ( Kalene Parker ) follow the murders while Stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in San Francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father 's theory . He encounters a strange lad Jeffrey ( Jim Thalman ) with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent Doctor Burroughs ( Richard Conti ) who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects . How this all come to an end is the play of the film , a story as much about the search for self identity between Stefan and Jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders.<br /><br />While Tom Wlaschiha , Jim Thalman and Richard Conti do well with their roles ( they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film ! ) , the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented Irit Levy and Kaylene Parker : when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero . There are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit , but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of ' Nessun dorma ' as sung by Mario del Monaco from a recording o the opera - and that seems to be the reason for making the film ! Good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors , but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing . Grady Harp , February 06
0 Poorly written conspiracy drama / mystery about the possibility that AIDS was introduced to the public by the government . Wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for answers -- that within this foggy plot would be hard for anyone to find . Despite the cinematography itself being commendable , the camera hungers for characters of true depth instead of the shallow , amateur acting it unfortunately has to convey . Grade : D+
0 I do n't give much credence to AIDS conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized . In the early years of the AIDS epidemic , the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies . This was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi - monde of San Francisco . The city , renowned for its beauty , has rarely appeared uglier than in this film . A sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene.<br /><br />While the acting and plot ca n't be said to be well - done the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss . Actually , I found the most interesting performance to be Irit Levi as a crusty and cynical Jewish , lesbian ( ? ) police detective . She 's interesting , though not necessarily convincing.<br /><br />Highlights : the film 's use of the garishly tragic Turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist , Ron Athey .
0 The cliché of the shell - shocked soldier home from the war is here given dull treatment . Pity a splendid cast , acting to the limits of their high talents , ca n't redeem ' The Return of the Soldier ' from its stiff - collared inability to move the viewer to emotional involvement . Best moments , as another reviewer noted , come when Glenda Jackson is on screen ; but even Jackson 's crackling good cinematic power ca n't pull this film 's chestnuts from its cold , never warmed hearth . Ann - Margret , she of sex - kitten repute and too often accused of lacking acting ability , finds her actual and rather profound abilities wasted here - despite her speaking with a nigh - flawless Middlesex accent . The hackneyed score , redolent of many lackluster TV miniseries ' slathered - on saccharine emotionalism , is at irritating odds with the emotional remoteness of the script , blocking , and overbaked formalism of the direction ; except for its score and corseted script and direction , ' The Return of the Soldier ' has all the right bits but it fails to make them work together .
0 The Good Earth is perhaps the most boring film I 've seen in my life . The plot is slow and lacking . The acting is borderline comical . While I love Paul Muni , I can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice . The only saving grace I found with this film is it 's production value . The use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment . Also , the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time . Other than the production value I can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film .
0 The Good Earth is not a great film by any means , it is way to ordinary . Maybe it was different in the 1930 's but who would want to see the life of a farmer . It is not very interesting to me . Yes , Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long . I could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act . In short Wang Lung ( Muni ) a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him . Both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds . The film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next . Also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments , it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis .
0 A couple of farmers struggle in life in a small village in China . Wang Lung ( Paul Muni ) buys O - Lan , his future wife , who becomes his slave ( Luis Rainer ) . American stars appear in the leading roles , talking with fake accents and emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology . A good wife , many children and land are the best things for men to have . They are seen as property and investment . Because it is a big budget movie , in which many extras cooperate , big sets are built and special effects take place , the movie makers could not take the risk of hiring less popular actors . Luise Rainer won an Academy Award for this performance , which is definitely the worst in the movie . Her immutable face builds a barrier between her and the audience . O - Lan is supposed to be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with . On the other hand Paul Muni gives a better performance , showing his talent ones again . Another problem with the movie is the ending . It seems like Franklin did not know when to end the picture . This film could be dangerous if it is taken as a truly example of Chinese culture and traditions .
0 Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth . Unfortunately , her role required no . She did not say much and looked pale throughout the film . Luise 's character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Muni 's character ( he did a fantastic job for his performance ) . Set in ancient Asia , both actors were not Asian , but were very convincing in their roles . I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance , because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for . She must have been a breakthrough actress , one of the first to method act . This seems like something that Hollywood does often . Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban . I felt Luise 's performance to be lackluster throughout , and when she died , she did not change in expression from any previous scenes . She stayed the same throughout the film ; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice . If her brilliant acting was so subtle , I suppose I did not see it .
0 Well I 'm probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site , but The Good Earth is one of the worst structured films I 've seen in a long time . We have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one . The first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine . They have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind . Conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended . Yeah OK . With this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again . < br /><br />Well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it . You would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film . However , the film then continues on for a whole other hour . And in this remaining time , its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers . Oh yea and the age old , money is the root of all evil blah blah blah . Just because you know your making an epic film does n't mean that your story can go on needlessly for more than it has to . Also the main idea I would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together . Then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman , and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character has n't even cared about through most of the film . < br /><br />Oh wait and the film is n't the only thing that s poorly written , the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense . She complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never wants to have a slave and yadda yadda yadda . Then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery . Even if they are starving at the time of this idea , it still does n't make sense when 20 minutes later in the film she is complaining about not wanting a slave again . < br /><br />There are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to . The only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography . The land is shot beautifully , oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive . Too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say . < br /><br />One last thing . I know that at this point in time Hollywood was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything . For most of the film Paul Muni does portray an Asian man to the best of his ability , but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no reason he loses it and just becomes regular old Italian Paul , they even cut his hair so he looks like Tony from Scarface(also a better film than this ) . Of all the main characters in the film I think maybe three are actually Asian , the rest are just Americans being silly . Oh and please Ms. Rainer that was a really nice one note performance , not , if i could i rip the Oscar out of your hands , oh i would . < br /><br />The Good Earth is one epic waste of time . If you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get The Grapes of Wrath , a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets . Mainly because it was n't written by a monkey .
0 The Good Earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in China . The movie is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck . The story is great , but I hated that they decided to cast Anglos in the lead roles . Walter Connolly is laughable as the farmer 's father . He has such a heavy American accent , as do most of the lead actors , that I could not bear listening to him speak.<br /><br />It is a shame that Hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast Asians in the lead roles . To take Anglos and make them look like Chinese is akin to Anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play African - Americans .
0 Well , what was fun ... except for the fun part.<br /><br />It 's my second least favorite so far , I even thought it was worse than ' Lazarus ' and ' Ghost in the Machine'.<br /><br />Let 's start with the good . The teaser , it was incredibly well done and also emotional . Being the great animal lover that I am , it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode.<br /><br />But then there 's all the bad , and believe me there is a lot of it . Little made sense , so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated ? whaaa ? ? ? the dialog was also pretty awful . There were about one or two quotable lines . < br /><br />and worst of all , having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me . In the end ... what 's the point ? they all pretty much died . We did n't learn anything , we were n't entertained , and I could n't even find Sophia 's death sad ... just very frustrating.<br /><br / > * star . shame because Season 2 was doing so well .
0 Amazing . That 's what you 'd say if you sat through this film . Simply , incredibly , amazing . It 's actually so amazing that anyone was stupid enough to dump money into making this monstrosity that you simply ca n't believe what you 're seeing . That , my friends , is what is truly scary about this film . Somebody thought it was a good idea to make it . < br /><br />Well , here 's another amazingly original story : High School student ( occasionally seemed like collegego figure ) has whore for a mom , lives in a trailer park , and is an " artist " who is ridiculed for his " being all different . " Well , of course , this poor ridiculed boy is eventually killed and , here 's the original part , his soul inhabits a scarecrow ( beneath which , he is killed by his slutty mama 's latest john ) . Then he goes around with the standard killing off of all the people that done hurt him . Awww.<br /><br />Here 's the breakdown:<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />--Amazingly funny movieeven if that 's not what the clearly drunk filmmakers wanted.<br /><br />--This and the sequel on one disk in the Wal - Mart $ 5.00 binso it 's only a little overpriced.<br /><br />Didn't Hurt It , Did n't Help:<br /><br />--The violence and gore are kind of sub - standard . One person is stabbed with a corncob.<br /><br />--Sounds like they put some effort into the musicbut it does n't really fit the movieand is n't all that good.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />--Terrible , terrible acting.<br /><br />--Another slasher let - down with sexy womennone of them removing clothing . When did that cease being a staple of low - brow slashers??<br /><br />--Ridiculous story.<br /><br />--The scarecrow vomits up one - liners that would make Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger blush.<br /><br />--Standard underlying love story goes nowhere , and is poorly done.<br /><br />--Some of the people killed seem like they were chosen at randomyou never really know who anybody is and then they 're killed . And you only assume that they must 've had it coming.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />--Extremely average slasher fare , just with a murdering scarecrow instead of   well , all that other crap.<br /><br />--Nowhere near as interesting as Freddy Krueger , Jason Voorhees , Pinhead , Chucky , or even Angela from the " Sleepaway Camp " seriesall of which are better than this atrocity.<br /><br />--The absolute worst dialogue I have ever heard in my LIFE . The script is laden with a level of retardedness that I never imagined could exist . I 'm serious hereit 's a full step beyond terrible . Do n't get me wrong , though , it 's funny as hellbut I 've never heard more asinine bantereven in " Slumber Party Massacre III . " This film makes " Jason X " look like Shakespeare.<br /><br />--The man who kills the boy that becomes the scarecrow : Worst wig ever . Dialogue to match.<br /><br />Memorable Scene:<br /><br />--The one where elementary - school youths spew out their own witty dialogue : " Hey , let 's go find small animals to torture . Huh huh." < br /><br />Acting : 3/10 Story : 3/10 Atmosphere : 2/10 Cinematography : 1/10 Character Development : 2/10 Special Effects / Make - up : 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality : 1/10 ( No nudity , Mom 's a whore , girls wear no bras ) Violence / Gore : 5/10 ( Low quality , mediocre amount ) Dialogue : 0/10 ( Extremely ridiculous , blatant , over - the - top and painfully funnyso bad it 's good . My first rating for dialogue in any film ! ) Music : 5/10 Direction : 2/10<br /><br />Cheesiness : 10/10 Crappiness : 9/10<br /><br />Overall : 3/10<br /><br />Another one for just people like me who enjoy watching pure crap . Or Slasher - film completists . This is not a good movie , at all . Laughable dialogue and characters keep it from being truly boring.<br /><br />www . ResidentHazard.com
0 This movie could be used in film classes in a " How Not to Script a B - Movie " course . There are inherent constrictions in a B - movie : Budgets are tight , Time is precious ( Scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days ) and the actors are often green and inexperienced . The one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you . Scarecrow 's script seems to have been written in a drunken haze . I could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie , but I 'll just mention one : The Gravedigger . The character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie . He seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie . He is shown with his daughter , who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie . The gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count . Why give the Gravedigger a daughter ? Why give the daughter a boyfriend ? Why introduce them so late in the movie ? Why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline ? Scarecrow does n't seem to care.<br /><br />The " story " of Scarecrow goes something like this : Lester is a high school kid ( played by and actor who 'd I 'd peg to be in his early 30 's ) who is picked on by the other kids . He is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named Judy . His mom is a lush and the town whore . One of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings ( by calling him a " faggot " for drawing birds instead of " monsters and cowboys . " If you have a high school student still drawing cowboys I 'd think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows ) and later , kills Lester , in a cornfield , under the titular scarecrow . Magically , Lester 's soul goes into the scarecrow . Somehow , this transference changes Lester 's soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast ( I know some reviews have called the scarecrow a Kung - Fu scarecrow . I disagree . The scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie ) . The scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him , those who smoke pot in the corn field , those who dig graves , boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers , pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set.<br /><br />The bonus feature on the DVD should be mentioned . The director ( a Frenchman ) does an impromptu version of rap music , admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by ( and I 'm paraphrasing ) : " Life ez a bitch , but et has a great ass" < br /><br />Number of Beers I drank while watching this movie : 5 Did it help : No Number of Beers needed to enjoy this movie : Whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level .
0 I desperately want to give this movie a 10 ... I really do . Some movies , especially horror movies are so budget that they are good . A wise - cracking ninja scarecrow who can implement corn cobs as lethal weaponry ... definitely fits this ' budget to brilliance ' system . The depth of the movie is definitely its strong point and the twists and turns it implements , keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really drives the creepy ... ninja ... puberty - stricken ... pre - thirty year old student ... non - cowboy drawing ... wise - cracking ... son - of - a - bitch scarecrow into the limelight as the creepiest horror icon of the year . All I can really say is , ' can you dig it ' and recommend watching movies such as Frankenfish if you enjoy this sort of hilarious horror.<br /><br />(WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY SMOKING ! ? '
0 This movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie . The main character was decently done and I felt sorry for him and there was a decent amount of backstory . HOWEVER , everything else sucks . The director , Emmanuel , is quite incompetent at film - making . He uses some of the most idiotic shots ever.<br /><br />- a couple of random sequences of random images dispersed throughout the film . I do n't know if he tried to be deep and intelligent and poetic but he was n't . It was stupid . Random shots of the trailer the main character lived in , random buildings , random pan shots of buildings , random cat which walks away . WTF ? And clouds . Lots of gloomy dark clouds.<br /><br />- he really liked this technique of having a scene cut up into different shots rather than being just one continuous shot . EX : Guy is trying to light his weed and the camera circles around him . Instead of just one shot , he edits it into like 10 different shots so its really EDGY ! and HIP ! and SMART ! stupid.<br /><br />The acting is horrible but it 's what makes the movie so funny . And the scarecrow is a gymnast cause he flips and spins and twirls all the time . And some of the deaths could have been better . You expect the main bully to have a long well built up death but nope . A simple corncob in the ear . The love interest was hot . Voluptuous . Which is why this movie gets a 2 .
0 Oh dear lord . This movie ... It was horrible . I am a HUGE fan of horror movies . And most of the time , horror movies other people say are bad , I like . The actor who played ' Scarecrow ' was amazing , I will say that . But this plot was awful . It made no sense ! It had way too much gore , and an unnecessary ( and revolting ) sex scene at the beginning . I do believe the director was trying to be ' shocking ' or whatnot , but it just came out awful . To add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot , the actors ( besides ' scarecrow ' ) we 're awful , and I cared so little about them that I soon forgot who was who . In conclusion , this movie made me sick . If you can avoid watching this movie in anyway , please do .
0 Spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow which then takes revenge on everyone.<br /><br />This movie really annoyed me . It has a great looking monster , has some good low budget effects , some atmosphere but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad . Half way in I started to fast forward and then step through the chapters on the DVD.<br /><br />The problems with this movie are many . First off the cast looks about thirty and yet they are suppose to be in high school . You do n't believe anything from the get go as a result . The scarecrow , while looking great is n't much beyond that . He says stupid one liners and moves in a manner more designed to be funny then scary . Is this a comedy or a horror movie ? Its a problem that goes beyond the one liners to much of the dialog and set up . It seems more send up of every cliché than heartfelt horror film . I some how expect that the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind , horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace it.<br /><br />Despite the good looking monster this is a film to avoid . Even if you pick it up in the bargain bin for under five bucks , you 're paying too much.<br /><br />Avoid .
0 With all the excessive violence in this film , it could 've been NC-17 . But the gore could 've been pg-13 and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass bad - hairdewed boy friend . There was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch , then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow , there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people . The violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this . ALmost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off , but the teacher who called him " white trash " and " hoodlum " ( though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum , not even close , i know hoods and am part hood , they do n't draw in class , they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher ) . The teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters , but was just stabbed in the back . There were two suspenseful scenes in the film , but did n't last long enough to be scary at all . As i said , the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off . If the gore was actually fun to see , then it would 've been nc-17 . Two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields , they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was , they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines . His stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach , though i would 've liked to see that . The acting was pathetic , characters were losers , and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts . I suggest renting this movie for the death scenes , i wo nt see it again anytime soon , but i enjoyed the excessive violence . Also , do n't bother with the sequel , i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death , it sounds good but is n't . The original scarecrow actually kept me interested .
0 The director states in the Behind - the - Scenes feature that he loves horror movies . He loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to Dario Argento , as well as other notable directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper . Basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh*t for Mother 's Day . The first thing they did wrong was the casting . CAST PEOPLE THAT CAN ACT . Also , do n't cast a person that is 40 years old for the role of a misunderstood , 18 year old recluse . That 's right , he 's been in high school for 22 years . The reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing . Or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn ( haha get it ) , and his girlfriend just goes , " Oh .. my .. God ? " The scarecrow himself is quite a character . Doing flips off cars and calling people losers.<br /><br />The movie does have one redeeming factor ... oh wait , no it doesn't.<br /><br />If you absolutely MUST see this movie , than just watch the Rock and Roll trailer on the DVD . It covers about everything and has a really gnarly song dude .
0 Scarecrow is set in the small American town of Emerald Grove where high school student Lester Dwervick ( Tim Young ) is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers & fellow students alike . The poor kid suffers daily humiliation , bullying , teasing & general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers . Unfortunately he does n't find much support at home since his mom is a slut & after Lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field & strangles the poor kid . However something magical happens ( no , the film does n't suddenly become good ) , Lester 's spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him & made his life hell ... <br /><br />Co - written , co - produced & directed by Emmanuel Itier who according to the IMDb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called Mr. Duforq although I do n't remember any character of this name , I suppose anyone who ends up looking at the IMDb pages for Scarecrow will probably already be aware of it 's terrible reputation & I have to say it pretty much well deserved since it 's terrible . The script by Itier , Bill Cunningham & Jason White uses the often told story of one of life 's losers who gets picked upon & tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick . We 've seen it all before , we 've seen killer scarecrows before , we 've seen faceless teens being killed off one - by - one before , we 've seen one of life 's losers get his revenge before , we 've seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before & we 've seen incompetent small town Sheriff 's make matters even worse before . The only real question to answer about Scarecrow is whether it 's any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level ? The answer is a resounding no to be honest . The film has terrible character 's , awful dialogue , an inconsistent & predictable story , it has some cheesy one - liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he ask 's ' can you dig it ? ' & the so - called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame . The film moves along at a reasonable pace but it is n't that exciting & the kills are forgettable . You know I 'm still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed & killed with a stick of corn ... <br /><br />Director Itier does n't do a particularly good job here , the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there 's never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off . Also I 'm not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back - flips & somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in The Matrix ( 1999 ) or some Japanese kung - fu flick ! To give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good & he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad one - liners & twirl around a bit . Do n't you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring ? I know he 's a killer scarecrow but I still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day ! There 's no nudity & the gore is n't anything to write home about , there 's a decapitation , someones face is burnt , someone is killed with a stick of corn , someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat , some sickles are stuck in people 's heads , someone has their heart ripped out & someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $ 250,000 this was apparently shot in 8 days , well at least they did n't waste any time on unimportant things like story & character development . Technically this is pretty much point , shoot & hope for the best stuff . If you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing ... The acting sucks , the guy who played Lester 's mum 's bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig & fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film & the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous & do n't get me started on his accent ... <br /><br />Scarecrow has a few fun moments & the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make - up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made , badly acted , silly , too predictable & very cheesy . If you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out Scarecrows ( 1988 ) . Not to be confused with the Gene Hackman & Al Pacino film Scarecrow ( 1973 ) or the upcoming horror flick Scarecrow ( 2008 ) which is currently in production . Scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels , Scarecrow Slayer ( 2003 ) & Scarecrow Gone Wild ( 2004 ) .
0 This movie is so aggrivating . The main character looks like he 's 35 and I 've seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy . The plot twists are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor factor.<br /><br />Also some of the worst dialogue I 've heard in 3 years , " lets go find a small animal to torture".<br /><br />Ugh ..... I ca n't even continue , do n't watch this pile of garbage , it was made in 8 days.<br /><br />The one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a faggot for drawing pictures.<br /><br />2 out of 10 , unwatchable
0 Holy @#% & this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with . I tried to watch this pile of festering waste but found it easier to slash my wrists and slug back a shooter of Lysol floor cleaner than endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen . I rank this well below anything I have ever watched on film or TV , and that s saying something . I once witnessed a cow crap in a field . I watched the steaming pile for a hour and a half , who knows ... it might have moved or something . Well that was time better spent than watching this tripe . The acting was non - existent , the plot was somewhere other than on this film . I think I saw a cut seen early on where the plot managed to escape and was riding off in the background on the back of a old pickup truck heading to Portland in hopes of becoming a Steven King shi77er . Please tell me director is getting medication he so desperately needs . It 's pretty clear he needs heavy medication and I 'd willing to front the money needed for his lobotomy reversal . Bah ... I ca n't give this review the full punch it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in typed word alone . Let me just say that if your looking for a flick to pass some time and you see this Chilton on the rack , walk to your car , start the engine , then shove both of your fists straight into the fan until it you ca n't feel your bones vibrate anymore . Be sure to have your wallet in hand also because you were going to waste the cash anyway . You might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself.<br /><br />By the way , I watched this after a " buddy " of mine sent his girlfriend over so I could see it . HE dint come over , SHE had too . What s worse is that she had to watch this $ % & @ thing TWICE ! I heard their married now and he gets to visit his balls once a month . I hope it was because of this film .
0 I saw this not too long ago , and I must say : This movie is terrible . I watch crappy movies for fun . Scarecreow is not fun . Scarecrow is stupid . You have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victims(actually worse than the one contained in this sentence ) . He has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings . " Everyone picks on me . The only girl that thinks I 'm not trailer - trash likes one of the guys that pick on me . I want to kill everybody . Wah . " OK , I 'm exaggerating . But the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies.<br /><br />Adding to what I just said , the kid 's mom is promiscuous , he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on , mom 's boyfriend tells him to leave , kid refuses , insisting that he is n't going to leave his own house . Boyfriend chases kid into corn field . He kills kid right in front of mom , mom screams in terror , boyfriend is like , " OMG ! I did n't mean to ! " Then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it . Kid was killed under a scarecrow , though . So , like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow , he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance . His victims " have n't been stalked like this before ... " ( Scarecrow 's official tag line)<br /><br />To make matters worse , this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 days . That 's right , 8 days . I was going to give this movie a 2 , because in spite of itself , it has one or two redeeming moments . ( They 're spoilers , so I wo n't spoil it for you , if you actually want to see this crap . ) I could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting , the horrible special effects , the abysmal script , and the bad camera work , but I simply have no respect for lack of effort on that level.<br /><br />This movie is n't nearly as good as I 'm making it out to be . If you want to see an example of how not to make a movie , or if you enjoy watching bad movies , like I do , then watch this at your own risk . Everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times .
0 WOW is all i can say if your reading this is either watched it or are thinking about it . trust me watch it!<br /><br />i laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie the worst acting ever made is very funny ! I ca nt believe they superimposed the school sign ! I must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time . If a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies . even the costume was bad . it looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job on making it . heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well . all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first . its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done . hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out , just not like this one .
0 Perhaps one of the worst teenage slasher films I ever did see . I 'll start with the bad points of t he movie , which pretty much covers the entire film . First of all , something no one can avoid : TERRIBLE ACTING . I swear they picked up some random kids off the street based on how they looked . Secondly , BAD / UNCONVINCING CHARACTER WORK / DEVELOPMENT . You hardly even know half the kids who are killed in here . All you figure is that they deserved it one way or another . The scarecrow 's character was overdone , and a cheap rip - off of the other great fantasy killers such as Freddy or Pinhead . Next : BAD DIALOG : The Scarecrow was full of horrid one - liners that would make you laugh , only because it was so terrible . Lines like " Let 's go find some small animals to torture ! " really just leaves you with an eyebrow raised . Last but not least : Next off : BAD CASTING . How old was the guy who played Lester ? Like 30 ? The back of his head was balding for God 's sake . There is much more I could say about this film , like it 's cheap special effects , it 's " high school film class " effort , but the point is understood . It 's just bad film making at it 's worst . As for what I found to be " good " in the movie : -Entertaining for those with low , low , LOW standards -Would help put insomniacs to sleep . -A very cheap laugh , or even a giggle .
0 First off , let me start with a quote a friend of mine said while watching this movie : " This entire movie had to have been a dare . You know , like , ' DUDE , I BET YOU COULDN'T MAKE THE WORST MOVIE EVER ' " . With this movie , they 've made a good effort at achieving that title . The effects are , of course , poor . The plot / dialogue is like a collage of of bits stolen from every B horror movie ever made . The actors , I 'm assuming , are supposed to be in college . Yet parts of it ( especially at the beginning ) make it seem like they 're supposed to be in high or middle school . It makes no sense . The Scarecrow going around killing people is n't the least bit enjoyable . ( SPOILER : At the end , when they chant Lester 's name and he reappears , the black guy and Scarecrow are both laughing , probably out of relief they were on their last scene , and at the cheesy dialogue . )
0 Let 's face it ; some lame kid who dies and has his soul transfered into a scarecrow . Das no gon na happen neva ! OMFG This stupid loser kid who ca n't stand up for himself gets his ass handed to him by some drunk bastard screwing his mom . Right as he dies , he looks up at the scarecrow and he let 's his spirit go into the scarecrow . The drunk guy covered up his death by making it seem suicidal and thought he had gotten away with it . We later see he is tossed out of the trailer and later earns another encounter with the scarecrow . They had a brief encounter which includes the drunk calling him a loser and the scarecrow rebounding with " Takes one to know one , loser ! " The scarecrow flips off the building , calls him " daddy - o " , and then beheads the poor man . We can see how this awesome movie unfolds from that . He goes on to kill many people , afterward . He mainly kills the people who gave him a hard time in rl and goes off to kill some random ass people , just for some laughs . No laughing here . He adds a punchline to every kill , too . Every time he killed someone , he would do some karate flips and finish it all off with one of his signature punchlines . In the case of someone who was hard of hearing , he would say " Here , have an EAR of corn ! " then shove it up their ass . OR we can actually take an example from the movie ! He just got done killing a cop and was on his way to killing the only person who ever stood up for him . Her father , the sheriff , yelled to the madman to stop , and he said " Hey , stay awhile ! " and threw a dagger threw his chest and stuck him onto some tree . In the end of the movie , he killed two guys and threw in the punchline " Got ta split ! " and killed two guys by shoving a scythe into their heads . Wowzors , this movie made me want to cream my pants so bad . Maybe next time this guy makes a movie , it wo n't be gay .
0 I 've got ta say , I usually like horror movies that i 've never seen ... however , this one was just to pathetic for my gory taste . I 'm used to the gory , gut wrenching types ... but this particular movie was lame . The acting was horrible ( yet the corny ( no pun intended ) one - liners were cute ) . And the sequel to it , Scarecrow Slayer was even worse ! Yes , probably , when it first came out , there was a huge rave about it and people liked it . But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose come out , movies like these make movies like Scarecrow seem childish . If you want a movie to just pass the time , pick this one ! The special effects are cheesy as heck . But seeing that it was a low budget movie , I can kind of see where that would come in . This will kind of remind you of the movie " Children Of The Corn . " Independent movies rock .... most of the time . So if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs , or in the sequel , 2 scarecrows going at it , then these movies would be for you .
0 I 'm watching this on the Sci - Fi channel right now . It 's so horrible I ca n't stop watching it ! I 'm a Videographer and this movie makes me sad . I feel bad for anyone associated with this movie . Some of the camera work is good . Most is very questionable . There are a few decent actors in the flick . Too bad they 're surrounded by what must have been the director 's relatives . That 's the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie ! Music was a little better than the acting . If you get around to watching this I hope it 's because there was absolutely NO other option ! The sequel ( yes sequel ) is coming on now .... I think I 'll skip it ! Jason
0 Wow , what can I say about this film ? It 's a lousy piece of crap . I 'm surprised that it got rated as high as it did . What 's wrong with this film ? Here 's a better question : What 's NOT wrong with this film.<br /><br />The story itself is just crap and cliché . Here 's pretty much what it 's about ... Some kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on , gets killed , and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge . " All " of that is packed into 86 minutes of worthless film . If you have n't seen this movie do n't waste your time watching it . Also , the second one is n't much better , so do n't bother watching that either ... I rated this movie a three because I liked the scarecrow 's outfit , not because there was anything good about the movie . I think you get the picture .
0 A far as B - movies go , SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad , that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through . A lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls , ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck . He then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him . Apparently , the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers . This scarecrow , aside from having a snappy one - liner for each of his victims , can also do Matrix - like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight . Also , why did he always look like a rotted corpse ? Just like the two needless sequels that followed this , this is n't even worth a laugh .
0 Okay , ' enjoy ' is a pretty relative term , but flexibility is in order when you 're dealing with a filmmaker of James Glickenhaus ' calibre.<br /><br />McBain is truly one of the most ridiculous , over the top action films I 've ever seen , without the nasty edge of The Exterminator . Other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film 's heroic middle aged commandos , but how about making a film in the Philippines that is set in Colombia ? All the extras are Filipino . In fact the only character who looks remotely Hispanic is good ol' Victor Argo as the much reviled ' El Presidente ' ! Oh yes , we also have Maria Conchita Alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader . There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of American imperialism .
0 I purchased this film on the cheap in a sale , having read the back of the DVD case and assuming that either way I ca n't lose , it if was rubbish then no loss , if it was any good then bargain ... <br /><br />Then I watched it ... <br /><br />I am normally a fan of Christopher Walken , but in this film he commanded very little screen presence , seeming not to do a whole lot , even the death of his friend near the beginning which sparks off the " action " in the plot seems to affect him very little , and his eventual revenge is just boring and undramatic.<br /><br />Normally a film which has themes as grand as revolution and revenge are able to capture the audience and snare them into feeling something for the characters , however watching this film felt more like seeing a series of confused , and almost random events that loosely tied together towards it 's eventual conclusion ... <br /><br />At this point I wept ... <br /><br />I thought this film was the most horribly painful piece of viewing I have ever been subjected to , the scene where the pilot sacrifices himself by refusing to jump out the explosive laden truck due to not wanting to kill any civilians is not so much tragically sad as it is unnervingly horrible and painful , although not quite as bad as the emergency surgery on the wounded girl . The acting was poor all round , the script and story was weak , the " action " was even weaker , and the " visuals " were but bluntly not all that visual . To summarise there are films which are good , films that are bad , films that are so bad they are good , films that are terrible ... <br /><br />And then on a whole new level is " McBain "
0 This was an absolutely terrible movie . Do n't be lured in by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside . Both are great actors , but this must simply be their worst role in history . Even their great acting could not redeem this movie 's ridiculous storyline . This movie is an early nineties US propaganda piece . The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions . Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony , and her pseudo - love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning . I am disappointed that there are movies like this , ruining actor 's like Christopher Walken 's good name . I could barely sit through it .
0 Creep is the story of Kate ( Potente ) , an intensely unlikeable bourgeois bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train , and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station . After somehow meeting workmate and would - be rapist Guy on a mystery train that runs after the lines have closed , things go awry and she finds herself pursued by what lurks beneath the city 's streets . Her story is linked to that of George ( Blackwood ) , an ex - con working in the sewer system ; they meet in the final third of the film , brought together by their attempts to escape the monster that pursues them.<br /><br />The pair proceed through a set of increasingly unlikely locations ; from the Tube station , they end up in the sewage works before somehow finding themselves in some sort of abandoned underground surgery . Most Tube stations do n't have toilets , so how one has a surgery is beyond me . Naturally , the film cares to explain that the surgery does n't have running water . Yet it has electricity ? Just one of many inconsistencies that work against the atmosphere of everyday believability that the film tries to create.<br /><br />The monster itself is a problem . There 's a complete lack of reasoning for its actions , it just kills people for no obvious reason . And then of course it keeps some alive for no real reason either , perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra 15 minutes or so running time . I understand that natural evil is supposed to be scary , but then the film attempts to explain itself via a photo of a doctor and his son , and a few shots of some jars containing babies , and yes , it is just as tired and pathetic as it sounds . It also fails to explain how the creature has been underground long enough to lose the ability to speak , communicating only in raptor screams , but not long enough for its pair of shorts to decay . Hmm.<br /><br />This doctor business leads to scene that is the film 's desperate attempt to implant itself on your memory , and while it is gory and uncomfortable to watch , it just is n't enough . The final third of the film hinges on an emotional relationship that never existed , and the characters break down and recover for little or no obvious reason . George breaks down , unable to cope with something despite stating that he wants to escape so he can see his daughter again , and Kate becomes emotionally tough seconds after going to pieces over someone that ripped her off for a travelcard . Yeah.<br /><br />After starting out as a " this could happen to anyone " movie , it quickly falls apart as it introduces ideas that make it more and more unrealistic . A complete lack of emotional interest in the characters and an absence of suspense make this one to avoid .
0 The London Underground has something inherently creepy about it , with its long winding tunnels , the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground , and of course the rats roaming the tracks . It a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often . It was used in the seventies horror Deathline aka Raw Meat , featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel , and the celebrated chase sequence in American Werewolf in London . So I was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent UK production Creep.<br /><br />I thought the film started off well , with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving , followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of London . However , Creep went downhill from here , and I found myself wishing that I 'd switched it off after this opening scene , leaving me with a favourable impression of the film . All the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable , even Potente herself , and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness . he also made the mistake of showing the " monster " in full lighting , where he ceases to become remotely scary , and reveals his name to be Craig . How can you have a monster called Craig ? It turns into an X Files - type thing , and reminds one of the episode Tombs . In fact , I was wishing Mulder and Scully would turn up and sort them all out for me.<br /><br />As for the infamous sexualised violence , it is very graphic , disturbing and totally unnecessary . It seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value . The trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror , which is a mistake as it 's only halfway through the film.<br /><br />So there you go . The only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from Ken Campbell , one of my favourite occasional actors . You do n't see him very often , but when he 's on screen he acts everyone else into a corner . Casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius , unfortunately the only one evident in the film .
0 The potential was there . I saw Creep and thought , ' Oooh , this is getting interesting ' several times . Yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored , like they never happened . The lead character was irritating throughout the movie , and at one point my fella and I both shouted that we wanted her to die . There are some genuinely spooky / scary moments , but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me . It 's another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while , but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve.<br /><br />The one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy , but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you 're on to a loser .
0 I 'll keep this short as a movie like this does n't deserve a full review.<br /><br />Given the setting , this movie could have been something really special . It could have been another " 28 days later " or even a " Blair Witch Project" < br /><br />The first 20 or so minutes of the movie I was really excited , directer did a decent job with cinematography and suspense , although I do n't think He managed to capture true eeriness of an empty London Underground.<br /><br />Characters were a big let down . Our " heroine " in this movie is a worthless piece of crap , and you really do n't care if she dies or not . As many people have said before , I was rooting for the homeless people and the black guy , who managed to give me a chuckle or two(whether intentional of the writers or not).<br /><br />The main villain , is kept in the dark for the first half of the movie , but when he is revealed I was really disappointed . I wo n't spoil it but lets just say my 10 year old sister could probably beat him in a wrestling match.<br /><br />All in all this is just another mediocre horror film which falls into the trap of following a simple Hollywood formula . This film had a lot of potential but really failed to hit the mark.<br /><br />Just to highlight how lame this movie was , the characters in this movie had at least FIVE TIMES to finish off and kill the main villain . INSTEAD THEY RUN AWAY .
0 I was so disgusted by this film , I felt obligated to warn off others . This film has no story , plot or hint of purpose . The film starts after the standard " lets be scary " movie intro , which by now every film watcher has become accustomed . So we can ignore the beginning completely . We are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static . ( Unless you have seen white noise - EEK ) Acting is a DISGRACE and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came . Having said that , even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able . Their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster . Senseless violence and what I can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up " eccentric " writer , who probably considers himself to be an artist , has resulted in a film which will test your patience . It was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said , " We have been watching this for 45 mins " did I realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag . Clearly something was missing and unfortunately it was n't the audience . Rather than suggest what the film is missing , let me tell you what it has : Dumb Blonde ( surprise surprise ) , Victims , bad - monster - guy - thing , about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours , days , weeks , months ... and credits.<br /><br />Want a silver lining ? Well , the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes , but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film !
0 Absolutely laughable film . I live in London and the plot is so ill - researched it 's ridiculous . No one could be terrorised on the London Underground . In the short time it is not in service each night there are teams of maintenance workers down there checking the tracks and performing repairs , etc . That there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely . Or that it 's even possible to get locked in and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age ... <br /><br />The worst that 's likely to happen if someone did find themselves there after the last train is that they might get graffiti sprayed on them . Although this has been coming under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network , another thorn in the side of the story . ( Remember in London as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.)<br /><br />If it had been set in a city I am not familiar with perhaps I could have enjoyed it through ignorance , but it 's not a high quality film so I just could n't bring myself to suspend my disbelief and try and enjoy it for the banal little tale that it is.<br /><br />I would have given it 0/10 if such a rating existed ! Possibly the most disappointing film I ever thought I would like .
0 Yet another example of the complete waste of UK Lottery money . Just how commercial did this film prove . The Film Council , who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded , on one of the London Undergrounds disused stations , for allowing this clichéd , dismal specimen to be committed to film , a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate , most notably Deathline . Amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute . It 's a little bit too late then ! Surely all those development executives , at the UK Film Council , could have noticed this at the script stage . Add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare .
0 ! ! ! ! ! OF COURSE THERE 'S SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! I 'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies : Female protagonist - Check Bad things happen to drug takers - Check Heorine knocks out villain - Check Heroine does n't notice villain recovering unconsciousness - Check Frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - Check Unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class . Dear oh dear if only London transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here . In fact there 's so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he 's been killing people on the underground . I 'm led to believe it 's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it 's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless Not to be totally negative I doubt very much if the producers thought they 'd be making a film that was going to sweep the Oscars that year and there 's always a market for horror movies . Likewise I doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the DVD market rather than cinema distribution and I will state that it 's slightly better than 1972 's DEATH LINE which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the London underground . it 's just that when you think all the clichés have been used up in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head
0 ...... in a horror movie that is . Alright first off , lets start with Kate . Her main goals include getting laid by George Clooney , looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over . Got ta love her . She had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but ..... instead she ran . I mean she did n't wanna bring Guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was too late . I mean the guy tried to rape her . I ca nt get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot . I mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night . The movie kept going on . And as a result lost all its credibility .
0 Okay I must say that before the revealing of the ' monster ' . saying that he really did n't fit into that category , just some weird thing that had an annoying screech ! And personally I think a granny could have ran away from that thing , but anyway . I actually was getting into this film , although having the main character a drunk and a heroine addict did n't come as an appeal . But such scenes as when she runs away from the train , and you can see the figure at the door was kind of creepy , also where the guard had just been killed and the ' monster ' put his hand on the screen.<br /><br />But then disaster stuck form the moment the monster was revealed it just became your average horror , with limited thrills or scares . Slowly I became more bored , and wanted to shut the thing off . I like most people have said was rooting for the homeless people to make it , specially the guy , he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there . I think this film could have really been something special instead it became what every other horror nowadays are ! Just boring and well not worth the money.<br /><br />if you are looking for a cheap scare here and there , or a mindless gore fest ( which is limited , hardly any in fact ) by all means give it a go , but for all you serious horror watchers look somewhere else , much better films out there .
0 Please , be warned : this movie , though a pretty bad storyline , was one of the most gruesome movies I have seen ... EVER . Just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie.<br /><br />So , it officially begins with a party . Just your average party but there 's some guy there . He 's pretty into Kate ... if you know what I 'm saying . Memorise his face ; it 'll help later.<br /><br />So anyway Kate goes of to find George Clooney ( did n't I say the plot was bad ? ) and so takes the tube . That 's London underground at the middle of the night , but she 's just stupid like that . So the timetable says the next , and last , train will come in 7 minutes . Now Kate , dumb party girl that she is , decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes . Typically , she misses the train and finds herself locked in the London Underground . Alone . Well , almost ... <br /><br />So the movie just carries on from there . Blood , guts , limbs , even certain parts of the body I shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body.<br /><br />In short , it 's a typical horror ; pretty but thick damsel in distress - type women and sick , weird psycho . Or as the case may have it , Creep.<br /><br />I'd say give it a go if you 're into Saw , Hostel or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre but for the rest of us , Scream with satisfy out horror needs thankyou very much .
0 This film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized . There are two routes to take in horror films : either you do n't really explain what 's going on ( or who the killer is , like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre ) or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained ( Halloween could potentially be an example of this).<br /><br />Unfortunately , Creep fails in this area . I see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for Craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation . No character is fully realized , although the circular nature of Kate 's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story.<br /><br />In the end , this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film - making that drag down the film.<br /><br />This film will go down as another example of a film ( as most are ) that could be so much better even though it would never be great . The only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting : the characters , story , direction , and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift.<br /><br />Creep does serve a purpose as a mindless , silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment , but sadly , that 's about it ...
0 Basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970 's classic kitsch horror ' Death Line ' which ironically was like this cobblers , also partly filmed at the disused Aldwych underground station.<br /><br />Making good use of the now disused Jubilee Line platforms at Charing Cross as well as the aforementioned Aldwych , this film contains basically the same plot - dodgy murdering mad zombie in the tunnels preying on the lost passengers who have missed the last train - originality is not this film 's strong point.<br /><br />Indeed strong points are sadly lacking . The gore ranges from the poor to the unnecessarily over gory whilst the sub - Gollum nutter is never really fully explained as seems little more than an under developed plot device.<br /><br />Franke Polente has little to do with a thin script than run down a lot of tunnels and scream every so often , indeed she was like pretty much everyone else in this film , out - acted by a small dog and a pack of tame rats.<br /><br />If creepy films set on the London Underground are your bag , or you just want to play ' spot the tube location ' them pick this up on DVD when it hits a bargain bin . If you are looking for classic horror , go and dig up a copy of Death Line ( aka Raw Meat).<br /><br />If you are looking for a quality well written and acted film , you will need to change trains .....
0 Creep - " Your journey terminates here . " Some very graphic scenes and ... well , yeah , that 's about all for this film.<br /><br />No real plot , no storyline . No likable characters , well , ' characters ' is n't correct considering you do n't have a clue who anyone really is . I mean , they are being chased by some weird looking ' thing ' in the sewers ( who is this thing ? why is he there ? ) , that 's quite scary I guess , but do I really care ? No , I do n't . Why do n't I ? Because I do n't have a clue who these people are and I do n't know if I should want them to live or die . It 's one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you , which it rarely does.<br /><br />This film lacks any meaning , any purpose . It feels like I fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up . It jumps right into the action . Basically , some women and her friends get locked in the London Underground , get chased by a weird creature , then they eventually escape from it.<br /><br />Creep has its moments which make you jump , the art is good , the location is excellent and the sounds are OK , but that is n't what makes a decent horror film , so unfortunately all that goes to waste.<br /><br />It 's nothing new . Another predictable modern ' horror ' , where Kate ( the lead ' character ' ) consistently does the stupid " hey , I know you lot sitting at home think I should do the sensible thing in this situation , but , oooh no ! I 'm going to do the total opposite because I 'm a dumb blond " thing . I wish they would n't do that , it 's done so many times , it 's boring and gets predictable . In fact , I 'm pretty annoyed the silly woman did n't get stabbed by the , erm , grey alien - looking creature.<br /><br />"Your journey terminates here " is the films tag line . Well , Creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film . If you 've had a few beers , got a couple of mates back at yours , then sure , watch it by all means . But if you want something original and clever , avoid .
0 I just rented Creep and was not at all impressed . I did n't feel anything in this film . I felt sick because the gore alone was shocking.<br /><br />I walked out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this film . Have n't we seen this all before ? I did n't like any of the characters barr the guy in the sewer cage . I felt bad for him . But then again I could n't think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the Creep ? So many questions need to be answered.<br /><br />Someone mentioned references to the PS2 game Silent Hill and I can see similarities vaguely.<br /><br />Not a bad film , not a good one . judge for yourself .
0 This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen . Worse than the most abhorrent American dross ; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in American dross par excellence . I can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals , and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea . it 's not . It is abject rubbish from very bowels of Satan himself ( who could probably have written a better script had he put his mind to it ) . Robert Jones as Exce Producer , spending our tax payers money ( lottery money folks ) on this piece of nonsense , should be accountable . Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re - make Deathline ? ? ? I ask you - camp as a Christmas Tree , Deathline ... ' Mind the doors ' is classic of really bad British film , we really do n't need a reminder . And we certainly do n't need a poor , second rate , badly scripted , badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this . All this this from the UK funding agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men ... I rest my case.<br /><br />Do Not Pay ANY money to see this . It is absolute and utter crap - the one saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge wedge of cash ... our cash ... for making it . They should hang their heads in shame.<br /><br />I am staggered at the low , low standard of this film . It makes me Mgr that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting . There is no hope for the British film industry whilst idiots are running the show . Harvey Wienstein where are you ? Come back , we forgive you ! ! !
0 All logic goes straight out of the train window in this British horror film , set in the London underground and starring the usually reliable Franka Potente ( Run Lola Run ) , Franka plays Kate , a businesswoman on the way from an office party to meet friends who falls asleep at an underground station , only to wake up and find she has been locked in and finds herself being chased by " someone " or " something " with killer intentions.<br /><br />Plot holes and unbelievability are rife and there are very few moments that are actually jumpy/ scary but plenty that are just plain dull.<br /><br />All in all an unpleasant film that should just stay locked underground forever and do us all a favour.<br /><br />The only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor Ken Campbell , who 's done better than this  that 's even including " Erasmus Microman"!.
0 I was really , really disappointed with this movie . it started really well , and built up some great atmosphere and suspense , but when it finally got round to revealing the " monster" ... it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems ...... again . Whoop - de - do . Yet another nutjob movie ... like we do n't already have enough of them.<br /><br />To be fair , the " creep " is genuinely unsettling to look at , and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy , but I 'm sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human , albeit a twisted , demented , freakish one . When I saw all the tell - tale rats early on I was hoping for some kind of freaky rat - monster hybrid thing ... it was such a let down when the Creep was revealed.<br /><br />On top of this , some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense . ( Spoiler ) < br /><br />Why the hell does the Creep kill the security Guard ? What s the point , apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says " HI I 'm A PSYCHO AND I LIVE DOWN HERE ! " ? Its stupid , and only seems to happen to prevent Franka Potente 's character from getting help.<br /><br />what the hells he been eating down there ? I got the impression he was effectively walled in , and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose ... so has he been munching rats all that time , and if so why do they hang around him so much ? Why is he so damn hard to kill ? He 's thin , malnourished and not exactly at peak performance ... but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that .cripple the non - psycho characters in the film.<br /><br />The DVD commentary says we are intended to empathise with Creep , but I just find him loathsome . Its an effective enough movie , but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me sick .
0 I was sadly disappointed by this film due to the fact that it felt false and the characters were not strong enough to carry the films pretty weak attempt at horror . The basic idea for the film was interesting but unfortunately it was n't able to excite , really scare or shock me - there was one part in the entire film that I thought was gruesome but even that did n't redeem it . I did get to like the character of Kate by the end of the film as she seemed to soften and become a little more realistic by the end , the character played by Jeremy Sheffield was not actually needed for this film and I think the director / writer got carried away with the myriad of characters used for no purpose , if he had left it at the basic characters making it more of a solo effort on Kate 's part , it may have worked - Jeremy 's acting was wooden to say the least and I felt uncomfortable watching the bad on screen chemistry - or lack of it . Such a shame . Disappointing .
0 Honestly , I went to see the movie , not because of the actors , not because of the plot but because it was rated 17 here in Luxembourg and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category . Believe me , being a movie - freak , I have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime ( Ichi the killer , Irreversible , Hellraiser ) but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I have ever seen . < br /><br />The plot is plain stupid , the directing is awful , acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of so - called " Horror Soundtracks " . There is n't a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie , and some of the scenes are really hard to stand . ( especially the scene , where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby cries -- horrible ) . I ca n't understand why the movie was rated 16 in Germany , where normally the criteria are real tough ( e.g. kill - bill ( brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to Asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing ) even a movie like state of grace is rated 18 ) . No one can call this a Horror movie , because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public ( Showing the " Creep 's " face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision ) ; for me ( excuse my expression ) it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies . In some scenes you see violence , that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything . The plot has holes and flaws , the dialog is boring , honestly I ca n't mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the British and Scottish accent.<br /><br />If I had something to say , I would ban this movie from the theaters , I fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to getting feedbacks to my thread and I 'd be happy to discuss about one or the other topic.<br /><br />"Livin ' the dream baby , livin ' the dream " David Aames
0 I am compelled to write a review of this IMAX feature as a means of warning others to SAVE YOUR MONEY . Almost any episode of Desmond Morris ' " The Human Animal " or David Suzuki 's " The Nature of Things " could have bested the material presented . Not only does the director fail to make use of IMAX 's incredible 65 to 70 mm film stock and gigantic presentation screen , everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned previously . Viewers are introduced to a pregnant Heather , her husband Buster , and their niece and nephew . We follow them for an interminable forty - odd minutes as they eat , sweat , listen to music , etc . Although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies ' natural diving reflexes , do we really learn anything more than most grade - school graduates ? Are we even remotely entertained by the trans - Atlantic Heather ? Do we care ? Avoid this film at all cost . If you do wish to see an IMAX feature , I suggest the beautifully photographed " India : Kingdom of the Tiger " or the technically thrilling " Space Station 3D " . Trust me .
0 This film differentiates itself from the run - of - the - mill " wonder of the human body " documentaries by bravely , if bizarrely , opting to elicit disgust in the viewer . In one scene , the camera closes in on a gigantic 50-foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it . In another , the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo . In a final tour de force , the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of ... teenage armpit hair . Unfortunately , I 'm not making any of this up . See this film if you must , but : bring your vomit bag , and do n't have pasta salad beforehand .
0 After what I thought was a masterful performance of two roles in Man From Snowy River , WHY was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel ? It just was n't the same without Spur and Harrison , as portrayed by Douglas . Maybe he recognized how poor the plot was -- Jim returns after extended absence , to find Jessica being pursued by another man . He could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him , and not find competition . For a Disney movie , this contains foul language , plus the highly unnecessary part when Jim & Jessica shacked up without being married -- very LAME . Quite an insult to viewer intelligence , according to members of my family . I 'll stick with the first one , and try to forget I ever saw the sequel !
0 The original movie , Man From Snowy River , is one of the best I 've seen , nearly perfect . A Lady and the Tramp storyline in two senses -- rich girl / poor boy , and ability vs. bloodline . The sequel , however , is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous , overblown Disneyfied mess best summarized as " Rambo Meets the Black Stallion . " Without the charm of The Black Stallion . The young hero comes back from a 3-year absence , and suddenly he 's Superman on horseback ; in the original , good film , he was real and believable , but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel . I 've hardly been as disappointed in a movie , and at times this thing made me quite angry -- they missed hardly a cliché . Brazen audience manipulation -- do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse - loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them , to make them happy ? A mess of a movie .
0 This film , like the first one ( " The Man From Snowy River " ) has the same good and bad features , perhaps even more so than the original . Unfortunately , the bad outweighs the good . < br /><br />The GOOD - Magnificent scenery , better than the first film . I love those high country shots in Australia . Tom Burlinson is still a likable guy , as " Jim Craig . " Bruce Rowland did a nice job with the music , too.<br /><br />The BAD - Once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine " Jessica " ( Sigrid Thornton ) who is a world - class pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her . In this film , we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father . Previously it was Kirk Douglas , now replaced by the always -profane Brian Dennehy . Speaking of that , it is a disgrace that a Walt Disney film would includes usages of the Lord 's name in vain . That was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the 1980s . This film , like the first one
0 I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne Brontë 's novel when I read it some time ago and usually particularly enjoy BBC dramas . But I 'm very disappointed , I never thought it would be as bad as that : the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me as the novel had.<br /><br />First of all , the music ( and songs ) seems totally out of place in a period drama ( sounds as if it 's been written for a contemporary horror film)and like another commentator , I was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun round the actors . I 've seen some scenes filmed that way in " North and South " and it seemed all right there but in The Tenant , it 's definitely overdone and simply annoying . Camera movements can not make wooden acting lively.<br /><br />Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at first and the script lacked clarity . None of the characters were properly introduced at first . The little boy gave a very good performance , he 's very cute and the best feature of the film.<br /><br />SPOILERS Tara Fitzgerald 's characterisation of Helen Graham made her appear cold and harsh , letting no emotion pass through . She does n't seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way . I just could n't believe Markham could have fell for her and I 'm not mentioning the awful hairdo she was given . I could not help feeling some sympathy with her husband ! Fancy being married to such a virago ... Besides , he was the only main actor that sounded right to me . Toby Stephens I found just OK , Helen Graham 's brother not very good . < br /><br />Maybe it 's difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak subjects as alcoholism and cruelty . Besides , what is only hinted at and left to the reader 's imagination in the book is dwelt upon with complaisance in the TV adaptation : making some scenes both gross and comic , ( like when Huntingdon 's eye starts bleeding ) and others far too sexed up for a period drama ! I mean , do n't we get enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas ?
0 Brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature , particularly the nature of addiction , which still resonate strongly today.<br /><br />As for the movie ... eh . Nothing special . The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and CIRCLING around everything , making the viewer quite nauseous . Why the director did n't put a stop to this is beyond me -- but maybe he was too busy trying , and somehow failing , to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately - cast actors . All in all , a weak adaptation . Your three hours would be better spent reading ( or re - reading ) the book .
0 Before I go on I have to admit to being a huge Bon Jovi fan . In fact that s what attracted me to the DVD case in the first place . I probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first Vampires title so much.<br /><br />But this is n't half as good . Not even Jon could save this film for me . My main problem would be that it simply is n't scary . Apart from Jon 's character Derek Bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you could n't care less whether they die or not , especially the annoying vampire / drug addict woman . The female vampire simply is n't scary or sexy . Rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl , no wonder she is so desperate for blood then . Another huge problem is that everything is just " too bright " . There is no atmosphere or sense of dread . I know the first Vampires being set in New Mexico was n't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be . This film has no tension like that.<br /><br />The story is basically the same as before . Vampire wants Berzier 's cross to be able to walk in daylight . However the story has less cool bits this time . There is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master - the original vampire , as in the first film . You really do n't care who or what this one is . There is no army of masters . Instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a Disneyland attraction then a creepy temple.<br /><br />So there you have it really . Lack of scares , lack of atmosphere , lack of interesting story . A real let down for me personally .
0 Really bad movie , the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complement.<br /><br />This vampire 's hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far , Derek Bliss ( Jon Bon Jovi ) , travels to Mexico in search for some blood suckers ! , he use some interesting weapons ( but nothing compared to Blade ) , and is part of some Van Helsig vampire 's hunters net ? , OK , but he work alone . He 's assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight ( is almost a sequel of Vampires ( 1998 ) directed by John Carpenter and starred by James Woods ) , Derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends : Sancho ( Diego Luna , really bad acting also ) a teenager without experience , Father Rodrigo ( Cristian De la Fuente ) a catholic priest , Zoey ( Natasha Wagner ) a particular vampire and Ray Collins ( Darius McCrary ) another expert vampire hunter . So obviously in this adventure he is n't alone.<br /><br />You can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor ( Jon Bon Jovi ) ; is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to James Woods , and then , if you watch the film ( i do n't recommend this part ) , you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories , totally predictable , with terrible acting performances , really bad special effects and incoherent events!.<br /><br />I deeply recommend not to see this film ! , rent another movie , see another channel , go out with your friends , etc.<br /><br />3/10
0 Listening to the director 's commentary confirmed what I had suspected whilst watching the film : this is a movie made by a guy who wants to play at making a movie . The plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when they 're going through that " I could write a book / screenplay / award winning sitcom " phase . There 's a germ of an interesting idea buried in there ( probably because its a sequel to some - one else 's movie ) , but it is totally buried under an underwritten , badly executed and laughably un - thought - out script.<br /><br />The lines are dire , and the performances are un - engaging , though again , I 'm inclined to blame the director . He does not appear to have consulted the actors at all about what is required , rather plonked the script in their hands , pointed the camera at them and told them to get on with it . Who knows , with a little coaching , these actors could have acquitted themselves better ( say what you like about musicians in movies , Jon Bon Jovi was excellent in Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in The Leading Man).<br /><br />As it stands , the cast have no chemistry whatsoever . A beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when , in order to infect Bon Jovi 's character with vampire blood from his ailing co - hunter , he is given a transfusion . She should have bitten him . Mind you , they should have looked vaguely interested in each other throughout the rest of the film too . The only real moment of sexual tension , between the two female leads , is by the directors own admittance accidental . He had originally intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for more pointless plot exposition - so , I suppose the finished product could have conceivably been worse . But not a lot.<br /><br />Frankly , as movies go , this is badly plotted , silly and forgettable . Even as trashy movies go it 's not sexy enough or gory enough to be entertaining . It could have been a fun and bloody little romp , but the director has left with more of a comedy , for all the wrong reasons .
0 This is not a good film . The acting is remarkably stiff and unconvincing . The film does n't seem to know whether it is going for a real horror approach or to go down the camp and kitsch route . I never saw the first film but this one does n't stand up on its own merits , there are several unconvincing plot twists and the viewer is never made aware of the importance of the lead female vampire . Not worth the effort of watching
0 First of all , Jon Bon Jovi does n't seem to be in place in a vampire movie . Together with the other not so interesting characters and the poor storyline the whole movie becomes predictable . If you keep that in mind and you 're a total vampire movie fan , you can have some fun with a few of the scenes . Do n't expect any Tarantino - style chapters here and neither an Anne Rice storyline . ( I expect to have have forgotten the whole movie by tomorrow ;)
0 Hi folks < br /><br />Forget about that movie . John C. should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits . bon jovi has never been and will never be an actor and the FX are a joke.<br /><br />The first vampires was good ... and it was the only vampires . This thing here just wears the same name.<br /><br />Just a waste of time thinks ... < br /><br />JAKE Scorpio
0 This movie is n't very good . It 's boring , and not much blood for a horror film . The plot just trods along with not much happening . And I think the female vampire was so stupid . She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes . But , whenever she has one of them pinned , she just takes her time and something always happens where she does n't bite them . No wonder this went straight to cable.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT : Not anywhere near as good as the first Vampire movie . You 're a SUCKER if you waste your time on this .
0 This movie was messed up . A sequel to " John Carpenter 's Vampires " , this did n't add up right . I 'm not sure that I enjoyed this much . It was a little strange . Stick to the first " Vampires " , it 's a good movie . " Vampires : Los Muetos " was n't a good attempt of a sequel.<br /><br />4/10
0 The last reviewer was very generous . I quiet like the first movie , but ca n't say I enjoy this one very much . The beginning is bearable , but it goes downhill pretty quickly . I just do n't see Jon Bon Jovi as a " bad - ass vampire hunter " and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary . A lot of the scenes just do not make sense . I mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you , let alone an experienced hunter . Why Una is able to communicate with Jovi ? Nothing was ever explain in this movie , you would n't mind if it was entertaining , but that was too much to ask . This has to be one of worst vampire movie I have seen .
0 Ugh , what can I say other than , ugh . I rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original Vampires . This movie could not have been any lamer . Lacking not only in plot , but the acting is atrocious . Combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch . Many times I questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark . Here 's a sampling of the lamer aspects ... <br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Professional " Slayer " insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night . He wakes up to a woman crying , sitting no more than 3 feet from him in the middle of nowhere . He immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance . She goes from crying to seducing him , and he lets it happen with obvious results ... <br /><br />One of the main characters is Zoe , was bitten by a Vampire , but as long as she takes these " experimental pills " she got in Mexico City , she 's fine , although her body temperature is below room temperature ... <br /><br />Guard outside of monastery where hero is staying the night is killed by vampires , hero leaves the next day . He then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left ... <br /><br /> ... avoid this movie .
0 I only rented this because i loved the first movie . However , calling it John Carpenters Vampires : Los Muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it . He is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film ( Jeepers Creepers Anyone?)<br /><br />A tragic storyline , terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing Vampire Hunter of all time . It 's not even comically bad.<br /><br />What we end up with is a dull , uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clichéd acting . It just reeks of low budget.<br /><br />Avoid like the Bubonic plague .
0 John Carpenter 's career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication . His excuse is that he only produced it . Jon Bon Jovi looks like a girl . In fact , Bon Jovi and the two Vampire girls , Natasha Wagner and Arly Jover probably all fit in the same clothes . In short , it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp - model sort of way . Bon Jovi has the most charisma . At least he looks happy when he is smiling . The two Vampire Girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints . At one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss , but stop . Amazing how each Vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires . At one point , Arly Jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb Vampire Hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act . It would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof , and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched Arly Jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening . As far as gore is concerned , a few heads are ripped off , and the blood spurts profusely . These scenes have so little suspense or build - up that when they happen it is almost funny , and there is no " horror " pay - off from the scene . All you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of " Wow , that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls . I wonder who has to clean it up . " Throughout the movie , these Vampire Hunters who are obviously trying to kill Arly Jover ( the top vampire in the world ? ? ) keep reaching out to her . At one point , Bon Jovi goes into the abandoned Church and after he just shot her with an arrow ( and has done so on other occasions ) , he says " I am not trying to hurt you . I just want to talk to you . I want to get to know you . " HUH ? ? Of course , the dumb vampire Arly jumps out to say hello and Bon Jovi sticks her again with another impaling device . " Why Ca n't We Be Friends " the 1970s hit song by WAR should have been the theme song for this movie . Aside from all of the other silly moments , there is a transfusion sequence when Natasha Wagner has all her Vampire blood removed , and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion . I guess Blood Type is not important ? Anyhow , all her Vampire blood is removed . Bon Jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him , he can beat Arly by becoming a vampire also . Of course , as the vampire blood is transfused into him , none of his healthy blood is removed . So apparently Bon Jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body . And just like the first VAMPIRES , this one also has the vampires - bursting - into - flames special effect .
0 Thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey , John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace . This movie sucks on so many levels it 's pathetic . The first VAMPIRES was fun , but this low budget retread makes me yawn.<br /><br />Jon Bon Jovi ( the poor man 's Kevin Bacon ) drives around Mexico with a surfboard housing a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear ala Antonio Banderas 's guitar case in DESPERADO . He picks up some lame " hunters " along the way ( including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes pills to keep from turning into a vampire ) , and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no backstory and so we could care less about her or her quest ( to walk in the sunlight by stealing the Black Cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so ) . If you 've seen the first VAMPIRES , you 've already seen this , and done much better.<br /><br />John Carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately . Frankly , I think he 's past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic . The only decent film he 's done since THEY LIVE ( 1987 ) is VAMPIRES . Everything else is complete crap , right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded GHOSTS OF MARS ... and now this waste of celluloid . Where are more greats like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 , HALLOWEEN ( 1 ) , ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING?<br /><br />Carpenter crony Wallace proves he ca n't write his way out of a paper bag with his paper - thin script packed with yawns , groans and recycled gags from the original . Did I mention I hated every character in the movie ? There was not a single memorable character in the whole film . How does that happen ? This film has nothing to recommend it . Not even the DVD presentation is good ; the menu looks awful.<br /><br />By comparison , JASON X : " FRIDAY THE 13th IN SPACE " was a masterpiece . Now that is how you make a sequel and ( re)energize a franchise , ladies and germs , as well as create an exciting DVD menu .
0 This " Debuted " today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is " I am speechless " I taped it today so I could watch it tonight after work . I had high hopes , Now I am tearing apart the closets looking for a length of rope so I can hang myself . Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen . I wish I could say something nice like " It was fun to make fun of this movie " but this movie is giving me nothing to work with . I know you are not supposed to post spoilers here with out prior warning but I am going to anyway " This movie sucks " There I said it ! They should show this flick to film students to show them what NOT to do ! My nine year old niece could make a better film . The only decent thing about this film is the sound and/or sound track . OH ! I just found a rusty C - clamp in my old tool box . I am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen . I could just tape over this VHS but I think I will burn it in the fire pit instead . I could wash with soap but I fear I will never be clean again . Christmas is coming . Buy this movie and give it to people you hate . -Mike
0 This movie is one of the most awful movies ever made . How can Jon Bon Jovi play in a movie ? He is a singer not an actor , What?Is he killing vampires with his guitar ? And what about the dreadful plot ? O my God this movie really sucks . In the end is the Queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover ( Blade ) surrounded by an army of vampires , but when the " fantastic " slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left ! ! What happened with the other 10 - 15 vampires ? They run out in the sun ? ? ? And what about the " Grand Finally " when Bon Jovi blows her head with a shotgun ? ? ? That 's really a " NOT " . In " Buffy the vampire Slayer " in 100 episodes not a single vampire is killed with A SHOTGUN ? ? ? This really is a lack of originality !
0 This movie was very very mediocre and very very gory . everyone left their acting lessons at home and totally forgot how to act I mean it was so bad and had no real plot and kindergarteners could have written a better story plot wait what story plot . not at all scary !
0 The same difficulty I have with the musical version of " Les Miserables " applies equally to " Oliver . " Instead of the composers ' writing in the stylistic period of the play settings , they merely wrote Broadway - type melodies , which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed.<br /><br />Too , the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties which permeate the score . It 's a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste.<br /><br />The casting of the boy Oliver does n't help matters : tentative of timbre and vexingly precious , there 's something less than solid here . Fagin performs his traditional routine adequately , though the tunes he 's obliged to sing have little basis in period manner.<br /><br />"As Long As He Needs Me " is given a strident rendition , throaty and strained . The two big production numbers , " Who Will Buy " and " Consider Yourself " seem over - produced , with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in . It 's one thing to go all out , yet another to cross over the line into excess . < br /><br />The gloom , despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography . While the novel is considered a classic , I must confess I have trouble with Mr. Dickens ' consciousness , in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration . This may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life , which was full of disappointment and regret . < br /><br />Not all the combined talent of this production , either on- or behind camera , can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material . All this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me.<br /><br / >
0 The producers made a big mistake casting Mark Lester , who could n't act or sing , in the title role . Aside from his very bad " acting " , all of Lester 's singing had to be dubbed by a girl . I do n't know why they cast him at all , since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well . Shani Wallis was far too old to play Nancy , who was only supposed to be 16 . The current West End version is so much better than the movie in every way . Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than Jack Wild ever was . It was clearly political to award this old - fashioned musical so many Oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968 .
0 Must every good story be " improved " with added corny Broadway music ? Apparently those who ca n't come up with their own plots think that classic literature is just there for the plundering . I confess that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites , as it is certainly true that Dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out , and this was a great example of just that ... So of course , take this serious tale and add nauseating music and camp it up with every character from prancing orphan boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it 's uplifting ? Argh . Fetch me a basin.<br /><br />The four stars in my rating come from casting , which I could liken to that of My Fair Lady . Each of these films had a cast that a play version could be proud of , but then they must go and have them sing ( see complaint above ) . Unlike My Fair Lady , those singing here could actually do so and they mercifully spared us the singing voice of Oliver Reed ( pardon if I 'm mistaken , it 's been a while).<br /><br />My biggest complaint I 've stated . Why embarrass everyone except the truly shameless by putting silly songs into a perfectly good story ? Seldom has this been done to good effect . Generally it ruins the story . It did with this one . Jury 's still out on whether this story is worth saving , but with all that gadding about , it 's impossible to tell .
0 I like musicals but as a Dickens fan I HATE this one . * * MILD SPOILERS * * Starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse ? The poor of London coming out to sing ? Fagin and Dodger walking off into the sunset ? Not exactly faithful to the novel . As I recall , Dodger was publicly hanged and Fagin went crazy in prison . * * END OF SPOILERS**<br /><br />Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes , doing little more than growling to indicate his evil . Worst however , is Mark Lester as Oliver , who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he 's really the main character . His portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl . Guess they did n't realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in England.<br /><br />Self - respecting Dickens fans : stick to David Lean 's amazing 1948 film or the BBC 6-hour adaptation from the mid-80 's . Avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical .
0 Well , I saw this movie yesterday and it 's - unfortunately - worse than you could think . First of all the plot is idiotic , it has no sense at all . The screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues . The audience was laughing many times . And the suspense is very low . Actors play so - so , with an exception of Sharon Stone , who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments . The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like " I want to * beep * you " and it looks like , let 's say it gently , a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all . That erotic tension from BI1 is totally gone . From the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical straight to DVD , but on a far lower lever than the original movie . For instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly . The director of Basic Instinct 2 is no Paul Verhoeven and it shows . The new composer is no Jerry Goldsmith and its shows . The script is done by people who are no match for Joe Eszterhas . There 's no substitute for Michael Douglas in it . The film looks cheap and badly edited at times . I 'm sorry but my first thought after I left the theater was : " Why heaven't they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie ? " All to all the original movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this . The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of break - thru in the popular cinema . It was provoking , sexy and controversial . It had the best Sharon Stone 's performance in her career . It had this specific Paul Verhoeven 's style . Unfortunately Basic Instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie , badly directed and a sure Razzie Award Winner in many categories . It 's a pity that they made this film .
0 It 's not like I have overwhelmingly fond memories of Verhoeven 's original pants - down shocker - it always struck me as a glossy , well - made airport - novel - of - a - movie . Thrilling , sexy trash , but trash nonetheless . It was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist . After a decade of anti - sex AIDS - induced hysteria , a film about a wildly - sexual hotbod who thrill - kills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff . Basic Instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy , so the fact that it 's desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sort - of be overlooked . All it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable . That it resoundingly fails on so many levels , and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved , is really quite extraordinary to watch . Let 's state the obvious for starters - Sharon Stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet Catherine Trammell . What was so photogenic thru Verhoeven 's lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gun - for - hire Michael Caton - Jones , who 's flat , drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot . I like Sharon Stone a lot , but if the first film launched her career , BI2 could kill it . She has no chemistry with stuffed - shirt David Morrissey - their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch . His dough - faced mamma 's boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering , orange - skin machismo of Michael Douglas . Supporting turns by David Thewlis and Charlotte Rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and cliché - heavy posturing . And what of the much - touted sexual shenanigans ? Poorly - lit , fleetingly - glimpsed , as utterly mainstream as an episode of Desperate Housewives - the European sensibilities that Verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed . Do n't watch this film for carnal thrills - there are none and what there is is tragic . The film is , as a whole , convoluted to the point of utter confusion , boring and laughable . The last 40 minutes in particular , where you come to the realisation that the film is , in fact , not going to go anywhere of interest at all , are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure . As a failed sequel , Basic Instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as Exorcist 2 The Heretic , Beyond The Poseidon Adventure and XXX2 . As a vanity project , it rivals Battlefield Earth in its misconception . As a multi - million dollar piece of Hollywood film - making , it 's a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst .
0 I saw this film at the London Premiere , and I have to say - I did n't expect much , but I did expect something that was at least mildly entertaining.<br /><br />The original " Basic Instinct " was no great film and is still something of a " smut classic " but it was entertaining . I can recall countless times flipping through channels on TV on a late Friday or Saturday night having come across the movie and finding myself beginning to actually pay attention to it.<br /><br />However , this lame - brain , waaay - belated sequel has nothing . Is Sharon Stone still gorgeous ? Well , let 's put it this way -- for a 47-year - old , she 's pretty hot . Is she as beautiful as she was in the original ? No . She also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face , and her haircut in this movie is somewhat unappealing . She does n't look as soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original -- which is sort of the whole point of being an evil seductress , and whatnot.<br /><br />The rest of the performances range from bad to terrible -- and Michael Caton - Jones ( a typically safe director -- one who does n't always do great work but manages to make worthwhile movies ) has officially delivered his first true turkey ; a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be serious.<br /><br />I hear the film went through multiple editing sessions , and it 's very clear from the start . Nothing makes much sense . The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the ending -- oh my ! Talk about stupid AND unbelievable . ( Still predictable , though . ) I saw " Gigli , " I saw " Son of the Mask " -- and although I 'm not looking to " smear " this film , I can say with my own authority ( which you do n't have to agree with at all , mind you ) that I prefer both those films over this catastrophic failure.<br /><br />By the way , Stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy - type nightclub.<br /><br />"Basic Instinct 2 " -- basically , it stinks , too .
0 It 's been about 14 years since Sharon Stone awarded viewers a leg - crossing that twisted many people 's minds . And now , God knows why , she 's in the game again . " Basic Instinct 2 " is the sequel to the smash - hit erotica " Basic Instinct " featuring a sexy Stone and a vulnerable Michael Douglas . However , fans of the original might not even get close to this one , since " Instinct 2 " is painful film - making , as the mediocre director Michael Caton - Jones assassinates the legacy of the first film.<br /><br />The plot of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks in right at the beginning . Catherine Tramell ( Sharon Stone , trying to look forcefully sexy ) is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder . A psychiatrist ( a horrible David Morrisey ) is appointed to examine her , but eventually falls for an intimate game of seduction.<br /><br />And there it is , without no further explanations , the basic force that moves this " Instinct " . Nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy , C - class erotic film . Sharon Stone stars in her first role where she is most of the time a turn - off . Part of it because of the amateurish writing , the careless direction , and terrifyingly low chemistry . The movie is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality ( a menage a trois scene was cut off so that this would n't be rated NC-17 ) than the first entrance in the series . " Instinct " is a compelling torture.<br /><br />To top it off , everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is not found anywhere in the film . The acting here is really bad . Sharon Stone has some highlights , but here , she gets extremely obnoxious . David Morrisey stars in the worst role of his life , and seems to never make more than two expressions in the movie- confused and aroused . " Instinct 2 " is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series , that managed to put in thriller with erotica extremely well . Paul Verhoeven , how I miss you .... <br /><br />"Basic Instinct 2 " never sounded like a good movie , and , indeed , it is n't . Some films should never get out of paper , and that is the feeling you get after watching this . Now , it is much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg dropped out , and why Sharon Stone was expecting a huge paycheck for this ...... -----3/10
0 It 's hard to believe , after waiting 14 years , we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage . The original was a high impact , dark thriller that achieved " cult " status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by Paul Verhoeven . This film adds nothing , delivers nothing , and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels.<br /><br />The opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast . Unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute dissertation in the self - indulgent life of Catherine Tramell ... or is it Sharon Stone . Possibly a copulation of both.<br /><br />If the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in " B.S.1 " , forget it . You wind up with soft - porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them . It 's interesting to note that the wonderful Charlotte Rampling was romping around in her skivvies , via the 1966 GEORGY GIRL , when Ms. Stone was only 8 years old . A very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here.<br /><br />If you 're a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system . If not , you might as well wait for the DVD release in the " rated " version , " unrated " version , " collectors " edition , or " ultimate " version , and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news of " Basic Instinct 3 " at which point Ms. Stone will be 62 years old and nobody will really care .
0 In my book " Basic Instinct " was a perfect film . It had outstanding acting on the parts of Stone , Douglas and all the supporting actors to the tiniest role . It had marvelous photography , music and the noirest noir script ever . All of it adding up to a film that is as good as it will ever get!<br /><br />This sequel is the exact opposite , it can not possibly get worse , bad acting and a lame script , combined with totally inept direction , this is really bad , boring , annoying . The only thing that somewhat keeps you concentrated is the relatively short wait for the next scene that is an exact re - enacted copy of the original . These copies are so bad they make you laugh and I laughed a lot in spite of myself , because it was like watching the demolishing of a shining monument . The only thing that is good in this horrible mess are the excerpts of the Jerry Goldsmith score of BI1 . Michael Caton - Jones and the half - wit responsible for the script even included the " There is no smoking in this room " dialog in the interrogation scene and yes she sends her attorney ( who is now a solicitor ) away ! < br /><br />I am sorry I have seen this awful film that should have never been made ! It does damage to the original , so bad is it . The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery ( and I am sure Ms Stone afforded the best surgeon money can buy ) can do a good job but can obviously not restore the perfection of the original . And what concerns the human body applies to film - making , too . There should be a law : Do n't ever make a sequel to a perfect film !
0 The film is pretty confusing and ludicrous . The plot is awful ... but on the plus side the acting is pretty good , with a few good shouts and rants . Sharon stone is OK this time ... not even half as good as the original mind you . The murders are n't as gory as the first one either , which is a shame . Its not the unpredictable mess everyone say it is though . The sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake ( they are fully clothed ) . The script is weak most of the time , but the scenes with banter and arguments between Dr . Glass and Washburn are highlights . The plot twists a few times , but the ending is awful . The tension is always constant with a huge dollop of ' Oh my god ! ' . The chase sequences are brilliantly directed , and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise , rush - felt film . Sharon stone is a bit old for this too . The bits where we see her breasts were , in the first one , delights . This time around , they are too horrid to describe . The films its self is rather average , but it is worth a go . Mainly because the film does deserve some good buzz ... with the opening sequence being a highlight . Not to be critical , but if you liked the first one - leave this one . Do n't ruin the run . You 'll be glad you left this stone unturned .
0 This film is awful . The screenplay is bad , the is script mediocre , and even the sex scenes are worthless . The thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking . This movie was shot in a dark , shadowy and monochromatic style ( a la " War of the Worlds " ) , which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film . Greg Morrisey 's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film . The twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here ; the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic . The only highlight is Sharon Stone 's performance as Catherine Tramell , faithfully continued in this sequel , but it is n't enough to make up for the other shortcomings . The only circumstance under which a " Basic Instinct 3 " should be made would be if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast .
0 After eagerly waiting to the end , I have to say I wish I would n't have joined the whole series at the first place . The final episode was everything against the previous seven years . It has ruined everything . The journey was 23 years , but captain Janeway has the power to reduce it ... let say , seven years only . Why seven ? Why not just one ? Or nothing ? Why not avoid the whole adventure ? Crewmemebers were dying all along the journey . Why she wants to save Seven of Nine only ? The others do n't count or what ? The most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them . As the say , " journey is more important than the destination " . Unbelievable . And at the finale scene the are surrounded by other Federation ships and the Earth is in sight . Nothing about landing , returning to the normal life.<br /><br />Worst ending ever .
0 I sat through almost one episode of this series and just could n't take anymore . It felt as though I 'd watched dozens of episodes already , and then it hit me ..... There 's nothing new here ! I 've heard that joke on Seinfeld , I saw someone fall like that on friends , an episode of Happy Days had almost the same storyline , ect . None of the actors are interesting here either ! Some were good on other shows ( not here ) , and others are new to a profession they should have never entered . Avoid this stinker !
0 I 've been going through the AFI 's list of the top 100 comedies , and I must say that this is truly one of the worst . Not just of the 90 movies on the list I 've seen , but of any movie I 've ever seen . Drunks are funny sometimes , Dudley is n't . Liza almost made it worthwhile , but alas ... just go watch Arrested Development if you want to see her in something good . Seriously , Dudley laughing and drinking is supposed to be funny ? I would highly recommend almost ANY other movie on the AFI 's top 100 comedies for more laughs than this . If you want to see a funnier " drunk " , try The Thin Man . Funnier movie in general , any Marx Brothers movie will kill ( especially if you 're as drunk as Arthur ) .
0 After the superb AANKHEN(2002 ) which was a remake of a Gujarati play he comes with WAQT which too looks like a stage play < br /><br />In stage plays , we have characters shouting , overacting here too the same < br /><br />The first half shows Amitabh almost kidding the 40 + Akshay Kumar who acts too funny like a small nerd < br /><br />The film has a good message how not to spoil your son but sadly the way Amitabh wants to make Akki responsible is absolutely fake < br /><br />Even his reason for hiding his sickness , his runnign from the hospital and the melodramatic speech by Akki is a put off < br /><br />Some emotions do touch you but most are too over the top < br /><br />Rajpal 's comedy is hilarious but too stretched in second half < br /><br />Direction by Vipul Shah is too overdone though some scenes are good Music is okay < br /><br />Amongst actors Amitabh overdoes it in the first half but is superb in emotional scenes Akshay Kumar too does his part well but looks umcomfortable in some too weepy scenes His chemistry with Bachchan is matchless Rajpal is a highlight , he makes you laugh without overacting and just his presence and his dumb behaviour and deadpan humour he is a riot Boman is good in some comic parts but too loud at places Priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do , this is her last film with Akki so far Shefali is awesome though she looks too young for Bachchan
0 I can not believe that the Indian film industry still puts out such third - rate dross as Waqt . For starters , the storyline is totally implausible  spoilt son gets thrown out of family home so as to teach him some self - sufficiency . So what does he do ? He promptly goes on to win some national talent contest by doing some star jumps in front of a panel of judges ( I honestly am not joking here ) . In the meantime , his dad is dying of lung cancer , but keeps it a secret from the son , but he survives long enough to see his son become famous , to see his new grandson and also make a new toy giraffe with his own hands.<br /><br />The acting is cringe worthy in its hamminess  no effort was made to try and act in any convincing manner by any of the main players in this film . As usual for Indian films , the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the concerns of the real world.<br /><br />To be honest , the main losers when such dire films are made are the intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a film . The actors , such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar , will still be revered as Gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in Bollywood .
0 I saw the 7.5 IMDb rating on this movie and on the basis of that decided to watch this movie which my roommate had rented . She said she had seen it before . " It 's funny and sad ! I cried the first time I saw it , " she gushed . Maybe compared to other Bollywood movies this deserves a 7.5 out of 10 , but in comparison to all the other movies I have seen in my lifetime , this deserves no more than a 3 . Any movie where I can perpetually guess what is going to happen next is no good for me . The characters are unbelievable , how the act is not realistic at all and their motives are contrived . It is over dramatic and the songs are n't all that great . My biggest problem with Bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety . All the emotions are way too overdone and thus not at all realistic . Any emotion or bond between characters that is the least bit subtle must be magnified with an unnecessary song . I think I understood that the relationship between the father and son was more like one between friends than one between a parent and child without having to have it conveyed via a five minute long song . The stupid comic relief complete with laugh track was not funny or necessary ( we get it , Laxman is n't the sharpest tool in the shed ) . If a movie tries to elicit tears through the most hackneyed means possible it just is n't meaningful , just a bit embarrassing.<br /><br />*****SPOILER*****<br /><br />Generally if someone has terminal stage lung cancer their son who lives with them would know something was wrong without having to be told . Too many plot holes to count . At first the movie was amusing and cute in the way Bollywood movies are to people who do n't watch them that avidly but it just got tedious . It takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is amusing and heartwrenching and the best way to do it is usually not having all the amusing parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartwrenching parts at the end.<br /><br />*****SPOILER OVER * * * * * Perhaps it had a very little more depth than other Bollywood movies that I have seen , but not much at all . I spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be funny . I did n't shed a single tear nor did I feel like it , rather I was overwhelmed with a feeling of disgust at the attempt at a dramatic ending . I do n't recommend this movie if you want to watch something good , I recommend it if you want to watch a Bollywood movie that is kind of sad .
0 This movie 's full title is " Waqt : Race Against Time " . That 's a race no one can ever win , but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious " waqt " on this bakvaas . This movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made K3 G look honest . It strained my credulity too far . It was ridiculously stupid in its storyline , and deserves to be mocked for it.<br /><br />It 's not quite as awful as Baghban or Black , but this movie has nothing to recommend it . Stupid , pointless , with a ridiculously OTT performance by Amitji . The central " plot " is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many " family " BW films . If my father , who raised me , and who I love dearly , treated me like Big B did Akshay , I 'd shoot him myself . To say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness .
0 Those 2 points are dedicated the reasonable performance from Akshay Kumar . I know Bollywood films do not really strive to be realistic but PLEASE a Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot . The father is dying and does what any good parent does ... kick his son out the son with his PREGNANT wife . A few things that were too hard to swallow- 1 . Priyanka ' cool indoor swimming pool in the bedroom ' and to go from that to living hungry in her in - laws garden shed ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 2 . Akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man , gets bitten by rabified dogs , to then just walk off . This film is an INSulT to our intelligence I really ca nt believe i contributed financially to the ' people ' who made this film by taking my family to see it , we left the cinema with a frown , please do not subject yourself to this mess to watching this take my advice and do not waste your ' waqt ' .
0 this is just usual Indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema , as Indians we can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry , however it also the worst.<br /><br />how can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage . take a look at Russia , Iran , china and Latin America , look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like Kisna!!<br /><br />get real people , no wonder the international community in general laughs at Indian cinema .
0 PROS : Akshay Kumar 's performance(is it just me or does this guy always manages to trump AB in their movies together ? ) . Some touching scenes in the 2nd half.<br /><br />CONS : The whole 1st hour(the jokes were flat to say the least ) . Every scene involving Rajpal Yadav . Major stupidity in AB 's decision making . Let me get this straight , he believes brutally insulting his son 's soul in every possible way(that will likely ruin their relationship beyond repair ) is a better way for him to make Akshay finally take some responsibility then actually telling him the truth ? ? WTF ? He considers Akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his OLD father is soon gon na die due to cancer , but thinks insulting him will make him stronger ? Am I the only one who does n't see the logic here ? Easily the movie 's biggest flaw.<br /><br />- Akshay becoming a stunt man . LMAO ! ! We 're told he finished 1st in college every year and has a degree in MBA . But when the time arrives to support himself , and his pregnant wife , he becomes a stunt man . LOL ! ! How abt actually applying for a normal job in ur field ? Or Heck , anywhere else where ur life is n't in danger ? This is some incredibly dumb writing.<br /><br />- The ending . I hate this sort of melodramatic crap . Everything is pushed down our throats to feel sorry for AB 's character , which I could n't . The entire thing reminded me a little too much of Srk in KHNH(which I hate ) . This " please feel sorry for the guy with the illness " crap has run its course . I felt more like puking than sympathy for the OLD man . Could n't watch the final 20 or so minutes because of it and thus had to fast fwd . the whole thing.<br /><br />Bottomline : Waqt is just too dumb to be called a good movie . Its obvious director Vipul Shah targeted this at the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who could care less about a story that actually makes sense . Give 'em some decent song picturizations , fancy outfits , plenty of glycerin - filled scenes and some star power and they 'll happily lap - up crap like this .
0 well well One ca nt b wasting time just cause of a big star - cast .. i think all i could see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor which will appeal to i do not know who ? some pathetic songs that will be heard by who ? some pathetically abrupt turnings justified by who ? race against time ? u mean waste against time ? OK so first you spoil your kid , then you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a brilliant new concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given but it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus rather than you going for such a wasteful movie to learn it Hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i ca nt waste my time writing about waste anyway !
0 First of all there is Gujarati Theatre then there is Bollywood . Both have their strengths and fan following . Director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of Gujarati Theatre when making a Bollywood production . First he made Aankhen ( adapted from a Gujarati play ) - which had a unique plot , but could not hold as a Hindi film . Now he 's adapted another Gujarati play and named it Waqt - a race against time . In sum , the emotions are alien . The plot development is not for Hindi films . For example , the role play between father and son is best left to Gujarati Theatre - do n't bring it in a Hindi film . Even the comedy track is best left for the Gujarati stage . All performances are average - nothing to shout about - barring Shefali Chhaya Shah who is fantastic .
0 I found this film to be quite an oddity . From the very get go I found it extremely hard to like this movie , and now after a little thinking about it I can pretty much pinpoint the reason why . Jean - Marc Barr , although I love him to bits ( I think Zentropa is one of the best movies ever made ) is quite miscast here , and although I ca n't figure for the life of me who would be better , I am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work . Everything else is fine , except for the stabs at weak comedy ( A Meet The Parents Joke is not really needed , filmmakers ! ) and I really like Richard E. Grant as the British Major . It just suffers from one thing .. Jean - Marc .
0 ALL FOR LOVE ( as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend ) is a romantic period drama featuring Captain Saint Ives a French officer in Napoleon`s army who is captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison . There`s also a storyline involving a murder .<br /><br />I will be honest and confess that I wasn`t too taken by the movie since I`m not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but I will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and it`s got a good cast that features Miranda Richardson , Anna Friel , Richard E Grant , Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs . The costume design as you can expect is also excellent < br /><br />I`ll be very surprised if this movie doesn`t get any complaints after being broadcast on BBC2 at teatime . Captain Saint Ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there`s a scene of French prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen . You really do have to worry if BBC schedulers have any type of clue as to what they`re doing
0 Around the late 1970 's , animator Don Bluth , frustrated with the output his company , Disney was churning , defected from the Mouse House to form his own studio . His first production , THE SECRET OF NIMH , was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day . This was followed by AN American TAIL and THE LAND BEFORE TIME , both of which were made under the involvement of Steven Spielberg and were commercially successful . Although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of NIMH , they still are very charming , enjoyable features for both children and grown - ups . But before long , Don Bluth had his first major misfire with ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN ; critics were especially harsh on this film , and matters were n't helped by the fact that it opened alongside Disney 's THE LITTLE MERMAID.<br /><br />Considering that the movie has such a friendly - sounding title , one would expect ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN to be pleasant family fare . Instead Bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling , deceit , crime , mistreatment , and murder . That itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say , but it does call into question over whether the film is for children . On the other hand , it 's hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN . In short , it 's a movie with a major identity crisis.<br /><br />Set in a dreary junkyard of New Orleans , the movie starts out when Charlie B. Barkin , a rough - and - tumble German shepherd , is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner , a nasty , cigar - puffing pitbull , Carface . Before you know it , Charlie finds himself in heaven , albeit by default . Here a whippet angel , Annabelle , tells him that " all dogs go to heaven because unlike people , dogs are usually loyal and kind . " This line represents the confused nature of the movie , since the dogs in the movie , the whippet aside , are presented as anything but.<br /><br />Upon realizing that he 's been murdered , Charlie steals his way back to Earth and plots to get even with Carface . With the reluctant help of his dachshund pal Itchy , Charlie " rescues " Carface 's prize , AnneMarie , a human girl who can talk to animals ( in order to predict who will win the rat races ) . Charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family , but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring Carface down . Although he refuses to admit it , Charlie does grow to love AnneMarie ... <br /><br />The concept of the story is n't as problematic as the execution . Aside from the human girl AnneMarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three - quarters through ( with the vocal pipes of Ken Page ) , none of the other characters emerge as likable , nor frankly , are even worth caring about . Unfortunately , that also applies to Charlie ; in trying to make him an anti - hero , the script ( composed by more than ten writers ) only succeeds in rendering the character TOO unlovable . As such , the audience feels no empathy for Charlie , and worse , his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing . ( Further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from Burt Reynolds . ) Besides the lack of an endearing lead , the movie 's other problem is in the structure of the story . The slowly - paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie 's running time . The aforementioned musical alligator ( who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats ) seems to have been thrown in from nowhere , as does a scene where Charlie tries to show his generosity to AnneMarie by feeding a pack of pastel - colored pups pizza . The whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft ; a bit more polish could have made this a tighter , impactful story.<br /><br />Matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by Charlie Strouse and T.J. Kuenster ( AnneMarie 's song and the gator 's ballad are the only good ones ; the latter in particular benefits from Ken Page 's mellifluous vocal ) or the uneven voice cast . As mentioned , Burt Reynolds ' stiff and lifeless Charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further ( the only exception is a fiery confession to Itchy about his true intentions toward the end ) . Dom DeLuise as Itchy is pretty good , but he 's had better roles , notably Tiger in AN American TAIL and Jeremy in THE SECRET OF NIMH . Ken Page , as mentioned , is awesome in anything he does , but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best . Similarly wasted are Loni Anderson ( as a collie who once sired a litter with Charlie ) , Melba Moore , and Charles Nelson Reilly . Judith Barsi as AnneMarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable , partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show.<br /><br />Barsi aside , the only real positive about ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN is the animation . Technically , this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from Bluth 's team ( by 1980 's standards , that is ) , particularly a frightening scene where Charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic canine - demon . If anything , the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling.<br /><br />On the whole , however , I can not recommend ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN as good entertainment . Even though I recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion , the overall package is not in the same league as Bluth 's better efforts . Animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry , but by the time it 's over , ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth .
0 Wow , what a waste of acting talent . My husband and I sat there , both thinking , this has to get better , these actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap . Unattractive characters , hackneyed script , and listless pacing make for a long two hours . I actually could n't hack it and left to do the grocery shopping ( cat litter being more appealing than this film ) . The husband stayed and confirmed that it did n't get better -- by the time Buddy is killed , you were wishing they all would get hit by a car and end their miserable lives . It would be infinitely more entertaining . Beautiful scenery and costumes ca n't keep this one alive .
0 I went to see " Evening " because of the cast . I 'd gone to see " Norman 's Room " for that reason -- that movie offering Diane Keaton , Leonardo De Caprio and , also , Meryl Streep -- and had loved every minute of it . Same for " The Notebook " even though it was chick - flit lite . And my feeling was , anything offering performances by Vanessa Redgrave , Meryl Streep , Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close would be at least as good . Instead , I found sometimes even the greatest actors can not overcome trite , simplistic and -- on one occasion -- truly offensive material.<br /><br />Now I had no problem with the way the film was structured . I actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story ... so long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse . But while Vanessa 's character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt " was a mistake " was riveting , at times , the part actually showing what that " past mistake " was does nothing to clarify the matter . In fact , it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest " girl meets boy , girl gets boy , girl loses boy " fashion , and in the most unbelievable , clichéd , wrong - headed way possible.<br /><br />And from here be spoilers , so bear that in mind should you continue reading.<br /><br />First of all , Claire Danes was brutally miscast . Not only does she not even begin to resemble Vanessa Redgrave as a young woman , she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting . Do n't get me wrong , she can be good in the right role -- just not this one . And Patrick Wilson was miscast , though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off . He 'd have been better suited to the part Hugh Dancy played -- the rich confused WASP -- and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all ; he 's a bit too WASP - y for that . Hugh Dancy ? One note -- " I 'm a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why . " And the " why " ( I 'm a closet case in a sexually repressed world , so I have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone I know ) was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died ( as you knew he would because that 's the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the Fifties ) so ludicrous , wrong - headed and mishandled , I nearly threw my candy at the screen.<br /><br />As for the modern part between Toni Collette and her sister , her fear of commitment , her jealousy of her sister 's " perfect life , " her sister wondering if she 's made the right choices , her pregnancy and her too - perfect boyfriend ( which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by Patrick Wilson , and Ebon Moss - Bachrach might have been a more interesting Harris , given his dreamy eyes ) -- anyway , all this was hashed over in the 70 's and 80 's . And in much greater depth . Do we REALLY have to present it , again , and all as if it was fresh and momentous?<br /><br />And to top it off , Meryl Streep does n't even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie , all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions . She 's still good , but only because she 's Meryl , and Meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeup.<br /><br />So to put it simply , this movie has every cliché in the " really meaningful message " movie book , and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out , again . At two hours long and laced with " Lifetime Movie - of - the - week " music that is guaranteed to rub you raw , it 's a complete failure in both the " meaningful " and " moviemaking " aspects . I give it " 3 " only because of Meryl and Vanessa.<br /><br />Now , if all you require from your films is twadd le , then please set my comments about " Evening " aside and have the time of your life . But if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings , rent " Norman 's Room " and find out what truly great acting is .
0 The story of a woman ( Ann ) on her death bed , her two daughters ( Nina and Constance ) and her thoughts about her past . The flashbacks are concerning a weekend where young Ann is in the wedding of her friend Lila . At the wedding she meets Harris who will impact her for the rest of her life . Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life she remembers him as her true love . Her daughter Constance is older , more " responsible , " a mother of two and has things together . Nina jumps from boyfriend to boyfriend and job to job and is unsure of her direction in life.<br /><br />First of all the good . The period detail in the movie is great . The dresses , hair , cars , houses , etc . really put you in another time and place . And there is some very quality acting in the movie . Vanessa Redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile mental state as her life comes to an end . Claire Danes is beautiful and does a great job as the main character when she was young ( and she is an outstanding singer ) . Hugh Dancy brought a lot of life to the character of Lila 's brother Buddy.<br /><br />Now for the bad , which unfortunately is everything else . Things constantly disrupt the story as it is being unfolded for us . The chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is great . They have fun and dance . Then ... you are supposed to believe that she does n't really like him more than a friend and that his pining only annoys her . And I thought the whole , " he might be gay " thing was out of the blue and did n't serve a purpose.<br /><br />Then we have Harris . The character acts wooden and creepy . Had this been another genre , you would have known that Harris was the serial killer from the get go . It is an unbelievable stretch to think that all these girls loved him so ( but they do portray the other guys as pretty lame to try and help him out).<br /><br />And the grandest problem of all . Why do n't Ann and Harris get together ? They fall for each other . They have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardener 's shack , come home to find out about Buddy 's tragic end and then ... <br /><br />Nothing.<br /><br />They meet up a few years later and get all misty eyed about each other and I could n't help but wondering why . WHY ? The movie does n't let you know why they were forced to marry other people and so I had a hard time feeling sorry for them.<br /><br />The part of the story in the present is fairly boring . The cliché good daughter and the cliché bad daughter . Nina changes over the course of the movie but I am not sure why . I 'm not sure what convinces her to change her life . There is a " touching " scene where the daughters are connecting that coincides with old Ann dreaming she 's chasing a butterfly . It is really lame and embarrassing.<br /><br />"There are no mistakes " , Ann advises at us . The statement does n't ring true with the story . And it does n't ring true after seeing the movie and wishing they had n't wasted the talent of such good actors .
0 Some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous . Not painful to watch with your significant other ? I was apologizing to my boyfriend the entire movie . < br /><br />It was so slow and awfully strange . < br /><br />Both Redgraves , Vanessa and Natasha were unfit for this , especially with Vanessa doing that ridiculous brash American accent . < br /><br />Claire Danes was the same wiggly - lipped awkward girl that she was in My So - Called Life . She has yet to push herself in any way . Girl , find a new way to pretend to cry ! < br /><br />Meryl Streep was one of the only redeeming part of this movie , she was on screen for five minutes , and I swear to God , she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake . < br /><br />Oh ! And Hugh Dancy , who gets better every time I see him . < br /><br />Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes . < br /><br />I mean , this was a well - shot movie , it was very pretty , the settings were interestingly dressed , providing relief for the intense boredom I was feeling . < br /><br />I do n't know , It 's just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of " The greatest actresses of our time " sucks so much . It sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors , and the main character ( Ann ) was a huge jerk . I was glad she died . But that 's because I felt bad for Lila , Ann 's friend -- mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy . < br /><br />Ugh . BAD job , Evening the film . You were n't entertaining and you were n't even thought - provoking . I sure hope the book was better , so it did n't waste even more of people 's time . 3/10
0 This crap is like watching paint dry . I 'm so disappointed because I was so eager to see it.<br /><br />There simply is no meaning to this film . If it were never made , no one would notice or care . It 's hyped up because of all the big names in it , but if " nobody 's " were in , nobody would give this film any love.<br /><br />Seriously , I was at the point where half - way through the film I would look at Vanessa Redgrave and think , " Hurry up and die already ! " This is like the " Joy Luck Club " without any of the friggin ' joy . It 's the " Ocean 's 13 " ( nothing but a big - named cast ) of mother - daughter movies and completely anti - climatic ... oh until it 's finally over.<br /><br />I'm sure they 'll all be nominated for Oscars ... <br /><br />- 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk .
0 I knew that ' Evening ' was a girlie film , so I was expecting to be bored . A wicked tease on IMDb had said that it was a ' chick flick ' but that your companion would survive.<br /><br />Survive ? Yes . I am still here , but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours - it seemed a much longer evening than that ! I suppose that , for Yanks , it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach - well , next to the beach , in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower . If that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film.<br /><br />There 's a Monty Python film about a Knight who just wo n't die . He ends up a wriggling ( why do Yanks add an third syllable to this word I wonder ) torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis . This film is also about a sort of living dead . Vanessa Redgrave ( inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here ) goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt . She 's not worried about having been a wide - eyed , breathless bimbo , but imagines herself a murderess.<br /><br />Obviously , being a girlie film , there 's a chap who is supposed to be the Mr Darcy / Heathcliff character . I 'm not a woofter , so I ca n't claim to be a good judge of such things , but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour . He 's a bloodless cypher.<br /><br />As you might gather , the main characters are n't much cop , but the minor ones manage , amazingly to be much worse . There 's a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers . Fair enough , but it is n't the role of Hamlet - why ham it up so badly ? Forgetting that it was a girlie film , I thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl - friend would have told him that face - fungus did n't flatter him , but then I realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a ' beard ' because he looked worse without it.<br /><br />I kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery - if you 're dragged along to it , see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head , just the sort of thing you 'd expect in a beach cottage.<br /><br />Apart from the obligatory wedding , there is only one piece of action . You 'd have thought that they 'd have got it right . Sadly , though , the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that could n't be there . When the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they ca n't know is nearby ( but we do as the audience ) . If they do n't have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place , then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him ? I suppose that the director 's excuse is that it is supposed to be a half - remembered dream sequence ... <br /><br />Another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan . I did n't think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties .
0 Just PPV'd this . I do n't want to waste too much time on this as most of the posters here put it better than I ever could , but I did want to say a few things.<br /><br />I did n't know which was funnier : Redgrave chasing tiny moths and tripping over her nurse ; Close wailing that her " precious " boy ( whom she and the Mr. had decided was a drunken loser ) has been turned into roadkill ; that the tone - deaf Ann schmoozed with Peggy Lee ; or the horrid CGI of Crypt Keeper Annie gazing at her younger self!<br /><br />I never bought Danes as the younger Redgrave . I did n't buy Richardson and Collette as sisters , either . If Meryl Streep 's daughter wants to be an actress , she better get Mama to give her a few lessons ! I had zero idea why any girl ( or Buddy ) would make fools of themselves over vapid stud du jour Harris ! Ann 's daughters are as whiny and thoughtless as she , Luc is a retarded slacker on crack , and I did n't give a rot about any of them ! Evening gives Chick Flicks a bad name !
0 With a cast list like this one , I expected far better . Venessa Redgrave spent the majority of the movie lying in bed . The best actresses in the world can not make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep throughout the entire movie . The plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as their mother comes closer to death . The thing is , she never tells her daughters anything except cryptic advice to be happy . All the relationships in the movie are underdeveloped . I also felt that the back and forth between the past and present was unnecessary . It seemed as if the idea was stolen either from the book the Da Vinci Code in which the device was used to increase suspense , or from The Notebook in which they used the device to create the never ending romance of the story 's main characters . Either way it was a cheap device in this movie because it did n't work to create anything . It was a way to attempt suspense in a movie that has none . I left wondering why good movies ca n't be written for women . It really was a disappointment .
0 I saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening , and I must say I was extremely disappointed . And I have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast Claire Danes in the lead role . Depending on what you think about Danes , she was either horribly miscast , or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the 2007 Razzie for Worst Actress . I think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her . Instead , she is completely unlikeable . The other " great " actresses do an OK job , but certainly do n't light up the screen . Out of all the " great " actresses in this movie , I 'd say the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson . Streep is barely in the picture , and only appears near the very end.<br /><br />Horrible screenplay as well . It comes off more as them reading lines than truly being " in character . "
0 This is , without a doubt , the most offensive " chick flick " I have seen in years , if not ever . The writing & characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody . Before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster , we were subjected to the following themes : having a baby will solve all of your problems , " performer types " are miserable messes , & musicians ca n't be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle . What a waste of a talented cast & some great - looking sets & costumes . When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life , she 'll end up - shudder - " alone ! " , I felt queasy . I ca n't believe this movie made it to theatrical release . It 's the sort of fare one expects from those " women 's " cable channels that I always pass right by when channel - surfing . I am female and over 35 , so I should be part of this film 's target audience , but boy , does " Evening " miss its target .
0 I never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel ( especially a beloved one , like Evening ) but when I saw that the book 's author , Susan Minot , was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film , I thought that Evening would be a good adaptation.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the book , do n't bother with this movie . It is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another.<br /><br />Here , our characters are completely different : the bride is in love with Harris . Harris is the son of the housekeeper . Buddy is a drunk , in love with Ann and/or Harris . I do n't think a single character made it from the book to the screen ; oh it just gets worst with every passing moment.<br /><br />And , really , did n't we learn from Bridges of Madison County that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in , to scenes of our heroes ' grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights , simply does not work on film ? This film is a disaster . Skip it .
0 Cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less . Vanessa Redgrave is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret love ... <br /><br />This is one of those movies which has the look and expectations of being a great film simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be about something other than the potboiler that it really is . Not bad as such but with Redgrave , Toni Collette , Glenn Close , Meryl Streep , Clare Danes , Natasha Richardson , Eileen Atkins , Patrick Wilson , Hugh Darcy and others ( all giving fine performances ) you expect more than a weepy story that s a bit more than a harlequin romance.<br /><br />Wait for Cable .
0 Almost as tedious to watch as it was to read , Evening is a gorgeously produced failure ... until Meryl Streep walks in and quietly shows her other cast members how to act this kind of stuff . Vanessa Redgrave is shockingly off in her role as the dying Ann and Claire Danes is a cipher . Perhaps if Vanessa and Claire had switched roles we could have seen the vibrancy in the young Ann that gave her entrée to the rarefied world of the story and we could have imagined that the older Ann actually was dying . < br /><br />I was hoping the addition of Michael Cunningham to the writing credits would smooth out the jumpy storytelling but alas . It gave me a headache .
0 I looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented . I mean , I hate to say bad things about an amateur production , but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it , tone it down a little . " Groundbreaking " is a little over the top . This is a Boston based college production that does n't even achieve the level of most amateur college film . It 's what you would expect a bunch of kids to do . A silly action film without much creativity . It 's pretty funny if you 're willing to poke fun at it . Not something you will ever see unless you are a student at Emerson college .
0 " The 40 Year Old Virgin " exists in a world I do n't understand . A world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to " f * * * off " and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded . A world where it 's really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other peoples ' cars . A world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings . A world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities . And a world without any funny jokes ! I am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie . I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch - not very funny to begin with , and stretched out beyond all rational thought . The chest - waxing scene went on FOREVER.<br /><br />The characters , aside from Carell , were totally one - note . And the romantic elements were completely contrived , particularly the scene where Keener finds porn in Carell 's apartment . That was just lame.<br /><br />And I also found the " Aquarius " sequence totally annoying and excessive . I hated hated hated this movie !
0 It is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today . maybe I am a dinosaur from the fifties , and I am out of touch with todays movie going generation , and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie , since so many people loved it . I found it foul and vulgar . I have n't said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill . The humor is sophomoric and crude . I am not a politically correct person , and even I found the gay jokes , not only not funny but downright offensive ( I 'm not gay ) . The main character in the movie is not even a likable person , just pathetic . When the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see .
0 About 15 minutes in , my wife was already wanting to leave . Not so much because of the material , but the lack thereof . They decided to fill in the blanks where the funny stuff should 've been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could . When this would let up ( very rare ) , we 'd sit back and watch ( not laughing , mind you ) and wait for the next gross - out or offensive remark(s ) . After about 35 minutes , we both got up and left . Everything we 'd read said how great this was . The trailer looked good and Roger Ebert actually called it " intelligent " and said it was n't a crude sex comedy . Did he go to the right movie ? Along with Be Cool , it 's the only other movie I 've ever walked out on ... and I have no regrets . I 'm sick of trying to go see comedies in America .
0 Wow ! This film is truly awful . I ca n't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight . The cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast . The story is disjointed , fragmented and incoherent . The telling , leaden and predictable . No wit , no charm , no humour . Not sexy in the least . The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake . There 's also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on . When your lead ( Carrell ) is unfunny and unappealing it 's uphill from there . Despite it 's phony turn - around ending where love triumphs over lust I was left with a sick feeling in my stomach . If this is what passes for humour and social comment then we 're definitely doomed .
0 After we counted the use of the f word , oh , about 22 times in the first 10 minutes or so of the film , listened to some really bad actors going on about a woman and a horse , and pretty much acting like 12 year old boys being naughty together , well , we turned it off . Relying on gratuitous profanity and potty humor is a sure sign of a loser Hollywood movie , the product of unimaginative and no - talent writers . < br /><br />We did give it a second chance , thinking surely it would get better . No dice . Later , my boyfriend skipped through the rest of the movie in case it improved , still no dice.<br /><br />The main character did have a cool bike.<br /><br />I would n't recommend this to anyone except maybe really immature adolescents , or frat boys .
0 At least with the teenage geek gets the girl films , the guy is usually unpopular with girls . In the 40 Year Old Virgin he is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women but somehow has remained a virgin . But then you are not supposed to engage your brain with this film or did I miss the bit about him being comatose for 20 years?<br /><br />One of a series of films where 40 somethings act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them . I find it hard to understand how a country that has produced such excellent TV comedies seems to think it has to rely on crude and shallow characters for laughs . They 've done the gross out movies . They 've done the let 's act like all Americans have a mental age of 15 . Where will they go next ? < br /><br />This film is crass and crude entertainment with nothing to recommend it .
0 Bela Lugosi is not typecast in this fantastic twelve - part adventure serial , playing the lead as Frank Chandler / Chandu the Magician , enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of White Magic pushed against those of Black , while displaying vigourous fighting skill , successfully wooing a young Egyptian princess , and cutting a lean and dashing figure in yachting gear , complete with nautical cap . The somewhat lumpy plot engages Chandler / Chandu in an ongoing series of escapades pointed at achieving the rescue of his fiancee , Princess Nadji(Maria Alba ) and others from the clutches of the idol - worshipping sect of Ubasti , which covets Nadji 's blood in order to revivify an ancient mummified princess entombed upon the mysterious island of Lemuria . Director Ray Taylor , an old hand at such entertainments keeps events moving briskly , but repeated scenes and footage , a good deal of which is to be found in the previous year 's Skull Island setting from KING KONG , and the port locale from SON OF KONG , reduces original action to less than 60 minutes from the serial 's running length of over two and one - half hours and , if viewed at one sitting , becomes lacking in effect to most viewers , unless insomniac .
0 " The Return of Chandu " is notable , if one can say that , for the casting of Bela Lugosi as the hero rather than the villain . Why he even gets the girl.<br /><br / > The story as such , involves the Black Magic Cult of Ubasti trying to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji ( the delectable Maria Alba ) and use her as a sacrifice as a means of reviving their ancient leader who just happens to look like Nadji . Lugosi as Chandu , who possesses magical powers , tries to thwart the villains.<br /><br / > Director Ray Taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage . Fans of King Kong ( 1933 ) will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep Kong at bay in several scenes . The acting is for the most part , awful . The actor who plays the high priest ( I believe Lucien Prival ) for example , uses that acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies . The less said about the others the better.<br /><br / > It is a mystery why Lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career , because he was still a bankable star at Universal at this time . Maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl , who knows . As his career started to spiral downwards in the late 30s , this kind of fare would become the norm for Lugosi rather than the exception.<br /><br / >
0 Ever notice how in his later movies Burt Reynolds ' laugh sounds like screeching brakes?<br /><br />Must have been hanging out with Hal Needham too much.<br /><br />And from the looks of " Stroker Ace " , WAY too much.<br /><br />Can you believe this was based on a book ? Neither could I , but it was . And probably not a best - seller , I 'll wager . < br /><br />Burt 's another good - old - boy in the NASCAR circuit who hitches up with Beatty as a fried chicken magnate with designs on his team . Anderson provides what love interest there is and Nabors does his umpteenth Gomer Pyle impression as faithful mechanic / best friend Lugs . < br /><br />A lot of people here are friends of Burt 's or Hal 's . Others must have needed the work . And even real NASCAR drivers get in on the act , and look to have more talent than those with SAG cards . < br /><br />As far as laughs go , Bubba Smith ( pre-"Police Academy " ) gets them as Beatty 's chauffeur . And Petersen , in full Elvira mode , gets lots of appreciative leers as a lady who wants to get to know Lugs real well . REAL WELL.<br /><br />It 's a shame that Burt threw away as much time and effort in a film like " Stroker Ace " where it did n't matter whether he bothered to act or not . They did n't bother to write a character for him , why bother to act?<br /><br />Two stars . Mostly for Petersen , and for the out - takes at the end . Now THEY'RE funny .
0 Oh man is this movie bad . It flows horribly . The story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself , and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this , does n't love himself . He tries getting out of the contract and horrible , painfully unfunny gags ensue . Jim Nabors seems as if he 's sleepwalking , not acting . You 'll miss such Burt sidekicks as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this stinker . Loni Anderson 's hair is downright scary , proving that tons of hairspray did n't go out in the sixties . Or maybe that was a wig . Speaking of , Burt 's wig was n't bad in this film . His worst " wig day " was in " Smokey and the Bandit 2 " . Anyhow , this movie is the worst Reynolds car movie , ever , ever , right up there with " Cannonball Run 2 " . The original " Smokey " and " Cannonball " ( and " Hooper " which , thankfully , had no sequel ) are great , funny films . This one is n't . Even Ned Beatty , who is a great actor , stinks . You 'll long for a Jackie Gleason type villain who is fun to hate . And mind you , this is n't one of those fun movies to bag on . It 's lousy , pure and simple . Even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring , and worst of all , unfunny . And least I forget , " Stroker Ace " was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burt 's coffin before his somewhat - revival years later in " Boogie Nights " , another film that , like " Deliverance " years earlier , shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so .
0 This is one of the most insipid , lackluster , unoriginal , and pointless movies ever made ! It almost feels like everyone involved in this project did n't even try to make an appealing movie . This is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of Smokey and the Bandit , which I think is the best film of them all . As for this waste of film stock , Burt Reynolds sleepwalks his way through the entire movie , Jim Nabors is wasted , the other actors are n't given very much to do , the car races are obviously stock footage , the humor is uninspired , and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours . " Stroker Ace " is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or distinctive about it .
0 Burt Reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions . He 'd show up , party with his friends on film , and take home a big paycheck . It did n't seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was pure crap.<br /><br />No film epitomized this more than " Stroker Ace " which makes " Cannonball Run " look like a classic and " Cannonball Run II " look watchable . Save for a few race scenes there is absolutely NOTHING worth seeing here . Even the beautiful Loni Anderson hams it up so bad as a dumb blonde it 's embarrassing.<br /><br />If the thought of Burt hamming it up with Jim Nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie . Otherwise pick almost any other film comedy and it wo n't be any worse .
0 It occurs to me that some of the films that have been banned during the course of cinema history were actually very important and very good films . I 'd like to argue that instead of banning challenging , controversial movies the censors should consider banning films that are so bad that they pose a threat to your IQ and your sanity . If they were to do so one of the first films to be quickly hidden away would undoubtedly be " Stroker Ace " . This film is awful with a capital ' A ' . It is the worst film Burt Reynolds ever starred in .... quite a feat for for a man with " Cannonball Run II " , " Cop And A Half " and " Rent - A - Cop " on his CV!<br /><br />The wafer - thin story introduces us to successful stock car racer Stroker Ace ( Reynolds ) , a man who loves fast cars and fast women . He gets stuck in a demeaning contract with crooked promoter Clyde Torkle ( Ned Beatty ) . The contract requires him to do some humiliating promotional work for a new chain of fast food restaurants , such as dressing up as a giant chicken . Thrown into the mix are Lugs ( Jim Nabors ) , Ace 's dim - witted pal , and Pembrook Feeney ( Loni Anderson ) , a bimbo with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea who is wooed by Ace.<br /><br />Hal Needham , the director of this low - grade garbage , was formerly a stuntman and he made numerous films that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular stunts and car chases / races . Some of these films were OK , like " Hooper " and " Stunts Unlimited " , but with " Stroker Ace " he reaches a career nadir . The characters are so stupid that you actually feel pity for the actors playing them . Anderson especially is saddled with such a dumb role that it makes you grind your teeth with despair . The humour is weak and infantile throughout , and the stunts and race sequences are unremarkable . Even the out - takes during the closing credits ( which can be found in all the Reynolds - Needham collaborations ) are generally unfunny , which gives the impression that maybe the film was n't much fun to make . " Stroker Ace " is a stinker of considerable magnitude .
0 This should not have been listed as a Colombo because in my opinion it does not resemble any of the other Colombo ever made . This should have been listed as a movie starring Peter Falk and not playing the caracter of Colombo because it does not do justice at all to our great lieutenant Colombo .
0 Whenever a Columbo story deviates from the familiar plot ( colorful killer commits crime , Columbo smokes out killer , Columbo becomes a pest in the process ) , the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes . This episode deviates in the extreme , and the result is a major flop.<br /><br / > Would you believe : Columbo never faces the villain till the very end?!!<br /><br />Frankly , I was tempted to turn it off about two - thirds through.<br /><br / > Oh , the sacrifices we self - appointed reviewers make ! ! !
0 Seriously what were they thinking ? Over the course of years the Columbo series has tried out some new things and diverted away from the usual successful formula but this movie really overdoes it . This movie is basically very different from any other Columbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the movie.<br /><br />Main thing that of course makes this movie different from any other Columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed . The entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the Columbo character in a totally different environment and situation . Also the overall is just totally different and more ' modernized'.<br /><br />Director Alan J. Levi did some other Columbo movies in the past , which all very much sticked to the usual formula . It also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this movie.<br /><br />The Columbo character himself also feels quite different , perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation , when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding . The absence of some good relieving and trademark Columbo humor also does n't exactly make this a good or enjoyable watch.<br /><br />In all honesty , the movie does n't begin too bad but the movie starts to become more and more ridicules with its story as it progresses . It 's such a stupid written kidnap - thriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely . It also makes the movie more and more unwatchable . This is a very little interesting Columbo entry that also really does n't know to entertain its viewers in any way.<br /><br />It also does n't help much that the supporting actors are n't the most talented ones around . Despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style , Peter Falk still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie . Can you just imaging how this movie would had been without him ? It would had been an extremely bad and ridicules cheap movie I can tell you.<br /><br />An odd Columbo entry , which could be described as a failed experiment to divert from the usual formula.<br /><br />4/10
0 The script for this Columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980 's soap opera . Deeply character - driven films are great , but only if the characters are compelling . And in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel . The villain 's dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist . The great Lt . Columbo himself is no where near his famous , lovable , self - effacing , crumpled self ; and the bride / kidnap victim is a whimpering , one - dimensional damsel - in - distress ( she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor - come on ! ! ! I could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the you - know - what in 2 seconds ) . In any sense of reality , this character would have at least TRIED to struggle or fight back at least a little . And speaking of reality .... the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police . The POLICE ? ? Give me a break . Everyone knows the FBI takes over EVERY kidnapping case . This was NO Columbo , just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar Lt . Columbo written in and stretched to 2 hours .
0 I love Columbo and have seen pretty much all of the episodes but this one undoubtedly ranks as the worst of the lot . A mind - bogglingly tedious , pointless , muddled pile of unwatchable drivel that wastes both the time of the viewing audience and of the acting talents of an exceedingly bored - looking Peter Falk . The ' plot ' , such as it is , just seems to be made up as the film goes along with not even the slightest hint of the ingredients to the formula that made the show such a brilliant success to start with . One part of the proceedings which I found extremely puzzling ( or possibly annoying ) was Peter Falk 's character being introduced to the guests at the wedding as ' Lt ' Columbo . If the producers insist on keeping Columbo 's first name a secret , why could n't they have omitted this line altogether as it sounds ridiculous ? Like I said , this is the pits and all true Columbo fans would do well to avoid it like the plague .
0 Loyalty to Peter Falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the ( 1 ) it deserved . ( For that matter , loyalty to Mr. Falk was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails . ) Even if you forgive all the glaring errors , this was just plain the poorest excuse for a made - for - TV " Columbo " film ever . I 'm glad I watched it on TV for free ; would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print .
0 Absolute garbage . The reason that this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula , but because the plot was just pathetic . < br /><br />The supposed star did n't do anything to solve the case - and neither did anyone else really - it was just routine police work . Utterly tedious.<br /><br />You sat right till the end hoping for a twist - and got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment . < br /><br />There was so much potential in having a relative in apparent kidnap . Could the Lt 's personal involvement finally cloud his judgement ? < br /><br />All the obvious signs were of a stranger doing it . But surely a genius like Lt C , by constant conversation with the wronged husband , would gradually uncover a fiendish plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower room while a masked groom surprises the bride , hides the body and then plants subtle clues . It could have been good . It was a complete waste of time .
0 An uninspired and undistinguished " new " Columbo which sees the man - in - the - mac attend his nephew 's wedding , only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night . Columbo investigates ... <br /><br />And that it is about it : indifferently plotted and surprisingly laden with a flat script , given that it is written by Robert Van Scoyk , who penned the highly enjoyable Columbo story " Murder Under Glass " in the detective 's heyday ; there is not even a murder to speak of and the greatest amount of ingenuity afforded to Columbo by the script - writer is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding , which include everybody who was there!<br /><br />Devoid of every Columbo trait possible , I thought I was watching an episode of Hill Street Blues . An insult to the history of the series , with appropriately soap - opera style acting . Very avoidable stuff .
0 Most definitely the worst Columbo ever dreamt up . No murder and the abandonment of the tried and tested formula makes this a real drag . Falk looks bored throughout and so will you be if you waste anytime watching this .
0 This show stinks . For parents , they usually want their kids to watch something good for them . It is usually educational , funny , and bright.<br /><br />Is it educational ? No . the Doodlebops sing and that 's it . They usually sing about themselves , they do n't try teaching anything.<br /><br />Is it funny ? No . The Doodlebops instead say something which is not intended as a joke , and laugh at it.<br /><br />Is it bright ? It 's so bright , it 's painful . As far as color , s everything is extremely bright , so that 's good . But NOTHING is ever wrong in the world of the Doodlebop 's . Therefore , they are always happy . a kid in trouble will become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad.<br /><br />The show is also extremely cheesy . Every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny . It 's overkill.<br /><br />For kids , it 's entertaining , but past the age of 2 you wo n't want your kids to see it . They 'll never know how to grow up .
0 My children watch the show everyday that its on . Its a great program for younger children . However they need to stop showing re - runs and do some more actual shows and get rid of Rooney 's and Deedee 's YELLOW TEETH . Moe is the only Doodle bop with clean white pearlie teeth and the children notice these things and ask if the 2 do n't ever brush their teeth ? Does the show ever make its way to the United States and if so where can we find its schedule at . And one other thing if we might be able to add . Moe you need to stop hiding so much . Sometimes when you pop up out of no where you scare the younger children and what s with the pulling of the rope ? What does that signify ? other then getting wet all the time . They need to add newer things to their show instead of the same ole same ole . Kids loose interest that way .
0 Normally when I write a review for a movie online , it is for one of three reasons . Either , I have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent , I feel that the public 's perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons , or I believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers . While all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative , I find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as , " This is one of the best films of all time ! " , does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides , nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good , which should be the point of the review in the first place . With that being said , War of the Worlds is nothing more than a hurried , incompetent attempt at a money grab ; piggy - backing its loathsome carcass on the multi - million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by Steven Spielberg . Many people will buy this DVD in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject . This movie is not even " so bad " that it becomes funny or endearing , rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger . Now with most of the insults out of the way , allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than I. < br /><br />Judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film ( I found it as SAM 's Club for 8 bucks ) , I assumed that the cast would be no - names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular . Check . This is not a big deal for me , as I find a large budget and an over - reliance on big name stars and SE can diminish an otherwise decent movie . I also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score . Check again . What I did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien / battle scenes . < br /><br />Now , as per IMDb 's policy any spoilers must be announced in advance , no matter how small , so here is fair warning . The movie opens with a lot of inane small - talk , followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot . Seriously , it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube . It is very hard to describe every little issue in depth , but by the end of the first ten minutes , the combination of shaky camera - work , spliced scenes , and a LOT of walking begin to frustrate the viewer . However , the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going . The next 30 minutes basically go as follows : one of the main characters walks to one of the pods , he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot . They both walk back to town . These walks are n't two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged . They are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie . In a particularly grueling scene , the main character is shown looking at a pod , then he is shown pacing and panting , then he looks at the pod , then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town , then comes in to town and walks into a building , then he has a cup of coffee and says " Thank you Mary " to a random maid that serves him coffee , then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building , then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod . I apologize for the extreme run - on sentence , but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film . Characters speak way too long about mundane things , they walk a lot , they send other people to walk , the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed , but for no dramatic effect , simply the camera man is a sophomore at Tech somewhere . The editing is mind - bogglingly bad . People actions make little sense . For instance , when the professor goes to a farmer 's house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town , the farmer stutters and paces around . When the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside , the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later . Nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene , as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk . The entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film , but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion . I have seen better high school video productions . Finally , the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story . I get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage . However , it is so awful in technical aspects , and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad . Avoid this film at all costs .
0 I am currently sitting here , forcing myself to finish this . I figure I blew 6 bux on the VHS , might as well suffer for it . I remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for " War of the Worlds " cause of the rumors of the Spielberg movie at the time , and I missed the old TV series from the early 90 's . The website make it out that this was a multi - million dollar budget rendition of the classic book . It was going to be a " perfect translation " . Perfect CRAP is more in tune with this film.<br /><br />First off , the video on this movie was glitched ! It looked as if I was watching the Full Motion Video from an old mid-90 's PC or Playstation CD - Rom video game . Sadly enough , the color quality was similar . The acting made Shatners classic " dramatic pause " look damn near Shakespearean in quality . The CG rendering of various scenes was horrendous , and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old Dukes of Hazardd scenes.<br /><br />Secondly , it is slow and terribly drawn out . I sat thru 45 minutes of the video ( no promo 's at the beginning ) before the cylinder actually Opened to reveal the first alien . After that , the alien was a terribly constructed CG squid . I am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry I have seen is a spinning silver disk ( crappy down even ) attached to a mechanical arm . The dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental 's . The last thing on that , for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900 's NO ONE is concerned for their life . It 's like they have no concept . Even though media was slow , word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known . The " illusion " of day and night was shoddy at best . Simply changing the color around the people to purple , blue or green does not signify NIGHT TIME . Perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a MUCH better illusion . THere is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the " hero " gallop around or walk down silly roads . Get on with the film . I know how people get around , you do NOT need to be so in - depth.<br /><br />Now , finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines . Mighty Morphin Power Rangers had better looking effects . Even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student . The animations do NOT match up to the scenery at all.<br /><br />In closing folks , if you want " The War of the Worlds " , do one of four things . 1 ) Watch the 1953 original , 2 ) watch the early 90 's TV series , 3 ) wait for Spielberg 's rendition to be released shortly , OR 4 ) Read the frikkin book ( something we all probably did in elementary English class ) . AVOID THIS MOVIE . IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY .
0 I must admit I burst out laughing when I saw one reviewer compare this to LOTR . Well yes , if you exclude the dwarfs , the cast of thousands , the great special effects , the big battles , the strong characterization , the decent plot , the good acting , the classy direction and everything else . Which leaves you with the walking . And boy , does this film do walking ! If Mr Piano had his way , this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the Wisconsin countryside , but every 40 minutes or so these pesky Martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble . You 've never seen so much walking in a movie . If this really had a $ 20 m budget , most of it must have gone on Mr Piano 's shoes , because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does . Which explains why there 's no money left for decent effects , a decent video camera or proper actors . Honestly , it 's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes . Even on fast - forward , this is a looonnnggg walk.<br /><br />As for the sci - fi stuff , I think it was a mistake to put Martians in the film : they only get in the way of the walking , which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story.<br /><br />I wonder how much Mr Piano charges to walk dogs ?
0 Wow ... <br /><br />I picked this up at the local Wal - Mart after reading online that it had been released early . I 've been following this online for some time , and just had to buy the film.<br /><br />Wow ... <br /><br />I guess the thing that really struck me was the editing , or lack thereof . Time and again , characters ( usually The Narrator and whoever he is with ) are shown walking ... and walking ... and walking . I am not an editor , but I do know that you can cut between someone leaving point A to show them arriving at point B. There is no need to show almost the entire journey ! Wow ... <br /><br />I actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this . They seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy , depending on what action was to be added at a later date.<br /><br />Wow ... <br /><br />Why it was decided to do almost all the effects using CG is beyond me . Even ILM still employs miniatures sometimes . One of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of ( according to the end credits ) the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities , including London . At times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera . In one shot in London , there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator 's brother ( played by star Anthony Piana without his distracting mustache ) . Not since GETTYSBURG have I seen such a fake piece of facial hair.<br /><br />Wow ... <br /><br />Why Timothy Hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me . It is a turkey , plain and simple . On the plus side ( at least for me ) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh - out - loud bits of hilarity I have seen in quite a while .
0 Is it possible to give a movie NO STARS ? I suppose not . However many stars IMDb displays this just think zero and you 'll get my drift . Director and photographer Timothy Hines did n't have much of a budget compared to Spielberg 's Herculean effort with the same material ( rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made ) , but that need not be an insurmountable handicap . I 've seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring ( " Soldier and Saints " is a recent example ) . With hard work , integrity and , above all , talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of Wells ' novella -- and at fraction of what was spent by Dreamworks on its " War of the Worlds " . Unfortunately , Hines failed in all these departments . Even if he had had Spielberg 's budget and Tom Cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal he 's foisted on us.<br /><br />Primarily , Hines seems unable to tell a story . Thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound , but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records . A guy walks down a country lane , a lot . He talks badly aped Received English to some other guy . Then he walks down the same lane , only shot from the back this time to show he 's returning -- clever , eh ? Walking and talking , for nearly an hour that 's all that happens . OK , I 'll grant that one extended excursion from the main character 's house to the impact site on Horsell Common to show that it 's a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful ( a first - year film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this , btw ) , but half a dozen times ? Back and forth , back and forth , et cetera , et cetera with some yakkity - yak in between . Remarkable . The only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish CG works into something that could be offered as a feature - length film . Finally the Martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking , or shrieking . Later we get staggering and wailing for dessert.<br /><br />Thankfully , much of the dialogue is lifted straight from H.G. Wells ' text ; else we 'd have no idea what is going on . But is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text , to realize what words alone ca n't convey ? If a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel , why bother ? Why not do a radio play ? Orson Welles made himself a household name doing just that . However , Hines thinks he 's a filmmaker , so he 's content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning.<br /><br />Secondly , Hines was able to buy some CG effects of a sort for his movie , but he has no idea how to use them . Now I for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy . I believe good science fiction cinema does n't need dazzling technical effects . Some really potent Sci - Fi 's have flourished on virtually none at all . But " The War of the Worlds " as film requires a certain baseline effort . Wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled . The effects do n't need to be complex ; they can even be crude ( e.g. fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the George Pal / Byron Haskins 1953 version ) , but they must be handled well . Unfortunately Hines ' effects are both crude and incompetent  tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum  Martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort  skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream -- the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times ( flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice )  and on ad nauseum . Crude technique is forgivable . So you have a CG fire effect that 's less than convincing ? Fine , we can work around that . Just do n't use it too often and only show glimpses of it . That stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum ? Throw it away . It 's not necessary . You say your Martian flyer looks like a toy on a string ? If you must use it , go ahead , but please do n't show it twice ! But no , Hines wo n't listen . We get the worst looking stuff used again and again . Got ta get those 180 minutes somehow , boy.<br /><br />Next we have acting , or more precisely too much acting . Whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out . Evidently Hines thinks he 's getting a bargain -- More fleeing in terror over there ! You , quaking behind that tree , let 's have a real conniption fit this take . You call that writhing in agony ? Nonsense , my grandmother can writhe better -- Nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink . They are n't even good amateurs . But this need n't prove fatal . Many a good movie has been made with rancid acting . That 's what directors are for . And editors . Which brings up another point   Who the hell let Tim Hines edit this cheese factory ? If America 's butchers were as adept at meat cutting as Hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef . In spite of the near three - hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie -- not sequences , but single frames , creating a herky - jerky effect that 's nauseating to watch . Maybe Hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890 's . If he was I can say he does n't know how to do it .
0 I honestly believe that ANYONE considering film - making be subjected to this mind - boggling failure . Like the " films " of Edward Wood , Jr. in the ' 60s and ' 70s , this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts , re - editing their films , and reworking their special effects until they finally look right . This movie is also a decent argument FOR the studios ' pre - screening process . If Mr. Hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience , perhaps he would have cut 75 % or the walking / running / strolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes.<br /><br />Film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is " good enough " can truly be . Every performance , every line of dialog , every digital effect , every filter effect , indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity . A beginning filmmaker may find himself / herself tempted from time to time to think " At least I accomplished SOMETHING " or " Just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself " . This movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out.<br /><br />Critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment " the worst movie ever made".<br /><br />Beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are , and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites . Also , beginning directors can learn the importance of a GOOD screenplay , and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story . Writers and directors who watch bad made - for - cable movies of the week and think " I can do better than THAT " can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really IS to produce even mediocre results.<br /><br />I sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers . Particularly those entering the craft in this current post - Lucas and post - Spielberg environment . There is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects . The War of the Worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off . Some ca n't even come CLOSE to it .
0 After hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is I took the plunge and bought the DVD . That said everything previously mentioned about this film is true . For a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all . The list of problems with the film could drag on forever . Chief amongst them is the film is simply too long . It dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours . Nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly . < br /><br />Secondly , as many had pointed out from the " trailers " , the special effects are anything but special . The tripods looked OK in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was grade - Z 1970 's or 1980 's quality . Probably the worst effects of all were the horses , which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved . The heat ray effects were laughable , as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles . Also pitiful was the Thunderchild sequence , in which the Thunderchild , described in the book as an ironclad ram , looked nothing of the sort . Instead it resembled a World War 1 era destroyer , complete with deck guns ( which fired but had no visible crew ) , and torpedo tubes . < br /><br />The colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects . Most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out Mars to her in the sky . Well , the sky is black , but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight . There is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape , bathed in full sunlight , and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars . To detract even further , the color of the scenes made no sense . In some they are bathed in orange light . In others green light . In still others it 's blue light . In some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue . The frame - rate and camera is very shaky , giving everything a stuttering look.<br /><br />Finally , the acting is overall sub - par . One man portrays two characters who 's sole difference was one lacked a mustache . This led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were . The English accents , even to American ears , are outrageous . < br /><br />In summary , this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times . I have not seen Gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one , because of it 's poor quality in every respect , must easily be worse then anything that mainstream Hollywood has put out . I would not be surprised if the movie makes it to the bottom 10 or 20 in the IMDb rankings . It 's a pity that Mystery Science Theater is not still around .
0 Nu Image , UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come in with budgets of roughly $ 2 million . Some feature extensive effects work , others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both -- for $ 2 million.<br /><br />Mr . Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $ 20 million dollars but it 's painfully obvious that this was probably produced for $ 750,000 if not considerably less than that . Few sets are utilized , a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish.<br /><br />It 's painful to watch . Not so much because it is poorly directed , poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget.<br /><br />Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by P.T. Barnum .
0 I love movies , and I 'll watch any movie all the way through , just to give it a chance . I can finally say that I found a movie I ca n't watch all the way through . The acting is terribly stale and monotone , the CGI looks like a computer geek did it in his mother 's basement with minimal software , and ..... the long scenes of just ... walking ! ! ! ! And this movie is THREE HOURS LONG ! ! ! I did n't even make it 15 minutes until I fast forwarded the DVD . The scenes with the aliens are very short . Ummm , instead of naming this " War of the Worlds " , lets name this " War of the Walking Long Distances " . This cost 5 million dollars to make ! What they spend the money on , the dramatic opening song?<br /><br />Oh , but on a positive note , one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people . That 's hilarious , not because people are dying , but because when they turn to skeletons , they still squirm for 20 seconds afterward.<br /><br />So .... like I said , if you are a fan of boring , stale , action - less movies , here is one for you DVD collection . But I did n't write this for you , I wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will HATE this movie . It is not worth your time or money < br /><br />I know this is by the book , but the book is n't that long , and I 'm a complete book worm / nerd / geek / whatever , but why ? Just get the Steven Spielberg version , it 's not all that good , but it 's 10 times better than this ! ! < br /><br />I give this a BIG , FAT ZERO out of 10 .
0 Finally i thought someone is going to do justice to H.G. Wells 's classic , not another version set in the wrong locale or era , but one based firmly on the book . Well it definitely follows the book pretty closely , and that is the only plus to this mess.<br /><br />This is 180 Min 's ( yes 3 hours ) long , the book is only around 150 pages .<br /><br />If Timothy Hines had the nerve to come on here and say " if you can do any better ... " i would say " yes , i could " and i have never used a video camera or been to any sort or drama school in my life.<br /><br />I paid good money to get this crap over to the UK from the USA , do not make the same mistake as me .
0 Save the $ 8.97 you 'll spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and go see the real film by Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />I'm a filmmaker , and being an avid fan of H.G. Wells , I had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment . Instead , it took four days to finish watching this because I could n't stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time . It 's horrible.<br /><br />There are reports that Timothy Hines had a $ 20 Million budget for this production . Where the heck did it go ? Did he use most of it to buy a new house ? Finance his retirement ? Or what ? Let me start with what is actually good about this film . It does stay true to the book AND there are a few good performances in it . I can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film . But good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible ... and I do mean horrible special effects . Any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the CGI . To me , most of it looked like " stop action " card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated CGI software that a $ 20 Million project should be using.<br /><br />There 's no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film . My own partner and I sat down and recreated our version of the Ferry scene using software that cost less than $ 1500.00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what Hines created . I 've seen films with budgets of less than $ 2 Million look better . Much better.<br /><br />In my opinion the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and better than Hines ' special effects in this film . IN fact , I have a much better appreciation for Attack of the Killer Tomatoes because of this film . There 's no excuse with today 's technology for a film to look like a 50 's B - Movie unless that was the intention , which should n't have been with this particular project.<br /><br />A problem I had with the DVD transfer was that the film is jerky , another demonstration of amateur film - making.<br /><br />Overall , I have to say that I produced a $ 45,000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film.<br /><br />I strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film - making or who is a fan of WOTW to leave this film on the shelf and watch Attack of the 50 Foot Woman instead . It would be easier on the eyes .
0 I 'm not really sure how to even begin to describe how bad this movie is . I like bad films , as they are often the most entertaining . I love bad special effects , bad acting , bad music , and inept direction . With the exception of the music ( which was better than I had expected ) , this movie had all of those qualities . < br /><br />The special effects were amazingly bad . The worst I 've seen since my Nintendo 64 . Some scenes to watch for include the Thunderchild , the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot , the Big Ben scene , the train wreck ... Wow , there are so many bad effects ! On the plus side , though , SOME scenes of the alien walkers are well done.<br /><br />The acting was about as bad as it could possibly have been , having been based directly on H.G. Wells ' book . For having such good source material , it 's almost as though the actors were trying to be so over - the - top as to make it funny . And then there 's the mustache ... the single most distracting piece of facial hair I 've seen in a long time . Of course , only half the movie contains acting . The rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots.<br /><br />To say that Timothy Hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors . With the use of different colored filters between shots for no particular reason , the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside scenes , the bad green screening , it 's amazing to me how this man ever got approval to direct a movie . I would n't imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad a movie . Bravo , Mr. Hines . Bravo . < br /><br />My advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what I did : have some friends who enjoy bad movies over , drink , play poker while watching it , keep drinking , and maybe you 'll make it all the way through . It does make for an excellent bad movie , so have fun and laugh yourself silly with this disaster .
0 Holy freaking God all - freaking - mighty . This movie was so bad , I thought I was on drugs . In a bad way ... The character acting is the poorest thing I 've seen in quite some time . This movie was more akin to Lord of the G - Strings , IMHO(it 's a real movie ) . Most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen . My favorite part was when they are in the carriage , and you can tell there 's no horse . They 're fleeing from alien monsters , and going about the same speed as a swift jog . Then it switches to a far - shot with a ridiculous CG horse . And the CG in general seems to be sub - par to 1992 's Beyond the Mind 's Eye . I mean , Come on , really . It felt like a horrible episode of Hercules , only without Kevin Sorbo there to save the day . Worst . Movie . Ever .

0 If this film had a budget of 20 million I 'd just like to know where the money went . A monkey could make better CGI effects then what was wasted for 3 hours on this dreadful piece of garbage , although I must admit the machines and the martians would have looked really , really cool on an original play - station 1 game , and early PC games from the mid 90s if a game had ever been made . What puzzles me is where did the money go ? Pendragon films could have made a great film with good old fashioned models and computer controlled cameras a la George Lucas circa 1975 - 83 , and actors who actually look like they care about what they are doing ( or ruining in this case ) for about the same 20 million . This is quite possibly the worst film EVER made ! I would rather sit through a 24 hour repeat screening of Ishtar than watch this film again . I hated it completely ! I regress . I say this IS the WORST film EVER made because unlike other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes , or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians , these are films that are so bad you have a special place in your heart for them , you love them . There is no love for this film and no place in my DVD library for it . I sold it to a guy for a dollar . I 'm betting the money for the film was spent on booze and other vices for the cast and crew . Shame on you Pendragon films ! I want my money back !
0 I have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty , and I can honestly say I feel violated . I had read the reviews and heard the warnings , and I thought I was prepared for anything - at best I thought , a faithful ( if misguided ) attempt at an original adaptation ; at worst , a so - good - it's - bad " Plan 9 " for the new millennium . So when I managed to pick up a copy in Walmart while in Florida and brought it back to the UK , I joked to my friends " Prepare for the worst movie ever made ! " Oh , cruel Karma . There is absolutely NOTHING to recommend this film . The " special " effects look like the work of a first year design student using a Spectrum ZX81 . The acting is terrible , the accents are WORSE than terrible ( one artillery mans ' accent seems to take us on a tour of the British Isles , from Scotland to Wales via Northern Ireland ) , the dialogue is stilted , the editing is non - existent , the production values prove that no expense has been gone to . Words really can not describe how bad this movie is ; from the Union Flag flying from the horribly CGI'd Thunderchild ( the Royal Navy flies the White Ensign , NOT the Union flag ) to the woodworm ridden acting , this is quite simply a crime against film making . When you consider some of the literally - zero - budget fan films that are available on the ' net ( the Star Wars short " Troops " for example ) , the whole " we 're enthusiastic amateurs " argument goes right out of the window . And if you believe an interview with Hines on the Pendragon website , this film had an 8 figure budget ! I can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the US . Maybe the problem is that Hines & co tried to make a film of the book , rather than turn the book into a film ( if that makes any sense ) . Characters and extras spout chunks of text verbatim without trying to convey the feelings behind the words . Ironically enough , the ONLY person who even came close to giving a decent performance was Darlene Sellers , the ex - soft porn actress . My advice ? Pray like crazy that Jeff Wayne does n't screw up , and go watch the Spielberg version . It may not be true to the text of the book , but I can say this ; As a lifelong HG Wells fan ( and Englishman as well ) Speilbergs film IS true to the Spirit of the book . Maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country , but I will say this : Timothy Hines stole three hours of my life , and I want them back .
0 Well , on it 's credit side ( if it can be said to have one ) , Timothy Hines DID manage to capture the original setting of H.G. Wells ' outstanding novella . But other than that - well , to call a spade a spade - it sucks bigtime . What the Master Ed Wood could have done with the alleged $ 20 million dollar budget ! Timothy Hines really does make Mr. Wood , who was a flawed genius anyway , look like the best filmmaker of all time . The special effects ( I guess you 'd call them that ) are not even up to computer game standards . The acting is , well , perhaps about dinner theater comparable , and the accents are atrocious . At the risk of sounding offensive , a lot of the acting from the principal male characters is ( especially Poor Ogilvy ) , well , ahem , . . . GAY ! Poor Ogilvy minces and flounces about the bogus English countryside , waving his asbestos white handkerchief about as if it were heat resistant armor . Hey , the Stormtroopers in " Star Wars " had neat white body armor too , and it did n't work either , they still got blasted . Even when Ogilvy and Company get fried by the Martians ' ' Heat Ray ' ( ? ) , they flounce and mince in some weird kind of dance , even when they 're theoretically DEAD and reduced to skeletons , which persist in unseemly dancing and writhing . Maybe Timothy Hines rented the skeletons from Ray Harryhausen , being left over from " Jason And The Argonauts " . Or was it " Josie And The Pussycats " ? I dunno . The soldiers , presumably because they 're ' military ' , all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode , like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him . Wow ! I loved it ! But the ' soldiers ' all looked like they were either fascist troops from the Spanish Civil War , or Boer Commandos ( which would be more or less correct for the period . Perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius Hines ? ) . Oddly enough , the character of the Curate looks exactly like he 's drawn in the original illustrations by Warwick Goble , and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting . Oh , yeah . Musn't forget the THUNDER CHILD . In the book , the warship is described as an ironclad torpedo - ram . It was MEANT to RAM enemy ships . Yet , it 's bow was crumpled after ramming the Tinker - Toy constructed Martian War Machines , with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak , and she sank . An ironclad warship like THUNDERCHILD could 've rammed the TITANIC and survived , but I guess the Royal Navy was bound by the same lowest - bidder constraints as our own Military . The costumes are all wrong , especially the British Army and Police uniforms , cobbled together mostly from USMC Alphas . And Timbo , in an obvious homage to Western Films Of Yore , has obviously set his movie in Wild Western England , because all his riders are using western saddles . The accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of Scottish regional accent used by Clan Macabre , and magically delicious Irish accents from County Malarky . On the credit side , and contrary to what one reviewer wrote , the only genuine , authentic feature of this Thing is the artillery . The guns are not from the Civil War , but appear to my eye and research as bona - fide British nine or 12 pounder Rifled Breach Loaders , perfectly authentic to the period . So was the ammunition shown being used . But the Artilleryman , who is a driver in the Horse Artillery , was not shown correctly driving his limber . You do n't sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team , you ride the nearside wheel horses . The Opening , using what I believe is authentic period film footage , is okay , and the score 's not bad . However , to the best of my knowledge Weybridge has never had an underground , and it certainly did n't in 1898.<br /><br />But growing up reading this novel , I am very disappointed . Even more disappointed then I was at Spielberg 's zillion dollar , special effects laden version . Maybe his version would have profited by swapping Anthony Piana for Tom Cruise , and vice versa . I have a lot more to say , but I 'll let it go at this for now : I wish somebody would make a GOOD version of " War Of The Worlds " that 's faithful to the original . Timmy 's vision is fine for a high school film class , or maybe I should say pretentiously stupid for a college - level film student , and about as bad , which is about the best I can say for this thing , but that 's about it . Oh , yeah . Just where DID the budget go ? And what happened to Michael Caine ? I 'd like to hear HIS comments ! I have a sneaking suspicion that Timbo " Orson Wood " Hines ' breathtaking , bound - breaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risk - taking director 's ticket to cult stardom , because , I must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie , which I did n't pay for anyway but was thoughtfully sent to me by a friend who burned a DVD copy for me , with no malicious intent that I 've been able to determine . I must add here that I thought Blackmoon 's dubbed and abridged version was not only a vast improvement , but an absolute , hysterically funny ( in a good way ) treat to watch . I find it hard to watch Master Timbo 's version after Blackmoon . Keep it up , Tim ! Make your own version of " DUNE " , now . It just awaits the hand of a master like you ! And all you headupyourass snobs who hated Cloverfield ? FORGET IT . It CANNOT BEAT TIMBO HINES ARTISTRY FOR SHEER HILARIOUS AWFULNESS ! HEY GET A LIFE!TIMBO IS WORSE THAN THE MASTER ED WOOD ! I KID YOU NOT !
0 Hines and Goforth , the perpetrators of this crime , begin on the wrong foot first step , by assuming that Wells wrote Gothic horror and that all of his lines are meant to be taken seriously . That simply is n't true . Wells was very much an inheritor of the Enlightenment , and his main concern was that Victorian self - satisfaction might leave the British unprepared for the world the new technology could produce - both the good and the bad.<br /><br />Two terrible consequences follow - the protagonist is portrayed as a wimpy screamer ( I was reminded of Fay Wray in the original King Kong ) , rather than a man struggling to live out the ironies of an unbelievable catastrophe ; and the dialog reeks of ' Victorianisms ' uttered seriously that Welles clearly meant to be taken tongue in cheek.<br /><br />All of this looks suspiciously like Ed Wood with an enormous budget to waste on CGI effects - which by the way are so poorly accomplished , the Warner Bros. cartoon factory of the 1940s could have done a better job . ( Gobs of spattered blood looked like red balloons , I expected them to float away any minute . ) Think The Yellow Submarine as done by the old EC Comics.<br /><br />Worse yet is the loss of theme , which robs the film of any reason to exist . Although the makers of this film return the story to its Victorian era , they utterly miss the uncanny way Wells ' story predicted many of the horrors of the First World War - a fact not unnoticed by Wells himself , who , after the war , reworked the theme in The Shape of Things to Come.<br /><br />Without any theme , all we have here are a lot of people running around getting blasted into cartoon balloons , when they 're not trying out for a high school production of a drunken student 's rewrite of Macbeth.<br /><br />Really , this is the worst , most senseless piece of drivel I have suffered through since a friend talked me into seeing the Eastern European cartoon " Fantastic Planet " thirty years ago . That film was so pretentiously dull , my friend and I and two total strangers gave up ridiculing it about half - way through , and sat near the screen playing cards , using the movie as light by which to see the cards - its only usefulness , as far as any of us could tell.<br /><br />But I already have electric lighting in my apartment , so I did n't need this put - down of Wells for anything.<br /><br />Do not avoid this film - steal every copy you can ( do n't pay a cent ) and burn each and every one of them . God in his wisdom created us just for this purpose .
0 Let this serve as a warning to anyone wishing to draw attention to themselves in the media by linking their name to that of a well - loved and well - respected , not to say revered author , in order to draw attention to their home - movies out on DVD.<br /><br />Hyped to the skies by its obviously talentless makers , in fact lied about only to be revealed , finally , as ludicrously inept in every department , the fans of Wells and of his book have been after the blood of its Writer - Producer - Director since it appeared on DVD.<br /><br />Many good points have been made by the other comments users on this page . Particularly the one about using this as a teaching aid for Film School students , since this " film " does not even use the basic grammar of scripting , editing , continuity , direction throughout its entire 3 hours running time . It is possible the Director did show up for the shoot . Certainly there was no - one present who knew even remotely what they were doing.<br /><br />An ongoing thread continues to evolve on this IMDb page which should at least furnish the watchers of this witless drivel with a few laughs for their $ 9.00 outlay.<br /><br />Much was promised . Absolutely nothing was delivered . Except " Monty Python Meets " War of The Worlds " with all the humour taken out.<br /><br />Indefensible trash . Just unbelievable.<br /><br />There are REAL independent film - makers out there to be checked out . People who actually try to work to a high standard instead of flapping their gums about how great their movie is going to be.<br /><br />People could do worse than keep an eye on Brit film - maker Jake West 's " Evil Aliens " for example .
0 WOW!<br /><br />I just was given this film from a friend of mine , who bought it for 1.98 at Walmart , and he felt that he got taken ! It is beyond boring , most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen , the acting is somewhat improvised , almost as if they did n't have a script . The Martians are CGI , which look like they were done by a novice , or a Fan produced movie . I can not stress just how bad this DVD really is!<br /><br />Example : In one of the scenes , the martians are torturing a local female captive . She goes from a woman in front of a green screen , to a CGI copy of that woman . The change is totally noticeable , and when she is killed , you can see that it is a computer figure , looking like something from a game back in 1990!<br /><br />If at all possible , avoid this movie like the plague ! You can download two trailers from their site , and see how god - awful it really is !
0 Twenty years ago , the five years old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later . On the present days , Michael ( Gordon Currie ) invites his girlfriend Peg ( Stacy Grant ) and his best friends Chris ( Myc Agnew ) , Jennifer ( Emmanuelle Vaugier ) , Lisa Ann ( Kelly Benson ) , Ned ( Brendon Beiser ) , Mitch Maldive ( Phillip Rhys ) and Trish ( Rachel Hayward ) to spend the Halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm . He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear , and together with his Indian friend Crow ( Byron Chief Moon ) , they would perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy Morty ( Jon Fedele ) that would eliminate their fears forever . The greatest fear of Michael is to become a serial killer like his father , but something goes wrong and Morty turns into his father , killing his friends.<br /><br />"The Fear : Resurrection " is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows , but in a messy screenplay full of clichés . There are some exaggerated performances , like for example Ms. Betsy Palmer ; others very weak , but in general the acting is good . Unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live ; further , in spite of being surrounded by close friends , the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies . The low - pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation . In the very end , Michael shows a charm that his father was interested that I have not noticed along the story . I do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes running time . The special effects are very reasonable for a B - movie . My vote is four.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Fear 2 : Uma Noite de Halloween " ( " Fear 2 : One Night of Halloween " )
0 Five - year - old Michael sees his mother getting axed to death by his serial killer father " The Highwayman , " who later commits suicide . " 20 years later " grown Mike ( Gordon Currie , from PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5 ) invites seven of his friends to his secluded grandparents home to " master their own fears " at a Halloween night costume party . Morty , a life - size wooden doll kept in the attic by the Indian handyman , becomes possessed by the dead father 's spirit and kills them off using their phobias . Characters are thrown out a window , drowned in a toilet , eaten by rats , blown up , etc . Morty morphs into the dad and a tree , walks around and makes stupid wisecracks . After finding a girl chopped up and stuffed in a cardboard box , the characters remain in the house , act cheerful , crack jokes and have sex.<br /><br />The Morty design is good and Betsy Palmer ( Mrs. Voorhees from the original Friday THE 13TH ) is surprisingly delightful as the grandmother , but this thing is even more senseless and confusing than the original and is full of false scares , bad acting , brain - dead characters , repeat flashback footage and annoying distorted camera - work . Plus the only two minority characters ( the Indian and a half - black girl ) are the first to die . BLAH !
0 This movie was crap with a capital " C. " The opening scene showed promise . But that " promise " was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is going.<br /><br />And the wooden statue , Morty , who was rather creepy in the original film , looks plain goofy in this one . It was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume . ( And by the way , who else thinks " Morty " is one of the most un - scary names on planet earth ? It ranks right up there with " Jimmy " or " Fred " when it comes to horror value . Or why not just name the wooden statute Henry - freakin'-Kissinger . " Run , it 's Dr. Kissinger ! " That 'd be about as scary as " Morty.)<br /><br />And then there 's a scene where the " hero " hits his father 's tombstone with---"a sledgehammer ? " you might guess--"a two - by - four ? " someone might venture . No , he angrily beats his father 's tombstone with a twig --- a freakin ' twig . But worse than that , once the characters walk away , the tombstone actually , and inexplicably , bleeds . Oh brother!<br /><br />There 's also a Native American guy who lives with the main character 's grandparents , but apparently , does nothing except Morty - maintenance . He perpetuates creepy Morty - legends , warns those who scoff , and even fixes Morty 's arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank . But for all his respect for and tenderness toward Morty , does Morty give a rat 's hairy behind ? No.<br /><br />The movie drags on , and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears ( sort of ) . This film is a real yawner . Do n't rent it .
0 Those of you who , like me , were disappointed with the original 1995 horror yarn , " The Fear " will find more to be disappointed with in this silly little sequel . It sort of follows a similar plot , but it is impossible to connect to the original , with the exception of the presence of Morty , the mannequin monster made of wood . Here is a brief overview.<br /><br />Twenty years after Mike Hawthorne ( Gordon Currie , in a decent performance ) witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life , Mike is still suffering from the fear of that day . In hopes of ridding his fear , Mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents ' home . His plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears , and then present the fears to the mannequin Morty . According to an Indian friend , this process is supposed to magically take away one 's fear . What Mike does n't know is that Morty is possessed with his father 's spirit , and begins killing off the friends ... or is it really Mike himself doing the killings ? Who cares?<br /><br />A have a few troubles with this film . The first lies with Morty . I thought the original made Morty look rather convincing . This time , it is painfully obvious Morty is a man ( actor Jon Fedele ) in a fake looking suit . This can especially be seen in early scenes , where Morty is still supposed to be inanimate , but if you watch closely you can see him blinking . Another trouble is that most of the characters do n't try hard enough . Some of them do , namely Betsy Palmer , of Friday the 13th fame , who was excellent in this film . But most of them do n't make the effort or were n't given the chance . Finally , there are the killings . The opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing . Actually , when I saw them I thought I was in for a good movie . When the second half of the movie arrives , and the killings really start , everything falls to pieces . Deaths are either uncreative , unseen , or foreseen ( glimpses of the next scene as Currie has a blackout ) . One character dies in the end and no one , including the viewer , even notices . While more characterization was needed in the beginning half , it was n't too bad . The second half was . I think new director Chris Angel got to this point and really did n't know how to shoot the violent scenes , so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian . A silly ending does n't help either . Thus , unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin , you should probably skip " The Fear 2 : Halloween Night . " Zanatos ' score : 4 out of 10 .
0 A young boy sees his mother getting killed and his father hanging himself . 20 years later he gets a bunch of friends together to perform an exorcism on himself so he wo n't turn out like his father . All the stock characters are in place : the nice couple ; the " funny " guy ; the tough ( but sensitive ) hood ; the smart girl ( she wears glasses -- that 's how we know ) ; the nerd and two no - personality blondes . It all involves some stupid wooden statue that comes to life ( do n't ask ) and kills people . I knew I was in trouble when , after a great opening scene , we jump to 20 years later -- ALL bad horror movies do that!<br /><br />The dialogue is atrocious , the acting is bad ( except for Betsy Palmer -- why Betsy ? ) and the killings are stupid and/or unimaginative . My favorite scene is when two people are supposedly having sex and the statue knocks the guy off the bed to show he 's fully dressed ! A real bad , stupid incoherent horror film . Avoid at all costs .
0 Mike Hawthorne(Gordon Currie)is witness to the brutal murder of his mother and suicide of his father Morty(Jon Fedele ) . Twenty years later , Mike gathers a group of his friends to his family 's cabin in the woods for a Halloween party . While playing a game where the guests confess and confront their worst fears ... Mike tries to summon the spirit of his late father . It is soon discovered that Morty 's spirit inhabits a wooden Indian in the cabin . The statue comes to life and the blood bath begins.<br /><br />Most of the F / X are not very convincing and the movie takes on a cheap teen slasher theme . Stale story pitifully acted . Cast members of note are : Kelly Benson , Phillip Rhys , Emmanuelle Vaugier , Byron Chief - Moon and veteran actress Betsy Palmer .
0 I have not seen the first film and if it anything like this have no great desire to . < br /><br />Having just watched it a few hours ago I am struggling to remember a thing about it . < br /><br />From what I remember it 's main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people stay at a house with that dodgy old woman from Friday the 13th and are stalked by plank of wood man.<br /><br />Some people die , the film ends , I am starting a law suit against the person who sold me this film as I want compensation for the missing time in my life . < br /><br />I will pay u £ 1 to take this film off my hands ...... oh wait I already gave it away to a " friend " .
0 Before starting to watch the show , I 've heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting . What a deception , the scripts are so dumb that I am quite sure the authors are son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers . And what about the SFX and colors , they are so extreme that it is painful to watch , colors are not saturated they are over saturated , like scripts are overwritten and show is overrated . This show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best , they are sufficient . Unfortunately for this show , the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility .
0 i am very disappointed with this movie because i like these french actors and i liked " Buffet Froid " from this Director ( bertrand blier ) but the script of " Les Acteurs " is VERY POOR . why these actors they agreed to play this poor scenario .
0 I am really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons I 've ever seen . I did not laugh once throughout this short , and it 's a Bugs Bunny cartoon , for Christ 's sake ! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny , not boring ! Alas , this short turns out to be Good Night Elmer ( another incredibly boring Jones short ) with the addition of Bugs Bunny.<br /><br />The first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff . Good Night Elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff . This cartoon , on the other hand , is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon : there 's too much dialogue . The cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve , but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue . At one point , Elmer finishes eating dinner , and comments , " That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb , " possibly the most redundant dialogue I 've ever heard in a cartoon ( characters reading text out loud in the later - era Woody Woodpecker cartoons does n't count in my book ) . Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long , it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this.<br /><br />Elmer 's Pet Rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me , but if you 've sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career , you might enjoy it .
0 I am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators . To me it was rather a disappointment , especially the combination of historical facts , fantasy and the main character 's internal turmoil does not work at all ( in Vonnegut 's book Slaughterhouse Five and even in George Roy Hill 's adaptation for the screen it does ) . Credibility is often overstretched . Too many questions are left open . Did I miss some central points ? Or did I fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots ? < br /><br />A boy called Campbell , Jr. , grows up in upstate New York . At home his father has many technical trade papers and one book . It has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it . The boy leafs through the book , his dad does n't like his doing that . What should this tell me ? The family moves away from upstate New York to Berlin . BANG . It is 1938 , the boy is a married man in Berlin and a theater playwright . What kind of plays does he write ? In what language ? Is he successful ? His wife is an actress and looks glamorous . The parents move back to the USA and invite their son to do the same . He does not . Why ? Because having grown up in Germany he feels more German than American ? Because he is successful ? Because his wife is ? Because he likes his life there ? Because he likes the Nazis ? Because he is just plain lazy and does n't like change ? Do n't ask me.<br /><br />Possibly , the man just does not care , is not interested in politics , is a kind of an existentialist . He states that he is deeply in love with his wife . He speaks of his Republic of Two ( meaning he and his wife ) . There is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie , it much more seems a Republic of One.<br /><br />On the request of an American agent Campbell , Jr. , agrees to broadcast anti Semitic Nazi hate propaganda to American listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to American authorities who read between the lines . The crucial meeting with the agent on a Berlin park bench is short , unexciting and anti climactic , the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation , the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast.<br /><br />So now we have Campbell , Jr. , presenting himself over the air as the Last Free American . The scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting - although one wonders what happened when Campbell , Jr. , really and honestly had to cough , hiccup etc . ( must have scrambled the messages terribly ) . Anyway , the Nazis lose , the wife dies ( touring in the Crimean for German troops - I never heard such tours really happened on German front lines in WW II ) , Campbell , Jr. , says he goes to the Russian front but does not go , is captured by an American soldier who recognizes his mug ( how come ? ) , is dragged to a sight - seeing tour in Auschwitz , is then released and resettled with the help of the Crucial Agent somewhere in the City of New York.<br /><br />AND THIS IS WHERE THE STORY REALLY STARTS < br /><br />BANG . From now on it is like a short story by Paul Auster . It is 1961 , Campbell , Jr. , lives in New York tenement as a has - been and mourns the loss of his wife . Nobody really cares - or do they ? Yes , somehow they do , and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction . Auschwitz survivors . A painter . Some American supremacists discover " him and want him to be their figurehead . They even find his presumed dead wife for him , or is she his wife ? Anyway , in the end Campbell , Jr. , calls in at the Israeli consulate , and they obligingly give him the Big War Criminal treatment , placing him in the cell adjacent to Adolf Eichmann 's . He writes his life story and , once this task finished , hangs himself on the typewriter 's ribbons without getting sooty the least bit.<br /><br />While I can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss , I just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone . So I found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss . Amazingly , many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero , having put his reputation at stake for playing the Last Free American . I assume according to them this took a lot of courage . As a matter of fact , however , the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment Campbell created for himself a win - win situation , as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war . The danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story.<br /><br />One might argue , that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything . But even then it fails to make a point , primarily , I suspect , because the love affair in the Republic of Two falls completely flat . This is a pity , especially if you consider that the wife was played by Sheryl Lee , a talented , versatile and sensuous actress . She has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous German accent . Another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts ( confession , broadcast and hidden messages ) , but I guess this is largely unfilmable . Maybe I should give the book a chance .
0 This was an awful movie ! Not for the subject matter , but for the delivery . I went with my girlfriend at the time ( when the movie came out ) , expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over oppression . What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression , with no uplift at the end . The previews and ads made NO mention of this ! Plus , for all that they played up whoopi goldberg , my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes ! Again , the previews say nothing about this ! ( not that you would expect that , but it 's just more of the problem ) . If I had known how depressing this movie would be , I would 've never have seen it . Or at least , I would 've been prepared for it . This was a bait and switch ad campaign , and I will NEVER see this movie again !
0 The concept for Sarafina appears to be a sound one , that is aside from the musical perspective . It attempts to combine upbeat African music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set . The contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror . Had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film , however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers do n't exactly sit well next to the songs . < br /><br />Aside from the poor premise the acting is n't the best either , Goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast . Overall a disappointment.<br /><br />3/10
0 I just did n't get this movie ... Was it a musical ? no .. but there were choreographed songs and dancing in it ... <br /><br />Was it a serious drama .... no the acting was not good enough for that.<br /><br />Is Whoopi Goldberg a quality serious Actor .. Definently not.<br /><br />I had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie . The message on apartheid and the " tribute " to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted . But as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse.<br /><br />See for yourself , but in fairness I hated it
0 One scene demonstrates the mentality of " Terminator Woman " pretty well : Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain 's camp . Karen runs across an armed guard , who points his gun at her , but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight . Karen kicks him in the balls , picks up the gun and runs away ! Then again , when a film is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of his family , you know you should n't expect too much . Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble do get some amusing banter going early on , and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their love - hate relationship . But after about 20 minutes they get separated , and the film slows to a crawl , and even with the occasional fight scene to liven things up , it lacks excitement . The finale has Trimble fighting Qissi inside a cave and Sheperd going womano - a - womano against the beautiful Ashley Hayden on a speedboat , but the fights are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value . On the positive side , kudos to the costuming department for giving Karen the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the film ! ( * 1/2 )
0 This film has got several key flaws . The first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot ! This sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch but also sends the watcher certain feelings of hopelessness , as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life . This means that the film can not captivate it 's audience , instead it encourages the viewing public to grow contempt for the film and everything associated with it ! In short , it really is very very very very very very very BAD ! Do yourself a favour and chew on a large rubber shoe , you 'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching Terminator Woman .
0 You may want to know up front that I am not a Mormon , unlike a good number of those who have already reviewed this film . I mention this so you 'll understand that the way I look at the film may differ greatly from those in the faith . For some , being critical of the film might be seen as being critical of the faith -- and that is NOT my intention . So , my review is that of an outsider trying to look inside and learn more about who this man and his people were . Well , after seeing the film , I doubt if I have learned much at all . Since I have been a history teacher , I have a good basic understanding about Young as well as Joseph Smith as well as the teachings of the church . But anyone wanting to see this film to really learn anything will probably be disappointed because the film seems so gosh - darn nice -- too nice and too unrealistic in its portrayal . Plus , you learn practically nothing about the church 's beliefs other than they are nice people , work hard and some have many wives ( and this latter part is only barely hinted at in the film ) . Instead , the people are almost cartoon - like in their simplistic portrayals . Joseph Smith and Brigham Young and their followers are angelic , the non - Mormons were all devils and Brian Donlevy ( playing EXACTLY the same sort of role Edward G. Robinson later played in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ) is the trouble - maker who claims to be a Mormon but just comes along so the film can have a bad guy . It 's all so very simple .... too simple . Almost like an indoctrination film or infomercial.<br /><br />Brigham Young especially was a very complex man -- with many good points ( an excellent organizer and visionary ) as well as bad ( do n't even get me started on his views about Blacks within the church or intermarriage ) . To portray him in such vague terms is just plain silly . It 's also a lot like how Gandhi was portrayed in the film with Ben Kingsley -- only the facts that led to his being almost super - human were emphasized . Heck , now that I think about that , this is the trouble with most religious films -- they often come off as one - dimensional , trite and bland . Let 's have a full and more complete film of these men -- one that will stick to facts and not emotional appeals.<br /><br />Now if you can ignore the fact that you wo n't learn very much about the faith or its second leader , the film is enjoyable enough . It 's obvious someone at 20th Century - Fox really cared about the film , as they had a wonderful cast of both premier actors ( Tyrone Power ) , up and coming actors ( Linda Darnell , Jane Darwell and Vincent Price ) and wonderful character actors ( Dean Jagger , John Carradine and Brian Donlevy ) . The film also had wonderful location shooting and lots of gloss . It just did n't have a lot to tell us other than they were all " swell " . Plus , there were plenty of factual errors and a few just plain dumb scenes . A few of the mistakes include Young taking over the helm immediately after the death of Joseph Smith ( it was three years later ) , no mention of the various Mormon denominations and splinter groups , talk of " gold in California "-- even though it was 1847 and gold would n't be discovered until 1948 , as well as no specific mention of polygamy or Smith 's many wives . Just plain dumb scenes include Carradine pulling out a gun and waving it about in the courtroom scene -- and no one seemed to care -- even though it was a very hostile audience ! Do n't you think at least the judge would tell him to put it away and stop threatening people with it?!<br /><br />One final comment . Do not , I repeat , do not watch this film when it 's shown on American Movie Classics ( a one great station that has sunk a lot in recent years ) . While I am critical of the film because of its simplistic message , I was horrified with the complete disrespect the station had for the church and its traditions . What I mean is this . The film was punctuated with ads for penis enlargement formulas as well as tons of pop - ups ( some advertising a show that features the " sexiest cast " ) . Talk about disrespectful and gross and I would be just as offended if they did this for any other religious film . By doing this , they not only insult the faith but marginalize their market -- after all , who is into hearing about these things AND the life of Brigham Young ? ! Is this a movie , in this form , that you can show to your kids or recommend to others ? !
0 This film , though ostensibly a comedy , is deadly serious . Its subject is Imperialism ( with a capital I ) : how Britain , foolishly , humiliatingly , tries to convince itself that it 's still a great power after World War II . At home , the Empire is run by amiable dolts , benevolent Tories who are so in - bred that they ca n't distinguish close relatives ; the Offices of Government consist of long forgotten archives ( a dig at Orwellian paranoia ? ) , inhabited by indolent rats , and ante - rooms wherein lounge bored synacures , reading popular novels.<br /><br />Abroad , Britain clings to the old pomp ; but pomp out of context looks threadbare and silly , especially when its embodied in bumbling twits . Carlton - Browne is an unsentimental picture of decline , with none of the lachrymose rot that marred the supposedly anti - imperialist Jewel in the Crown.<br /><br />The film is also about the Cold War , bravely admitting that it 's a dangerous farce , whose participants deserve mockery and contempt , not fear and respect . It 's about how colonialism , characterised more by neglect than tyranny , destroys the colonies it deserts , robbing them of amenities , power , and , most importantly , self - respect , leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys.<br /><br />It 's the seriousness , of course , that kills it . That 's not to say that weighty subjects ca n't be treated in comedy - The Miracle Of Morgan 's Creek , Dr. Strangelove and The Life Of Brian have all proved that . Indeed , one might suggest that serious themes should only be treated by comedy - it allows for a clearer - eyed view.<br /><br />The problem with Carlton - Browne is that every situation must have a significance beyond the merely comic , so that it becomes weighed down and unfunny . In the three films mentioned above , much of the comedy arises from character reaction to an extreme situation , not the extreme situation itself . Here , the script is too poor to sustain rich comic characterisations , and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled - Peter Sellers , Terry - Thomas , Raymond Huntley and John le Mesurier - are criminally wasted.<br /><br />Terry - Thomas , sublime so often , shows that he could n't handle lead parts , and that he needed to play sneering , arrogant bounders , not brainless toffs . The music is made to carry much of the comedy , but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on screen . ( To be fair , unlike the majority of British comedies of the period , which were stagy and underproduced , the Boultings often try to make their points through film itself , by montage and composition ) Only Huntley manages to raise genuine laughs , and that 's by essaying a character he could have played in his sleep.<br /><br />None of the Boultings ' farces have dated well - they 're never thought through enough . Although Carlton - Browne revels in the decline of the Empire , it also seems to be anti - democratic and militaristic . I 'm sure this was n't intended , but these blunders are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form .
0 The main reason people still care about " Carlton - Browne Of The F.O. " is that it features Peter Sellers in a second - billed role . But watching this film to see Peter Sellers is a mistake.<br /><br />Sellers plays Amphibulos , a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirt - poor island nation of Gaillardia , formerly a British colony , now hosting a lot of Russian diggers during the height of the Cold War . Amphibulos wants to play both U.K. and Soviet interests against each other for easy profit , " everything very friendly and all our cards under the table " . Terry - Thomas is the title character , a lazy British diplomat anxious to show Gaillardia that Great Britain has n't forgotten them , all appearances to the contrary.<br /><br />A positive review here says : " The reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated . " I would argue that the reason " Carlton - Browne " is considered below average is because the comedy is non - existent.<br /><br />After a decent opening that establishes the film 's only two strengths , a sympathetically doltish Terry - Thomas and John Addison 's full - on larky score , things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes . The low opinion of Carlton - Browne by his boss and the obscurity of Gaillardia ( which no one can find on a map ) is milked to death . By the time we actually reach the island ( after a labored series of airsick jokes ) , expectations are quite low.<br /><br />They're still too high , though . The island itself , which seems to exist either in Latin America or the Mediterranean , is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport , and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade . The army is apparently still horse drawn , allowing for another lame aural gag by a thick - accented announcer : " In war , the army uses many horse." < br /><br />Sellers never quite takes center stage even when we 're on his character 's island . The plot is taken over instead by Ian Bannen as King Loris , who inherits the throne of Gaillardia after his father 's assassination . Bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written . Normally this would make him the likely target for scene - stealing by Sellers , but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache , Sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year , " The Mouse That Roared " and " I 'm All Right , Jack." < br /><br />Strange that this film , like " Jack " , was a Boulting Brothers production , with Roy Boulting here serving as co - director alongside Jeffrey Dell . Usually Boulting films combine wicked social satire with anything - goes comedy , but here there are only fey jabs in either direction . Amphibulos works his mangled - English vibe for all its worth ( " This man is like , how do you say , the bull in the Chinese ship " ) while Carlton - Browne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve.<br /><br />The weakest and most protracted element of the film is young Loris 's romance with Ilyena . Score one point for her being played by ravishing Luciana Paluzzi , dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressed.<br /><br />The film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one , and a final bit of action by Carlton - Browne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally . Apparently he lives to see another day , but the film of the same name is strictly DOA .
0 It was meant to be a parody on the LOTR - Trilogy . But this was one of the most awful movies I 've ever seen . Bad acting , bad screenplay , bad everything . THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION . I do n't doubt any second that there are people who 'll like this sense of " humor " , but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as Mel Brooks or the Zucker Brothers . I 'm working in a movie theater and in DVD Shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas : At the movies it was a nice ( but no big at all ) success during the first two weeks but then , when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good , the movie dropped very fast . In DVD sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore . In the last ten years , the two worst movies I 've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque . I ca n't decide which one was worse , but I 'm happy that there a so many good movies so I do n't have to think too much on this question .
0 This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . There is absolutely no storyline , the gags are only for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching . In the whole movie Fredi ( oh my god what a funny name . ha ha ) does n't ask himself ONCE how he came from a plane to middle earth . There are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny . e.g. : Gandalf is called Almghandi , Sam is called Pupsi ... and so on . I did n't even smile once during the whole movie . The gags seem like they were made by people whose IQ is negative . If you laugh when someone 's coat is trapped in the door ( this happens about 5 times ) then this movie is perhaps for you . Another funny scene : They try to guess the code word for a closed door ( do n't ask why- do n't ever ask " why " in this movie ) and the code word is ( ha ha ) : dung . So if you laughed at this examples you might like this movie . For everybody else : Go to Youtube and watch " Lord of the Weed " : it 's a lot , lot more fun .
0 This sounded like a really interesting movie from the blurb . Nazis , occult , government conspiracies . I was expecting a low budget Nazi version of the DaVinci code or the Boys from Brazil or even Shockwaves . Instead you get something quite different , more psychological , more something like from David Lynch . That was actually a plus . But the way the story is told is just awful.<br /><br />Part of the trouble is the casting . Andrienne Barbeau 's character starts off the moving being somewhat timid and afraid . She just does n't do that well , even at her age , though she certainly tried . The actor cast as the son apparently thought this was a comedy . Most of the other actors also seemed to have thought this was a campy movie , or at least acted like it , rather than simply being quirky . The only one that I thought did really well was the daughter , Siri Baruc.<br /><br />Another big part is the pacing . It starts off very slowly . So slowly you might be tempted to turn it off . But then it gets compelling for a while when you get to the daughter 's suicide and the aftermath . But shortly afterward , it all becomes a jumbled mess . Some of this was on purpose , but much of it was just needlessly confusing , monotonous , and poorly focused.<br /><br />The real problem , is it 's simply not a pleasant movie to watch . It 's slow , dull , none of the characters are likable . Overuse of imagery and sets . Some movies you see characters get tortured . In this , it 's the viewer that does . It does have a few creepy moments , most notably the creepy Nazi paintings and the credits , but the rest of the movie is mostly just tiresome .
0 This is a movie of tired , yet weirdly childish , clichés . There 's a Nazi witch master performing sf - related experiments in the basement ? Oh please ! < br /><br />Aiming for a creeping sense of horror and fear , the general impression of the film is that of a very immature conception of fright . Not having any expectations beforehand , I am left with : an aged Xander from Buffy and a heroine with ape - like face who does n't seem to know how to act . Said Adrienne Barbeau have I only only encountered before in the much more enjoyable " Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death".<br /><br />Camera and editing adds to the general impression of lame .
0 Can I please say first of all , that I felt so strongly about this movie that I signed up to IMDb specifically to review it . And my review ? This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />The synopsis of the movie sounded interesting- Nazis , occult , time travel , etc . , but the movies plot failed to properly bring all these elements together . Remember the episode of South Park that featured manatees writing Family Guy using ' idea balls ' ? Did these manatees also write Unholy ? Its like the writer wanted to include all these different ideas , but had no idea how to link them all together , and then to make things make even less sense , included a Donnie Darko - esquire time travel theme to the ending , messing up the chronology.<br /><br />I could tell from early on that this was a bad movie . Special effects were too low budget for anything better than straight to DVD . The acting was n't great , but in fairness I 've seen worse . I will praise the Nazi paintings , they were creepy , but the evil Nazi butcher guy was just comic.<br /><br />I do n't have a vendetta against this movie or anything , but to be honest , I 'm not even into the horror genre . But this movie can not be described as a thriller or a drama . If this story had been well told , this would have been a good movie . But it has been over hyped . Waaaaay over hyped .
0 When I started watching this movie I saw the dude from Buffy , Xander , and figured ah how nice that he 's still making a living acting in movies . Now a weird movie I can stand , given that it 's a good dose of weird like for example David Lynch movies , twin peaks , lost highway etc . And you sort of have to be in the mood for one . This one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theory 's that make absolutely no sense . I mean come on people Nazi 's who conspire with America to make an unholy trinity of evil powers ? I was surprised they did n't mention the hollow earth in this movie with Hitler flying saucers and lizard people . Maybe if you had like 60 grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense , but seriously I do n't condone drugs like I do n't condone this movie . It should be burned , shredded and forgotten just so good ol' Xander might get another acting job . It was n't his acting though , that was alright , but the script just did n't make any sense . Sorry .
0 I 'm not sure this is a spoiler ; perhaps it is a public service . If you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits , you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcer 's voice - over , which states the U.S. has just surrendered to Nazi Germany on May 7 , 1945 to end WWII . Here are just a few of the problems with this close : < br /><br />1)The older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more UNHOLY movies in their mind 's eye to fill in the yawning chasm between movie events and this startling conclusion.<br /><br />2)The average person will really kick themselves that they did not " watch " one of these UNHOLY fill - in - the - blanks flicks created in their own head for free , instead of shelling out time and money to see this UNHOLY from the video store ( or on cable).<br /><br />3)This end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about WWII , leading them to the conclusion that George W. Bush is the latest heir to the Nazi throne .
0 I read Rice 's novel with interest , and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths.<br /><br />However , I was simply APPALLED at this disastrous adaptation . The casting was based merely on physical appearance , and not acting talent ( with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher , who was neither blond - haired , or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag ) . The cast 's embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a French accent was hilarious , but not in an entertaining way . I found myself wincing through this muddled and melodramatic tripe , and was surprised I made it to the end.<br /><br />A warning to fans of the novel - stay away from this one .
0 This movie was so badly written , directed and acted that it beggars belief . It should be remade with a better script , director and casting service . The worst problem is the acting . You have Jennifer Beals on the one hand who is polished , professional and totally believable , and on the other hand , Ri'chard , who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece . Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just awful as the slave owning ( and keeping ) couple , although both normally do fine work . The actors ( and director ) should not have attempted to do accents at all -- they are inconsistent and unbelievable . Much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual English . The casting is ludicrous . Why have children of an " African " merchant ( thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society ) been cast with very pale skinned actors , while the supposedly socially desirable Marcel , has pronounced African features , including an obviously dyed blond " fro " ? It 's as if the casting directors can not be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color . It 's just so weird ! This could be a great movie and should be re - made , but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors . There are plenty of good actors out there , and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals , Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would do with an appropriate cast , good script and decent direction .
0 The story and the show were good , but it was really depressing and I hate depressing movies . Ri'Chard is great . He really put on a top notch performance , and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous . Seriously , I thought she was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile . I ca n't say anything bad about Peter Galleghar . He 's one of my favorite actors . I love Anne Rice . I 'm currently reading the Vampire Chronicles , but I 'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book . This is a little too"real " for me . I prefer Lestat and Louis 's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves . Eartha Kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did The movie was ruined for me ; I could barely stand to watch the rest of the show . ( sorry for the ambiguity , but I do n't want to give anything away ) Sorry , but it 's just not my type of show .
0 " Feast of All Saints ? " Where ... ? When ... ?<br /><br />Was the Feast of All Saints storyline and theme edited out ? < br /><br />What a waste of a wonderful title ! There is never anything in the story that has the remotest connection to the " Feast of All Saints . " Nor is there anything in the story about " All Souls Day " which the term is referencing . Why bother to use this title if you never intend to including any kind of storyline or theme about " All Souls Day " or the " Feast of All Saints " ? < br /><br />Embarrassly Bad Script & Amateur Writing < br /><br />How did they attract such great talent to this clunker ? The writing is so amateur -- characters that have known each other all their life go into big long speeches about their life history for the sake of the audience . Not at all the way people talk to each other . < br /><br />What was the Director Thinking?<br /><br />The directing is equally bad ! The forced and overly deliberate style feels amateurish . In one scene , a character is yelling " Take your hands off of me " and NO ONE is touching him ! The most badly directed scene however , is the incredibly over - the - top battle scene at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />Excessive Gore in a Very Fake , Silly Battle Scene < br /><br />There are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene . It looks like a Saturday Night Live skit ! ! You can see extras waiting for their cues to walk across camera . Everyone plays their death scene like 4th grade boys -- exaggerating every little gasp and twitch . The blood on battle victims is so excessive and carelessly applied it looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just squirted straight lines of red on the costumes.<br /><br />This whole battle scene comes off as the spoof of a really cheesy war movie . You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride up on a horse and deliver the punchline.<br /><br />Who in Real Life Would Ever Behave this Way ? ! < br /><br />The most ridiculous bit of writing , directing and casting is actually the focus of the scene : < br /><br />A little girl is standing under the dead body of her hanging father -- who is terribly mutilated , and literally dripping blood form his gaping wounds . Even a totally idiot would know he is dead ! Yet she is -- very monotonously -- repeating over and over " Daddy , daddy ... " while looking at someone off - screen . She delivered it with about as much believability and passion as you could expect from an non - actor kid that had been repeating the line for the cameras all day.<br /><br />Even if the poor kid had any acting skills , the scene is completely unbelievable . The little girl would n't even BE in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage -- surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies , while she calmly stands there ! ! Natural instincts would had the kid screaming and terrified , running AWAY from the bloody carnage ! < br /><br />Are we Suppose to be Horrified or Laugh ... ?!<br /><br />One particularly goofy detail , that gives the scene an SNL satire tone , is the father hanging , with a huge hook through his mouth and cheek . He looks like a fish on a hook ! The unintentionally funny details , make the whole scene come across as fake and silly.<br /><br />In Fantasy La - La - Land , Mothers and Daughters are the Same Age ! < br /><br />Another funny detail , is that you see a central character -- the little girl 's mother -- at the end of the scene and in the next scene , that occurs 20 + years later , she looks exactly the same ! She is still young and beautiful , and now the same age as her daughter ! < br /><br />I almost turned the movie off right there because the direction and writing were obviously awful -- but I tried to stick it out because I wanted to see the Louisiana settings and I like all the actors . I do n't know what these fine actors were thinking when they accepted these roles!<br /><br />Who was the Targeted Audience?<br /><br />The excessive amount of blood and badly acted violence in the opening scene are weirdly out of place with the soap opera storytelling tone that follows . It is also a strange way to start a movie that , for the rest of the time , seems targeted to romance novel reading females . Weird inconsistency in tone !

0 There 's so little here of the fantastic Anne Rice book that what IS here makes no sense . Some of the characters -- intense and surprising characters -- don't make it to the screen at all , and those who do are watered down to the point that there 's no reason for their existence.<br /><br />Where 's the relationship between Christophe and Marcel ? Where 's the continued affair between Marcel and Juliet ? Why does Dolly Rose appear at all , since her story 's never explained ? Where 's the rape and redemption of Marie , whose greatest attribute ( and downfall ) is that she can pass for white -- and her marriage to Richard ? Why does the film end with Marcel 's beating at the hands of his father ? We learn nothing of Aglae beyond that she 's a bitch who hates her husband ; why no backstory explaining this hatred ? < br /><br />As for the performances , there 's not a one that 's better than mediocre , though that 's likely due to the lousy script . Best of the lot is that of the actor playing Richard -- but Richard 's not on screen enough to salvage the film . Worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose , though again , it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she 's given to work with.<br /><br />All in all , this is just terrible . I thought it 'd be impossible for any Anne Rice book - turned film to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN , but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that mess look like a critical hit . How is it that Rice is such a slut she 'll allow her best works to become such junk on the screen ?
0 A slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of NewOrleans black women by white men of power and privilege . Ooh . Does that whet your appetite ? Well , then , belly up to a VHS or DVD and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history . For good measure , it 's adapted from the book by celebrated hack Anne Rice . The directing is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog . Most of acting is amateurish . The production 's sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors , all of whom have scarcely been in employed in today 's market ( Jasmine Guy , Ben Vereen , Pam Grier , Eartha Kitt ) , including some faces that have barely been seen at all ( Bianca Lawson , Rachel Cuttrell ) . It also is , despite itself , a sterling showcase for Nicole Lyn . The pompous and ponderous James Earl Jones is on - hand as well . So , is the late Ossie Davis , a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary Negro Ensemble Company . This film should be rated " T " for tripe .
0 College students , who are clearing out a condemned dormitory , are stalked by an elusive killer.<br /><br />The Dorm That Dripped Blood ( aka Pranks ) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans . The movies production values are pretty low and the story for the most part is pretty routine , there 's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring . In fact much of the story 's build - up is pretty forgettable , save for one or two brutal murders . But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax ( in an atmospheric setting ) and one fairly bold , unconventional conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is lackluster for the most part . Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character . Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill - fated student.<br /><br />Over all this is a pretty standard B slasher effort , but the finale is well worth savoring and for this viewer saved the movie from being a complete ho - hum.<br /><br / > * * out of * * * *
0 Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher , and the light fades quickly . If not her , than what other reason to watch this . five college kids are signed up to prepare an old dorm for its due date of demolition . Problems are automatically occurring when a weird homeless man is soliciting , and the group are short a few people . Then , a killer is on the loose . I honestly wanted to say I was going to enjoy this one . It had a fair set up , or maybe that was just Daphne Zuniga in it . The film is too slow , and almost as silent as a library . Most of the acting is below average , and the " point - of - view " moments are so old news . Acclaimed composer Christopher Young of such films as " Hellraiser " and " Entrapment " scored this , in a repetitive cue line that was better made for a TV movie . Still , it seems higher than the movie deserves . So , other than Young and Zuniga , this one scrapes the bottom of the barrel .
0 Over Christmas break , a group of college friends stay behind to help prepare the dorms to be torn down and replaced by apartment buildings . To make the work a bit more difficult , a murderous , Chucks - wearing psycho is wandering the halls of the dorm , preying on the group in various violent ways.<br /><br />Registered as one of the 74 ' video nasties ' listed by the U.K. in the 1980s , The Dorm That Dripped Blood had a good reputation built up for it prior to first viewing . The term ' video nasty ' strikes into mind some images of some great explicit gore , violence , sex , etc . : All the things a horror fan dreams of . So , after hearing all of that info , I settled into Pranks ( alt . title ) expecting a sleazy slasher experience . . . and that 's what it tried to be , but failed pretty much completely . Visually , the film 's not great . The cinematography , gore ( except for a couple scenes ) , and overall direction all fail . It 's simply not enjoyable to watch . The unoriginal script is lacking and often throws in random things without any real reason ( like the opening kill ) . There are some cool death scenes , including a pretty nice face melt ( which can be seen on the poster ) , but that 's about it for the positive . The acting is pretty bad , the story seems unimportant , the killer is n't cool or scary , and it suffers the one major error that any slasher flick should always avoid : it 's a bit boring . Overall , for a film done by a few UCLA film students for $ 90,000 ( which would be over double that today ) , The Dorm That Dripped Blood is n't a total mess . It has a couple good things , and is fairly watchable . . . But , as a slasher flick looking to be on the level of films like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces . . . it just can not compare . Do n't expect much , and you may at least be entertained . I hate to say it , but this is one of the few films I 've seen that would actually be better with a remake . . . and yet , they go after great works like Black Christmas . Oh well . . .<br /><br />Obligatory Horror Elements:<br /><br />- Subgenre : Slasher < br /><br />- Violence / Gore : There are some brutally cool kills , and the gore is okay for the most part . . . but nothing special . Also , they off - screened some of the best murders.<br /><br />- Sex / Nudity : There 's a little unappealing ( to me ) nudity , but not very much.<br /><br />- Cool Killer(s ) : Nah . The ending monologue(s ) of the killer made him / her pretty uncool.<br /><br />- Scares / Suspense : A jump scare or two , but nothing too effective.<br /><br />- Mystery : I suppose , yeah , but I simply did n't care enough , and it 's as obvious as the nose on the killer 's face.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />Final verdict : 3.75/10 . Bah ! Humbug ! < br /><br />-AP3-
0 I 'm not looking for quality ; I 'm just trying to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in Britain . This one was initially banned and re - released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut.<br /><br />Some college kids spend their Christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation . There are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids . Which of them is the slasher ? The actual killings are not very gory , so this video nastie is not really nasty . There is the requisite flashing of the boobies , but it has nothing to do with the college kids.<br /><br />I had a suspect very quickly and I turned out to be right . Maybe I 've seen too many of these . The end twist was clever ; I have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality .
0 Probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever , badly acted and badly written.<br /><br />THE PLOT Five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm , but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one , the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper John Hemmitt played by Woody Roll , or could it be one of the five characters.<br /><br />ACTING Not that bad not that great either apart from Daphne Zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine , and the rest well quite dull although Laura Lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end.<br /><br />THE KILLS Ca n't really see why they banned this , the kills look fake mostly , one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake , but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car , one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive.<br /><br />OVERALL Not really a great slasher could have been a lot better
0 An uninteresting addition to the stalk ' n slash cycle which dominated the horror genre in the 1980 's . This was filmed as Pranks but released as The Dorm That Dripped Blood which is an obvious steal from the 1970 horror anthology The House That Dripped Blood . Daphne Zuniga is the only recognisable face in the cast and this was her first horror movie ( she has also appeared in The Initiation and The Fly II ) .
0 The two things are are good about this film are it 's two unknown celebrities.<br /><br />First , Daphne Zuniga , in her first appearance in a film , young and supple , with looks that still encompass her body today , steals the very beginning , which is all she is in , and that is that . She is obviously just starting out because her acting improved with her next projects.<br /><br />Second , the score by then known composer Christopher(Chris ) Young is what keeps this stinker from getting a one star ... yeah , I know one star more is not much , but in this movie 's case , it is a lot.<br /><br />The rest is just stupid senseless horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down , getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer , blah , blah , blah ... we all know where this is going.<br /><br />Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga , then turn it off .
0 Eh , not a particular good slasher flick . So - so acting , effects , decent yet familiar and uninventive soundtrack.<br /><br />There are three deaths in close succession near the beginning of the movie that make for a fairly good scene in which it would seem anything goes . Apart from that , there 's a lot of characters wandering around , not realizing what 's going on , or chasing after red herrings ; more killing of time , than of people . There are other deaths , and the killer is an equal opportunity murderer , not partial to any one implement . The killer also likes to set other people up to kill innocent people as well . The identity is n't revealed towards the end , and motive is pretty thin , and we really do n't care.<br /><br />Supposedly the movie takes place around Christmas , but this is n't a major factor . One scene gets lit by Christmas lights , that 's about it.<br /><br />The movie is rather dark with a muddy picture most of the time , at least on the videotape I watched . Some of the dialog got a little lost in some of the opening scenes . The ending should have been stronger than it was . We think we realize what happened , although there 's a chance something else did .
0 I heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80 's movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see . Well , I rented it and I have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as " April Fools Day " , " Friday 13th " and " Prom Night " , this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story . Characters that I found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer . Another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket , he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting , instead , the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste , I was disappointed in his part in the end . As far as the true identity of the killer goes , when the identity was released as to who he was , I just laughed , but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed . This movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but do n't spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory .
0 It 's the early 80s . There 's a group of suspiciously old - looking teens . And there 's a maniac stalking around . Yes , this is slasherville.<br /><br />This movie is called Pranks . Why is it called Pranks ? I have n't the faintest idea . Unless your idea of a great prank is to repeatedly hit someone 's dinner with a baseball bat - on balance , not a great prank ; in fact quite a rubbish prank if truth be told . But there you go.<br /><br />The film itself concerns a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a decommissioned dormitory . They become aware that a psychopath is on the loose . To combat this development , they split up and wander about in the dark . It ends in tears for most of them.<br /><br />Pranks is a badly made slasher movie . The DVD release I viewed was the Vipco one . It appears to be cut of a fair bit of violence . This makes the DVD even more pointless because , let 's face it , a slasher movie shorn of violence is a waste of time . For slasher - film and video nasty completists only .
0 ( ( NB : Spoiler warning , such as it is!))<br /><br />First off , this is a teen slasher flick -- the Spam - In - A - Cabin genre , as Joe Bob Briggs piquantly put it . If you 're looking for Roshambo , this is n't it and was n't going to BE it . I 'm desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography , directing or acting performances.<br /><br />Secondly , this was n't Zuniga 's first horror flick , it was her first screen appearance period , cinema , TV , whatever . For what it is worth ; neither is Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon or Katherine Hepburn.<br /><br />Thirdly , you have to give even a lame slasher flick props . Sure , it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre : any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof , and the harvest time is now.<br /><br />Except this one gives the chop to the sweet , virginal protagonist as well ! Now THERE is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions ! Interesting that this was said ingenue 's only film role . Another One Hit Wonder , except that term gives the lass too much credit.<br /><br />(Then again , this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one - movie actors in history . Of the nineteen credited actors , a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film . Three appeared in one other movie by the same producers . Only one other besides Zuniga has as many as six screen credits . What was this , the Has Been And Never Were Mutual Aid Society?)<br /><br />Granted , I saw this a long time ago on late night cable when I was bored and never anticipate being that bored in my life again , but I see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the incinerator with Joanne.<br /><br />2/10 .
0 One of a multitude of slashers that appeared in the early eighties , Pranks is notable only for an early performance by Daphne Zuniga ( The Sure Thing , The Fly 2 ) ; her character dies fairly early on , and the rest of the film is totally forgettable.<br /><br />During their Christmas break , a group of students volunteer to clear a condemned college building of its furniture . A crazy killer , however , throws a spanner in the works by methodically bumping off the youngsters one by one in a variety of gruesome ways.<br /><br />Exploiting every stalk ' n ' slash cliché in the book , director Jeffrey Obrow delivers a tedious and unexciting horror that had me praying for the characters to be killed , so that I could get on with watching something more worthwhile . The majority of the deaths ( which , let 's face it , is why we generally watch this kind of film ) are brief and not that gory ; the only truly grisly imagery comes right at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor ( there is one notably bloody dismembered corpsethe film could 've done with more).<br /><br />At the last minute , the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpectedly downbeat ending , but this really is one for slasher completists only .
0 This one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre Slasher movies but it 's surely a damn bad movie.<br /><br />The Holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it 's poor production values and stupid plot . I mean , the sub - genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far . There is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add.<br /><br />The clichès are more than boring , the gore is minimal , and so does the mystery.<br /><br />This is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that should n't be hyped even if it has a video nastie label.<br /><br />I am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of trash .
0 If you 've ever seen an eighties slasher , there is n't much reason to see this one . Originality often is n't one of slasher cinema 's strongpoints , and it 's something that this film is seriously lacking in . There really is n't much that can said about Pranks , so I 'll make this quick . The film was one of the 74 films included on the DPP Video Nasty list , and that was my only reason for seeing it . The plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at Christmas time . As they 're in a slasher , someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie . The fact that this movie was on the Video Nasty list is bizarre because , despite a few gory scenes , this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone , and gorier slashers than this ( Friday the 13th , for example ) did n't end up banned . But then again , there 's banned films that are much less gory than this one ( The Witch Who Came from the Sea , for example ) . Anyway , the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it , as although the audience really could n't care less who the assailant is by this point ; it is rather well done . On the whole , this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss .
0 What the ........... is this ? This must , without a doubt , be the biggest waste of film , settings and camera ever . I know you ca n't set your expectations for an 80 's slasher high , but this is too stupid to be true . I baught this film for 0.89 $ and I still feel the urge to go claim my money back . Can you imagine who hard it STINKS ? < br /><br />Who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations ? ? ? Well actually , you could n't possible care less . And why should you ? The makers of this piece of garbage sure did n't care . They did n't try to create a tiny bit of tension . The director ( Stephen Carpenter -- I guess it 's much easier to find money with a name like that ) also made the Kindred ( 1986 ) wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did Soul Survivors . Complete crap as well , but at least that one had Eliza Dushku . This junk has the debut of Daphne Zuniga ! ! ! ( Who ? ? ) Yeah that 's right , the Melrose Place chick . Her very memorable character dies about 15 min . after the opening credits . She 's the second person to die . The first victim dies directly in the first minute , but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares ? The rest of the actors ... they do n't deserve the term actors actually , are completely uninteresting . You 're hoping they die a quick and painful death ... and not only their characters < br /><br />My humble opinion = 0 / 10
0 I 've always liked Fred MacMurray , andalthough her career was tragically cut shortI think Carole Lombard is fun to watch . Pair these two major and attractive stars together , add top supporting players like Jean Dixon , Anthony Quinn , Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth , give them a romantic script , team them with noted director Mitchell Leisen and you get  a mediocre movie experience.<br /><br />Skid Johnson ( Fred ) and Maggie ( Carole ) " meet cute " during her visit to the Panama Canal , and spend the next few weeks falling in love . Skid 's a great trumpeter , so he embarks on a musical career , which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall . During his climb to musical stardom , he neglects Maggie , who later inspires him to start over after he 's hit rock bottom . Ah , yes  it 's the true Hollywood happy ending , which comes none too soon.<br /><br />Stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success , but this movie is so predictable and slow - paced that it 's difficult to watch at times . The early scenes set in Panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever , and later an alcoholic Skid just wanders endlessly in New York . Fred and Carole try their best , but the tired script and S - L - O - W direction just do n't give them a chance . Even the final scene , in which Maggie encourages Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment , just does n't ring true.<br /><br />This movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars MacMurray and Lombard . However , I guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours .
0 I am a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard . And , in addition to them , Charles Butterworth ( a very enjoyable supporting actor ) was in this film, ... so why did n't I particularly enjoy it ? ! Well , despite a good cast , this is one of the poorest written and most clichéd " A pictures " I have ever seen . Given the talent and money spent to make this film , it is shocking how slip - shod the writing was . I knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film I found myself predicting EXACTLY what would happen next -- and I was always right ! And this is n't because I am some sort of " movie savant " , but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it . In fact , it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichés all strung together ! Also , I found it a bit irritating that Fred mistreated Carole so bad throughout the film and yet , true to convention , she came running to him in the end . Uggh ! There is MORE suspense in a Lassie film ( " will he bring people to rescue Timmy or will the rope he is dangling from break?").<br /><br />Despite the very , very tired and clichéd script , there were a few positives about the film . It was pretty cool seeing Fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film -- it was pretty believable and he looked like he had n't eaten , shaved or slept in days . Also , Charles Butterworth 's " prattle " did provide a few mildly humorous moments . But all this just was n't enough to make this film look any different than a " B movie " . It 's a shame, ... it could have been so much better .
0 In what would be his first screenplay , based on his own short story " Turn About , " William Faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty , sacrifice , and really strange relationships . The story originally was about only the Tone , Young , and Cooper characters , but MGM needed to put Joan Crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract , and Faulkner obliged by creating a female role . Crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her co - stars ' Young and Tone , leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraph - like shorthand that sounds like a Monty Python sketch ( " Wuthering Heights " performed in semaphore ) . Seriously , the almost entirely pronoun - less sentences make Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James.<br /><br />The film also reflects some familiar Faulkner themes , with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister ( as may be found in his " Sanctuary , " and elsewhere ) . When Young proposes to Crawford , in Tone 's presence , in lieu of an engagement ring ALL THREE exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another . The closeness of Tone and Young is also noticeable , especially as they go off to their Thelma & Louise fate . Frankly , it 's creepy.<br /><br />Not as creepy to this New Yorker , however , as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach , Wellington , which Crawford cheerfully catches ( and which is shown gamboling over her hands -- I had to turn away ! ) and Young turns into a gladiator . Blech.<br /><br />That being said , there are some nice performances . Young is particularly engaging in a scene where he 's taken up in Cooper 's fighter plane , and Roscoe Karns is delightful as Cooper 's flying buddy . Tone , despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue , has a nice moment , dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy Young 's fate . Crawford , stripped of meaningful dialogue as well , mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic , which is quite a balancing act for one role.<br /><br />The battle scenes -- not surprisingly , for a Howard Hawks film -- are the most exciting part of the entire picture . But not enough . As far as I 'm concerned , this is 75 minutes of my life I 'm never going to get back .
0 My wife and I thought that with this cast and director , the movie would have to be at least worth watching . We were wrong . In fact , we gave up on it after 45 minutes . The idea that Crawford , Young and Tone are British but speak with American accents was , for me , impossible to get past -- hard to believe this is England when no one talks with a British accent . There is zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone , and to echo a previous comment , the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous . There is no reason to care about any of the characters , which is why we threw in the towel halfway through . I found it hard to believe that Hawks directed this , as none of the actors spoke with the trademark Hawksian rat - a - tat delivery . So save your time , and skip this one .
0 Could n't believe it ! Clipped sentences ? Good grief ! Know what ? All true ! Real people ever talk like this ? Do n't think so . Good girl ! Stout fellow ! Stiffen upper lip ! Only reason given movie 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper such a dish . Movie as a whole ridiculous unless you like watching endless biplane dogfights . Seemed endless , anyway . Think all Franchot Tone 's dialogue dubbed . When Crawford and Young make a special effort to sound British they come over as Irish . Handy tip - we Brits clip words , not sentences . And somehow we manage to draaaaaaaawl at the same time . But that 's only if we 've been to a really good public ( that 's private to you ) school .
0 Lulu ( Louise Brooks ) works as a typist and is missing something in her life . She enters a Miss France contest against the wishes of her boyfriend Andre ( Georges Charlia ) and she wins . She sets off for the Miss Europe title leaving her boyfriend behind . She wins again but returns home to Andre because he has asked her to . Once back together , her life becomes mundane again so one night she writes a note to him and leaves to experience the fame that is waiting for her as Miss Europe . Andre follows her ..... <br /><br />This film is a silent film with a piano music - track all the way through . It is also sped - up so everything seems fast . Limited dialogue has been added on afterwards and it is very phony . The cast are alright bearing in mind that it is a silent film . The best part of the film comes at the end but the story goes on a little too long . After watching this , I 'm not really sure what the big deal was over the looks of Louise Brooks - she has a terrible haircut that makes her face look fat . I do n't need to watch it again .
0 Please Note : I see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film . I saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky . Considering some indicate that the original version was LONGER and without crappy dubbing , my review must be read with this in mind.<br /><br />Although I know that Rene Clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and Louise Brooks has a bit of a cult following as well , this is in many ways a technically poorly made film . While Hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929 , up through the early to almost the mid-30s , a lot of famous French films were essentially silent films -- with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film . The lip movements in many , and in particular this film , do n't even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an American like Ms. Brooks could do a French film . This is just sloppy and I would have preferred they had just made a silent film -- and as a silent film this is would have been an average film -- with excellent camera work ( at times ) and some decent silent - style acting.<br /><br />The problem I also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot . For a silent morality play circa 1920 , it would have been fine , but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary ( that means " old "-- not " slutty " ) . A lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé ca n't handle it . She gives it all up , temporarily , but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end ! A tad melodramatic , huh ? And also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped.<br /><br />Finally , the character of the fiancé 's friend ( ? ) I found very disturbing and unreal . He looked like Harold Lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else . As he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about , his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean - spirited . Were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused ? This seems to me that 's what is implied and I do n't like it at all.<br /><br />There are FAR better French films of the era ( Le Million , La Femme du Boulanger , Fanny , Regain , and others ) as well as better silent films . I just ca n't understand this film 's high rating .
0 This review may contain some SPOILERS.<br /><br />Just when you thought they did n't make them so extremely bad anymore , along comes Rae Dawn Chong as a space vixen and Willie Nelson as a Native American witchdoctor ! It 's even worse when you factor in that these two are the BETTER aspects of ` Starlight , ' a film that should only be viewed for laughs.<br /><br />Chong is an alien sent to Earth to seek out the only remaining half - breed , part man and part alien . Apparently , the Earth is in dire straits . Something is wrong with the genetics of mankind , and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland . Only by duplicating the DNA of the half - breed can the kindly alien race save the planet . Do n't ask me how that is , since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution , which is caused by humans . You would think Earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures , not saving them ! Anyway , the half - breed turns out to be Billy Wirth , a man living in a small Southwestern town and is part Native American from his mother 's line , despite the fact that his mother is a red - headed Caucasian and his grandfather is Willie Nelson . Was n't this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic Carmen Electra bomb ` The Chosen One ' such a howler ? Chong arrives in her ship just as Wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend . Before you can say utter the word ` hogwash , ' Chong is revealing her secret to Wirth , who is n't surprised for a moment , and spreading the word to Wirth 's family . Chong also makes pals with Wirth 's mother , who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years . Well , this is because Wirth 's father was an alien that abandoned her . Of course , he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to Earth for Wirth so he can use Wirth 's DNA to make the people of Earth his slaves . ( Huh ? ) His laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture Wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie . Not only are they boring , but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most.<br /><br />The ideas might be nice on paper , but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity , particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien . But the effects are the bane of the movie . The opening scene involves Chong on her spaceship , communicating with her superior , someone who we do not see but that Chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light . They use no spoken words , but telepathy , so we are treated to subtitles . Trouble is , both Chong and her superior 's subtitles both look alike , and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually ` speaking ' at any given moment , which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish . The spaceship is the worst effect to come out of Hollywood this side of an Ed Wood film . Now , I am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this , but these effects really got to me . The most offensive was the most simple one : a fake night sky . The stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone . Most notably are the moments where Chong tells someone she comes from Pleiades , and we get a shot of the seven stars . Thing is , the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie , but any stargazer knows that Pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations Perseus and Taurus , and the cluster does n't take up much room in the sky at all . These effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment . Be careful , for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have Willie Nelson turn into a human spotlight and . . . Oh , it has to be seen to be believed!<br /><br />Starlight , star bright ; Last star I see tonight ; I wish I might , I wish I may ; not have to watch any more of this trash today.<br /><br />Zantara 's score : 1 out of 10 .
0 I finally caught up to " Starlight " last night on television and all I can say is . . . wow ! It 's hard to know where to begin -- the incredibly hokey special effects ( check out the laser beams shooting out of Willie 's eyes ! ) , the atrocious acting , the ponderous dialogue , the mismatched use of stock footage , or the air of earnest pretentiousness that infuses the entire production . This truly is a one - of - a - kind experience , and we should all be thankful for that . I nominate Jonathon Kay as the true heir to Ed Wood !
0 This has an interesting , albeit somewhat fanciful sci - fi plot , but it 's wasted with poor direction and shlocky special effects . Rae Dawn Chong is appealing , despite the lack of a believable story and direction consistent with her talent .
0 All I can really say is that I 'm glad that I was knitting socks while watching the movie , or I would be very angry for having wasted 2 hours of my life . The acting was terrible , the plot was even worse . There were some scenes that were meant to be serious that had my husband and I laughing out loud . I highly recommend this movie to people who like to do their own version of MST3K.
0 I shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing , preachy cinematic trash . Larded with enough Indian - wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to stock a new - age shop , Starlight makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a feather - wearing crystal - fondling idiot.<br /><br />The plot ? Alien Rae Dawn Chong arrives to guide a flute playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert Earth 's impending environmental collapse . But first they must defeat an evil alien who looks nothing so much like a refugee from a Castro street bar . Fortunately , they 've got mystical grandpa Willie Nelson along to help ( who looks faintly embarrassed by the proceedings , as well he ought to be ) along with buckets of cheap F / X and reams of pointlessly swelling music.<br /><br />Sure , the clunky script helps to obscure the film 's trite plot and staggering pace , but that 's just the tip of this melting movie iceberg . Everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science .
0 I wanted to see it because of two reasons . One , it was the remake of High Sierra with Bogart , two , the Bogart part was played by Jack Palance , whom can play dramatic roles with some subtility , as in The Big Knife.<br /><br />But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake . The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra ; only here , the actors do n't care , the director is lost in his thoughts , and who knows what the producer was thinking . Jack Palance is getting bored looking at Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters is asking herself what she 's doing in this film . I do n't even want to compare her to Ida Lupino in the same role . And of course , they had to use the dog story again ! They surely could have come up with some different ideas . Perhaps the color makes it nice to see the same location where they shot High Sierra , but that definitely does n't add any quality to the film.<br /><br />It 's a waste of time if you 've seen High Sierra before . Otherwise , why not see a pseudo - film noir . As for me , I 'd rather die than see it one more time ...
0 City girl Meg Tilly receives a horrifying phone call from her mother and , understandably shaken , returns home to her family 's rural digs , only to be faced with a mystery : why are all the homespun residents acting out in bizarre and unsettling ways ? Radiation thriller , with barely a nod to ecology , has small town residents going berserk , which ( laughably ) includes two women gazing at each other with desire in a public place and Tim Matheson receiving oral attention from a girl on an office bench . The picture is too silly for words , wasting Tilly 's wistfulness and quiet intensity on trash while forcing itself into a corner it ca n't possibly hope to get out of . Some of the cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth is good ( particularly a fire sequence set inside a garage ) , though he is let down by the scrappy editing -- and a fairly bathetic finale . Simplistic screenplay has nary a surprise nor a shred of originality up its sleeve . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 I have been known to fall asleep during films , but this is usually due to a combination of things including , really tired , being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot . However on this occasion I fell asleep because the film was rubbish . The plot development was constant . Constantly slow and boring . Things seemed to happen , but with no explanation of what was causing them or why . I admit , I may have missed part of the film , but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else . I ca nt recommend this film at all .
0 ... let me count the ways.<br /><br />1 . A title - only ' remake ' that pulls out every cliché in the slasher handbook.<br /><br />2 . A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic.<br /><br />3 . A completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills.<br /><br />4 . A PG-13 rating that insures no gore , violence , or sex.<br /><br />5 . A villain that is not frightening or even mysterious.<br /><br />6 . A cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we could n't possibly care about them.<br /><br />7 . A lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere ( much unlike the original Prom Night).<br /><br />8 . A script of dialog that 's beyond poor - it 's mind numbing . < br /><br />9 . A series of cardboard performances ( not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that).<br /><br />10 . A completely inept teen - targeted slasher remake that 's not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination - or even to show a puddle of blood.<br /><br />It 's a no - brainer horror fans , save your money.<br /><br />BOMB out of * * * *
0 Prom Night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a Lifetime original film . You know the one . This October , Lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving ( insert disease name here ) to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex - boyfriend . It 's dramatic   it 's sappy   it 's immensely dull . It does nothing to further a genre , tell an original story , or strive for ANY sort of newness . Prom Night shares this plight . Watching the killer poke holes in his victims , we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled . It occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history.<br /><br />Our director is working with a fairly good - looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier . Think about Matthew McConaughey coming at you with a knife . You 'd probably go   " OH ! Good lookin guy is going to kill me ? Naaaa . " Not scary even for a second , so the director throws Schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror . This mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator . You 'll get 15 jump scares in this film , 2 of which made my date jump ( I might mention she is afraid of EVERYTHING ) . I 'd also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me.<br /><br />As if this film were not disjointed enough , it appears to be cut to shreds . I 'm not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film ; I 'm saying as the film moves from scene to scene , you often get a jarring jump . This is the kind of thing you 'd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together , cross his fingers , and hope for the best . The editor should be shot.<br /><br />With a plot you can pack into two sentences , one stray spray of blood , an emo killer , and the tension of a very special episode of " Silver Spoons " , we 're left with no reason to support horror this weekend   at least on the big screen . In fact , this is the sort of film that should be punished . Is it really that hard to make a scary movie ? Was this crew even aware they were making a horror film ? ? ! ! A complete waste of my time and yours . I bit the bullet to get you this review . Do n't let my sacrifice be in vain . DON'T GO INTO THE MOVIE ! ! !
0 Poor acting , no script , no plot , no convincing killer , no suspense , no original setups , it uses the same closet / under the bed / person - behind - you - in - the - mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring , and NOT in a foreshadowing way either , and the fact that NOBODY ever " really " gets killed ( at least not on screen ) , which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve MORE cheated for spending money on their admission ticket .... its a horror film w/o any horror LMAO . The MOST you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheet.<br /><br />You have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this , or you were high / drunk at the time.<br /><br />Honestly , I have a life and do n't bother writing reviews that often unless I really really hated something , or enjoyed it tremendously.<br /><br />But this film is AWFUL and I feel I have a duty of sorts to warn you NOT to give your money to Hollywood and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again ! < br /><br />It is one thing to rent a " bad " movie at blockbuster from the Weinsteins , its another when you have to sit through it in a theater.<br /><br />Also , in case you want some remake nostalgia , forget it ! This is NOT a remake , nor is it a re - imagining . It is not scary , nor engaging , nor is it satisfying enough to be " funny " like others on IMDb have claimed ... it is just stale and booooring.<br /><br />Here is what you will take away from this film : remembering the scar on Brittany Snow 's head that stands out more than the plot , the fact that Jonathan Schaech MUST be having some sexual affair with J.S. Cardone of " The Forsaken " to have gotten another role as a killer(because he is as frightening as my poodle , and too cute to kill just about anyone ) and that for some reason ( duh ) everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back . What kind of person would NOT get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow does n't show up ? This is my warning to you . DO NOT waste you 're money like I did . The " original " sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for Jamie Lee Curtis fans , though no way near as bad as this piece of crap ( sorry to sound vulgar or rude , but once you see this , you will understand why I say what I say ) .
0 Prom Night is about a girl named Donna ( Brittany Snow ) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night . And by doing so killing her family , friends , and her enemies . < br /><br />Now before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG-13 horror movies that have n't been scary lately . Are you tired of stupid girl dialog ' Oh my god ' and talking about girlish things . And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying . And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian , Japanese , and Chinese films . That pretty much sums up Prom night but I 'm still not done with the review.<br /><br />The only reason to see ' Prom night ' is to crack a laugh at the kills . If not , do n't see Prom night . You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall . And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7 . So not only are n't they scary but it 's obnoxious . By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl . Too much girl talk , too much guy talk , and lots of ' Oh my gosh . It 's our prom ' . I understand it 's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate . < br /><br />If I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films I 'd be the first one too . I 'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick . Seriously do n't spend your money or the time for dull acting , cheap scares , and a ' Night to die for ' when watching the film.<br /><br />1 star out of 10 . ( P.S. If I could give the film zero stars I would ) .
0 I am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself , but I just got back from this movie , and felt I had to express my opinions . Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan . But what makes a horror movie ? I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development . I know they often lack in horror movies , but Prom Night looked like it did n't even put forth ANY effort in that department . Next , we all love suspense . That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises . Yeah , Prom Night had none of that ! Of course , we like a terrifying killer . Prom Night have that ? Nope , it has a pretty boy with a cute lil ' knife . And when all else fails ... at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore , and the occasional nude scene ! Yeah , well when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 like Prom Night , they leave that stuff out too . So with all of these elements missing , I ask .... does this still count as a horror movie ? Nope . I 'd call it more of a comedy . People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw " Semi - Pro " that was supposed to actually be a comedy ( which also sucked , but that s another story ! ) . I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror . All the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money . The people I went to see it with did n't even know this was a remake ! Which made me mad ! I wonder what will happen when there 's no more movies to remake ? ? ? Where will horror go next ? ? ?
0 So , Prom Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie . I 'm a big wuss and was scared to see this movie at the beginning , but upon seeing it , it is neither horror or thriller.<br /><br />I was basically making fun of the movie in my seat because it was so predictable . You could predict what was going to happen next . The young actors were alright at playing their characters , but I 'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise.<br /><br />Yes , I 'll give props for the plot because it was good , but it 's not thrilling or scary . There were almost zero " jump - in - your - seat " scenes . So , do n't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres , wait ' til it comes to DVD .
0 When I first saw the trailer for Prom Night , I have to admit , the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie . So my friend and I saw Prom Night last night and I have to say I must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film , not to mention I am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people . There was no tension , the characters , how was I supposed to care about them ? They had no development what - so - ever , the killer ? ! Oh , my God , this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed , I know it 's a film , but why would a man who never(or at least we know of ) killed any one before , kill a girl 's family and friends that he 's just obsessed over ? I mean , was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her ? I have no idea , because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror.<br /><br />Donna 's family was just brutally murdered by her teacher , who has become very obsessed over her , he was captured and put in jail . It 's been 3 years and she 's just now getting some peace in her life , she 's even going to her senior prom . But the killer has escaped and still has Donna on his mind , he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends , and the hotel maid , and the bell boy , because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employee 's are . Donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un - noticed and can kill people so silently , just , wow.<br /><br />I'm sorry , I really did want to love this movie , we have n't had a good slasher flick in a long time , but this was just a stupid movie that I was not impressed with . Just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious . I know that this was a PG-13 movie , but I just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes ? Not to mention no stab holes ? I would n't recommend this movie for anyone unless you 're a teen , this movie was made for the teenagers , not adults , and not for those who know a real horror movie , no offense to those who did enjoy this film , but I do n't understand how anyone could.<br /><br />2/10
0 I saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real , who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that , my girl friend turned to me and said " we have to go see this movie" ... enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and I tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there were n't even any of those . It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall . I would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music , there was absolutely no character development.<br /><br />The plot is just ... well there was no plot it was basically I know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer , That 's brilliant ! hmmm The acting was what you expect in a Australian soap opera hopeless , that main character the Blondie god dam she annoyed me . her longest line must have been half a sentence , and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression.<br /><br />Please listen to me if you have any taste in movies do n't go see this , and if your like me and do n't have a choice well then I wish you good luck , maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine . Ca n't believe this film got made !
0 In Bridgeport , the deranged high school teacher Richard Fenton ( Johnathon Schaech ) is obsessed by the teenager student Donna Keppel ( Brittany Snow ) ; she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her , but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life . Three years later , the traumatized Donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills . On her prom night , she goes with her boyfriend Bobby ( Scott Porter ) and two couples of friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for the party . But the psychopath Richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing Donna , stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path.<br /><br />The forgettable slash " Prom Night " is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality . The stupid story is shallow and silly , with a bad acting of Johnathon Schaech in the role of an insane killer . The predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes . My vote is three.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " A Morte Convida Para Dançar " ( " The Death Invites to Dance " )
0 I 'm not particularly fond of remakes , or to steal the modern jargon " retellings " , but this film truly peeved me off . The original Prom Night , while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece , still realized what it was ... horror . There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film . Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience . Sorry folks , but a white knuckle film this was not ! The scares were cheap , and foreshadowed terribly . ( A good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now , is the cat jumping out of the closet , followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film ) This film could n't successfully pull that off , so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film . There needs to be a likable hero or heroine . This film does n't have one . The person I most identified with was the head detective . His calm demeanor , but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have . Common sense approach to events that occur . ( If you 're running from an Axe wielding psycho , you turn and sprint in the opposite direction . Not jog , whilst looking back ever three seconds , gaging the killer 's progress , only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path . ) If you friend disappears , you do n't go looking for them alone . And if you suspect foul play you tell someone , not investigate yourself . These clichés are tired and well overplayed . In the horror genre in general , and in this film in particular .
0 Imagine the scenario - you are at the movie theater only because you are in Washington for the weekend and it 's raining and you 're finished with the Museums . You think you might go see the Sarah Marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you do n't have to engage your brain . It 's sold out . Options ? - The Bank Job , In Bruges , The Leatherheads or Prom night . You 've seen the Bank Job ( suprisingly decent heist movie that ) and In Bruges ( again , pretty good ) so you 're down to two . You do n't fancy watching Clooney or the nice one from the Office run around in 1930 football uniforms , so you go see Prom Night right ? Wrong . You take the $ 8.50 , walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for $ 8.50 . It would be money better spent.<br /><br />It actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror / thriller or whatever it is supposed to be . If I was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut I would n't know whether to laugh or cry . Probably both . An insult to anyone 's intelligence ... my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie , as for the acting , they might as well have cast robots ( or maybe dogs ) in the roles , they would have been more realistic . The detective has to be possibly the worst actor I have ever seen ( Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan ( I hate his acting so much I do n't care how you spell his name ) you are relieved on your title(s ) ) < br /><br />So in summary ' not good '
0 and rent a GOOD horror movie . It 's like the writer had never seen a horror movie before and did n't realize every single thing he wrote was clichéd and hackneyed and has been parodied to perfection in movies like " Scream " and " Scary Movie".<br /><br />In between the scary bits is the most BANAL and BORING dialog ever written . Stupid " we 're going to the prom " junk . I wanted to claw my ears off . Honestly , " The Hills " has better dialog.<br /><br />There really was no need to make this movie . Leading lady is uninteresting and I kept thinking " Her ? Really ? Guy is obsessed with her ? Really ? " < br /><br />All the characters act in stupid ways , including the police . ( Cover the place in teams of 2 ! Front and back ! Not one sleepy cop sitting in his car with the window rolled down just waiting for his throat to be slashed . ) < br /><br />The serial killer just swans about murdering everyone he wants without the least bit of problem . No resistance from victims ( or doors ) . Nobody has any protection or the least idea of fighting back ( or flipping the security lock on the hotel room door ) . The people are like mentally disabled sheep.<br /><br />By the by , if you 're a gore fan , you 'll be disappointed too . All the killing is kept offscreen and is -- ahem -- tastefully done . ( So boo hoo for you ! ) < br /><br />None of the killings is the least bit interesting . Most of the time they 've already happened by the time we find out.<br /><br />The only cliché missing was the cat that always pops out in this kind of movies . " Oh kitty ! You scared me ! I thought you were the killer -- AIIEEEE ! " < br /><br />And then at the end when it 's time for the killer to die -- well , let 's just say it 's the easiest and most obvious choice . Snore.<br /><br />The audience was jeering and talking back to the screen throughout . It was too dumb to believe and not really scary enough . Do n't encourage this kind of lazy film - making.<br /><br />(Oh , and by the way -- no crowning of a prom king or queen . No tiara . No bucket of blood . ) < br /><br />So save your money and rent " Carrie " or " Friday the 13th " or " Halloween " or " Scream " or " Scary Movie " ( any of them ) to get a good scare with some original twists .
0 Okay . So I just got back . Before I start my review , let me tell you one thing : I wanted to like this movie . I know I 've been negative in the past , but I was hoping to be surprised and actually come out liking the film . I didn't.<br /><br />It 's not just the fact that every horror cliché imaginable is in this . And it 's not just the fact that they make every little thing into a jump scare ( walking into a baseball bat left on the floor ? Are you kidding me ? ) . It just was n't scary . One thing I was surprised about : there was more blood than I thought there was going to be .. which is n't saying much.<br /><br />The film starts off with Donna being dropped off by Lisa 's mom at her house . She comes in .. goes upstairs . Camera pans to her father dead on the couch . Spooky . She goes upstairs , where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens . Finds her brother on his bed , apparently dead ( how could she tell ? He did n't have a spot of blood on him ) . Killer comes in , Donna hides under bed , mom dies . She runs outside screaming for help . Killer behind her : " I did it for us . " Cut to therapy session . This confused a lot of people- everyone was asking whether or not her family actually died or if she imagined it- and she mentions how the nightmares have started coming back . Filler dialogue ensues.<br /><br />THey cut to the chase pretty quick . Few scenes at the salon , they go to the hotel . Of course the killer is already there ( for some reason , he escaped 3 days ago but the police / family were n't informed until he 's already there ) . More filler ensues.<br /><br />I'm not going to go on about what happens in the film , because I do n't want to spoil it too much . If you want to know who dies , Horror_Fan made a post about it already . But on the subjects of deaths : they were n't that exciting . People in the theatre actually laughed out loud ( an experience I 've never had before in a horror movie , not even in When A Stranger Calls ) during several of them . One in particular : the bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious ' scared ' face I 've ever seen . The only death involving any blood was Lisa 's , and that was pretty scarce . Her throat is slashed , blood ( if you can even call it that- it was practically black ) splatters on the curtain - thing . The only other blood was on Claire when we see her body . Apparently , Fenton decided to stab her a few times after he choked her to death . Um , okay ? The movie was one of the most clichéd I 've ever seen . Let 's see here .. obligatory close - mirror - curtain - BOOM ! scene . Check . Twice , actually ( you could tell they were struggling ) . Mandatory backing - up - into - killer . Check . There 's also the backing - up - into - lamp scene , but you 've all seen that . Oh , you say you want a birds - flying - away scare ? Well , you got it ! ( Yes , they managed to incorporate one of those in here ) . And , of course , the we - have - security - on - all - exits - but - he - still - escaped scene . Shall I go on ? I could.<br /><br />For anyone saying the characters were n't stupid , are you kidding me ? " Oh , even though the massive alarm is ringing , literally saying PLEASE VACATE THE BUILDING , and 3 of my friends are missing , I 'm going to go upstairs to get my wrap . " These characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever . The only likable character - Lisa - made one of the most stupid moves in the movie . " Oh , I just realized the psycho - teacher is here ! I must leave my strong boyfriend behind to run off by myself to warn her ! Oh , shoot , the elevator is being to slow ? Guess I 'll take the stairs and run off into the construction site ! " Ugh . By the end of the film , they all deserved to die . The only death anyone felt any remorse for was Donna 's boyfriend ( I ca n't even remember his name- is that bad ? ) , and by that time , the audience was completely drained out of this scareless , clichéd film.<br /><br />There were SOME positives- the acting was decent for the most part , and it was well - shot . But that 's about it.<br /><br />I'd give it a 1/5 , and that 's being generous . Just for the laughs ( and believe me , the audience had a few ) , and Brittany Snow.<br /><br />Oh , and the reaction was bad . Very bad . People were boo - ing after the movie ended and buzz afterwards was very negative . Expect bad legs for this one .
0 Good grief I ca n't even begin to describe how poor this film is . Do n't get me wrong , I was n't expecting much to begin with . Let 's face it , a PG-13 slasher flick is pre - destined to be missing the ummm ... slashing , so no one should be surprised by the lack of gore . But it was the level of incompetence and cliché on display in all the other aspects of this movie is what really blew me away . < br /><br />We have a protagonist who is quite simply so completely useless that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy . And here 's a turnup for the books ... SHE NEVER CHANGES - hence breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing - character development . If you think by the end of this film the poor little girl is going to turn around and finally kick some arse then think again . < br /><br />On top of this , we 're handed possibly the least intriguing ( and definitely the least scary ) killer ever to grace the genre . I 'm not joking when I say that Dora the Explorer has scarier villains than this movie.<br /><br />Finally , because all the potential for tension or gratuity is removed by the inept ( and apparently thirteen - year - old ) director , what could possibly be left to fill up 2 hours of screen time ? < br /><br />Closets , that 's what . < br /><br />Lots and lots of closets : big closets , small closets , mirrored closets , closets to Narnia , so many damned closets you 'll not want to dress yourself for another year . In fact this movie should have just been called " CLOSET " , and had a picture of a big scary coathanger on the DVD case . On the back it could have had a photograph of the audience falling asleep and a quote by Roger and Ebert - something to the extent of : " what the f*@ ! did we just waste our time watching ! "
0 This movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood . The fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business . The idea that audiences paid to see this movie ( and like an idiot I rented the film ) is discouraging also.<br /><br />Obsessed teacher ( 3 years prior ) kills teenager 's family because he wants her . For no reason he kills the mother , father and brother . From the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction . Years later , obsessed teacher breaks out of prison . HMM -- usual bad writing -- no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute . Obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a Navy SEAL and can sneak around , sniff out people and with a knife is super killer . Sure ! ! ! Now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason , knifes bellhop for the fun of it , and starts to hunt down the teenager 's friends . Now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you . Obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel --- again it is stupid , ever cop would know his face -- but he walks right by them . Now he kills two cops outside teenager 's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend.<br /><br />There is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage . If any other profession put out work of this low quality , they would be fired . Yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash .
0 I wish I could give this movie a zero out of ten . Before going to this movie the day after it came out , I came on IMDb to check out the comments . A comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog . I never go by other people 's opinions , so I wasted seven dollars for this crap movie . It had to be one of the WORST movies I 've ever seen.<br /><br />The person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff . Since when do scary movies have sappy scenes ? I swear , I 'm amazed there were n't any GROUP HUG ^-^ moments.<br /><br />I think I jumped . Once . And that 's because I zoned out , thinking about my research paper for English . The clichéd , birds / cat popping out of nowhere thing when you THOUGHT something was gon na happen.<br /><br />And the characters were STUPID . My friend and I almost DIED laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said , " I have to get my mom 's shawl ! ! ! " You . Idiot . Screw the shawl ! Safety is just a few steps away , but NO , my mom 's shawl ( that did n't match the dress By the way ) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety . And to top it all off , they take her BACK to her house , knowing that the killer knew where she lived . God.<br /><br />My friend and I also predicted the ENTIRE movie . And not just the , I bet he 's hiding under the bed , moments . It was the , " HE stole the bellhop 's clothes and sneaked out of the hotel " and " It 's the detective coming down the hallway , not the killer ! " moments . Movies should NEVER be THIS predictable . Disney movies are n't even this predictable.<br /><br />I'm gon na complete my rant now by saying , this was a terrible movie . I 'm glad I went to see it in theaters so I would n't buy it for $ 15.00 and then hate it . It was just bad . It would 've been better if only one thing would 've happened . If , after being shot by the detective , the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in . Knife in hand , falling and stabbing the girl on his way down . Oh , how lovely that would 've been.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money . Go see a GOOD movie .
0 PROM NIGHT ( 2008)<br /><br />directed by : Nelson McCormick < br /><br />starring : Brittany Snow , Scott Porter , Jessica Stroup , and Dana Davis < br /><br />plot : Three years ago , Donna ( Brittany Snow ) witnessed the death of her entire family at the hands of her teacher ( Jonathan Schaech ) who has a bit of a crush on her . Now , she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends . Once there , they start dying one by one because the killer escaped from prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because apparently her prom is too important to interrupt . < br /><br />pros : I got a few good laughs out of the film due to the terrible dialog and the dumb character moves.<br /><br />An example:<br /><br />Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is oddly obsessed with her ( she does n't seem that great ) has escaped from prison . Their reason : They do n't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends . LOL < br /><br />cons : Let me start off by saying I 'm a huge slasher fan . Usually I can have fun with even the bad ones . I even like some PG-13 horror films . TOURIST TRAP ( 1979 ) , one of my favorites , was originally rated PG . I also enjoy POLTERGEIST ( 1982 ) and THE GRUDGE ( 2004 ) . So the fact that this is a dumb slasher film that is rated PG-13 does not have anything to do with me not enjoying the movie.<br /><br />First of all , I had a big problem with the story . I like slasher films that do n't even have stories . At least they can be entertaining . This is about a teacher who falls in love with his student , so he kills her entire family . A few years later , he tries to make it up to her by ruining her prom and killing all of her friends ... ? Then there were subplots that I doubt anyone cared about . Claire ( Jessica Stroup ) is fighting with her boyfriend , she has cramps , and I could n't care less . This should have been a Lifetime feature , not a remake of PROM NIGHT . < br /><br />And then ... this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes . I do n't even care that it 's not that gory , some of my favorite slashers ( HALLOWEEN , CURTAINS , the original PROM NIGHT ) were not that gory but they still had effective murders . Here , we have half the characters dying in the same hotel room off screen , a woman being stabbed several times with no stab wounds , and a closeup on a bad actor 's face as he screams in agony . I 'm sure that 10 year - old girls were terrified , but not me.<br /><br />I also hated the characters . There was Donna 's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend Bobby ( Scott Porter ) and I can almost guarantee you will never meet a boyfriend that sensitive in your life , unless you are a gay male . Then we had Donna 's annoying friends Claire ( Stroup ) and Lisa ( Dana Davis ) , and the token mean girl Chrissy ( Brianne Davis ) . If you thought the characters in DEATH PROOF were annoying , try watching this movie . And do n't get me started on Ronnie ( Collins Pennie ) and the DJ ( Jay Phillips ) who gave me flashbacks to Usher 's performance in SHE 'S ALL THAT.<br /><br />Add to all that predictable plot turns , a terrible soundtrack and a big lack of respect to the original material , and you have quite a stinker .
0 Note : I could n't force myself to actually write up a constructive review of Prom Night . It just ca n't be done . Instead , I went through what I thought about while watching the movie.<br /><br />Things that I thought about while watching Prom Night : < br /><br />-I'm so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place , only for the main character to wake up right before she bites it . Of course , when I say " elaborate deaths " , I mean off screen throat slashes or stabs in the stomach . Did n't the whole " it 's just a dream " thing get ruined by Dallas ? Speaking of which , I wonder if a couple stabs in the gut will cause immediate death.<br /><br />-The film is only ten minutes into and I can already count the horror clichés on two hands . Not a good sign.<br /><br />-Even after just meeting the protagonist 's boyfriend , I 'm convinced he will die . Anybody want to place bets ? < br /><br />-The killer in this movie is a teacher that is obsessed with the main character , Donna . ( By the way , does anybody think that " Donna " is a horrible name for a main character in a horror film ? ) He spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds Donna celebrating her high school prom . While there is no accounting for taste , I seriously wonder who would take all that time to stalk somebody as dull as Donna.<br /><br />-High schools allow proms to take place at hotels and does n't keep track of the students . Apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please . I suppose if this plot point was n't in place , the movie would be 90 minutes of people being bored out of their mind and randomly biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom . I suppose the trade - off for their excitement is my utter boredom with everything . I 've already played " count the pieces of chewed bubble gum under the seat " and " guess how much money I have in my wallet " and I 'm only in the 20 minute mark . How else will I entertain myself ? < br /><br />-Note to self : Do n't forget milk and bread on the way home.<br /><br />-Dear screenwriter : You 've used up enough false scares to get through this movie and every other horror remake this year.<br /><br />-The 1980 version of this film was n't that good but compared to this remake it was like Citizen Kane , or at least The Godfather . It had Jamie Lee Curtis in one of her many post - Halloween horror flicks and it did have a little " twist " at the end . I miss Jamie Lee . I wish she 'd act more.<br /><br />-Apparently at prom there is n't much dancing going on . Instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college . I hear all these colleges being brought up by name , and I ca n't help but wonder who these girls have to cheat off of on the entrance exam to get in.<br /><br />-The killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and wipes up his mess between scenes . That 's the only logical explanation for why he could stab somebody to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time somebody goes up to the hotel room , there is no trace of a struggle . ( On another side note : This is a very lazy killer . Michael Myers went hunting after his victims . Just saying.)<br /><br />-It 's official : the entire audience in the theater is rooting on the killer . What triggered it ? Was it whenever Donna went back up to her hotel room while sirens were going off ordering everybody to exit the building ? Was it her constant dreams , and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on reenacting her steps to a tee ? Or was it Brittany Snow 's unconvincing performance ? I 'll have to say it was all of the above.<br /><br />-Okay , who had " he dies off screen in the third act " ? You win the pot.<br /><br />-Finally , the movie is over . My friend turns to me and says " Donna was n't too smart . " That 's the understatement of the week . Kind of like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind , or a week long power outage is a slight inconvenience.<br /><br />-I ca n't wait to get on Rotten Tomatoes and see if anybody gave this move a favoring review.<br /><br />-I ca n't recommend this . I refuse to recommend this . This is as lazy of a horror film as any , and the only way to enjoy its cheese smelling plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers . And unfortunately for theater patrons , alcohol is n't served.<br /><br />Rating : * out of * * * *
0 I went into this with my hopes up , by twenty minutes into the movie I could n't have been more let down . Despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake , I kept my hopes high that maybe ... just maybe someone would get it right this time around . Sadly , Prom Night is about on the same quality level as the recent April Fools Day remake , bad script , bad direction , cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror.<br /><br />From beginning to end it 's boring , repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls . We 've seen it all before and we 've seen it done a million times better then this . If you go to see Prom Night in the theater ( I 'd say wait for the DVD or PPV ) , get ready for the audience to laugh , because laugh they will . The laughs are n't at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny , they are in response to key " thrilling " moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of Scary Movie . Seriously , was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof ? The film makers missed the mark so badly here , that a large number of the audience in the theater I attended walked out about halfway through the movie . Which in retrospect , I wish I had done . Not me though , I had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better . Needless to say It did n't . The " horror " scenes are a joke , not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction , the script , the " special effects " and the camera work . The movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it , but still came out of it with a micro budget movie . I halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking I would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere . < br /><br />This movies scary alright , if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed .
0 " Prom Night " is a title - only remake of the 1980 slasher flick that starred Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen . This movie takes place in an Oregon town , where Donna ( Brittany Snow ) is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years . She and her friends arrive at the prom , which is taking place in a grand hotel , and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives . Little does anyone know , a man from Donna 's past , who has haunted her for years , is also at the prom ... and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of her.<br /><br />I'm a fan of the original " Prom Night " , so I tried to maintain a little hope in this movie , but I have to admit I was quite disappointed . " Prom Night " suffers from the worst affliction a horror movie could have , and that is predictability . There are absolutely no surprises here , and I felt I had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times , often better , before . What does this equate to for the audience ? Boredom . Unless of course you have never seen any horror movies , or are part of the pre - teen crowd , but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen . The plot is simplistic , but the entire script is void of any type of surprise , twist , atmosphere , or anything , and this really , really hurts the movie because it never really gives the audience anything to sink their teeth into . It all just seemed very bland.<br /><br />A lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a PG-13 slasher movie as well , and I understand what they are saying , but I do n't think it 's impossible to make a good slasher movie with minimal gore . Take Carpenter 's " Halloween " for example - little to no on screen violence , but still an extremely frightening and effective movie . You do n't need gore to make a film scary , but even had " Prom Night " been gratuitously violent ( which it is not , it is very tame ) , it still would have added little to the movie because there is not much in the script to build on to begin with . The tension and suspense here is mild at best , and I spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations , and was correct about 99 % of the time . Our characters are n't well written enough either for the audience to make any connection to them , and their by - the - numbers demises are routine and careless.<br /><br />I will point out a few things I did like about this movie , though , because it was n't completely useless - the cinematography is really nice , and everything was very well - filmed and fairly stylish . Among the " jump " scares ( that are for the most part very predictable ) , there were a few that were kind of clever . The sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold , however predictable the unfolding may be . As for the acting , it 's mediocre at best . Brittany Snow plays the lead decently , but really the rest of the cast does n't show off much talent . Johnathan Schaech plays the villain , and is probably the most experienced performer here , but even he is n't that impressive . However , I did like the character he played , which was a nice change from the typical ' masked - stalker ' type killer we see a lot . As far as the ending goes , the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my wit 's end and it was very anti - climactic.<br /><br />Overall , " Prom Night " was a disappointment . Everything was very by - the - numbers , routine , and predictable , which is somewhat upsetting considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie . There were a few neat moments , but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere , and had little plot development , nor believable characters . I 'd advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till it 's out on video , or rent the original instead , because there are absolutely no surprises here . Some may find a little entertainment in it , but it was far too predictable for my tastes . I expected better , and left the theater very disappointed . 3/10 .
0 If I could give this film a real rating , it would likely be in the minus numbers . While I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these terrible " horror " films , seriously , people , buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money you could be spending on something far more worth your time.<br /><br />Despite it being a horror film , there is nothing scary about it , unless the idea of seeing how many horror cliché 's you can fit in one movie scares you . If the rating had been higher , it probably would have made for a better film in the long run.<br /><br />Whoever made this version of " Prom Night " , you screwed up . The actors could probably have done a decent job if it were n't for the questionable scripting . This was a terrible waste of a cinema trip . I 'd sooner go and see " One Missed Call " again , at least that had some plot .
0 I think it was an overrated PG-13 crap ! At least BRITTANY SNOW 's performance was good and some others like IDRIS ELBA were good too , but some others teens in the prom like the leads friends were not that convincing . The killer was so dumb and looked so stupid too . The deaths were stupid , boring and completely unoriginals . The movie was very boring too and very overrated . It was n't suspenseful at all , i almost fall asleep . Its another bad PG-13 remake , its really a dreadful movie IMO . The ending was so stupid and the climax was very rushed and boring . The movie is pretty slow too . Overall the only good thing about this crap fest is maybe BRITTANY SNOW i think she gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA too , but besides that it was a completely dreadful movie and horrible remake . Well that s just my opinion . i gave it a 2/10 .
0 I saw this movie a few days ago and gamely jumped during the scary parts . I must admit , I found it pretty decent ... until I started to THINK about what the characters were saying . Logical problems:<br /><br />1 . Her boyfriend , who seems to be a pretty fit dude , makes no sound while being killed . Do n't you think that he might have at least tried to take the killer ? < br /><br />2 . When the remark is made that the gym teacher is " SOOOO in love with Lisa , " I almost screamed at the screen . When your best friend 's family HAS BEEN KILLED BY A TEACHER WHO WAS IN LOVE WITH HER , you do n't make comments like that if you have half of a heart.<br /><br />3 . As soon as Nash asks the uncle how many exits they have in the house and the uncle catches on that there may be danger ahead , would n't the smart thing to do be to get Donna , boyfriend , aunt , and uncle into a car and drive far , far away , then bait the house with the HRT and police force so that the killer has no way to get out?<br /><br />I could go on . And on . And on . Basically , the plot was decent , the characters were n't profiled enough for you to actually feel any empathy when they were slaughtered and there were way too many errors.<br /><br />HOWEVER.<br /><br />This movie might be good for teenagers , or young couples just looking for a fun night out . If you do n't consider all the goofs , it 's a mediocre film .
0 Why Hollywood feels the need to remake movies that were so brilliant their prime ( The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , The Hills Have Eyes ) but is it considerably worse why Hollywood feels the need to remake those horror films that were n't brilliant to start with ( Prom Night , The Amityville Horror ) Much like their originals these remakes fail in creating atmosphere , character or any genuine scares at all . Prom night is so flat and uninteresting its hard to watch , but for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />It 's a poorly acted , massively uninteresting and ultimately dull excursion that fails at everything its designed to do . It 's clear Hollywood Horror is dead . Even The likes of The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent plot . Prom night is virtually bloodless and I 'm not even going to mention how bad the plot is . Its inability to seal the killers identify makes this the least suspenseful horror movie since erm ... the original.<br /><br />One of the most notorious slasher films of the 1980s returns to terrorize filmgoers with this remake that proves just how horrifying high school dances can truly be . Donna Keppel ( Brittany Snow ) has survived a terrible tragedy , but now the time has come to leave the past behind and celebrate her senior prom in style.<br /><br />When the big night finally arrives , Donna and her best friends prepare to enjoy their last big high - school blowout by living it up and partying till dawn . But while Donna is willing to look past her nightmares and into a brighter future , the man she thought she had escaped forever has returned for one last dance . An obsessed killer is on the loose , and he 'll slay anyone who attempts to prevent him from reaching his one and only Donna.<br /><br />Who will survive to see graduation day , and what will Donna do when she 's forced to confront her greatest fear ? Scott Porter , Jessica Stroup , and Dana Davis co - star in the slasher remake that will have tuxedo - clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they file out onto the dance floor . A plot that will probably put you off going to see this . Witch if you ask me is a good thing.<br /><br />Without much to work with , McCormick gamely tries to milk tension out of the most banal of situations . At one point , a girl backs into a floor lamp ( a lamp ! ) and McCormick tries to pump it up into a jump - scare moment . Desperate times really do call for desperate measures . There have n't been this many shots of closets since the last IKEA catalogue.<br /><br />In the era of The Hills , My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator , there probably is a freaky , scary movie to be mined from the commoditisation of glamour and society 's creepy obsession with youthful beauty . This is not that movie.<br /><br />My final verdict ? Avoid at all cost . Nobody will like Prom Night , it 's even a disappointment to thoses who usually enjoy hack - job remakes . Considering its absolute lack of blood or frights . A night you 'll be in a hurry to forget .
0 OK this movie was made for one reason and one reason only TO MAKE MONEY!!The producers obviously did n't care about killing a classic horror movie . I knew this movie would suck as soon as it was going to be a pg-13 how many pg-13 slashers movies have turned out to be good ? That s like asking how many women have been on the moon ? The answer is NONE ! ! Prom night 1980 was of cource no masterpiece but it certainly deserves to be recognised as a movie that stays true to its genre and deosnt try to be anything more than that.<br /><br />My problem with Prom night 2008 is the way that it handles the killer and i have 3 major problems with him ..................... <br /><br />1)The way he escapes , he was locked up in a mental institute and he escapes through a air conditioning vent ! ! WHAT THE HELL ? why would they have an air conditioning vent in the patients room ? Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something ? 2)His intentions are somewhat uncertain the killer want all of the main victims family and friends dead so he can have her all to his self , he says he loves her but the next minute he trys to kill her , so does he want to kill her , love her or just plain rape her ? ? 3 ) The killer is too good , how did he develop all of his skills ? He used to be a teacher , so in this one scene where he kills the main victims boyfriend while he s basically on top of her asleep and she does n't notice , it all silly 2 stars out of 10 terrible , silly , stupid attempt at a horror movie
0 The night of the prom : the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic . And so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head - peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives.<br /><br />There really is no excuse for Prom Night . There is less than nothing original about it and I truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on IMDb . The only part of my viewing that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of ' ghosts ' . It was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them.<br /><br />The plot was basically some guy going on a rampage . And the thing was , it was n't even a slightly exciting rampage . Maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame Robbie Williams lookalike with a baseball cap , I might have sat there feeling slightly anxious . The fact that I cared less about the characters than I did about the colour of the cinema carpet did n't really add to the effect , either . And to make matters worse , the rest of the characters were equally one - dimensional and oblivious . The hotel staff did n't seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave . I was incredibly surprised that the bitchy , stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was . She realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs , entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets . Nice one.<br /><br />The worst thing was , I hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest . He really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening . Shocking ! And the music , do n't even get me started . It was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral.<br /><br />I really wish that Prom Night was a joke . It was terrible and stupidly predictable . No one , in their right mind or otherwise , has any reason to see this film . Mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation . If you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film , hear my plea . Do n't do it . There are better things to spend six pounds on . Like a sheet to play ghosts with .
0 The acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay . It was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes . The ending was even worse . Everyone kept dying , but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly OK ! They did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had , etc . The movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline . The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I kind of feel bad for the young actors . They needed better coaching . They could have really made this an OK film , but the screenplay and acting failed miserably .
0 i saw this film by accident and this movie was an accident ... well it must of been . blonde women being stalked , the villain appearing then disappearing getting from one place to another in minute 's then disappearing and reappearing , hiding.he was'nt even a super hero so i do n't know how he did it.he could'nt frighten a cat and that 's not hard to do.<br /><br />the old " mirror in the bathroom"is just not scary anymore in fact it stopped being scary years ago . you had the cop on the trail of the villain , another cliché(played by idris elba with a very convincing American accent , he 's from London ) the director did'nt have a clue and has made a film full of cliché 's and make 's " scary move"which was a COMEDY look scary . pathetic !
0 When I first saw the preview for this movie , I really could n't wait to see it . The plot seemed good and the setting was great . I mean , a slasher movie that takes place on prom night , great idea ! ! And the plot : A High School teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students , goes crazy , gets arrested , and escapes three years later on prom night ! Prom night , a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable , turns into hell ! ! However , I saw it and was extremely disappointed . It was not only the worst " horror movie " I have ever seen , but it was one of the worst movie in general that I have ever seen ! ! First of all , it was n't even scary . There was not one moment in that movie when I jumped out of my seat . Also , the murder scenes were so cheesy and dull . All the slasher did was either stab his victims in the stomach multiple times or cut their throats . Also there was absolutely no gore ( its rated PG-13 ) . The scene with the most blood was probably the one where the killer murders the black girl . He slits her throat and blood splatters on the sheets hanging around them ( they do n't actually show him cutting her throat).<br /><br />Next , you see the killers face the first time he is introduced in the movie . He is n't mysterious , creepy , or scary . He 's just this guy who kills people.<br /><br />Also , everything in the movie was so cliché . An example is when , at the end , the killer is about to kill the main character and at the last moment , the detective shoots and kills him . Also , every single thing in this movie was so predictable . The victim , after seeing the guy with a knife , runs for her life , hides , thinks she gets away , and then the killer just pops out and kills her.<br /><br />Finally , the sequence of the movie was extremely bad . The guy goes into the hotel , kills a few people , the bodies are discovered , someone pulls the fire alarm , and everyone evacuates . The main character forgets something in her room , has an encounter with the killer , runs and escapes . That s it ! She and her boyfriend go home , the slasher kills the guards patrolling the house , finds the girl , then gets killed by the detective . The movie sequence was so stupid and cliché.<br /><br />If your thinking of seeing this movie all because the preview looked good , trust me , do n't waste your time or money . No wonder this movie was being shown in the smallest theater in the movie theater . My friend and I , along with these two girls sitting in the back , were the only ones in the theater . That should have told me something about the movie beforehand .
0 We have all been asking ourselves " why do n't they remake the slasher films that were only OK instead of remaking the ones that were great already , that way they can only make it better ? " well with Prom Night they have remade the average but trashy fun 80s Jamie Lee Curtis film and made it even WORSE . Its a paint by numbers slasher film which is clearly trying to attract the young teens ( hence no violence etc ) , the knife in this slasher flick is blunt . The director spends so much time focusing on trying to make the rather attractive killer look somewhat creepy that anything else goes out of the window . The cast who include Britney Snow ( who was superb in Hairspray ) try their hardest but the material gives them nothing to do but pout and look scared . More annoying is how the death scenes are handled ( we will hear the attack but wo nt see it ) . It also looks like the only place the knife in this film worked was in the editing suite since the film looks like it has been butchered ( i m guessing anything remotely scary ended up on the cutting room floor so as not to scare the kids ) Yet in pours the money from Americans sending this film to number 1 at the box office ! ! ! Slasher movies are a lot of fun but in Prom Nights case it made me want to download the original . I've seen scarier OC and Dawsons Creek episodes
0 I 'm a big fan of the TV series Largo Winch . This movie was pain for me . I had to use fast forward not to fell to sleep . It was boring ! How can somebody ruin this title so much ? The story was the only good thing . Actors were sh.t . They ca n't live the role . The main actor(Tom ... ) is a null . Watch the other roles of this actor . The fighting scenes were unbelievable boring and not to followable , somehow they were not to follow the situation . Like other reviewer said low budget film with bad actors . Maybe next time somebody else can do better thing out of this title . French ca n't do right thing with big films , like Alien 4 . That was bit brrr , after Alien 1,2,3 .
0 First of all , if you'r a fan of the comic , well , you 'll be VERY disappointed I 'm sure ! Low budget movie ! ! ! Largo is supposed to be Serbian in the comic , now suddenly he becomes croatian , pfff ! chicken producers , it gave some spice and guts to the comic ( By the way , in the film , his father speaks Serbian and he speaks croatian ... Lol ) . The striking N.Y. Winch building becomes a common average - small yacht in H.K. The good looking Largo becomes some unshaved Tzigan / Turkish looking guy . Freddy the cool ' scarface ' pilot becomes some fat , out of shape , sad , average guy . Simon , Largo 's good buddy , does not exist at all ! ? He gave some pepper ! Largo does n't throw knifes at all , but just some snake stares ... The whole story is confused and looks like a pretentious TV - film . French directors and producers , if you do n't have the money , the ability or the technology to adapt correctly the comic , please stick to some romance shooted in Paris . Very very bad film , good thing I just rented it , do n't count on me to watch the sequel ( If there is any ! ) .
0 In my knowledge , Largo winch was a famous Belgium comics ( never read ) telling the adventures of a playboy , a sort of James Bond without the spy life ! So , when I had to choose a movie for a 5 years - old kid , I picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of James Bond!<br /><br />But , just after the opening credits , I got heavy doubts : when American movies offer amazing start , here , no action and a torrid sex scene   Then , the story get very complicated with financial moves   I thought I lost the kid.<br /><br />But , strangely , he had been caught by Largo , and more than James Bond ! < br /><br />Was it the excellent interpretation of Tomer Sisley ? The difficult relationship Largo has with his father ? The multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys , the bad guys are the friends ? The exotic locations of Honk - Kong , Yougoslavia ? < br /><br />Dunno , but he really cares about Largo ( " Will he get up ? ) and we enjoyed our moment .
0 Chilly , alienating adaptation of Rebecca West 's book about an Army Captain returning from duty in WWII with his memory impaired ( now there 's an original idea ! ) . It seems he remembers old flame Glenda Jackson but not current wife Julie Christie , which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks . This extremely well - cast soaper brings together leading man Alan Bates with director Alan Bridges and co - stars Jackson , Christie , Ann - Margret , and Ian Holm , but the burners are all on low . There are a handful of good scenes ( particularly whenever Jackson is on - screen ) , but Bridges ' pacing is unrelievedly sluggish and the film 's dulled - out color is enervating . Long on the shelf , this " Soldier " is best left forgotten . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 but " Cinderella " gets my vote , not only for the worst of Disney 's princess movies , but for the worst movie the company made during Walt 's lifetime . The music is genuinely pretty , and the story deserves to be called " classic . " What fails in this movie are the characters , particularly the title character , who could only be called " the heroine " in the loosest sense of the term.<br /><br />After a brief prologue , the audience is introduced to Cinderella . She is waking up in the morning and singing " A Dream is A wish Your Heart Makes . " This establishes her as an idealist ( and thus deserving of our sympathy ) . Unfortunately , the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about . Freedom from her servant role ? The respect of her step - family ? Someone to talk to besides mice and birds ? In one song ( cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest DVD ) Cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently . You go girlfriend ! In short , Cinderella is a very bland character . She passively accepts her step - family 's abuse , escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief . She only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family . For this , she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear , a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except , of course , Cinderella . Can anyone see Belle or Jasmine being such a doormat ? If Cinderella is dull , her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless . The Prince in Cinderella gets no dialog and almost no screen time . We are given no indication if he is a good man , if he respects Cinderella or anything . All we know is 1 ) he is a prince and 2 ) he dances well . Heck , even the prince from " Snow White " got to sing a romantic song at least . Not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting , it makes Cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot , weakening her already tenuous appeal.<br /><br />Perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were , the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movie 's comic relief , Cinderella 's friends , the mice . Granted , these characters are amusing . Even so , when the comic relief steals the show from the principals , well , let 's just say your story has some problems.<br /><br />Dinsey loves to proclaim all its animated features as " masterpieces . " While many of them are , there are some that do not deserve this appellate in any way . Cinderella is a prime example of this fact .
0 Just saw it yesterday in the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival . Just before going I came here to see how it was rated , and at that time it was 7.4 , a pretty nice rate ... <br /><br />After 15 minutes I was dying to get out ( never did this ) , but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screening.<br /><br />I did not like at all , the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere , the characters are shallower than the dialogs , nothing lead anywhere , and the worst and worst : plenty of Siemens and Organics advertising on the movie . Despite the fact that I already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself , I still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and Siemens mobile popping - up all the time on her lap - top ; or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have Organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen ! All of this would be bearable if the plot , characters , romances , anything was good , but was bad , really bad ! A " do n't know how to do " sex - in - the - city.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money .
0 When I bought this DVD I though : " It seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in Portuguese standards   let 's give it a chance  " I was TOTALLY WRONG ! What a disappointing movie ! First , it 's not a comedy ; it 's a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it 's even worse than many Portuguese soap operas ! Second , the plot is so boring , and leads nowhere   It has no structure , it just flows , like the wind , in one or another direction   The production is also bad ! The sound mixing is horrible , because sometimes the voices are disconnected . It made me remind some old Portuguese movies from the 80 's   The acting should have been better too   Well , to sum up , it 's not with films like this one that Portuguese cinema will improve ! In fact , it was one of the worst Portuguese movies I have seen in the last years ! Bad argument , bad acting , bad production   I had no high hopes for this movie , but it was much worse than I 've ever imagined ! Just forget about it !
0 ( I 'll indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin . ) My dissatisfaction is split : 30 % tone - deafness , 70 % lackluster writing.<br /><br />The 30 % : I agree with the first commenter 's synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories . I was surprised how , this film , at best , woefully shortchanges the real NYC by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if it 's inhabited only by the cast of Gossip Girl ( this is coming from someone who likes Gossip Girl ) . A few minority characters are written into the stories , but they are included by obligation , while we can see the gears under the film so clearly , striving to " be diverse " but falling ever - so - short.<br /><br />The 70 % is why everything falls short . All characters , white plus a few token minorities , are one - dimensional , cardboard cutouts of people concepts . Worse , their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what I 'd say is a " gag " : we get a basic conceit , then some punchline intended to be a clever twist . But even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say , " Okay , that was a surprise" ... the stories are still not that interesting , because they , too , are shallow . When you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending , you 're writing jokes.<br /><br />Spoilers below ... <br /><br />The movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories . That 's fine . But romance is amazing , deep , sometimes complex . These " romantic " stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other . Words exchange , thoughts are projected through voice - over , but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another.<br /><br />Meaning , there is no seduction ( in the broad sense ) , no tension , and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the Other . The only story involving a superficial " seduction " is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy ( Ethan Hawke ) gets outwitted by the girl he 's hitting on , who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker . Sure , his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as we 'd be if we were next to them , but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of " A then B " . So it unfolds , if something like a postcard could " unfold " , with all the other tales as well : A then B -- That 's It , the only point being that these happen to occur " on set " in Manhattan . By the way , the only Brooklyn we see is the Coney Island sketch ; the only Queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the West Village.<br /><br />It 's easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race , gender , sexual orientation , and so on . _ New York , I Love You _ , however , deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title . We expect to see the real New York , and real New Yorkers , but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic , its characters flown in from The O.C. , plus a few others to make it SEEM as if we are paying attention to diversity . But when we look closer at who those characters are , the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to represent.<br /><br />For example , the story with the Latino man with the little white girl in the park , who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny ( male nanny ) when in fact he 's the father . Notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramatic - construction point of view ( it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriend / stepfather are strutting the girl away ) , it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girl 's father is Latino ALSO must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer . What , the dad ca n't be just some guy from South America ? Now that he 's obviously hot , is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middle - to - upper - class white woman ? Are we that naive as to require such ? As if a Mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatable.<br /><br />It 's not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone . But in every conceivable set - up and plot twist , the direction taken screams status quo , appeals to safety . All these stories could have been made more interesting , even if we were forced to keep the single - dimensionality of the characters inhabiting them , at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes . Asian girl living in Chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy ? How 'bout an Asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead . Again , I 'm not saying the entire conceit has to be changed . It 's just that every . damn . story premise . is so hackneyed -- and thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love New York , outside the trite . The real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading.<br /><br />I will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack , the good pacing of the movie ( even if what was being paced was , well , dredge ) , and the general feel of many of the scenes . The movie was just fine to sit through , and I would n't dissuade anyone from doing so . However , it is telling that the most significant homage paid to non - superficiality is when the old opera singer says ( paraphrased ) " That 's what I love about New York : everyone 's from a different place . " Well , you would n't know it from watching this one .
0 Having loved ' Paris , Je T'aime ' , I highly anticipated this film and I admit I went in with high expectations , but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons.<br /><br />Although , I was not expecting a re - make of ' Paris ' in New York I was expecting the same structure . What I liked about ' Paris ' was the breakup of the neighborhoods . You got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell . In ' NY ' , there is no clear separation of the stories , at different points in the film , characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who I was watching and what exactly was going on . Also , the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow.<br /><br />Another thing I loved about the ' Paris ' film was the different takes on love . It was n't all romantic . There was love between parents and their children , unrequited love , a lonely , middle - aged woman yearning for love etc . , it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans . ' NY ' seemed to only go for an edgy , over - the - top sexuality . There were some redeemable shorts ( the older couple having spent a lifetime together , Julie Christie 's short ) , but overall the'NY ' film did n't evoke any emotion for me . I did n't connect with any of the characters like I did with ' Paris ' . I remember watching ' Paris ' and feeling a deep sadness , loneliness , yearning , hopefulness , wonder ... it just had so much soul . For me , there was no soul in the ' NY ' film.<br /><br />Maybe if I had gone into it without having ' Paris ' looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response , but as a self - titled re - take of ' Paris , Je T'aime ' I was sorely disappointed .
0 I saw this regurgitated pile of vignettes tonight at a preview screening and I was straight up blown away by how bad it was . < br /><br />First off , the film practically flaunted its gaping blind spots . There are no black or gay New Yorkers in love ? Or who , say , know the self - involved white people in love ? I know it 's not the love Crash of anvil - tastic inclusiveness but you ca n't pretend to have a cinematic New York with out these fairly prevalent members of society . Plus , you know the people who produced this ish thought Crash deserved that ham - handed Oscar , so where is everyone ? < br /><br />Possibly worse than the bizarre and willful socioeconomic ignorance were the down right offensive chapters ( remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in wheelchairs ? Me either ) . This movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst . Bad acting , bad writing , bad directing -- all spanning every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside fancy restaurants . < br /><br />But thank god they finally got powerhouses Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson back together for that Jumper reunion . And , side note , Uma dodged a bullet ; Ethan Hawke looks ravaged . This , of course , is one thing in terms of his looks , but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of horribleness to his terrifyingly scripted scene opposite poor , lovely Maggie Q.<br /><br />I had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film questionnaire , but it has to be the Anton Yelchin/ Olivia Thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste , which saddens me because I really like those two actors . I do n't consider myself easily offended , but all I could do was scoff and look around with disgust like someone 's 50 year old aunt . < br /><br />A close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is Shia LaBeouf 's tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former Disney Channel star to act against Julie Christie . I do n't mean opposite , I mean against . Against is the only explanation . I realize now that the early sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative highlight . HIGHLIGHT . Please keep that in mind when your brain begins to leak out your ear soon after the opening credits , which seem to be a nod to the first New York Real World . This film is embarrassing , strangely dated , inarticulate , ineffective , pretentious and , in the end , completely divorced from any real idea of New York at all . < br /><br />(The extra star is for the Cloris Leachman/ Eli Wallach sequence , as it is actually quite sweet , but it is only one bright spot in what feels like hours of pointless , masturbatory torment . )
0 I 've never been to Paris , but after seeing " Paris , Je t'aime " I 'm crazy to visit this city ! I 've been to NY several times and I LOVE the city and its boroughs . I kinda expected to be touched by this film , to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away , but , lo and behold , I regret the time and money I spent with it . There are no love stories between people or a person and the city . There 's a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just does n't work out fine . Maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city , where it 's said to have thousands of people living on their own . Ca n't you find love in New York ?
0 This was a movie i could not wait to see ! So i finally got it and I was pretty disappointed . For starters , the movie has so little said about New York , just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings , streets , bridges and cafes . It really does n't stay focused on the New York magic . Another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie . I know that it is a remake , but it is not a french style remake ! Anyway , here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies , such as long and messy scenes , no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style ! The story follows many lives ( too many for my taste ) and they somehow seem connected in the end . I feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories . The movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyone 's happy ending . So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each . And there you have your 120 minutes ! if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you ! i give it 4 just because i love New York and i loved the cast !
0 Following the success of " Paris , Je T'Aime " , a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in New York . Unlike the original film , the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly -- by the time you think are getting into a story , it 's over in too many cases . And , the often start up and stop and then begin again -- with the stories woven together . As a result , there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure.<br /><br />Sadly , however , while " Paris , Je T'Aime " was hit or miss ( mostly hit ) , most of " New York , I Love You " was miss . The stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet -- and often quite terrible . It was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories -- and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so . Now understand , it was good quality music but its somber tone really , really made me feel like cutting my wrists ! Among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom , the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant ( though this was also in the first film ) and the crotchety old couple . This is all so sad because I had loved the first film so much -- and I really WANTED to love this film . I respected what they tried but simply did n't like it very much.<br /><br />By the way , and this is NOT really a complaint , but I was amazed how many people were smoking in the film . For a recent film , that was unusual in our more anti - smoking culture.<br /><br />Also , if you get the DVD , there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film . One consists of Kevin Bacon ( wearing a cool fedora ) eating a hotdog .... and absolutely NOTHING more for almost ten minutes . The other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world -- including a very unhappy couple .
0 A few years back the same persons who created Paris , J'TAIME . , which was imperfect but very enjoyable ( my rating was a 7 ) , created this piece of garbage about New York City.<br /><br />In Paris , I Love You ( J'taime)created a feeling for Paris & it was made in many parts of beautiful Paris.<br /><br />In this current film , I did not recognize New York City , I did not feel that I was in the city of my birth.<br /><br />New York does have 5 boroughs , I saw no scenes in The Bronx , or Queens , There is one scene in Brooklyn,(Brighton Beach ) , I saw no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village/ No scenes of the beautiful hotels or theatres . It does have a large cast , most of the performers were not even stereotypes , they were caricatures of the lowest sort.<br /><br />The very few humorous moments are all of a course sexual nature or quite insulting to the many fine New Yorkers that we all know & love .. < br /><br />A few of the films nominated for the ' razzie ' awards were far better.<br /><br />Ratings : * ( out of 4 ) 20 points ( out of 100 ) IMDb 1 ( Out of 10)<br /><br />In my way of thinking I think the title should have been < br /><br />NEW YORK , I HATE YOU .
0 An anthology is always risky business and I think this endeavor should be praised . There 's a lot of talent involved here . A great many talented actors , directors and writers . Unfortunately , I could n't really enjoy this movie based on three issues I had.<br /><br />First of all , the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality . And unfortunately some of them clash with the others . < br /><br />Secondly , several segments feel underdeveloped to me . Like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition . I 'm not talking about happy endings here ( or even an ending period ) but rather , they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in . < br /><br />Last but not least , I did not feel New - York and its inhabitants were properly portrayed.<br /><br />What you 're left with is high - brow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied .
0 New York , I Love You , or rather should - be - titled Manhattan , I Love Looking At Your People In Sometimes Love , is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation . Case in point , look at two of the segments in the film , one where Ethan Hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexy - talk , and another with Orlando Bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two Dostoyevsky books . While the latter is n't a great story by any stretch , it 's at least something that has a beginning , middle and end , as the composer tries to score , gets Dostoyevky dumped in his lap , and in the end gets some help ( and maybe something more ) from a girl he 's been talking to as a liaison between him and the director . The Ethan Hawke scene , however , is like nothing , and feels like it , like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in ( or , for that matter , Hawke with a combo of Before Sunrise and Reality Bites).<br /><br />What 's irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible ' stories ' and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another ( i.e. bits involving Bradley Cooper , Drea DeMatteo , Hayden Christensen , Andy Garcia , James Caan , Natalie Portman , etc ) . It 's not even so much that the film- set practically always in * Manhattan * and not the New York of Queens or Staten Island or the Bronx ( not even , say , Harlem or Washington Heights)- lacks a good deal of diversity , since there is some . It 's the lack of imagination that one found in spades , for better or worse , in Paris J'taime . It 's mostly got little to do with New York , except for passing references , and at its worst ( the Julie Christie / Shia LaBeouf segment ) it 's incomprehensible on a level that is appalling.<br /><br />So , basically , wait for TV , and do your best to dip in and out of the film - in , that is , for three scenes : the aforementioned Bloom / Christina Ricci segment which is charming ; the Brett Ratner directed segment ( yes , X - Men 3 Brett Ratner ) with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist ; and Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in Brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary . Everything else can be missed , even Natalie Portman 's directorial debut , and the return of a Hughes brother ( only one , Allan ) to the screen . A mixed bag is putting it lightly : it 's like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left .
0 The problems with this film are many , but I will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones . First of all , while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life , the reality was that everything , as usual in movies and TV , was about something bizarre , usually of a sexual nature . The story lines were thin or nonexistent , and virtually every scene , camera shot , line of dialog , and expressed emotion was absolutely , and totally fake . It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that I walked out ( something no uncommon for me in recent years . ) I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program , but I believe the ( at one time , pre - Amelia , talented)director Mira Nair took part in this disgusting travesty , so perhaps the directorial talent in America has descended en masse into the cesspool .
0 There is a reason this went straight to video- the story is smarmy , Nick Cage plays Johnny in a sleazy way- sex in churches , and other scenes that border on tasteless(like the scene in the laundry room ) taint this movie . Judge Reinhold as the cuckold is okay- but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done . But it is a good film for trivia contests- because so few people saw it .
0 Thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called German Independent Series , Four For Venice is not only awful , but really awful . So awful , that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash.<br /><br />Nick and Charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on Tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession . Eva and Luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth , where Eva works as a waitress and Luis , an artist . Nick indirectly causes Eva to lose her job as an waitress . Luis and Charlotte had an affair at the back of Eva and Nick . Luis cheated on Eva by lying to her that he would be flying off to London to do something related to his artwork , but the fact is , he is flying off to Venice with Charlotte for an adultery holiday . Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged her 2 kids along to Venice for confrontation . The trip to Venice ends up both Nick and Eva falling for one another.<br /><br />The presentation of the journey from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of the comedy . It not only look senseless , but also draggy . In the film , Nick try to seek help for several ways , but it ends to no avail . It is either the strangers around him who acts like morons , or they are just simply dumb.<br /><br />The comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story . While some of the problems that can be solved with common sense , no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem . They prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem.<br /><br />It fails so bad , that even the beautiful sceneries in Venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film .
0 Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at " modern day " Las Vegas and the gap between generations , his first directorial effort since the 1940s ! David Janssen is somewhat miscast as a big - shot casino owner who reunites with his son ( Robert Drivas , who looks disconcertingly like an older Jason Bateman ) . Janssen approaches every scene the same way : defensively , with a chip on his shoulder . Playing this role cool and laid - back is asking too much from Janssen , who barks at everyone like a grouchy put - upon husband ( he even chews out Don Rickles and makes him cry ! ) . His son , a ne'er - do - well in search of his own identity , makes hip comments about how young people look down on Vegas ( give them another ten years ) , and his disapproval of Dad 's lifestyle causes friction . Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self - conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition . Unfortunately , " Where It 's At " does n't have much else going for it other than the now - dated ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids , some quick T&A shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high - stakes world of gambling -- most of which has been covered by now , ad nauseum . * * from * * * *
0 Casting bone to pick : David Jannsen was 38 playing the father of Robert Drivas , who was then , 31 ( yeah , I realize he 's supposed to be just out of college , but clues in the script have him being a loafer and so he 's probably 24 - 25 in the script--- that still puts Jannsen in parenting classes in Junior High ) . I assume the AMA wrote medical miracle up in their 1938 Year in Medicine . This movie has n't aged very well at all and now it 's main appeal is just to see a snap shot of Sin City , circa 1969 and all the incessant smoking , the weird hair ( Drivas has an atomic comb over that makes him resemble a well - groomed hip Cousin It ) and trendy fashions that went along with it . If anyone remembers , LV was n't exactly London ... the city coddled the mob and codger gamblers in those days . Drivas comes off as sexually ambiguous ; his dad thinks he might be gay ( in a sad irony , Drivas himself died of AIDS at 47 ) and the soapy conflict is from the generation gap issue ( ahem , as if one may call 7 years a gap ) . Sonny boy wants to be his own man and dad wants to pull him into the casino ( Caesar 's Palace ! ) , and plies him with girls ( including the horny - for - money Edy Williams ) . Interestingly enough , the son does n't seem to mind being thought of as gay--- unusual for the time and a cute Brenda Vaccarro is nearby to swoon platonically over him . What nudity there is is awfully lame--- just what was needed to pull the audience in for an ' R ' rating in the early days of the MPAA rating system ( which then was G - M - R[16]- and X ) . The editing is HORRIBLE and there 's stupid - silly overdubs by The Committee ( a late 60 's neo - avante - garde comedy troupe that mercifully faded off the map within a couple of years ) . Don Rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer ... seemingly preparing him for a role as a floor manager in the much better CASINO two decades later . Not to give anything away , but they would 've dealt with Mr. Rickles ' character with power tools and a hole in the desert back then . A curiosity at best , far from Joshua Logan 's usual caliber of work . Dos / Dias . Now go watch CASINO again ...
0 I can only believe that Garson Kanin must have been two people . The one who wrote the brilliant " A Double Life " and the funny " Born Yesterday " and co - wrote such excellent screenplays as " Adam 's Rib " and " Pat And Mike " with his wife Ruth Gordon and then the one who wrote and/or directed such tiresome , sad drivel as " Bachelor Mother " , " Some Kind Of A Nut " , and this . The cast tries , but the script is so tired and clichéd that even the efforts of the always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated . The script sinks to it 's nadir in the truly offensive sequence in which Janssen 's character tests Drivas 's character to make sure he 's not gay . An ugly sequence , but sadly one which could easily play in a film today . " Ethnic " jokes are now totally verboten , but " fag " jokes are still " good , clean , family fun " .
0 I was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic " Private Lessons " which portrays the dream of any male teenager.<br /><br />"Private Lessons II " has NOTHING to do with the title I mention . It 's just a regular soft - core Cinemax flick that wo n't make a change in your life . There 's just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but that 's it . I watched this a long time ago but believe me , this is just a regular boring soft core flick.<br /><br />The women are hot but that 's not enough to rent or buy the movie . My advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable .
0 Up until the last 20 minutes , I was thinking that this is possibly Jackie Chan 's worst movie ( excluding his pre-1978 work , which I am not familiar with ) . The final fight sequence changed all that : it is long and good and intense - indeed , one of the highlights of Chan 's career . But to get to it , you have to sit through a lot of " comedy " that might amuse five - year - olds ( oh , look ! someone threw a tomato at that guy 's face ) and endless " football " scenes . Not to mention the dubbing ( which includes the line " How can I turn it off ? It 's not a tap " - watch to find out what it refers to ) . " Dragon Lord " is worth renting for the final fight alone , but the rest of the movie is only for Jackie collectors , and even then only for those who 've already seen at least 15 of his other movies . ( * * )
0 When I sat down to watch this film I actually expected quite a bit , as the plot takes on quite complex issues . Using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach . Still unfortunately , despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between Muslim and western culture , adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays / lesbians , it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film . This leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle , attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with.<br /><br />However , this does not mean that the film is directly bad , as it 's rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing . The film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter , but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep . This has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts . By this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation.<br /><br />Even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama , the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when " the ball drops " . This way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard cliché that becomes ridiculous in its happy - ending . Nothing is left out in the Hollywood like ending . So even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages , one ca n't help but roll eyes towards the resolution . Personally I was close to shouting " finish already ! ! " at the screen.<br /><br />There were some decent acting in the film , and the two young female central characters had some good moments . So did their parents and other bi - characters . However the handsome Irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting , that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism . He did n't even appear very likable , but rather self involved despite his good deeds , which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained.<br /><br />I give the film a 4 , as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from . The script and cast had many good believable characters , giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others . Had the let - downs not been this disappointing , I 'd easily give the film a 7 or 8 . If you enjoyed this film , I 'd recommend the film " East is East " , which I think is an as good , if not better rendering of cultural conflict , as well as being amusing and engaging .
0 Long , boring , blasphemous . Never have I been so glad to see ending credits roll .
0 An executive , very successful in his professional life but very unable in his familiar life , meets a boy with down syndrome , escaped from a residence . Both characters feel very alone , and the apparently less intelligent one will show to the executive the beauty of the small things in life ... With this argument , the somehow Amelie - like atmosphere and the sentimental music , I did n't expect but a moralistic disgusting movie . Anyway , as there were some interesting scenes ( the boy is sometimes quite a violent guy ) , and the interpretation of both actors , Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne , was very good , I decided to go on watching the movie . The French cinema , in general , has the ability of showing something that seems quite much to life , opposed to the more stereotyped American cinema . But , because of that , it is much more disappointing to see after the absurd ending , with the impossible death of the boy , the charming tone , the happiness of the executive 's family , the cheap moral , the unbearable laughter of the daughters , the guy waving from heaven as Michael Landon ... Really nasty , in my humble opinion .
0 First of all , I was expecting " Caged Heat " to be along the same lines as " Ilsa , The Wicked Warden " . Boy , was I wrong ! In no way is this film 70s exploitation , " chix in chains " , or " women in prison " . Sure , the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison , who wear street clothes btw ( quite comical ) , but NOTHING happens.<br /><br />There are n't strong rivalries , no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape , and no inmates make out . There are 2 shower scenes , that I suspect is just recycled footage , but no fights breaks out / no one is seduced here - or anywhere for that matter ! Aside from the lack of plot , unconvincing , unsympathetic , and flat characters , a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to " free " their fellow inmates??!!<br /><br />PUH - LEASE , the movie should have just ended off with the escapees riding off into the sunset ... as opposed to letting this mess continue!<br /><br />I feel scammed .
0 Nicholas Walker is Paul , the local town Reverand who 's married to Martha ( Ally Sheedy ) , but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair , Veronica ( Dara Tomanovich ) . However in so doing , he gets a bout of amnesia ( hence the name of the film ) . Sally Kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good Reverand in a shades of " Misery " type of way . It 's sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this . Not the least bit John Savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator . In a film billed as a ' black comedy ' , one has to bring BOTH elements into said movie . While this does bring the former in spades , it sadly contains none of the latter . Furthermore you ca n't emphasize with any of the characters and as thus , have absolutely no vested interest in them . Technically not an all - together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one.<br /><br />Eye Candy : Dara Tomanovich gets topless ; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin < br /><br />My Grade : C- < br /><br />Where I saw it : Showtime Showcase
0 Towards the end of this thriller Ally Sheedy 's gaunt latter - day image is used creatively to make up more than one hauntingly evil image . She convinces one that , if a nasty Bette Davis - type role were to come her way , she could carry it off brilliantly . Unfortunately , I ca n't find many other reasons for seeing this . If you 've wondered what Sheedy looks like in a pair of old - fashioned glasses ( but why should anyone ? ) then here 's your answer . For the rest , Sally Kirkland 's sex - starved crazy woman is really tiresome , and even if you like this sort of thing more than I do you 'll have to admit that the tension sags badly during these scenes . Savage 's drunken brute of an insurance agent is equally distasteful but at least it 's a small role . Of the leading actors , Nicholas Walker inspires no sympathy at all for Paul Keller 's plight and his acting is wooden . Dara Tomanovich is better and during her scenes with Sheedy the level rises a little . Sheedy 's meticulous , understated performance ( though she often seems to be on automatic pilot ) is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest . The sets are drab , the camera - work undistinguished .
0 Where to start ... If this movie had been a dark comedy , I would say it was FANNN - TASTIC ! Unfortunately for me , and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare ( mind you that was the price I paid , got it from Wal - Mart ) , this movie was meant to be a thriller . The only THRILL I got was watching Kirkland 's lousy rendition of Anne Wilkes from Misery sans snowy woodland area . If you want a good laugh , on a rainy Friday night with some friends , then I highly recommend this movie . But if you want to watch something at least half way decent , then do n't even bother.<br /><br />I for one enjoy crappy films , the worse the better in most cases . But Wow ... I Meant WOW ! ! The only person in the entire film that did n't stink it up was the little boy , played by Vincent Berry . The only reason why I even give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do .
0 Instead , go to the zoo , buy some peanuts and feed 'em to the monkeys . Monkeys are funny . People with amnesia who do n't say much , just sit there with vacant eyes are not all that funny.<br /><br />Black comedy ? There is n't a black person in it , and there is n't one funny thing in it either.<br /><br />Walmart buys these things up somehow and puts them on their dollar rack . It 's labeled Unrated . I think they took out the topless scene . They may have taken out other stuff too , who knows ? All we know is that whatever they took out , is n't there any more.<br /><br />The acting seemed OK to me . There 's a lot of unfathomables tho . It 's supposed to be a city ? It 's supposed to be a big lake ? If it 's so hot in the church people are fanning themselves , why are they all wearing coats ?
0 I had quite high hopes for this film , even though it got a bad review in the paper . I was extremely tolerant , and sat through the entire film . I felt quite sick by the end.<br /><br />Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema -- I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen 's ' Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex , ... ' and Michael Hanneke 's ' Funny Games'--I found the directors ' obsession with this ten - year - old wanting to drink women 's milk totally sickening . And when the film climaxed in an " orgy " where the boy drinks both his mother 's milk , as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film , I almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental pap that it is.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong , I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema , as well as independently made films , so this flick should have pleased me enormously . Avoid this film at all costs , it should be relegated to the annals of History as a lesson in bad cinema .
0 " Plan B " is strictly by - the - numbers fare except for one thing . I surprisingly found it to be rather insulting.<br /><br />Jon Cryer is the " star " of this film and plays his usual , smarmy , egotistical , snotty character that was actually endearing in " Pretty In Pink " and has NOT been amusing ever since . Grating does n't even begin to describe his performance . Ricky ( Mark Matheisen ) is a muscular , blonde , struggling actor who ( gasp ! ) is only worried about his hair and getting laid . Talk about a stock character ... ugh . At least the other three characters are somewhat engaging . Lisa Darr and Lance Guest play a grounded , optimistic , caring couple who are struggling to conceive . Since they are not whiny drama queens , however , their roles are apparently considered boring and they are n't given enough screen time . Sara Mornell rounds out the cast by playing Gina , your usual nice and good - looking young woman who just ca n't seem to find the right partner in love . I 've seen this character a million times before but at least her performance overcomes some of the shortfalls caused by the predictability of her situation.<br /><br />What startled me about this film was its juvenile promotion of stereotypes . They introduced a Russian character for the sole purpose of mocking him and making fun of the way he talked . He was portrayed as being wild , ignorant and amazingly shallow . They were just getting warmed up though for the usual nonsense about gays . Gina decides to be gay for a while since she is n't having any luck with guys . Honestly . That was n't that bad except they really went overboard when Gina brought a lesbian to a Christmas party her friends were throwing . Her lesbian date had very short hair ( like I 'm sure all lesbians do ) . She also got quite upset ( like I 'm sure all lesbians do ) when Gina had the nerve to put on lipstick ( ! ) . Finally , her date goes around the party hitting on just about every woman there and mouths off when Gina expresses her disappointment . Of course , we all know how gay people ca n't stay faithful for so much as a couple of hours much less months or even years , right ? ( Please note the sarcasm in that statement . Thank you.)<br /><br />This film was based on a tired and predictable premise to begin with but Cryer 's unlikable performance combined with the idiotic stereotyping sinks this movie to the lower depths of cinema . 2/10
0 I had the misfortune to sit through the full 102 minutes of what , in my opinion , is this shockingly bad film . It fails on pretty much all levels ; the cast is awful , the acting - ham at best and the plot lacks any depth , leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story lines.<br /><br />Plan B has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and I found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedy.<br /><br />A bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie .
0 Even though there 's a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from , this ' Succubus ' is often named as THE best Jess Franco film . Heck , even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang counts ' Succubus ' among his personal favorites . So , maybe it 's me but I thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie . The opening is great , though , and shows Janine Reynaud performing an SM act on stage . It 's all downhill from here , unfortunately . Reynaud 's character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance . Franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations , beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score . This COULD have been his greatest film indeed , if it was n't for the lame and uninteresting story . It 's supposed to be psychedelic but I 'd say sophomoric is a better term to describe what 's shown here . Half of the time , you do n't have a clue what 's going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages . This most certainly is n't Franco 's best film according to me . I would n't even recommend it to die - hard exploitation fans . If you 're looking for more superior Jess Franco film , try to get your hands on ' Las Vampiras ' , ' The awful Dr. Orloff ' or ' Female Vampire ' .
0 I 've come to realise from watching Euro horror , especially films made by cult luminary Jess Franco , that you ca n't expect a plot that makes much sense . However , Franco has gone overboard with this film ; and despite a surreal atmosphere , and the film 's reputation as one of the director 's best - Succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film . I 've got to admit that I saw the American cut version , which runs at about 76 minutes ; but unless it was just the logic that was cut , I 'm sure the longer European version is just as boring . The plot has something to do with a woman marauding around ; practicing S&M and talking rubbish , and it 's all really boring . There 's no gore and the sex is dull , and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film ; I had difficulty making it all the way to the end . I have to say that the locations look good and Franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere ; but the positive elements end there . Jess Franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films - but this looks like it was one he made for the money , and overall I recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director 's more interesting works .
0 ' Succubus ' , the edited version of ' Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden ' , is a struggle to sit through , even at a lean 76 minutes ; any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious Euro horror tripe and I may have slipped into a coma.<br /><br />Jess Franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on Class A hallucinogenics , since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever . Apparently , this is one of the better of his 180 + films  it 's hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there.<br /><br />The unfathomable plot deals with Franco 's usual themes of sex , violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of S&M for good measure , and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious.<br /><br />I may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy Euro Horror again  life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this .
0 A disappointing film.<br /><br />The story established our protagonist as Chrissy , a ' young ' , rather sullen individual drifting , not doing much . Actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it did n't surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives . It 's a pity though , Chrissy seem like interesting character.<br /><br />Story was predictable and at times felt quite formulated . So the question now is , when are we going to see the Campions , Jacksons , and the Tamahori 's breaking ground with compelling , cinematically - told stories that will inspire , rather than entertain for the toll of two hours?<br /><br />Technically , a disgusting shot film .
0 Kubrick meets King . It sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980 , I remember . Then the movie came out , and the Kubrick cultists have been bickering with the King cultists ever since.<br /><br />The King cultists say Stanley Kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it . The Kubrick cultists do n't give a damn about King 's story . They talk about Steadicams , tracking shots , camera angles . This is a film , they insist : It should be considered on its own . As it happens , both camps are correct . Unfortunately.<br /><br />If one views it purely as an adaptation of King 's novel , " The Shining " is indeed a failure , a wasted opportunity , a series of botched narrative gambits . < br /><br />I used to blame that on Kubrick 's screenwriter . The writer Diane Johnson ( author of Le Marriage , L'Affaire , Le Divorce , etc . ) has a reputation as an novelist of social manners . Maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics . But the little blue - collar town of Sidewinder , Colorado does n't exist on any map in her Francophile universe . < br /><br />Kubrick the Anglophile probably found her congenial , however . He , of course , is the real auteur . And considered on its own merits , his screenplay for " The Shining " -- with its mishmash of abnormal psychology , rationalism , supernaturalism , and implied reincarnation -- just does n't stand up to logical analysis.<br /><br />I'm willing to consider Kubrick 's " Shining " on its own terms . I 'm even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror - genre movie . But it does n't succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation , alienation , and madness either . Parsed either way , the film pretty much falls apart.<br /><br />Are the horrors of the Overlook Hotel real ? Or do they exist only in the mind -- first as prescient nightmares suffered by little Danny Torrance , then as the hallucinations of his father ? One notes how whenever Jack Torrance is seen talking to a " ghost " he is in fact looking into a mirror . One notes how the hotel 's frozen topiary - hedge maze appears to symbolize Jack 's stunted , convoluted psyche . Very deep stuff.<br /><br />But if indeed the Overlook 's " ghosts " are purely manifestations of Jack Torrance 's growing insanity , then who exactly lets the trapped Jack out of the hotel kitchen 's dead - bolted walk- in closet , so that he can go on his climactic ax - wielding rampage?<br /><br />And can ANYONE explain , with a straight face , that black - and - white photograph ( helpfully labelled " 1921 " ) of Nicholson as a tuxedoed party - goer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotel - ballroom wall during the film 's closing seconds ? Are we to seriously conclude that Jack Torrance 's Bad Craziness stems from a some sort of " past life " experience ? ( And if you swallow that , since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selves?)<br /><br />Maybe Kubrick did n't care about his storyline . Maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror . Whatever the case , the film tries to hedge its narrative bets -- to have it both ways , rational and supernatural . As a result , the story is a mess . This movie has n't improved with age , and it certainly does n't improve with repeated viewings.<br /><br />I do n't deny that a few moments of fear , claustrophobia , and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long , long film . But those gushing Elevators o ' Blood , seen repeatedly in little Danny 's visions , are absurd and laughable . And Jack Torrance 's infamous tag lines ( " Wendy , I 'm home ! " and " Heeeeeere 's JOHNNY ! " ) merely puncture the movie 's dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy . ( I know : I sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief : " Whew ! Glad we do n't have to take this stuff seriously ! " ) Finally , Kubrick is completely at sea -- or else utterly cynical -- during those scenes in which Wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son . A foyer full of mummified guests , all sitting there dead in their party hats ? Yikes , now I really am afraid.<br /><br />Given Jack Nicholson 's brilliance over the years , one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeball - rolling , eyebrow - wiggling , scenery - chomping performance that the director wanted . The performance of Shelley Duvall , as a sort of female version of Don Knotts in " The Ghost and Mr. Chicken , " is best passed over in silence.<br /><br />This movie simply does n't succeed -- not as an adaptation , not on its own terms . It probably merits a 3 out of 10 , but I 'm giving it a 1 because it has been so GROTESQUELY over - rated in this forum .
0 I caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel , and was reminded of how terrible I thought it was in 1980 when first released . Many reviewers out there are n't old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King . The enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed " master " director put this multi - layered supernatural story on the screen . " Salem 's Lot " had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a TV mini - series , directed by Tobe Hooper ( he of " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " fame ) and was badly handled , turning the major villain of the book into a " Chiller Theatre " vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise . Fans hoped that a director of Kubrick 's stature would succeed where Hooper had failed . It did n't happen.<br /><br />Sure , this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments , it 's all downhill . Jack Nicholson can not be anything but Jack Nicholson . He 's always crazy and did n't bring anything to his role here . I do n't care that many reviewers here think he 's all that in this clinker , the " Here 's Johnny ! " bit notwithstanding ... he 's just awful in this movie . So is everyone else , for that matter . Scatman Crothers ' character , Dick Halloran , was essential to the plot of the book , yet Kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest " shock " sequences ever put on film . I remember the audience in the theater I saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick , those that stayed that is ... many left . King 's books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters , and often metaphysically . Kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately do n't really care what happens to whom.<br /><br />This movie still stinks and why so many think it 's a horror masterpiece is beyond me .
0 I hate this movie ! It was NOTHING like the book , and just thinking about it makes me mad . If you watch the movie before reading the book , then yeah , it 's a good movie . But King 's book was AMAZING and this movie was nothing like it . I mean , the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different . The ending for example ! So in the book it is extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes . but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze ... yeah , there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it . Another part that made me angry was that jack just kills Mr. Halloran ! what the heck , he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he was n't important . Overall , it was just bad that the movie was so extremely off .
0 Many King fans hate this because it departed from the book , but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump . That notwithstanding , the movie does fail completely , but it fails entirely on film terms . I 'd like to smack the people who tell me it 's the scariest movie ever made . I always follow up with the question " Really ... exactly what scene scared you ? " Every fan I 've asked , goes silent . Occasionally someone , at a loss for a decent scare ( There are none ... ) , names the " Grape - juice - shooting - out - of - elevators " shtick . If you 're afraid of that , I do n't know what to tell you , except maybe that you 're easily scared . I just rolled my eyes watching these z - grade horror ideas play out in this schlocky , incoherent movie.<br /><br />One place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get Mr Halloran up to the Overlook only to kill him ; with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes Halloran FOREVER to walk down . Really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film . < br /><br />Oh , and nice choice for Mr. Halloran 's artwork Stanley ! Black light afro - nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie . Has there ever been a more " off , " out - of - place shot in any movie ever made?<br /><br />I consider it a miracle that I was eventually able to bypass this turd , and agree that Kubricks 2001 is a truly important film , given the immense ' bad will ' generated by both this stupid , stupid movie , and the cult of fawning but inarticulate Kubrick fan - boys , who could n't describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the Library of Congress in front of them . < br /><br />Toss in the grotesque overacting of Jack Nicholson , the introduction of dumb one - liners at tense moments , and the Razzie nominated performance of Shelly Duvall and you have a very crappy movie .
0 These writings write about the end of the plot so do n't read it if you have n't seen this rubbish.<br /><br />I found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror . If I owned a video store I 'd put it in the BORING section . This film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks.<br /><br />This film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary . Well I drive to work and back ( and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats ) almost every day and trust me it 's not scary . It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving . Even the little kid does it too . Round and round he goes and he never stops . What 's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour ? I think NOTHING and if you watch it you will not think so too.<br /><br />The family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens . Then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason . That 's all that happens and as you can see it 's rubbish .
0 Not the best of the films to be watched nowadays . I read a lot of reviews about Shining and was expecting it to be very good . But this movie disappointed me . The sound and environment was good , but there was no story here . Not was there a single moment of fright . I expected it to a horror thriller movie , but there was no horror no thriller . The only scene where I got scared was during the chapter change scene showing " Wednesday " . There are lots of fragments i the movie . Most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything . The story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown . Might be a good movie to watch in the 80 's , but not for the 21st century .
0 Ladies and Gentlemen , please do n't get fooled by " A Stanley Kubrick " film tag . This is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made . Horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film . In Shining , there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive , foolish attempt made to create chilling horror . Everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality . All that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley . The hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too . A word about the actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost , lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do . There is not much to be said of a bald , colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor . No need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy . It can not be avoided as the film has been made and poor Kubrick is not alive to make any changes .
0 Ok , honestly I do nt see why everybody thinks this is so great . Its really not . There were two good things that came out of this movie 1 . Jack 's performance , he was very good I can tip my hat for him . 2 . Danny 's performance , he was good . No other then that it got pretty stupid . And , what was Stanley Kubrick thinking drafting Shelly as the Wendy ? She was so bad . She looked the same every time she got scared . The problem with this movie was the ending . I would have had more respect for it if Kubrick would have ended it differently . And , the over all movie was just stupid . The problem with the movie is that the book was so much better . So do nt see the movie read the book and you will be much better off . 3/10 .
0 I am going to keep this short . This " adaption " of the wonderful King book is a bad joke and nothing more . Of course there are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans in this site and , as a result , this movie has mysteriously find its way in the top-250.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is laughable as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall . The story , that has nothing to do with the book , is an incoherent mess and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are complete jokes.<br /><br />My advice to anyone that has n't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story : stick to the TV series .... < br /><br />Oh , and the people who are saying that Kubrick had every right to destroy the King story cause King is ... not a good writer should stick to reviewing " masterpieces " like " eyes wide shut " .
0 After just finishing the book the same day I watched the movie , I knew what was supposed to happen . I had high expectations of the movie , because of the rating . The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie . I have a couple main points for not liking this movie.<br /><br / > * * * * * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * * * * * * * * < br /><br />1 . The casting . Jack Nicholson barely fits into Jack Torrence 's character . Also , I would have NEVER picked Shelly Duvall for Wendy . I pictured Wendy much differently . I can see why they picked Jack Nicholson though , the grin , the pointy eyebrows , but he 's not supposed to really look ' evil ' . He 's supposed to look normal , and he turns evil . Also , they make one of the worst movie couples . Danny was alright , he needed more life though . He acted way to droney.<br /><br />2 . The screenplay . They cut out so many things that were in the book , and added things . Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted , changed , or handled wrongly . Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to seeing ( the hedge animals , the roque mallet , the elevator ) were not in the movie , and it was 2 and half hours ! ! I was extremely irritated.<br /><br />3 . The Ending . The ending was changed completly , Halorann died , Jack froze to death , Wendy never got hurt ... The Overlook did n't blow up . The Ending was so cool in the book , and the movie messed it up so horribly , I was apalled . Hallorann was never supposed to die , but Jack killed him with an ax . If they wanted to kill him , at least have Jack use a roque mallet . You never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie.<br /><br />There are other things that I did n't like about the movie , but there are things that were all right . The camera angels were cool , the blood coming out of the elevator ( did n't happen in the book ) was cool , but maybe I was too irritated that the movie did n't go with the book , to try to be scared at all . I reccomend reading the book , before you see this movie . I applaud Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis Stanley Kubrik any more . I would never have done that , I would have taken all the rights I could get to yell at him all day . I ca n't wait to see the 6 hour version , at least it has the hedge animals.<br /><br />Rating : 2/10
0 This has got to be the most stupid film I have ever seen ( spoilers ahead ) ! First of all , the plot is stupid . The little kid is weird and they move to a hotel because his father is the caretaker of it . We find that the kid has a gift , the " Shining " . This gift never ever has anything to do with anything except to make the kid seem cool . Then the movie gets more boring and boring until the man finally goes crazy . He goes on a rampage to kill the kid and his wife because ... well , he feels like it . Why else would he do it ? All of a sudden we see a naked woman in the tub . The man kisses her and realizes he is kissing a dead corpse , which is utterly disgusting . Somehow a black man enters the hotel and is whacked with an axe . Then the kid and the woman take the black man 's vehicle and leave the father , who dies within minutes of hypothermia . Most movies are n't a complete waste of time , but this falls right into that category . The music is trashy , the characters are corny ( except Jack Nicholson , who is a good actor ) , the plot is twisted and fits the description of vomit , the ending is very predictable , the storyline is slow , tedious , and boring . This movie is extremely overrated . AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS . I 'm surprised it 's gotten such a high rating on IMDb .
0 One Star . That 's all this documentary deserves . I have n't felt this disappointed in watching a movie , let alone a documentary , in quite some time.<br /><br />I'm a BIG fan of the " Walking With ... " series , including it 's Nigel Marvin spin - offs , for all their gleeful fun yet informative information . And although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures , the subject is still interesting and unique to explore . Having seen all the other docs from the series , I figured I need to see this one as well , especially after seeing relatively good reviews in other places.<br /><br />Well for those of you who put up a good review of this doc ... what were you thinking ? ! lol.<br /><br />Though the information that they were able to get through was interesting , the presentation failed in every other way possible . It had a terrible flow , was incredibly unfocused in what it was trying to say ( with information scrambled and sometimes out of of place ) , horrible effects ( that includes the few moments of CGI and especially the makeup effects ) , and overused MTV - style camera effects.<br /><br />Speaking of the makeup effects , one reviewer here mentioned how laughable the scene was when the cavemen come across this giant ape and how it looks a lot like a 70s man - in - suit horror movie . Well there are plenty of moments just like that were the people portraying the ape men looked ridiculous and acted ridiculous . None of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions.<br /><br />The worst part of all is none of it is shown in an interesting or dynamic way , or looks remotely real . It does n't even look like it was taken seriously . It also lacked any emotional punch that the predecessors of the series had . Remember the episode in " Walking With Dinosaurs " of the fate of the Ornithochirus ( sp ? ) ? That episode still gets me on the verge of tears every time I watch it . It 's this sort of engagement with the subject that lacks here most of all . When you are more engaged in the subject and it 's own personal story , even one that is just speculation , you care more about the facts surrounding it.<br /><br />The only saving graces of this production are the fairly good narration ( at least in the BBC version I saw ) and the music . Otherwise , DO NOT bother even renting this one unless you want to have a good laugh ( which I did frequently , but usually followed by rolling eyes ) . This does not belong on the shelf with the other " Walking With ... " docs.<br /><br />And does it make sense to learn that this doc was NOT produced or directly involved with the same people who did the others in the series ? Hmmm ...
0 OK , If you 're looking for another Bastketball Diaries , this is completely the wrong film.<br /><br />I revolves around two brothers . Max , the younger , has a major cocaine addiction . Adam , the eldest , is a doctor . This movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible . It however , does not . It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present . Most of the movie focus is on Max and his parting ways . Eventually Adam , can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well ( perscription drugs).<br /><br />This movie has almost no climax . Does n't descend into what cocaine really does to you , has boring and low - budget scenes , and the acting of the eldest brother , Adam , is horrific.<br /><br />I have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards , it is not a heart - wencher . If you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs- rent , if not buy ' The Basketball Diaries ' . And notice the difference.<br /><br />Try to avoid this movie but , if you think you will enjoy . Try and see for yourself ...
0 The movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike - but are not in any way expect for being smart - one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code . Geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title.<br /><br />I honestly did n't like the style of the movie . I believe that anxiety , confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose , but what I do n't get is why there is so much of it . The movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all . It gives the comic book like experience . However it 's visually numbing the viewer , it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs , monotonic scenes , dynamic cut , music and abrupt noises.<br /><br />The movie 's storyline is very simple , most of what 's going on is being dramatically pictured for long minutes , mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts.<br /><br />I will say openly that this movie did n't meet my expetations a tiny bit .
0 This has to be , by far , the absolute worst movie I have seen in the last 20 years . When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it I figured it could n't be too bad a movie since he has been in some pretty decent films , and he was a pretty fair actor . WRONG ! No one should waste their time on this film . I fast forwarded through 80 percent of it and I do n't feel that I missed a thing .
0 It is a pity that you can not vote zero stars on IMDb , because I would not have hesitated ! In fact I would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars . < br /><br />I , like many others , bought this film thinking that because it has Michael Madsen in it , it could be good ... No chance ! This film was shocking ! Imagine a movie length ' The Bold and the Beautiful ' , well , Primal Instinct did not even come close to that good , and I had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length ' The Bold and the Beautiful ' . < br /><br />Michael Madsen , how could you do this to us ? The worst part is , I did n't fast forward a bit , I was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke , that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film.<br /><br />Where do I start ... ? Directing - Zero Stars , Screenplay - Zero Stars , Acting - Zero Stars , Cinematography - Zero Stars , Digital Effects - Zero Stars , Production Design - Zero Stars , Make - up - Zero Stars , Casting - Zero Stars , Editing - Zero Stars , Trailer - Half a Star , Graphic Design - Half a Star , DVD Menu - Half a Star.<br /><br />However I think that it is very important to have seen bad films just so that you know what a really bad film is , so for that reason I am happy that I saw this film , just so that I have a bad film to put at the bottom of my list .
0 This has to be the worst movie I have seen . Madsen fans do n't be drawn into this like I was . He is only in it for a maximum of five minutes . This movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest of the movies on earth as well as t.v . had been destroyed .
0 A BDSM " sub - culture " of Los Angeles serves as backdrop for this low budget and shabbily constructed mess , plainly a vanity piece for its top - billed player , Celia Xavier , who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as twin sisters Vanessa and Celia . A question soon develops as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera , lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer . Celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the County of Los Angeles , while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon CD - ROMS , but when disaster befalls " Mistress Vanessa " , virtuous Celia , determined to unearth her sister 's vicious attacker , begins a new job as a " sex slave " at the private Castle Club where the specialty of the house is a " dungeon party " . Two FBI field agents ( whose deployment to the Vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet BDSM sites ) , in addition to a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective , are assigned to investigate the crime , while endeavouring to provide security for Celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her . Flaws in logic and continuity abound , such as a homicide being allocated to L.A.P.D. 's Operations - South Bureau , a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film . Direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic post - production editing and sound reproduction . The mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movie 's end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario . One solid acting turn appears among this slag : Stan Abe as a zealous FBI agent .
0 This is not Michael Madsen 's fault , he was hardly in it . This movie was just awful . If you want to laugh and be bored , go ahead and watch this movie . Words can not describe how idiotic it is . Sorry Michael . The cinematography was dark . All the other actors are unknowns . When watching it , it feels like a soft porn , but with no nudity or heated scenes . This movie had sexual overtones , since it is about a underground S & M killer . The acting was bad , except Michael Madsen 's parts . He looked like he wanted to laugh . I hope he got paid well for this lousy movie . It is something I would not be proud of . It is not even a B movie for cable , it is more like a F and it should never be shown , ever .
0 I just watched this film 15 minutes ago , and I still have no idea what I just watched . Mainly I think it 's a film about an internet S&M " star " of CD Roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online . She 's murdered by someone , which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 FBI agents to investigate the death . The local homicide division of Big City , USA is also investigating , though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the CD ROMs which he claims are as realistic " as the real thing " . I know . Wow.<br /><br />Michael Madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him . He 's in the film for about 15 minutes , and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason . I wo n't even explain the ending , because quite frankly I ca n't make it out myself . But before the final scene , we 're treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film . Honestly , they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all.<br /><br />All in all , stay away from this film . I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen . I really could have used that 80 some minutes on something else and have been more satisfied . Like , playing that game with a knife where you jab at your hand repeatedly . That for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining .
0 I agree totally with the last commenter this could be the worst movie ever made .I too had to fast forward through most of this movie . Michael Madsen must have done this movie as a favor to someone . The picture quality is grainy all the way through .And what little plot there is , is just plain stupid .I give this movie a 1 out of 10 if I could give it a lower score I would .Don't waste your time on this movie or you 'll regret it .
0 The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid . At least all I lost was $ 3.00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb . The crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat . When the female lead and the FBI guy went to the alleged killers location , Mr. FBI handed the female a revolver . When the alleged killer came out the door , the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic . One is left to ponder would an FBP agent hand a weapon to a civilian ? I think not . Ms. Xavier appears to be a very attractive female . It is too bad the R rating did not allow much of her to be seen . It would seem that a film editor cut what might have been the best parts of the film out .
0 [ CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!]<br /><br / > Timon and Pumbaa are watching The Lion King . Timon decides to go back BEFORE the beginning , to when the story really began . So they go back . Way back . Back even before Simba was born . Back to Timon 's old home which was miles away from Pride Rock . A clan of meerkats burrowed underground to hide from hyenas . The worst digger in the clan was a pompous , self - centered meerkat named Timon . His mother took pity on him but Uncle Max just shook his head . Mother suggested putting Timon on sentry duty ; Timon had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere . Just then , hyenas Shenzi , Bonzai and Ed arrived and nearly killed poor Uncle Max . That did it . The other meerkats just wanted Timon to go away while Timon took it upon himself to leave . So he kissed his mom goodbye and started off . He did n't get very far before he started getting homesick . Just then he met Rafiki , who taught him to look beyond what he sees . Timon had no clue what that meant so he continued on and met a warthog named Pumbaa , who was all alone due to a flatulence problem . Timon and Pumbaa join up then , but Timon declared them acquaintances , rather than friends.<br /><br / > They soon arrive at Pride Rock where all the zebras , antelopes , wildebeests , rhinoceroses , giraffe 's , elephants and many other plain animals had gathered . What was going on ? Timon did n't care . They pressed on . Timon then saw Rafiki atop Pride Rock lifting into the air something he could n't see . Just then all the animals took a bow . Was this to honor the birth of the new king ? No , Pumbaa had passed gas and the animals were bowing to cover their noses ; Timon and Pumbaa try an assortment of new homes , but each are discomforting due to incessant singing or hyenas or a large stampede of wildebeests ! Pumbaa and Timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream . When they reach land , Timon decides to give up . But then they gaze around at their newfound paradise . It was beautiful : trees and water falls as far as the eye could see . Timon named the place after a strange phrase he learned from Rafiki : Hakuna Matata . Timon and Pumbaa go out bowling for buzzards one afternoon when they suddenly run into Simba . They take him under their wing and become father figures . They teach him the arts of bug eating and belching contests . Pretty soon , a teenage Simba takes on Timon in a snail slurping contest . Simba won , leaving Timon deathly ill.<br /><br / > Then one day , Simba 's childhood friend Nala arrived . Timon and Pumbaa just knew she 'd break up the friendship . Suddenly , Simba runs away . Nala and Pumbaa race after him , but not Timon . He chose to stay at " Hakuna Matata " by himself , until Rafiki " talked " some sense into him , so he joins his friends at Pride Rock . Timon 's mother and Uncle Max arrive then . While Simba battles Scar , Mother and Max dig a large hole to trap hyenas Shenzi , Bonzai and Ed in . It worked . Scar is soon flung down the same hole where he is devoured by the hyenas . Then all is well . Mother , Uncle Max and the rest of the meerkats go live with Timon and Pumbaa in the paradise that is Hakuna Matata . Back to the present , Timon and Pumbaa finish the movie when suddenly Mother , Uncle Max , Simba and Rafiki want to watch it again . So do Mickey Mouse , Donald Duck , Goofy , Snow White , the Seven Dwarfs , Dumbo , Peter Pan , the Lost Boys , Mad Hatter , March Hare , Genie , Aladdin , and Jasmine.<br /><br / > Well , I must say that The Lion King 1 1/2 was n't as good as I had hoped . It was too ridiculous and silly . The original Lion King was a masterpiece . It had a serious story with light comedy thrown in . This one was just silly and made a mockery of it . I swear , sometimes Timon and Pumbaa are just way too overplayed . They 're overplayed to the point of no longer being funny , just annoying . The original voice cast is back : Nathan Lane as Timon , Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa , Matthew Broddrick as Adult Simba , Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi , Cheech Marin as Bonzai , Jim Cummings as Ed , Robert Guillame as Rafiki . New to the cast are Julie Kavner of TV 's ( Too ) long running series The Simpsons as Timon 's mom and Jerry Stiller as Uncle Max . So anyway , this movie is n't The Lion King III , and it is n't II because there already is a II . It takes place right after Part I and Part II is a ways away . Hence , it 's 1 1/2 . In conclusion , I do n't recommend this to die hard Lion King fans because it 's far too ridiculous and frivilous . However the kids will love it so I recommend it to them . I hope this will also be the LAST Lion King movie . Two is enough . " The Lion King 1 1/2 " . What we 've come to expect from Disney sequel makers.<br /><br />-
0 I saw and liked the first two a lot , really . Especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first . And it 's a story standing alone . You do n't have to know the first movie . I liked that in the " Free Willy " movies , too.<br /><br />But ... the third , here is absolutely useless ! I tried it with a friend of mine , because we both liked the first two . We decided to stop after a good half an hour . The movie is okay , there are funny parts in it alright . But what for ? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies . What Lion King 1 1/2 is for me is : a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already , plus telling the story from their point of view . But what for ? I 'd really like to know . You know , the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one , is really nice . But what comes after is mostly unnecessary . I guess many people liked Timon and Pumba , and so do I really . Yet , for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny . No chance , most of it was n't funny at all , at least for me . Btw . what was the movie about anyway ? Was it a ) about Timon and Pumba or b ) an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie ? I tend to choose option b and I 'm very disappointed about it.<br /><br />If you like to see stories like : " the story behind xy " , you should see " Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead " by Tom Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman . That 's really funny and no try to get more out of " Hamlet " then it has .
0 A dedicated fan to the TLK movies , with the first one being a milestone and the second probably the best sequel Disney has produced , along comes this film ... Now I 'm not arguing with animation , voice work , music , but this is no more than a Timon / Pumbaa screwloose in the TLK atmosphere . Although it is n't bad , it does n't add anything . Basically this movie is one big joke ... and that 's about all that saves it . Make a real TLK3 , Disney ! The potential is there.<br /><br />4/10
0 Having watched both the Lion King and Lion King II and enjoyed both thoroughly . I thought Lion King 1.5 might be worth watching . What a disappointment ! Disney must be getting desperate for revenues.<br /><br />Especially now that they lost the deal with pixar.<br /><br />Basically , they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editor 's floor ( or garbage can ) and glued them together to make a < br /><br />quick buck . Unlike LK I & II , both of which had strong story lines.<br /><br />This movie hardly has a story at all . While the characters and animation are always fun to look at , there is simply not enough material here for a movie . Some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk fillers on the original offerings.<br /><br />Disney - Shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick buck!<br /><br />Next time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work .
0 I found this to be an utter waste of time , effort and money . I know Disney always displays lack of creativity when making " straight - to - video " films - but rehashing the plot of the original film with a " new perspective " is an all - time low ... soon they 'll just be re - releasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a " new version of the movie we all love . " Nathan Lane surprisingly returns to his role of Timon yet again . Timon and Pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original " Lion King " embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it REALLY happened ... as they see it.<br /><br />Of course Timon is now the hero of the story , yadda yadda yadda , blah blah blah ... <br /><br />The musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap . The vocal talents are impressive for a video feature , but then again , when was the last time you remember Matthew Broderick , Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane being in anything of real commercial substance ? Overall if you liked the original you 'll hate this . It 's insulting because it 's unfair to children and adults alike . And that about sums it up .
0 There really was n't much of a story in this film . It loosely based itself off the events in the first Lion King movie . It is supposed to be how Timon and Pumbaa met via their aloneness . But there is n't much more than that.<br /><br />It mixes some scenes from the original , then it ab - libs about how this movie changed them a little bit . But still , is that it ? I was hoping for something a little more . Instead , all I have to show for it is an empty plot with little explanation.<br /><br />I guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the Lion King universe , then this is it . But other than that , it does little justice for the animators . Disney really should stop these direct - to - video productions . It really was quite boring and could have used Jason Statham . " D- "
0 I give this film it 's props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted . BUt I could n't get past the implausibility of the whole thing.<br /><br />First and foremost , a game built around the notion of " Russian Roulette " that has to fill on hour . the big problem is that if you are doing a " live " show , you run the possibility that your first contestant will be the one unlucky enough to draw the " real " bullet . Then what do you do ? You have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show . The corollary is that Okay , you get to the end and the first five contestants survive , which means number six has the bullet and ca n't possibly get the payout . He is n't going to shoot himself at that point , so it 's kind of anti - climatic . < br /><br />second problem , almost as big . Human nature . People are going to flinch , panic , soil their underwear and do things that would otherwise not make very good television . Too much randomness . That 's why " real " Reality television is actually tightly scripted and even more tightly edited.<br /><br />(The only random thing is the " performance artist 's " rant about female sacrifices , which were actually rare historically . Even that was predictable , since she went through with shooting herself to no effect . ) < br /><br />We are led to believe the shows ratings would increase while it was going on at 1 AM in the morning ( unlikely ) with the token Asian girl announcing each boost in ratings.<br /><br />A point on race and sex . Big surprise the movies two minority ( one gay ) and two female contestants are the ones who survive . So we are left with the two white males , and of course , the slightly less likable of them is the one who buys it . The purpose of such a show would be it 's randomness , but the guy you like the least is the guy who dies.<br /><br />the Climax is that after spending two hours fighting for televised suicide , the Eva Mendes character ( Mendes produced and starred in this thing , so she has no one to blame but herself ) actually grows a conscience when someone dies . What did she THINK was going to happen ? She is promptly shot by a bystander angry about the whole thing ( motives never explained ) and the show went on to be a big hit . Really ? < br /><br />the problem with media satire is that it has to either have some grounding in reality or it has to be so over the top to be ludicrous ( like Network ) . This is neither .
0 Live ! Yes , but not kicking.<br /><br />True story : Some time ago , a Dutch TV station made an announcement that they were going to air a new reality show . A contest rather . The main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure . For real.<br /><br />The country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd , saying it was appalling , immoral , what - is - this - world - coming - to , and the like . In a way , I had to agree.<br /><br />As the months passed , the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not , instead of running the country.<br /><br />The show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead . And up to the last moment the country was up in arms , the Prime Minister making speeches , every newspaper writing about it , everyone in the country holding their breaths . And the network pushed on . Towards a new frontier in television . And they definitely succeeded in doing just that . They pushed the envelope.<br /><br />The show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live , whilst she would die shortly after.<br /><br />And then , in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax . The woman was not ill , but all the candidates were . There was no kidney auction . The whole show , that , with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions , built up for months to a fantastic climax , was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major shortages in organ donors . The man who founded this particular network himself died of kidney disease.<br /><br />Now THIS is television . Leaving everybody far behind in amazement.<br /><br />Don't give me a poorly acted , poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a Russian Roulette show on American TV.<br /><br />As if.<br /><br />*Spoiler * As if I 'm going to believe they would get this through the FCC . As if I 'm going to believe this would get through the US Supreme Court on the basis of free expression . As if I 'm gon na believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on air.<br /><br />It 's all been done before . Watch Running Man with Arnold instead . At least it had a semi good ending.<br /><br />*Spoiler * This is an appallingly bad piece of film , together with a ridiculous ending . So she gets shot in the end , is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice ? Do n't take my word for it , but I would say this : leave this one alone and watch a test pattern instead , you 'll get more quality .
0 I really do n't understand all these positive user reviews . This movie is the worst movie I 've ever seen and I 'm not trying to be pessimistic.<br /><br />Eva Mendez is hot but terrible in this film . But I do n't think it is her own fault but the directors . He have somehow managed to make everything look artificial ; their acting , the idea , the make - up , everything.<br /><br />The star I 'm giving is only for the idea behind the movie , which was very bad executed.<br /><br />Don't watch this bullshit , go watch a Fellini , Woody Allen or some David Lynch .
0 I heard about this film and knew it was n't real good . But I started watching the film ( on my film - channel)and was interested . This could be a really great , darkly black satire on todays morals in media . The small featurettes on every contestent were good . It build up to something I would n't wanna miss . But when the so called show starts everything becomes implausible , cheap and rather silly . Here 's where the writer should have added something that would make people think . But instead it 's wrapped up and assuming people are this dumb.<br /><br />The ending is so bad I give it a 1 . Even if the film starts of promising .
0 Let 's see . In the " St. Elsewhere " finale we found out that there was no hospital and that every thing had been in the mind of an autistic child . " Newhart " ended by telling us that it had all been a dream . And " Roseanne " ended by telling us that it all had taken place in her mind . Very " creative " . Annoying was more like it . Yes , it was just a TV show and was n't at all reality . It 's just that when you get caught up in a great movie or TV show you end up at least wanting to believe that it 's all " real " . At least as far as the reality it portrays on screen . This type of series finale had been done twice before and was old hat , frustrating and simply not fun to watch . Now " Newhart " being all a dream ? At least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of anyone who loved the show . The idea itself was not too engaging but it was so brilliantly done that its arguably the Best Series Finale Ever . Roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan .
0 Blazing saddles ! It 's a fight between two estranged brothers ( Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard ) , both of whom can ignite fires mentally ; they square off over childhood differences , with dippy love - interest Debra Winger caught in the middle . Director Glenn Gordon Caron ( the TV whiz - kid behind " Moonlighting " ) smothers the darkly - textured comedy in Vince Gilligan 's screenplay with a presentation so slick , the movie resembles an entry from an over - enthusiastic film student on a fifteen million - dollar grant . It has the prickly energy of a big commercial feature , but a shapeless style which brings out nothing from the characters except their kooky eccentricities . These are n't even characters , they 're plot functions . Barely - released to theaters , the film is a disaster , although strictly as an example of style over substance it does look good . Winger is the only stand - out in a cast which looks truly perplexed . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 I love these actors , but they were wasted in this flick.<br /><br />I can only wonder , what WERE they thinking agreeing to this crap???<br /><br />Debra Winger just phoned it in ; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures . Some people thought it was deep . Well , if you liked " Breaking the Waves " , you 'll probably like this too . I hated both . 3/10
0 I ca n't believe they got the actors and actresses of that caliber to do this movie . That 's all I 've got to say - the movie speaks for itself ! !
0 Gene Hackman gets himself busted out of prison by a nameless government agency who want him for an assassination . It 's a given of course that Hackman has the proficient skills for the job.<br /><br />Nobody tells him anything though , he 's given as the audience is given bits and pieces of information . That 's supposed to be suspenseful , instead it 's annoying and boring . < br /><br />Hackman goes through with the mission , but the getaway is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders everybody dead to cover it up . So everyone in the cast dies and at the end you do n't really care.<br /><br />One of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long , almost three hours and got chopped down quite a bit . Maybe something really was lost in the translation , but I tend to think it was a mercy act on the audience.<br /><br />A very talented cast that had people like Richard Widmark , Candice Bergen , Mickey Rooney , Eli Wallach , and Edward Albert is so thoroughly wasted here it 's a crime . < br /><br />And we never do find out just what federal agency was doing all this , the FBI , the CIA , the DEA or even the IRS .
0 First , it takes a full half hour to get Hackman out of jail and to start doing the job . What a waste of time , we all know Hackman is getting out to do some job for his masters , why waste almost a third of the movie on these sequences . Then Hackman stays in a hotel and the story arc again goes nowhere , simply proving to us that Hackman is under close watch and anything he says or does is know by the masters . Again , another 20 minutes . Then more wasted time showing the reunion with his wife . All of this should have taken 10 - 15 minutes at most simply as a set - up for the real action , intrigue and plot twists . By the time the real action gets going , I was so bored that I just wanted the movie to end . Hackman is great as usual , and the other actors as well , but this is a dud of the first magnitude .
0 There are really two sections of this film . Firstly there 's the laughable prologue to the film which is so hysterical and cornball that it would almost feel appropriate that the ' The Simpsons ' Troy McClure should be doing the narration.<br /><br />Then the rest of the film begins ( starting off with a title song which really does n't fit in with the rest of the film ) which , while technically OK , is killed by a vague , inconsistent and unconvincing plot and not just uninteresting characters , but characters that make no sense.<br /><br />This is especially so with Mickey Rooney 's Spiventa , who was supposedly in on the plot and part of the ' organisation ' the whole time yet what would have happened had Hackman made the seemingly arbitrary decision to take him along when breaking out ? In that case he would 've been a totally superfluous and unnecessary character , which in the end he still is.<br /><br />The overall problem of the film is that it 's totally unwilling to put any detail on who or what is behind this conspiracy . It 's as if the filmmakers did n't have the courage to imply that a particular section of society would be capable of creating such an organisation and instead settled on the hope that a lack of explanation would suffice and the audience would form their own conclusions.<br /><br />Put simply , the film fails on all levels .
0 Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things : action and thrills . THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features Gene Hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task . Richard Widmark , Edward Albert , and Eli Wallach are his operatives --- they presumably work for the government , but that , like most of the movie 's plot line , is never made clear . Hackman asks a lot of questions that NEVER get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere . While it strives to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW , THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom . The film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it . Kramer 's direction is devoid of any style . It 's a very sunny movie!<br /><br />The acting is fine with Hackman proving he 's pretty much incapable of being bad . Widmark and Wallach are suitably nasty and Albert is well cast as Widmark 's cruel lackey . Even the usually obnoxious Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman 's sidekick . One oddity however is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman 's wife . We 're told she 's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang . Kramer 's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig . It 's a role better suited for the likes of Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell .
0 What did producer / director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy 's novel and Kennedy 's very puzzling screenplay ? Were there a few pieces left out on purpose ? And what about Gene Hackman , Richard Widmark , Edward Albert , Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney ? What did they see in this very muddled story?<br /><br />And why did Candice Bergen , who gave a horrible performance , accept such a thankless role?<br /><br />The Domino Principle wants to be on the same footing as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin . A major misfire by Stanley Kramer .
0 " The Domino Principle " is , without question , one of the worst thrillers ever made . Hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you 'll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream " I give up!!!" < br /><br />How Gene Hackman and director Stanley Kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecks.<br /><br />I hope they spent their money well .
0 This film is notable for three reasons.<br /><br />First , apparently capitalizing on the success of the two ' Superman ' serials , this low budget feature was made and released to theaters , marking George Reeves ' and Phyllis Coates ' initial appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane . Part of the opening is re - used in the series . Outside the town of Silby , a six - mile deep oil well penetrates the ' hollow Earth ' allowing the ' Mole - Men ' to come to the surface . Forget about the other holes ( those in the plot).<br /><br />Second , unlike most SF invasion films of the fifties , the hero plays a dominant ( and controlling ) force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes . No ' mild mannered reporter ' here ! Clark Kent , knowledgeable and self - assertive , grabs control of the situation throughout ( " I 'll handle this ! " ) , even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a Mole - Man ! As Superman , he is gentler than Clark towards the feisty Lois , but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as " Nazi storm troopers . " < br /><br />Third , you will notice that the transition from the Fleisher - like cartoon animated flying of Superman in the two serials to the ' live action ' flying in the ' Adventures of Superman ' had not yet been made .
0 " You 're not going to shoot those little creatures . In the first place , they have n't done you any harm . In the second place , they may be radioactive . " Ah , the joys of no - budget 50s sci - fi   Yet despite the odd gem like that , Superman and the Mole - Men is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58-minute running time . It 's beyond cheap ( the one shot of Superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation ) and pretty dull with it , though it has a surprisingly altruistic message  the mute Mole - Men , diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like Mr Mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters , released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious , merely misunderstood , and George Reeves ' Man of Steel tries to prevent the local small - town mob led by Jeff Corey from killing them . An interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day , perhaps , but with little more than good intentions to recommend it .
0 Back in the 1970s , WPIX ran " The Adventures of Superman " every weekday afternoon for quite a few years . Every once in a while , we 'd get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air " Superman and the Mole Men . " I always looked forward to those days . Watching it recently , I was surprised at just how bad it really was.<br /><br />It was n't bad because of the special effects , or lack thereof . True , George Reeves ' Superman costume was pretty bad , the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible . And true , the Mole Men 's costumes were even worse . What was supposed to be a furry covering would n't have fooled a ten year - old , since the zippers , sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious . But these were forgivable shortcomings.<br /><br />No , what made it bad were the contrived plot devices . Time and again , Superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating . A lynch mob is searching for the creatures ? Rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself , he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to Lois and the PR man . The creatures are cornered ? Again , he stands around watching and talking but does n't save them until they 're shot . Luke Benson , the town 's rabble - rouser , shoots at him ? Attempted murder to any reasonable person , but Superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems . Superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud , but never once took advantage of them.<br /><br />That said , both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well , seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles . If only they had been given a better script to work with .
0 I just got the UK 4-disc special edition of Superman 1 for about $ 5 . The additional stuff includes the 1951 feature Superman and the Mole - Men . So I slapped it into the DVD player last night , and here are my findings.<br /><br />Some initial disappointment - I had n't checked , and I think I had it mentally tagged as one of the Kirk Alyn serials . I 'm not a huge fan of George Reeves as Superman , and I had n't seen anything other than the odd clip of Kirk Alyn - but hey ho , never mind.<br /><br />This black and white production runs for less than an hour . It has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of Reeves ' early TV series , a two - parter , put together for cinema release , although IMDb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first TV series . In any event , it 's an odd choice for reasons I 'll get to later . I 'm of an age where I recall TV and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets , so there were no major surprises here . Even so , for a low budget movie , this one is REALLY low budget.<br /><br />The story concerns the small town of Silsby - population 1,430 - which , puzzlingly , is also home to the world 's deepest oil well ( 6 miles ) . The story opens with the well 's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down . This conflicts with the arrival of Metropolis reporters Kent and Lane to report on the well , at the behest of the oil company . As Clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down , a couple of odd little guys ( small in stature , big in head , black in jumpsuit , and bushy in eyebrow ) emerge from the capped - off drillshaft , and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces.<br /><br />A deep breath now , here is the remaining plot of the picture . The little guys scare some kids , so Jeff Corey ( playing the town 's rampant xenophobe ) incites some pals to kill these " creatures " . Superman steps in ( moderately ineffectually ) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital . Corey 's pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed , but he escapes and legs it down the shaft . Corey incites a lynch mob ( despite the sheriff arresting him ) to hang the hospitalised Mole - Man . Superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows . A total of 4 Mole - Men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at Jeff Corey ( I call this an Aargh ! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make Corey go " Aargh ! " ) and Superman saves him . He immediately changes his ways because of amazement at Superman saving him after the way he has behaved , the Mole - men go back down the shaft . The end.<br /><br />Despite the film only being an hour long , there is an inordinate amount of creeping around , bewareing and pursuing - I have left out all the " Mole - Man 1 creeps from A to B , looking out to make sure no - one is following him " stuff . The Mole - Men are never engaged in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they just turn up , get persecuted , and go back . They do look a little creepy , but they are hardly the bug - eyed monsters that the town 's reaction implies.<br /><br />Reeves is quite a good Clark Kent - very much a hard - nosed reporter , much more so than Phyllis Coates ' rather indifferent Lois Lane . But he is a terrible , terrible Superman . Not only does he not look the part ( at least his hair is dyed black in this , which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the TV episodes ) , the way he plays it is all wrong in my book . I 'm sure he was told to " strike the pose " ( which Superman does constantly ) , but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips , not fists on ribs . And he plays Superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - he does n't actually wag his finger in remonstration , but he may as well have done.<br /><br />And Superman does a huge amount of walking around ( I say a huge amount - he is n't actually in it all that much ) , and a bit of running . He takes off and lands a couple of times , but is n't seen in flight at any point . Oh , some bullets bounce off him , and he uses telescopic vision as Clark , but with no accompanying visual effect . In fact , visual effects are conspicuous by their absence , and the few which are present are n't very good.<br /><br />I've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time : but even by those standards I think it 's a pretty threadbare effort . Thankfully , production standards on the TV series were higher , and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them.<br /><br />Something of a disappointment - I sha n't be watching it again .
0 This movie was just plain bad . Just about every cop movie cliché is present and accounted for . Bad guy gets away ? check . Partner ? check . Wacky personality clash with partner ? check . Rookie with something to prove ? check . Rookie shows up grizzled veteran . check . About the only ones it did n't touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but I guess they 're saving those old chestnuts for Dooley 's next outing . Add in the battle of the sexes with Girl Power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like Dooley 's prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie . Avoid this one at all costs .
0 The Biggest one that bugs the hell out of me is that they say Zues takes DUTCH commands . But she is speaking German to him . The 2 languishes are completely different , its like saying " well he takes French commands " and start talking Spanish.<br /><br />James Belushi gives more the feeling of being a comedy actor not a detective in the slightest . The role just does n't fit him , even if its mend to be a comedy.<br /><br />To many stereotype / predicable stuff . Typical comment or comebacks.<br /><br />If you do n't look at those things i think it could be a nice movie to watch if its ever on TV . But i would n't suggesting renting it .
0 I am very disappointed with " K-911 . " The original " good " quality of " K-9 " does n't exist any more . This is more like a sitcom ! Some of casts from original movie returned and got some of my memory back . The captain of Dooley now loves to hit him like a scene from old comedy show . That was crazy . What 's the deal with the change of Police ? It seems like they are now LAPD ! Not San Diego PD . It is a completely different movie from "
0 The original was a good movie . I bought it on tape and have watched it several times . And though I know that sequels are not usually as good as the original I certainly was n't expecting such a bomb . The romance was flat , the sight gags old , the spoken humor just was n't . This may not have been the worst movie I 've ever seen but it comes close .
0 If you are one of the people who finds " According to Jim " great television comedy , this is going to rock your world . And might I add , kudos for proving that good talent , good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than ABC , which prefers to air crap like Jim Belushi 's show year after year.<br /><br />"K-911 " is a big , steaming , brown , German shepherd - sized " thank you " for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie . It 's exactly what fans of that film and the lesser Belushi deserve . Jim 's comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard . Look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee.<br /><br />If you enjoy Jim 's work , this movie is your reward .
0 I was expecting a little something from " K-911 " , I mean it did look like a cute movie that I could get into . I always did love the dog comedy movies . But it looked like it was supposed to be Jame 's movie , not Jerry Lee 's . The plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really did n't have chemistry to begin with . Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer was n't going in that direction . James just really ticked me off for more than half the film . The dogs were the true stars and that 's pretty sad that they out shined the actors.<br /><br />So , I 'm glad it 's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie . But hopefully , James will realize it was his brother Jim who was the talented one , no offense , but not everyone can be their star sibling . Do n't you wish Ashlee Simpson would take that same advice ? :D < br /><br />3/10
0 Extremely disappointing film based on the James Michener novel.<br /><br />What was even worse was Marlon Brando 's performance . His southern drawl was ridiculous . I found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost . Brando , so great in previous films , was reduced here to a laughing stock . Tyrone Power , in " Witness for the Prosecution , " should have been nominated for best actor instead of Brando here.<br /><br />The film , dealing with racism , dealt with the U.S. government 's attempt to avoid marriages between U.S. soldiers and Japanese women.<br /><br />Brando was stone - faced throughout the movie . His moving from anti - these relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an Asian woman . His emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views.<br /><br />Only the lord knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki received supporting Oscars for their performances . Nothing about either performance was equally impressive . Umeki 's appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part . A better performance in this film was done by Miiko Taka , who did nicely as Brando 's love interest . She showed great emotion as the anti - American who found love with the Brando character . Her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in World War 11 . She realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living.<br /><br />Martha Scott went from the Hebrew mother Yochobel in " The Ten Commandments " to the bigoted mother of Brando 's love interest at first . Her performance together with the one of Ricardo Montalban was wasted . Patricia Owens , as Brando 's first love , showed depth and conviction in her performance .
0 I did n't expect much from this TV movie . You have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any TBS movie starring Antonio Sabato Jr. Still , it managed to disappoint , failing even to be a good - bad film.<br /><br />Every scene was by rote , as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script , leaned back and said , " My work is done " . It 's all cliche , all predictable , and , even worse , the actors are forced to look like they 're taking it seriously , ( even when the plot developments are laughable).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor . Watch " The X - Files " if you 're in the mood for paranoia . They handle it better . Also , let anyone know that sitting through " Fatal Error " is just that .
0 This has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup , and the overall aftertaste is just as disgusting . < br /><br />Will be used in the 9th circle of Hell at recreation time . Just plain torture.<br /><br />I would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this appalling drivel again - ever . Horrible . Horrible . Horrible.<br /><br />You know , the good thing about Swiss Cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese : here it 's ONLY holes - and the excitement factor ? Well that turns watching paint dry into an adrenalin rush and an Olympic speed sport.<br /><br />My brain hurts from trying to work out who OK'd this drivel , did they think about the premise ? ( I sincerely hope not , otherwise there is no redemption ) the only consolation is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes . Made for TV should not be a synonym for : " Sure , let the horses bowels run loose across the living rooms ! Our audience are idiots!" < br /><br />I was hooked just to know how it could get any worse . This is not a good sign , folks . < br /><br />Hallmark should be ashamed for releasing it.<br /><br />I should be ashamed for watching it.<br /><br />I am ashamed . I 'm off for a long shower .
0 Robert Wagner is the evil boss of Digicron , a telecommunications company with a virus that kills people.<br /><br />'so you 're saying that the software virus has become a real virus that can kill people - that may be medically possible but not possible from my system ' < br /><br />'i'm having to write some new virus software of my own to trap it - it may take some time'<br /><br />'but it 's not going after software , it 's killing people'<br /><br />watch out for the ' i 'm into virology ' love moment and perhaps first ever film plot to feature death by braille keyboard
0 I rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable . Judge for yourself . Be warned , the following will not only give away the plot , but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie.<br /><br />A computer virus , designed by a frustrated nerd , sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors . When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye it can access the ' electrical system ' of your body . What it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium . Within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck , develops tunnel vision , his skin will turn white of the calcium , after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk . < br /><br />This virus is very intelligent . When it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device - operated by hands - the device is set on a very high voltage , which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert 's head . The virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM . Fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc 's in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water.<br /><br />Oh dear ...
0 I have read the novel Reaper of Ben Mezrich a fews years ago and last night I accidentally came to see this adaption.<br /><br />Although it 's been years since I read the story the first time , the differences between the novel and the movie are humongous . Very important elements , which made the whole thing plausible are just written out or changed to bad.<br /><br />If the plot sounds interesting to you : go and get the novel . Its much , much , much better.<br /><br />Still 4 out of 10 since it was hard to stop watching because of the great basic plot by Ben Mezrich .
0 Like so many media experiments , this amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary . In the 5 + years since it was released , the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development , and I found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason , I imagine ... The director clearly is a fan of Hitchcock , and it 's too bad that the film was not better executed , but in fact , it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction , including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention . One can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing page.<br /><br />I have to admit I found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more . Sometimes the slick has less to offer us , and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for education purposes . Oh yes -- and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot , my heart rate went up , and I was reluctant to get up and take a break .
0 Despite its stereotypes , virtually ' no - name ' cast and an obviously low budget I thought this film was alright ; much better than I expected it to be . I was skeptical at first - the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me . But in the end , I thought the film handled the concept well ( even if some scenes were a little clichéd).<br /><br />The cast was quite good , and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously . I could n't help thinking , though , that Janine Turner is a bit of a Geena Davis look - a - like . Maybe it 's just her face or the make - up , hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time.<br /><br />While it 's not a ' must see ' or a great film by any standard , ' Fatal Error ' is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end .
0 Actually , this flick , made in 1999 , has pretty good production values . The actors are attractive , and reasonably talented . There are n't a bunch of clowns running around blasting away , expending hundreds of rounds , but never hitting flesh . Nor are there wild car chases / crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed.<br /><br />The interiors look respectably modern , architecturally , and the equipment looks up to snuff . Well , there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a ' 50s electronics lab . And the pancake make - up on the corpses cracked me up . Not pancake make - up in the conventional sense , but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin . This is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student ( viewer).<br /><br />Ah yes , the virus . I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci - fi , horror flick I know of , but I ca n't . A computer virus that is transmitted via a television ( or computer monitor ) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen ? Gimme a break . Warp drives a la " Star Trek " are one thing , but photons becoming viruses ? This is so silly the desired " fright factor " just is n't realizable . The flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive , or have a cat jump out of the closet , or something , because the viral thingamajig is n't doing it . < br /><br />One presumes Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later , trashy venues . He needed the money . No other comparison between the two should be construed , however .
0 In some ways , the concept behind the storyline was a rather interesting blend of several typical movie types in an interesting combination . However , no point in this movie was so obvious that it did not deserve lingering close - up shots . I felt as though I had been beat over the head with the so - called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people.<br /><br />The writer appears to have simply lifted clichés from other movies as a substitute for writing lines adapted to actual characters . The actors did not help matters . No chemistry . I guess they were supposed to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories . However , the writers did n't work very hard to develop the chemistry . Sure , they 're both attractive , but whether they 're attractive to each other seemed to be an open question.<br /><br />The confidence Turner 's character shows in Sabato 's developed far too quickly and for no particular reason . Sabato 's character is supposed to be a discredited doctor who just ca n't seem to play by the rules . Think of the Jeff Goldblum character in " Independence Day . " Usually , that kind of character is supposed to demonstrate some kind of talent or brilliance . Sabato 's character does not . He 's Cassandra with just the crazy and all the prophetic skills of a magic eight ball . He appears to be right by random chance.<br /><br />The death scenes are comical . Every actor was really trying more than a little to hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on them . The symptoms looked like bad claymation , sort of like that video from the 80s , Peter Gabriel , I think .
0 OK , the movie is good but I give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale . This kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron 's paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus . First of all , strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus . An organic virus is much more complex , even though it 's way tinier . Though , it 's considered one of the simplest forms in the universe , organic virus 's attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the RNA , then change your own RNA code . Explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor ? Maybe the radiation has some effect on the user 's cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses ? I could see that , but obviously , the writer did n't think of that .
0 I 've just lost 2 hours of my life watching this mindless plot . I could make a better movie with my cellphone camera . How do they manage to get actors to play in those movies ? ? Porn movies have better scenarios and effects ... I wish I had those 2 hours back ... <br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is the cast . Even though , their acting skills in this one could not lift this movie to passable , the rest was just WAY too bad ! < br /><br />It 's the type of movie that I 'd recommend using to torture prisoners into scaring them straight.<br /><br />Even worse , I saw a translated version of this flick ... Imagine , a bad movie ... with an even worst translation ... Yikes !
0 A somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the TBS cable station . Antonio and Janine run around chasing a killer computer virus and ... that 's about it . For trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life ' Melissa ' virus also made it 's debut in e - mail inboxes across the world .
0 When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co - stars , you expect to find a well done horror movie , but this was actually quite different , representing as it did what I would describe as an early effort at science fiction . Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists ( Rukh and Benet respectively ) - competitors to an extent , until Rukh wins Benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory . The science here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges ( thus science fiction , with the emphasis on the fiction ) but somehow Rukh harnesses some sort of ray from Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth " several thousand million years ago . " In that pre historic time , a huge meteorite slammed into Africa , leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call " Radium X " - which can heal and destroy . A large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in Africa , on a search for the meteorite deposits , which Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon , unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well.<br /><br />Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here . Lugosi pulls off a role in which he 's the good guy pretty well , although I frankly found him a bit unconvincing - especially during the scenes set in Africa . The story also plodded along a bit , and while it held my attention it did n't captivate me . Given that this is really a sci - fi rather than a horror flick , and that sci - fi was in its very early stages , I suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack . It was OK - nothing more , but also nothing less than that . 4/10
0 Unless you are already familiar with the pop stars who star in this film , save yourself the time and stop reading this review after you 've reached the end of the next sentence.<br /><br />FORGET YOU EVER STUMBLED UPON THIS FILM AND GO WATCH SOMETHING ELSE.<br /><br />But if you insist on reading , consider : < br /><br />Lame vehicle for Japanese teen idol pretty - boys featuring nonsensical , convoluted " plot " that drags out for an insufferable amount of time until you 're ready to scream.<br /><br />Nothing in this film makes sense . It 's an endless series of people expressing various emotions , from joy to anger , from happiness to tragedy , FOR NO GOOD REASON . We can obviously see something incredibly " dramatic " is happening , but we just do n't GIVE A CRAP WHY 'cause there 's no backstory.<br /><br />By the time this film is over , you will be sick and tired of these stupid , lanky , girly stars ' faces . You 'll be revolted at having spent all this time watching them smile , sneer , cry , look mysterious , be " serious , " and any other pointless expression they slap on their faces.<br /><br />That some moron would ever go so far as to refer to this piece of insipid trash as being the " soul " of any of its " actors " should prove to you beyond the shadow of a doubt what the trailer and countless adoring comments on this site will not tell you : < br /><br />Only the " converted , " mindless minions will like this film , the majority of them teenage girls with a pathological adoration for anything androgynous . Freud would have a field day.<br /><br />Unless you 're one of these mindless " fans , " stay the hell away from this abomination .
0 I was n't sure how to rate this movie , since it was so bad it was actually very funny . I 'm not a Gackt fan by any means , though he is talented , despite the weird pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball . I always thought Hyde was talented though , Faith is an interesting album.<br /><br />But on topic here folks . This movie is ridiculous . It 's so over the top and nonsensical it 's almost like a parody of supernatural action films.<br /><br />The movie has almost no plot here , except it 's just about vampires with gangster friends . In a way , this film almost reminded me of Spider - Man 3 , with how there were too many ideas , which resulted in not enough time to pay attention on one of them.<br /><br />The action scenes were laughable . Quickly edited , almost hard to understand , with choreography that 's so laughably bad . Though Hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes , but that 's this film 's only such redemption . I 'm a sucker for good action movies , but the action was horribly done . Though the final shootout was OK and the highlight of this otherwise depressing movie.<br /><br />It keeps jumping between genres , not a good thing . It wants to be a drama , or an action flick , or a horror , or a romance ... what the hell.<br /><br />If this review is making you mad , why ? Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love ? Do n't fool yourself , this MOVIE IS BAD .
0 Thanks to the BBC for this show . I used to suffer from an inferiority complex , I hated leaving the house , talking to new people and I had an overwhelming sense that people hated me . However after watching one episode of 4 Non Blondes my fortunes started to change . After episode 2 I started applying for new jobs , wearing fashionable clothes and I actually felt talented . When the series had finished I was running the sales department at work , banging a plethora of women and frequently won the karaoke competition down my local . If you ever have a confidence crisis and do n't know where to turn then take a trip down to Poundland and pick up the DVD it 's only 99p .
0 Picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says " lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public ( also black ) in the street and ask him if he is black , then walk away " . The other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode . More laughter . Now if you think the premise is funny , and the show contains many such types of situation , you will enjoy this show . For the rest , use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry . Those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny . Another example of the humor in the show , a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier . Marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers ? I could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers , divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all .
0 Here is what happened:<br /><br />1 ) Head of BBC3 needs to make programmes aimed at different audience to BBC1 and BBC2 to keep licence and job.<br /><br />2 ) Lenny Henry offers his unfunny friends up.<br /><br />3 ) Head of BBC3 snaps them up , completely ignoring the fact that they are not funny.<br /><br />Worst of all , it is arguably racist , as all the characters play up to bad stereotypes . If a white person did this kind of thing , there 'd be uproar!<br /><br />Trash .
0 five minutes after watching this i logged on to IMDb to warn all of you out there not to bother with this movie ... genre : horror ? it had moments of mild suspense and throughout the whole movie i was thinking to myself " somethings got ta happen soon " it did not ... when the movie ended i felt so embarrassed for the writer / director i 've never been the biggest fan of patrick rea this guy just does not know how to make movies and after watching this sorry excuse of a horror flick i 've gone from not been the biggest fan to will not watch another of his works .. <br /><br />i was taken in by the plot summary please do n't make the same mistake.<br /><br />i gave this movie a 2 for the actors .. they were not bad and it was n't there fault they got such bad direction ...
0 A film with very little positive to say for it.<br /><br />Firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama.<br /><br />Besides being remarkably slow The Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again . I lost count of how many times I had seen " that " field at night or that bit of cracked earth.<br /><br />It also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience do n't know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused . So with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it 's fine . We find Jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre . Beth has a key to a warehouse of books ? There are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie , much later , in fact too late.<br /><br />And on the point of the acre . Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary  and also if they 're meant to be an acre big then make them so.<br /><br />There is also a frightening lack of reasonability as Beth ( the best performer in the piece , followed by Jefferson  the cop ) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on " medication".<br /><br />With the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child ( did he crawl out of the window ? He 's six months old ) the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene . Bad plinky plonk " horror " music fails to add atmosphere.<br /><br />Often bad films can be amusing but not The Empty Acre , which is just bad .
0 as an inspiring director myself , this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind . Shot with low end digital camera probably with 35 mm adapter for DOF . The editing is good acting decent , sound effects are n't too over the top . I would have give it a 7 for an indie film , but the story are n't that interesting . It 's more on the drama side , character developments than a horror flick.<br /><br />It 's not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out , or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy.<br /><br />honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50's < br /><br />This movie is about a family who has a dry field , and that is just that .
0 I saw this film on its release , and have watched it 3 or 4 more times , including last week . I regret I have to be a voice of dissension with regard to Mr. Branagh 's performance.<br /><br />This is really a glorious , sumptuous film , to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long - beautifully shot and designed . Derek Jacobi , Julie Christie , Kate Winslet , Richard Briers , and many others do fine jobs . Then there 's Kenneth Branagh . If ever there was a vanity project for an actor , this is it , and Mr. Branagh spares nothing in putting the " ham " in Hamlet . From the stunt casting ( which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast Jack Lemmon ) , to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of " naturalness , " to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others . His performance confirms that , while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary , he has never been a great film actor . The scenery budget could be charged to catering , Mr. Branagh eats so much of it . His performance is a perfect example of why people do n't go to see Shakespeare - " full of sound and fury , signifying nothing . " And if there is fault to his direction , it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance.<br /><br />No matter what theories people may posit on the Bard , he was , after all is said and done , a playwright . The brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless . Although there is no " right " way to play his plays , there is most certainly great acting , good acting and bad acting . Shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of " Hamlet " itself . It amazes me how Mr. Branagh " mouthed " it , but did not hear it . It was an example of spending too much time working out how he 's going to say something , and too little figuring out WHAT he 's saying.<br /><br />While Mr. Branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions , he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it . His direction has always been better than his acting . I still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming Shakespeare . He set a great template for other productions . And , it would be interesting to see him onstage , from about 20 rows back . But , I do hope he chooses to direct more and act less.<br /><br />Is it worth seeing ? Certainly . There are many little joys to be found in the film . But , it 's a long , long movie and , by the end , one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it .
0 This ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of " Hamlet " to ever reach the screen . Branagh 's approach to the material can only be described as vulgar ; going to such lengths as depicting Ophelia in a straight jacket , having Fortinbras ' army appear suddenly on the horizon ( looking very much like the climax of " Monty Python and the Holy Grail " ) when the palace is apparently guarded only by Francisco ( who shouts the very un - Shakespearean cry of " ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack " before being gunned down ) , and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of Jimmy Cagney 's Bottom and Mary Pickford 's Kate.<br /><br />Branagh chose to set his film in an Edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text , so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in Elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed . And Branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of Hamlet and Olphelia 's relationship , treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window.<br /><br />The uncut text does allow Branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime : more footage of Kenneth Branagh . This is never so apparent as in the " How All Occasions Inform Against Me " speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film ( at least that 's how it feels ) , which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of Gone With The Wind 's " I 'll never be hungry again . " This may serve Branagh 's ego , but it does not serve Shakespeare or the speech : when I saw the film in the theater , I leaned over to my companion and snickered " Great Moments With Mr. Hamlet . " Branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last , when he attempts to out - do the Olivier film and its justly celebrated death of Claudius by having Hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch , impaling him with a sword . Branagh 's Dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through Claudius ' heart with a super hero 's bulls eye . The only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off - the - wall funny.<br /><br />While this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy , it is in fact nothing but a star - studded display of a once - talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism . The Emperor has no clothes , and this Hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man 's ego out of control .
0 Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals , this movie is not for everyone.<br /><br />The story is very similar to other movies , in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age , and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family . She does that by choosing some kind of sport , and with the help of a local boy , that for some reason falls in love with her , she confronts her problems and wins.<br /><br />In Girlfight it 's boxing , in Bend it like Beckham it 's soccer , and now it 's Kung Fu.<br /><br />But Fighter is much inferior product than these two , it was simply embarrassing to watch it . Semra Turan , the " actress " that playing the role of a teenage girl , maybe can do a lot of things , but one thing she ca n't do is to act . Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy , the dramatic situations , in which she tries to show some emotions , are dreadful , her body and facial language are of amateur actress , badly instructed by the director . The rest of the cast is a little better , but they just can not save this cliché movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot . Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer.<br /><br />Even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this , it 's just so boring . The slow motion was really unnecessary , the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration , and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions , not actually fighting . Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys , and knocks them off their feet . < br /><br />The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it 's European . It 's very easy to publicize this movie - A first martial arts film from Denmark , but do n't be fooled , it 's not . It 's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems , which are , by the way , not really convincing.<br /><br />Bad movie with embarrassing lines , acting and story .
0 I watched this show and i simply did n't find it funny at all . It might have been the first episode . Lately i realize ABC is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is going down as a station . All the characters on this show are pretty bad actors , but even if they were good the jokes and script are pretty horrible and would still bring the show down . I would say that I believe this show will be cancelled , but seeing as how ABC is doing pretty horrible for quality of shows they are playing , they might just keep this one simply because it 's average compared to them .
0 Outside of the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious jerk , his show is terrible.<br /><br />Nothing about Lopez has ever been funny . I have watched his stand - up and have never uttered any resemblance to a laugh.<br /><br />His stuff comes across as vindictive and his animosity towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his body.<br /><br />I have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them.<br /><br />This guy has a grudge that wo n't end.<br /><br />I feel bad for Hispanics who have only this show to represent themselves.<br /><br />The shows plots are always cookie cutter with an Hispanic accent.<br /><br />Canned laugh at the dumbest comments and scenes.<br /><br />Might be why this show is always on at 2AM in replay .
0 This show was absolutely terrible . For one George is n't funny , and his kids are snobby little brats . He also treats his mother with no respect . As a Hispanic , I am highly offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed.<br /><br />Plus the dysfunctional family thing 's been done to death . For once , I want to see something original . What makes this show funny when other shows have done it millions of times ? I thought ABC would come to its senses and pull this piece of garbage off the air , but sadly , we 're going to have to stomach this until they " jump the shark".<br /><br />In my opinion , they already did .
0 This show is awful . How is George wanting the death of his mother funny ? This show is terrible . The parents are obviously horrible and the children should be taken to child services . The daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat . George is n't funny , especially when he speaks his loud and obnoxious brand of Spanglish . Ernie is a loser , but at least I 've chuckled at him a few times , but mainly at how pathetic he is . George 's mother , Benny , in an awful , despicable character . Sure , her husband left her , but how anyone can laugh at the way she treated George as a baby is beyond me.<br /><br />Can someone explain to me how George 's head being big is funny ? It 's not even that big ! I 've moved on from characters because they 're too awful and it would take hours for me to write and I , frankly , do n't care enough . I do care enough to tell anyone looking at this and wondering whether or not they want to watch this show , that this show is an abysmal excuse for a sitcom , and is not worth your time.<br /><br />I give it 2 starts , because the wife is extremely attractive .
0 Seriously , I mean very seriously , when I first started watching the show I thought it was good . But the plots just got worse . The storyline were either too boring or predictable . George is n't always funny , he sometimes acts stupid . His jokes are overdone . His mom is the silliest character of the show . How can a mother treat her own son that way , okay if it was the daughter in law , but this was her own son . I give this show a 4/10 just because the first few shows were a little funny . The actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a great job . Do n't know how these shows get to play for so long . < br /><br />If you 're really bored like I was and have nothing else to watch , I 'd suggest you watch this .
0 What has Ireland ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way ? This movie begins like a primer for film students on Irish cinematic cliches : unctuous priests , spitting before handshakes , town square cattle marts , cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music . Quickly , however , it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big Daddy - O of Irish Cliches - religous strife . It concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her Catholic - fathered child is educated , which would seem like a reasonable enough wish , though not to the ' 50 's County Wexford villagers she has to live with . Rather than send them to a Catholic school , she decides to up and leave for Belfast , then Scotland , where a few more cliches are reguritated . While she 's there , her father ( who looks eerily like George Lucas ) and family back home are subjected to a boycott , which turns very nasty . I 'm not going to give away the ending , not because I think people should go see this movie , but because it 's not very interesting . One of the problems with the film is the central character : we 're supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life . The villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to , but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it . In addition , it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current Northern Ireland peace process : the woman is told by her lawyer that she " must lay down preconditions " for her return . The film is allegedly based on a true story but it 's themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively , and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches , in the past .
0 I can not believe such slanted , jingoistic material is getting passed off to Americans as art house material . Early on , from such telling lines like " we want to make sure they are playing for the right team " and manipulative framing and lighting , A Love Divided shows it 's true face . The crass manner in which the Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic , the Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden , is as poor a representation of history as early US westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians . The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the Irish Catholics in the story ; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves ! It is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it 's obvious intent , so far from attempting art . This film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library .
0 I remember I saw this cartoon when I was 6 or 7 . My grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall . I remember that it really sucked . The plot had no sense . I hated the fox that became Casper 's friend . He was so stupid ! Casper cried his head off if he could n't find a friend . So what ? Get over it ! The only good part and I do n't want to sound mean - spirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end . I laughed my head off in payback because this cartoon sucked so much . The bad news is the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost . I wish he had stayed dead . I think I even gave the video of this to somebody because I hated it . No wonder they were offering it for free at the mall . If you have a child do n't let them watch this . They will probably agree with me that it sucks .
0 John Candy . Need we say more ? He is the main reason you should see this film . Most people do n't realize how gifted he was as an actor . Witness him changing from poor slob to horny jerk . Just a simple(subtle ) facial change and off we go . There are many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits . The best moments for me are the KUNG FU U scenes as well as the great moment when John(in a trance ) goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend - that is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend . I 'm sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude . It is , but it is also very funny mainly because it is John Candy doing this bit . The story in general is pretty lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty(both SCTV alumni with Candy ) are not given enough to do in the film . Levy has his moments , especially filming the wedding at the end(think Rod Serling ) and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone . Overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid . I give this one 4 out of 10 .
0 This movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny . When I saw this film , I saw it for John Candy and assumed , incorrectly , that it would be hilarious . Instead , there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat , unfunny moments . And , to top it off , Candy delivered some of the crudest lines I had ever heard up to that time . So , despite a potentially funny cast and story idea , we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult , though teens will probably find a few laughs . It 's really a shame -- it could have been so much better . I mean , with Eugene Levy , Joe Flaherty and John Candy it SHOULD have been wonderful .
0 No , not the administration of GWB , the Decider / Strutter / Smirker -- but the mini - series " Monarch Cove . " Lifetime must have realized what a dog this was because the series was burned off two episodes at a time , most of them broadcast between 11 p.m. Friday nights and 1 a.m. Saturday mornings . As to why I watched the whole thing , I can only plead to weekly sudden convulsive attacks of masochism.<br /><br />Most of the cast are unknowns who are likely to remain unknown . The only two recognizable names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward , who turn in the only decent performances ( Jones does n't make it through the entire series -- lucky woman ) . Ward , by the way , is aging quite well since her " Thorn Birds " days.<br /><br />The one main thread to the plot -- who murdered the father of the heroine who is wrongly convicted of Dad 's murder but is freed after six years in the slammer -- is stretched out for so long and concluded so hastily that you wo n't especially care who dun it . There is a great deal of " steamy " sex , several murders , and all sorts of rude behavior -- virtually none of which is either interesting or credible . Most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented . The writing and direction is on a par with the cast.<br /><br />If you stick around to the end , the post card is a ( very minor)hoot.<br /><br />CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED !
0 This movie is not as good as all the movies of Christ I 've ever seen . And I 'm quite amazed that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus , when the Scriptures ( as well the other movies ) state differently . It lacks also a very important issue : The Resurrection .. None of the other movies skip this very important part : the faith of all of us Christians lies in this very event . As Paul says in one of his letters " If Christ did not rise from the dead , our faith is vain " . A very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem . < br /><br />Finally , and in opposition to my Jewish co - commentator , Jesus WAS NOT a myth . And as a matter of fact , he was also a JEW . There are plenty of documents ( relgious and secular ) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man(or should I said , God become a man ) that indeed changed mankind . I strongly advise him(given he is a historian ) to read about Flavius Josephus , the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st . Century .
0 Although the director tried(the filming was made in Tynisia and Morocco),this attempt to transport the New Testament in the screen failed . The script has serious inaccuracies and fantasies , while the duration is very long . But the most tragic is the protagonist Chris Sarandon , who does n't seem to understand the demands of his role .
0 The stranger Jack ( Matthew Lillard ) arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques Max ( Vincent D'Onofrio ) and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons Jamie ( Valeria Golino ) that he is Jack 's brother . Jamie does not buy his story , dominates Jack and ties him up to a chair . When Max arrives , Jack proposes US$ 100,000.00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques " Spanish Judges " with a wealthy and dangerous collector . Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece ( Mark Boone Junior ) , who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from Mars , to compose the backup team . However , Jack double - crosses the collector and then he intrigues Jack , Jamie and Piece.<br /><br />The low budget " Spanish Judges " is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast . Valeria Golino is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor Vincent D'Onofrio , they are not able to save the stupid story . Further , the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work , and actually they are silly and not funny . My vote is three.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Tudo Por Dinheiro " ( " All For Money " )
0 The major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast in a professional production of Macbeth . Hearing David Lansbury 's soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous " Tomorrow , Tomorrow , and Tomorrow " speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role . I kept believing therefore that he did n't get the part because he was a lousy actor ; not because a bigger name was available . Then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly miscast , misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations . Sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done ( and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works)that they settle for less . This appears to be such an example .
0 I agree with most of the Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format . Columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods . This movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past . And that is the disturbing point , because Columbo is no ordinary detective.<br /><br />There are two parts in this film that left me intriguing . First , I ca n't figure out the title of this movie . It is misleading . Maybe a better title would 've been " The Vanishing Bride " or something similar . Second , Columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason ( to the viewers at least ) why he does it.<br /><br />I do n't feel betrayed , just disappointed . I 'm glad Peter Falk went back to the usual Columbo.<br /><br / >
0 LL Cool J performed much better in this movie that I expected ! He did a fabulous job acting as a " renegade " cop within a " renegade " department . From the very beginning , he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament he 's in . He acts as a sort of " gentle giant " -- a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody , yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start -- and he does an amazing job . He was quite clearly the best character in the movie.<br /><br />This was certainly a performance that will not win Morgan Freeman any awards . After starring in powerhouse films like the Shawshank Redemption this film was certainly a step down . His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor -- and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner . There are so many ways his character ( Moses Ashford ) could have taken a more pivotal role . That he did n't was disappointing and a true let - down . I was hoping to see more from him in this film.<br /><br />Timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry . His portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive . This movie is a typical action movie that ( at least initially ) bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs LA has experienced in the past . Being an action movie , it has its share of shoot - em - up scenes , blood , and guts . These scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable . Watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end -- think of what you would typically expect in a good - cops / bad - cops conflict -- and it bears little resemblance to a REAL police shoot - out.<br /><br />What irked me most was the way Timberlake 's character behaved during shoot - out scenes . He starts out having guns and not using them . Then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if he 's been firing a gun his whole life . Then he runs out of bullets and does n't have a gun -- and 30 seconds later , without moving or anything -- suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns AND extra ammo ? ! Little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me.<br /><br />If what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay , then you 'll probably love this movie . Personally , it does n't matter to me what KIND of movie it is as long as it is realistic . Make me believe that the story is true . This story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that I came away feeling unsatisfied .
0 Beginning with the poster ( featuring only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey ) , the entire movie was a fraud . One stereotype after another , this movie was about nothing - or nothing new , at least . After 10 - 15 minutes , you realize that you 've just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J recite their way through another cop - flick.<br /><br />Basically , the story is about the corrupt system in some city , all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town , under the watchful eye of some hot - shot politician . The almighty and above - the - law organization is called FRAT and guess what ? they 've got a kick - ass loony cop shooting and beating at will - suspects , girlfriends , you name it . FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy , so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented ( ! ! ! ) journalist . One hour later , after a series of unbelievably bad - made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines , everything ends happily and we get served the final line : you ca n't beat the system . Bah ! Do n't see this waste of film roll . Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 min altogether !
0 The movie started off strong , LL Cool J ( Deed ) as an undercover police officer , with partner Sgt . Lazerov ( Dylan McDermott from the Practice , possibly miscast as a bad guy ? ) committing robbery and murder . Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer , which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience . The other big names ( Freeman , Spacey et al ) are well cast and the movie shows promise.<br /><br />The movie begins to fall short as soon as Justin Timberlake ( Pollack ) is introduced . Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly , or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of Timberlake , I would choose the former . Even talented actors have to work hard at their craft ; Timberlake is NOT talented and no amount of hard work can save him . I would have thought he would put on a better show , given the fact that he has been acting talented for years . Everything he did in this film was unconvincing.<br /><br />Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums , it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films . Even hardcore N'Sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent.<br /><br />That aside there are a few plot holes , such as Pollack 's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery . This movie had so much promise . Thoroughly disappointing .
0 Lets enter the world of this movie for a second , so you can better understand the type of movie we are dealing with here.<br /><br />Edison is one of those really stupid movies where the bad guy and his goons have been letting loose 50,000 bullets shooting at the good guy behind walls and pillars , shouting at them , and then finally get to the good guy face to face and instead of killing him ...... instead of wasting this guy that has caused you SO MUCH grief .... instead of just walking up and POP! ..... What do you do ? The bad guy ..... he talks to him . He grabs the good guy and talks to him while holding his gun . THEY HAVE NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT ! SHOOT HIM ! SHOOT HIM NOW ! But he talks to him anyway . Oh another thing . At the end , a newspaper says " PULITZER PRIZE WINNER STORY RIGHT HERE " or something right above on a front page of a paper , when its like the first time the story is printed . So how in the heezy did someone win a Pulitzer for it that fast ? Yea , you know those types of stupid movies ? Yea well that 's Edison in a nutshell.<br /><br />You get Mr cool Morgan Freeman and shifty eyed tough Kevin Spacey who both phone in their roles completely , LL Cool J who scowls literally every single moment of the movie , while proposing to his girlfriend in a damn night club of all places , and who 's last line " Duck " was something from like a lethal weapon movie that was never made ... and Justin Timberlake whining and spewing nonsense every time he talks , little cocky bastard . The only bright spot was a crazy Dylan McDermott doing his best " Denzel from Training Day " impression , which was pretty entertaining.<br /><br />Oh yea so what s the movie about ? Eh , something about scandals involving the city Edison 's fictional special unit police force called " F.R.A.T. ( I swear I 'm not making this stuff up ) which was supposed to be a obvious play off of S.W.A.T. Anyway little journalistic super singer boy Justin Timberflake smells something foul afoot after a murder involving 2 undercover cops from FRAT , and he goes scurrying off looking for a story , gaining his boss ' ( Freeman ) trust along the way while they both unravel something even bigger and sinister than what they both thought . blah blah blah . Its like a bootleg pelican brief meets a halfassed training day . The pacing was slow and off , the script was horrible , and the acting was extremely uninspired . It jumped everywhere without going anywhere . People get put in comas and you forget about them . Everyone in this movie just did n't THINK . Damn what a stupid movie . Its becoming harder to write any sort of review for it because the movie left my brain the second it ended ... No lie Basically , do NOT waste your time !
0 Honestly before I watched this movie , I had heard many people said this movie was a disgrace . I did not believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey have taken roles in this movie , and watched it by my own . Apparently they were right . I was really disappointed and wondering all the time during the movie - why the hell did I watch this movie.<br /><br />Of course I was not expecting much from Justin as he really does not belong in the movie / theater business . But Morgan and Kevin ? I could not stop asking myself why the heck they agreed to take part in Edison . To be honest , their roles are rather stupid.<br /><br />Well you might think if the players suck , then I should pay more attention to the story . It is indeed story is the core of a movie , but guys ... trust me ... this is not a movie you want to give a credit for its story . Imagine this , a smart - ass journalist ( Justin Timberlake ) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learning how to become a ' real ' journalist from his boss ( Morgan Freeman ) . This all was supported by one agent who still has heart for justice ( LL Cool J ) and an brilliant investigator ( Kevin Spacey ) . At the end , they beat the system with a happy ending story.<br /><br />Jeez , I could not even carry on with this . Just recalling the movie is making me sick already . My advise guys , do n't watch this ! Please save your money and time for another movie .
0 There is an excellent reason Edison went straight to video : it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud . The movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring . Just a notch above lowbrow ( thanks to Freeman and Spacey , who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films ) , the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non - existent as Justin Timberlake 's acting . I hate to knock the guy , but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte , the better.<br /><br />The movie is n't all bad ... just mostly . I like the fact that LL Cool J was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man . He deserves it . And , unlike his fellow musician and co - star , he can act . Kevin Spacey is almost always enjoyable as well ( you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery ) , and Freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars ( out of ten ... he 's not THAT good).<br /><br />When all is said and done , the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo - action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake . It also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters . All in all , t 's just plain boring . That being said , rent this when you are suffering from insomnia .
0 Oh dear god . This was horrible . There is bad , then there was this . This movie makes no sense at all . It runs all over the map and is n't clear about what its saying at all . The music seemed like it was trying to be like Batman . The fact that ' Edison ' is n't a real city , takes away . Since I live in Vancouver , watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable . Why did n't they make it a real city ? The only writing that was decent was'Tilman ' in which John Heard did a fantastic job . He was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy . It was actually a shame to see John Heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time , and the movie be a washout . Too bad . Hopefully someone important will see it , and at least give John Heard credit where credit is due , and hire him as lead bad guy again , which is where he should be . on the A List .
0 The movie itself is not too bad ; many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script , but it is watchable . What really gives me the creeps though is that people like Justin Timberlake even get cast for movies , and on top of that for movies like this one . I have to admit I had never heard the man 's name before watching this , but the very instant he appeared I was just plain annoyed . The voice is crap , the face is a bad rip - off of Legolas , the posture is horrible , and he can not even properly coordinate all three of them . Said to say , I was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco , because I was hoping from then on it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only . Too bad I was wrong . These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance , and they are the main reason I give this a 4 . < br /><br />I see many upcoming movies with the little Timberlake cast ... and can not believe it .
0 Pathetic ... worse than a bad made - for - TV movie . I ca n't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick . For some reason Morgan Freeman 's character is constantly talking about and saying " pussy " when referring to NSync boy 's girlfriend . Morgan Freeman calling women " pussy " is just awkward ... What the hell were the people behind this film thinking ? Too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting , confusing camera angles , a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable.<br /><br />I rented this flop with low expectations .... but ... well ... it really sucked .
0 Timberlake 's performance almost made attack the screen . It was n't all bad , I just think the reporters role was wrong for him.<br /><br />LL Cool J played the typical rapper role , toughest , baddest guy around . I do n't think the cracked a smile in the whole movie , not even when proposed to his girlfriend.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman pretty much carried the whole movie . He was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was n't good or bad he was just " there".<br /><br />Overall it 's a Dull movie . bad plot . a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors .
0 If you watched this movie you know why I said " Jesus , Jesus , Jesus " . Hehehe ! ! ! Every time they said " Jesus , Jesus , Jesus " ... I laughed thinking " Jesus , Jesus , Jesus , why did I rent this movie " ? I can not believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen . WTF is Timberlake ? Dreaful acting ! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job ! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I am not a big fun of him ... but I really prefer an actor , not this android called Timberlake . And his girlfriend was shallow , hollow and annoying as hell . I was happy when they both were popped in the street.<br /><br />The story was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad guy role very well . The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake ruined it all . It would have been much enjoyable without him.<br /><br />By the way , the music was OK , but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a MTV video clip with flashes , low motion and things like that . Something misplaced for this cops movie I thought . Maybe they wanted to make a MTV video clip for Timberlake .
0 How can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up ? With enough cops to run a mini - war that include such weapons as flamethrowers , you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying ' thanks ' to a corrupt cop.<br /><br />You will never get your 90ish minutes back . Life is too precious to rent this movie.<br /><br />I feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie.<br /><br />If you like Justin Timberlake , feel free to rent this movie . He does have a very major part in it , so fans might enjoy seeing him . < br /><br />However , I believe most of his fans are young girls , who may be turned off by the violence in this movie .
0 LL Cool J. Morgan Freeman . Dylan McDermott . Kevin Spacey . John Heard . Cary Elwes . Roslyn Sanchez . Justin Timberlake -- wait a minute . Justin Timberlake ? And he 's the star ? I should have known better than to rent EDISON FORCE . In fact , I did know better . But in a moment of absolute weakness , I rented this STV . When you have big names like Freeman and Spacey in an STV , you know it 's one of two things : an indie or a dog . As in sat - on - a - shelf . Which this did . And with good reason . The plot as such involves a squad of corrupt killer cops a la MAGNUM FORCE , and " journalist " Timberlake is the only one brave enough to uncover them . He is targeted for his efforts -- or maybe I should say for his horrible acting . I turned it off after one of the bad guys was shot through the forehead and still had the forethought to turn to his shooter and smile before collapsing . Just awful . The real tipoff to how bad this flick is to see Freeman on the cover and throughout the movie sporting an unruly beard , looking like nothing so much as a hobo . You just know the director was not in control . Freeman is clearly slumming .
0 I rented this movie last week . I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it , so it seemed promising . And it was , until Justin Timberlake came on scene . He is a really bad actor and should n't be allowed to make a movie ever again . I mean , he is one of the most boring , uninspired actors I 've ever seen . He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever . Why the hell was he cast for the role of Josh Pollack ? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment . His character is so dull , it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en . It might sound cool , but believe me , it 's not.<br /><br />Now , Dylan McDermott 's acting is very good . It 's about one of the very few good things about this movie . He is just inspired.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special . He has some really cool lines though.<br /><br />About the story , although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good . I was expecting a big twist when Lazerov ( Dylan McDermott ) was killed , but nothing really happened .
0 * * * REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS * * * I 'll make this review short and sweet . I bought this movie from Best Buy because it sounded interested and had some top actors in it like Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman . How bad could it be , right ? Well , it 's pretty bad . Justin Timberlake plays Pollack , a wannabe journalist who stumbles across a case that may lead to corrupt cops at Edison 's Police Force . LL Cool J is Deed , a cop within the force on a special force team called F.R.A.T. ( First Response Assault Tactics ) . He 's teamed with an " on - the - edge " bad cop named Lazerov ( Dylan McDermott ) . In the opening scene we see Lazerov & Deed taking on some bank robbers , but at night they are busting a couple of guys doing drugs . I do n't want to give to much away , but things turn bad for the guys doing the drugs . Pollack , who works for Ashford ( Morgan Freeman ) goes to a trial involving Deeds & Lazerov . He suspect foul play and with the help of Ashford , does some investigate that turns ugly . Wallace ( Kevin Spacey ) who is all within the F.R.A.T. team joins with Ashford to try to bring the corrupt cops to justice.<br /><br />You can tell from the beginning that Freeman and Spacey 's performance are pretty lackluster . The only person that give a all out performance is Dylan McDermott . He is a complete nut case in this movie and made a believer out of me . LL Cool J is terrible in this film . He says every line the same way and shows pretty much the same emotion . He was much better in movies like Deep Blue Sea & Any Given Sunday . The film starts off with some nice action but then drags it feet through the rest of the film . The ending is far from satisfying.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this film . I 'm putting it on Ebay this weekend .
0 The plot of ' Edison ' was decent , but one actor in particular ruined the entire film . Justin Timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie . He is by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen , and should face the same fate as the entire F.R.A.T. squad . < br /><br />Whether it was an emotional scene , an action scene , or even a silent scene , Justin Timberlake managed to ruin it . < br /><br />Do not waste your time watching this film . Do n't even bother downloading it , midget porn would be a much better choice.<br /><br />And Justin , if you 're reading this , stick to music . Even though you 're no good at that , you 've done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing .
0 I found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film . I managed to stomach 45 - 50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching Monster House instead ( which , by the way , is great fun).<br /><br />The story has massive holes in it . The plot line is hugely over stated and dull , the acting is awful , especially from Justin TImberlake who should really stick to what he is good at ( looking daft and singing like a castrato ) . Morgan Freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable , especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and Timberlake meet . Freeman and Timberlake 's characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father / son relationship of sorts or something , which simply is n't evident at all apart from the fact that ; though Freeman 's character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of Timberlake , he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover up.<br /><br />It would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line , which is simply absurd and blown out of all proportion.<br /><br />Don't watch this film , it is a pure waste of time .
0 OK so I hear about this new Justin Timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names . I mean great actors like , The Freeman aka Morgan Freeman , an asset to Hollywood , however completely wasted in this film . Then we got Kevin Spacey , who I 've been a great fan of ever since I watched American Beauty and The Usual Suspects . Both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as I did when I heard the story . Then enter a fresh faced Justin Timberlake . I say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes have n't hit him yet . Well the reason for that , I might add , is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review . The movie is so terrible that when i got into the first 15 minutes of it . The characters were so one dimensional that it makes some Bible characters look like the Don Corleone . They got the one liners and sound - bite worthy stuff . The token troubled black guy ( LL COOL J ) who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life . The captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone . And what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience . Oh and lots of gun fire , i mean a whole lot . SPOILER(NOT ! ! ! ) THe kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who 's crooked dead and the hero prevails . They got flame throwers and rocket launchers , REally no kidding.<br /><br />Bottom line if you want to see Edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors , or a great fan of Justin Timberlake , to all the 13 year old girls out there , enjoy ! ! I wish i had more hands , because then I would have more thumbs , because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening.<br /><br />MAY G*D HAVE MERCY ON US ALL and save us from these terrible movies . Well it could be worst , another RNB terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher , hehe check out IN THE MIX lol , or even Get rich or die trying ' . Now the special thing about that movie is that its got 30 + year old men , playing 16 or even younger teens . I could go on with these .
0 When you go at an open air cinema under the Greek summer night you usually do n't care what the movie is ! Edison started really good with some good effort from the singers - who - want - to - be actors and a once again great Morgan Freeman but ... ( In a movie there is usually a good start to catch audience , done , a bit boring yet story filling middle of the movie that is more about characters and less about action , done , and the third part is something really good so that you can remember the movie ... ) when you see 30 elite police officers ( packed with weapons that can demolish a building ) shoot at a guy behind a car , fail to hit him even once while he kills all ( but 3 ) and then the guy takes out a flame thrower ( to kill the rest 3 ) , you realise that the Greek summer sky filled with stars is way too good to be distracted by a movie like this !
0 Jewish newspaper reporter Justin Timberlake ( as Joshua " Josh " Pollack ) is puzzled when a courtroom defendant whispers " Thank you " to testifying officer LL Cool J ( as Rafe Deed ) as he leaves the witness stand . In the opening sequences of this film , you are given the explanation . You will see Mr. Cool J 's devilish detective partner Dylan McDermott ( as Frances " Laz " Lazerov ) decide NOT to murder Damien Dante Wayans ( as Isaiah Charles ) . The cops in the city of " Edison " are so corrupt they shoot their suspects , steal their money , and snort their dope . Whether he 's out to impress his girlfriend ( herein , called " Pussy " ) or win a Pulitzer , the city 's corruption does NOT sit well with the noble Mr. Timberlake.<br /><br />Timberlake decides to investigate the corruption , which reaches both unexpected scope and life - threatening levels of danger . Writer / director David J. Burke keeps the film above water , but just barely . LL Cool J beats Timberlake in the " pop star to movie star " sweepstakes ( aka the " rapper to actor " progression ) . Mr. McDermott has fun with his role . Lending gravitas to the proceedings are sagely supporting actors Morgan Freeman ( as Moses Ashford ) and Kevin Spacey ( as Levon Wallace ) . F.R.A.T. means First Response Assault and Tactical , but it 's more important to know that " Edison ( Force ) " stars Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J , not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey ( who seems lost).<br /><br / > * * * * Edison ( 9/17/05 ) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake , LL Cool J , Morgan Freeman , Dylan McDermott
0 OK , I am not Japanese . I do know a little about Japanese culture , and a little less about Japanese pop culture . Other than that , I am Spanish , I eat paella and I like black humor.<br /><br />Good , with that point set , I can comment on the movie : I have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the Japanese audiences , Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director- despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of Talking Head , and even that was curious and somehow interesting- and I am surprised he came up with this . It may just be one of those lost - in - translation cases , I am afraid it is , but as a European viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded English subtitles I just thought it was horrible . The jokes seemed bad , the script was overcooked- I mean , give the audience a break , and shut up a little you damn narrator- to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast - paced speaking and absurd action.<br /><br />However , I thought the animation was really cool . The idea is great , and it is well exploited in those animated scenes . However , the eye - candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo - jumbo speech over still pictures . It just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut - out hysterical characters scene.<br /><br />I read Mamoru Oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this . The idea was good but horribly exploited . Maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie , or maybe it will be more and more over - narrated scenes . But hell , if you thought Talking Head was dense , Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will give cause you a stroke.<br /><br />Of course , all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European . Probably this is totally useless to Japanese people , maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation . Maybe .
0 I do n't want to go too far into detail , because I ca n't really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film , but I had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie . The animation is crud and the story alternates between boring / pointless to extremely irritating . The humor was completely lost on the audience , and yes - Ghost in the Shell fans , this is NOT an action sci - fi or anything like that - its an attempt at slapstick comedy , and the humor just did not work after being translated . It was a total chore to watch this movie , and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest , especially considering how excited I was and how open I was for anything - I was n't expecting a Ghost in the Shell sequel , but I was expecting something entertaining , and it simply did n't achieve this . Yaaawwnnn ... Rent Kino 's Journey instead .
0 I rented this on DVD and I kind of feel bad since Dawson and Lugacy are so earnest about it in the DVD comments . It 's not a bad movie exactly , but it 's one of those films that desperately wants to be a deep comment on human nature while not realizing that its story is practically a genre . Plus , it is a little simplistic about the issue in a lot of ways , and the characters ' behavior often strains belief . I 'd say its a film that you would get something out of if you do n't have a lot of film / TV / literature / life behind you ( to be honest , I 've seen almost exactly the same story in horror comics even ) . Otherwise , its point has been made before and more artfully . And that gets to the big problem , which is that it really does n't have much of cinematic interest to it besides the point . It ends up being a fairly bland movie overall that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling , and it does n't really pay off .
0 The plot for Descent , if it actually can be called a plot , has two noteworthy events . One near the beginning - one at the end . Together these events make up maybe 5 % of the total movie time . Everything ( and I mean _ everything _ ) in between is basically the director 's desperate effort to fill in the minutes . I like disturbing movies , I like dark movies and I do n't get troubled by gritty scenes - but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of hazy / dark ( literally ) scenes with NO storyline you have another thing coming . Rosario Dawson , one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here . And no , she does n't get naked , not even in the NC-17 version , which I saw.<br /><br />If you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch " Descent " , take a nap instead - you 'll probably have more interesting dreams .
0 I saw ' Descent ' last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was one huge disappointment . Disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful , the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and , being a fan ( sounds pervy , I 'm not ! ) of ' rape / revenge ' flicks of the 70 's , I was needless to say very curious to check this movie out . My conclusion : let 's stick to the classics ! Yes , the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat , the actors unconvincing . Even Dawson is empty . Some would say that it 's a right depiction of the college world in the US , that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial . Just like the scene where Dawson gets raped : it seriously lacks intensity ! I was n't expecting anything ' Irreversible'-style but still , are n't we suppose to feel compassion for her ? I did n't . Not for a minute , she was so lame all the way ;-) And I read that the photography was impressive . Well , it is good indeed but nothing ground - breaking either . I must admit that the screening at the festival was n't so good so maybe I missed out something here but at the end of the movie , I could n't help thinking ' I feel like watching Argento 's ' Inferno ' again . lol . More seriously , the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but I had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the American - Canadian border in Lynch 's ' Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me ' ... the crude red and blue lighting , the heavy bass music , the general lascivious / decadent atmosphere ... No , I just could n't get into this movie . Too bad .
0 It 's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself . The paragraph - long " plot summary " written on the movie page has details I could not glean from watching the actual movie . I found myself constantly backing it up to see what details I had just missed which could tell me what the ( bleep ) was going on . Alas , to no avail -- this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story , if you could call it a story . It 's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here , filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations . Newsflash to the the creators : I paid to watch you MAKE a movie . I can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free . And Rosario Dawson ? This is somebody I 've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face , and I can see why . She had one of the most artificial performances I have ever seen for a leading character in any movie , A or B. I figured okay , maybe she did n't really want the role , just got a hefty offer for a movie she was n't into ? Wrong . She was listed as one of the producers . Next time you produce something , do n't book yourself as the lead if you ca n't act . If you really can , then create a decent character for you to become . Also , somebody here mentioned the white / latino issue -- yes , I hate to say it , but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college - age males who wear baseball hats . That 's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters . The Adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story 's antagonist . As for the Maya character , she did n't seem like a real person . Anyway I 'm ashamed for Hollywood that this movie was even made .
0 Having just recently re - viewed " Lipstick " for the first time in a few decades , I backed it with " Descent " even though I have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine.<br /><br />It 's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the Rape Revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years , from the full - on gore of " I Spit On Your Grave , " to the tawdry sensationalism of " Lipstick , " to the tasteful handling of the issue in " The Accused . " But " Descent , " though making some important points , never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning . No , " Descent " is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make --- a message that , when examined closely , is n't that groundbreaking.<br /><br />I pretty much knew the plot going in . What I wanted to see * was * the " descent " or degeneration of Dawson 's character . Being a big fan of Rosario 's , I was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted ... you know , the kind of portrayal DeNiro brings to " Taxi Driver . " Unfortunately , the script and the director / writer 's choices do n't provide any sort of believable transition.<br /><br />The biggest point of failure is the second act . It became obvious what the filmmaker 's intentions were for this segment of club - hopping , drug use , and obsession with big black stallion Adrian ( every white boy 's nightmare , natch ) from a Q&A on the DVD , but this excursion into Dawson 's character is never believably rendered . We do n't know exactly what the hell she 's doing half the time , what she 's after , or why she 's doing it . The poor quality of the audio / video again do n't help , but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless . It destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well - done first act . By the time we get to the finale , our interest has already waned.<br /><br />One point of success that Dawson does point out in the Q&A is that by the end " revenge " scene we are pumped for retribution , then realize just how drawn - out and ugly the reality is . While that 's certainly valid , it does n't make the scene any more intriguing.<br /><br />If you have the DVD , check out the deleted " classroom " scene . This is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation ( though all verbal ) and really DOES show Dawson 's slow crack - up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor Francie Swift 's prissy , condescending dorm counselor . If more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down , we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence.<br /><br />As the film stands in the final cut , though , all we get is what we 've seen before , only in a more graphic rendering . So what ?
0 Revenge is one of my favorite themes in film . Moreso , " the futility of revenge " is one of my favorite themes in film . Having seen Gaspar Noe 's Irreversible ( 2002 ) , I was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme . Instead , this film is a weak half - hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film 's lack of conviction and focus.<br /><br />*SPOILERS * The end scene , a gratuitous male - on - male rape / torture scene , came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy . However , the film does n't even follow through with this . Instead , the drawn out scene ( which FAR exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized ) is crowned with a shot of Dawson 's face in an expression of either regret or " This did n't fix anything " while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background.<br /><br />My problem with the scene was n't one of shock , but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience . I mean , do we feel bad for the rapist ? Do we rejoice in Dawson 's revenge ? Are we disgusted by the brutality of it all ? Do we feel Dawson 's moment of regretful clarity ? Aside from this failing , the film is really sort of awkwardly paced with more style than substance . Character 's are thin , dialog is monotonous , etc.<br /><br />Normally I try to take films on their own terms but Descent did n't really seem to know what those were . Thumbs down .
0 Rosario Dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge . While its clear why Dawson took the role , its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent , decidedly un - Hollywood film , its also clear that aside from stunning good looks , Dawson seems out of place in the role . Forgive me I simply could n't find her . That s not a mistake , that s how I felt , I had no idea where she was . Yes I know she 's on the screen but even though I spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me what s so ever . I blame the script for this since other than the ending , not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense . The people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens did n't seem to fit together . Forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film , other than the end ( which I would love to talk about but ca n't cause it would spoil it ) , and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing more than an image , stayed with me . What can I say , this may click with you , it may not , for me it 's time I ca n't get back . For Rosario Dawson fans only , though be warned there 's several real reasons why this is NC17 . ( And Rosario- please , you 're a better actress , pick better scripts )
0 This movie sucked plain and simple . Okay so it 's basically about a girl that gets raped , and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist . The rapist is a douche , but the girl victim is partly to blame . I mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff , but when the rapist tries to have sex with her , she does n't allow it so the rapist rapes her . And the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it does n't really expose or show anything , but when it comes to the rapist getting raped , it 's a pretty long rape scene . There is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching.<br /><br />3.2/10
0 I 'm going to write about this movie and about " Irreversible " ( the ( in)famous scene in it ) . So you are warned , if you have n't seen the movie yet . This are just my thoughts , why I think the movie fails ( in the end - pun intended).<br /><br />Acting wise , Rosario Dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger ( a teenager in other words ) . The villain guy is good , but loses his " evil " touch right before the end . If he really never changes , then why would he let a woman tie him up ? He would n't , period . Then we also have the bartender/2nd rape Dude . Actually I do n't think you would need him . At least not for the 2nd rape , but more about that later on.<br /><br />Let 's reprise the story . Rosarios character is sexually insecure , might even have lesbian tendencies ( see her scene with a female friend ) . This was n't intentional , as Rosario states herself , but there is sexual tension between them . Rosario 's character meets a guy , who is a sexual Predator , in all the bad senses . But he makes an impression on her.<br /><br />Rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before . I beg to differ . Because she acts , as if it is her first boyfriend , which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother . Talking about her mother , here 's another problem . After the first rape takes place , Rosarios character does n't tell anyone what happened . Seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one , nothing of that gets explored after that . If Rosarios character would n't call her mother anymore or would behave strangely , the mother would be worried like crazy . There was so much potential here . Also her female friend : We see her at the party , it 's obvious there is something going on and " boom " she is gone.<br /><br />The first rape is almost unbearable to watch . But feels like a pinch , when you compare it to the ending ( rape ) , which feels like you 're getting hit with a sledge hammer ! After rape no . 1 we get too stretched out scenes . Threads are opened ( such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian , as one guy states who tried to hit on her ... ) , but left in the open . No real social contact is established , if you leave the bartender guy out , who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene . It 's apparent that he is n't a " nice " guy and his character get 's fleshed out a bit . But when Rosarios character meets her rapist in class again , his being in the movie seems pointless . We get the point that Rosarios character is n't the same anymore , that she went " bad " and is able to hurt people . ( Too ) Many scenes show exactly that , her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff . Back to Rapist # 1 who cheats on a test , gets caught by Rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again ( really ? ) . As absurd as that sounds , the guy meets up with her , not without us having seen him beforehand , with another girl ( very likely that he raped her too , although we never see anything of that , fortunately ) and his football career . Well career is a stretch and he is bullied . This is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works , but then again is too cliché to stay with you . So Rapist # 1 submits to Rosarios character ... why exactly ? Because he promised her , it was her day ? Again , really ? A guy like that never loses control , especially with a woman he raped before ... I guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is . The bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something , but letting him submit like that , just feels wrong . Another possibility would have a drug in his drink.<br /><br />So rapist # 1 undresses and get 's blindfolded and let 's Rosarios character tie him on a bed .... seriously , that 's just crazy ! But what comes next , is even crazier . First she talks to him , then she " shuts " him up and forces an object into him . This is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one . This is n't about what this guy deserves or not , it 's just intense . And of course that was what they were aiming for . Now after she is " done " the bartender guy comes in and rapes ... rapist # 1 . If this really should work as a revenge movie , it would have been better if Rosarios character herself would have been doing all the " revenge " . Having a henchman doing the job , takes away everything that was built up.<br /><br />This is n't supposed to be entertaining / enjoyable , it 's a hard watch & it is Art - house . But the 10 minute ( I did n't count ) rape scene at the end , just smashes everything . Rosarios character is more or less , only watching what happens . Which brings me to the biggest disappointment.<br /><br />Irreversible comparison : " Irreversible " had the rape scene , but the movie went on ( even if it was back into time ) . Rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this . First , that comes a bit too late , that should see her say that after the initial rape . And secondly and most importantly , this is where the Art - house movie should 've come in . It is more interesting seeing were Rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope , with what she had done . But then again , she did n't actually physically do that much ( see above ) ... a broken character that the movie cuts off ... < br /><br />Good intentions ( Talia and Rosario had worked before ) , but failing to convey most of the things , they set out to do ( even if you can see what they meant , it has to be convincing , otherwise it does n't work ) ... not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are ...
0 This movie was disgusting . Their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage . What is garbage ? The misuse of peoples time , the misuse of energy , and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write . Talia you are a sick demented loser . Your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem . < br /><br />The acting and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the middle of the garbage . I ended up at a scene that was uncalled for . If you want to learn how to shock people watch a Larry Clark movie . I lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie " no more support from me . " How could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is manifested from the mind of a psycho ? I feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene . I think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is ; congratulations you won his attention .
0 If you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault , then this film is not the film that you want to watch . It was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back . Spoiler : Rosario Dawson turns the tables on her assailant . Instead of using the criminal justice system , the victim resorts to using vigilantism . She in essence nullifies the judicial system . The film " The Accused " was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins . What the " Descent " does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence ? Is victim any better that the accuser ? No ! ! !
0 Do not waste your time or your money on this movie . My roommate rented it because she thought it was the other movie called Descent ( the flick about some travelers who get trapped in a cave ) . so , we decided to watch it anyways thinking it could n't be that bad . It was . I ca n't believe this movie was actually produced and put out to the public . It was so horrible it was almost like an accident scene where you want to look away but you just ca n't make yourself . I honestly feel emotionally scarred . It went from being a semi - low budget movie in which a college girl gets assaulted by a boy she 's dating to an all out porno flick . And really not a good one . I went from hating the woman 's rapist to almost feeling bad for him . Almost . All in all , an awful movie that was definitely rated NC-17 for a reason . Do n't waste your money . And do n't let your kids watch it .
0 Okay so i found out about this movie and I watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether I should watch it or not . Before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it . i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time . So i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought : The beginning started off fine for me . It seemed to be heading in a decent direction . Got past the rape scene and i could n't figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie . Do n't get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it did n't really bother me to a dramatic point . Then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on . There was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing ! its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie did n't have that . It had about 3 of these pointless scenes , where you see the main character Maya kind of get out of control but it did n't show it right making me want to fast forward . Then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it was n't so boring but still a little dull . Oh and as a note Rosario Dawson still did a great job . Okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to Maya 's attention . That s where it got disturbing . I did n't feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all eck after it . I ca nt really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its so ... i do n't know i ca nt find a word to sum it up . But if you choose to watch it just do n't be unsuprised .
0 This movie offers NOTHING to anyone . It does n't succeed on ANY level . The acting is horrible , dull long - winded dribble . They obviously by the length of the end sex scene were trying to be shocking but just ended up being pretty much a parody of what the film was aiming for . Complete garbage , I ca n't believe what a laughable movie this was . < br /><br />And I 'm very sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this film cause she though this would be her jarring break away indi hit , a wowing NC-17 movie . The problem is no adult is going to stick with this film as the film plays out like a uninteresting episode of the OC or something aimed at teens . Pathetic .
0 You know all those letters to " Father Christmas " and " Jesus " that are sent every year ? Well , it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a half - forgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them . As bizarre settings go , it 's a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is " Dead Letter Office " . Having said that , this is obviously an Australian film as opposed to a British one . If it was Royal Mail , most letters get this sort of treatment anyway . I have n't been in this flat for two years and we 're still getting letters for a Mr Wang , some female priest of the Church of Latter Day I've - Never - Heard - Of - You and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company.<br /><br />"Dead Letter Office " ( the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up ) follows the story of Alice ( Miranda Otto ) who grows up in a seriously divided home . Writing to her absent father , she only learns in adulthood that her letters have n't been delivered for one reason or another . So , logically , she gets a job at the D.L.O. and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding Chilean immigrant Frank Lopez ( George Del Hoyo ) . Slowly , she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the self - contained world of the Dead Letters Office to its knees?<br /><br />Nothing against this film but I was reminded of the god - awful Heather Graham film " Committed " while watching this . However , this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again , that ai n't difficult . For a start , this film is much more logical . True , the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood . But at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel . It is also well acted . Both Otto and Del Hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know they 'll never find while other characters are peripheral at best . Part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly , leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed . The other part is that when you consider Australia 's draconian immigration policy ( i.e. if you do n't speak English , rack off ! ) , such a story is unlikely to take place in reality . The other characters , sadly , also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than odd - ball stereotypes.<br /><br />Despite that , " Dead Letter Office " is certainly something a little different . It might not be to everyone 's taste but I liked it . Yes , it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes , it 's nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavy - duty swearing and nudity ( no chance of that in an Australian film ) . There ai n't any major laughs , there 's no Bullet Time and the characters are usually one - dimensional . But it 's the story that counts here and while it 's not earth - shattering in its magnificence , it 's a pleasant enough way of passing the time . It 's the movie equivalent of a Sheryl Crow CD - nice to listen to now and again but you would n't really miss it if it was n't there .
0 This movie had a IMDB rating of 8.1 so I expected much more from it . It starts out funny and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous . But before the movie is half - way through , it begins to drag and everything becomes sickingly predictable . The characters in the office were delightful in the first third of the movie , but we get to know them a little too well ; they become caricatures , not real people at all . This is the same story I 've seen hundreds of times , only told here with slightly different circumstances . The thing is , I could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialog were n't so stale!<br /><br />The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and unbelievable motivations , and unfortunately that was also the case with Dead Letter Office . Hopefully this movie will end up in the Dead Movie Office soon .
0 ' Dead Letter Office ' is a low - budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service , struggling to rebuild their damaged lives . Unfortunately , the acting is poor and the links between the characters ' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over - schematically represented . What 's most disappointing of all , however , is the portrayal is life in the office of the film 's title : there 's no mechanisation whatsoever , and it 's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living . Granted , part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure , but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s , if it ever truly existed . It 's a shame , as the film 's overall tone is poignant and wry , and there 's some promise in the scenario : but few of the details convince . Overall , it feels the work of someone who has n't actually experienced much of real life ; a student film , with a concept and an outline , but sadly little else .
0 This picture seemed way to slanted , it 's almost as bad as the drum beating of the right wing kooks who say everything is rosy in Iraq . It paints a picture so unredeemable that I ca n't help but wonder about it 's legitimacy and bias . Also it seemed to meander from being about the murderous carnage of our troops to the lack of health care in the states for PTSD . To me the subject matter seemed confused , it only cared about portraying the military in a bad light , as A ) an organzation that uses mind control to turn ordinary peace loving civilians into baby killers and B ) an organization that once having used and spent the bodies of it 's soldiers then discards them to the despotic bureacracy of the V.A. This is a legitimate argument , but felt off topic for me , almost like a movie in and of itself . I felt that " The War Tapes " and " Blood of my Brother " were much more fair and let the viewer draw some conclusions of their own rather than be beaten over the head with the film makers viewpoint .

0 When Marlene Dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers , it was films like The Garden Of Allah . How a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me . Also how Marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me.<br /><br />The Garden Of Allah , one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by Robert Hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with Mary Anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911 - 12 . It then got two silent screen adaptions . The story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in French Tunisia to see some of what he 's missed in the world . He runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent . She 's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train.<br /><br />The woman is of course Marlene and the runaway monk is Charles Boyer . I 'm not sure what was in David O. Selznick 's mind in filming this story . Someone like Ingrid Bergman might have made it palatable for the audience . But you can bet that the movie - going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see Marlene as a modern day Salome rather than a saint with that title . The public still remembered Rudolph Valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting.<br /><br />As for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which Boyer happens to be the one with the secret . The monastery will have to rethink it 's economics if Boyer leaves . The monks are a sincerely pious group , but from the head man Charles Waldron on down they 've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest.<br /><br />Anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts . Most especially Marlene Dietrich . I would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot .
0 The real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor . A visual treat to the eye , the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart . I was intrigued , at first , by the idea of Dietrich and Boyer leaving religion in order to " find " their capacity for love . What follows is a huge disappointment . Boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment . Dietrich 's amazing wardrobe outshines her performance -- at times her face is frightening to look at -- a unfeeling mask . As a monk , Boyer held the formula for the monastery 's liquer ( which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse ) -- when he leaves his " marriage to god " the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion . The viewer feels Boyer was well rid of his past . However , the journey that follows is all too predictable .
0 As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich , I had to ( finally ) watch this very , very dull picture . It is Miss Dietrich 's first color film , and the world 's most beautiful blond is a redhead ! Bad start . The story is a tremendous bore , involving a subject which itself bores bores me stiff : religious guilt . ( Who needs it ? ? ? ) Suffice it to say , perhaps , that of all Dietrich 's films ( and I have seen most , including " Pittsburgh " ) this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching . The color photography is OK ( this is a very early Technicolor release ) , but to no purpose . Ridiculous casting : C. Aubrey Smith , Basil Rathbone ( enough said ? ) . The only thing of any interest at all is John Carradine 's outlandish caricature of a performance as " The Sand Diviner , " who foretells all that will happen . The supposed " happy ending " is one of the most depressing ever conceived . Yet another example of David O. Selznick 's highly inflated reputation ( did he ever make a really good film ? -- other than That One ? ) And , for one final annoyance , the soundtrack of the MGM DVD is a mess , with volume levels seemingly randomized . Highly unrecommended .
0 My first full Heston movie . The movie that everyone already knows the ending to . A " Sci Fi Thriller " . The campy factor . Everything that goes with this movie was injected in my head when I rented it , and on the morning that I watched it , it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood that I was in ( Not wanting to move . Put in player , hide in blankets ) . And though I tried to understand what was happening to lead to the ending that will be eternally ruined by pop culture , it just really did n't make it . Everything was all over the place , relationships had no backbone , the ending had no lead in . Everything was just kind of there in some freakish way and the watcher has no choice but to leave partially dumbfounded at the ending that it gets to , because even though we all know that it 's people , it 's quick answers as to WHY it 's people makes any serious attempt at enjoying the movie for anything other than the silliness thrown out the window .
0 Anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics . Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to begin at , which is fine but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie , SOYLENT GREEN , are far better choices than those series . SOYLENT is probably science fiction 's best kept secret . It remains one of the biggest , yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day . Charlton Heston overdramatizes his role , yet it works . Edward G. Robinson , in his final role , makes the most out of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching.<br /><br />It is Manhattan in 2022 , the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune ( a small jar of strawberry jam costs $ 150 ) . A big executive for the Soylent company is murdered and police detective Thorn is on the case.<br /><br />The secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie . SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch , but the whole screenplay is a joke . It is just as cheap as the entire production . The screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie , yet were completely hilarious . Everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules , specifically cop Thorn who likes to just waltz into people 's apartments , peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants . The character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie , but still you realize that SOYLENT GREEN sucks . An enjoyable piece if you have the time , but do not expect anything more .
0 I watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of Sophia Loren . I 'm a person who they call a Cultural Barbarian . I hate art in any kind of shape or form . Rambo is more my kind of movie , action , kills , blood , horror . If you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague . No one dies , no action , no nudity , nothing of the kind . Let me give you a résumé in a few sentences . It starts out with 5 minutes in black and white Nazi propaganda . Every Italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of Hitler , except for a housewife , an anti fascist and a caretaker . The housewife who is cheated by her husband , meets the anti fascist . She falls in love with him , wants to make love to him , but the anti fascist is gay . Despite of this they make love with each other . At the end of the day , the housewife reads a book from her gay lover , and the guy himself is deported by agents . The end . You want an even shorter résumé ? BORING ... That short enough ? The guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself , to save the audience from this atrocity . On a side note my sister loved this movie . Like I said , I 'm a Cultural Barbarian ...
0 " Fever Pitch " is n't a bad film ; it 's a terrible film.<br /><br />Is it possible American movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that Hollywood churns out that they 'll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs ? That 's the only reason I can think of why this horrible romantic comedy ( and I use that term loosely because there 's nothing funny in this film ) is getting good reviews.<br /><br />I sat through this film stunned that screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny.<br /><br />The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well to film . He adapted " Fever Pitch " for a British film starring Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997 ; Peter Hedges found Hornby 's voice for " About a Boy " ( 2002 ) and when " High Fidelity " was Americanized for a movie in 2000 , writers D.V. DeVincentis , Steve Pink , John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg did n't go wrong because they kept the essence of Hornby 's wit and humor . They made one of the best films of that year.<br /><br />So why does the American version of " Fever Pitch " go so painfully awry ? The British version was n't a masterpiece , but it was charming , funny , unexpected and gave us two characters we could like , respect and understand.<br /><br />But Ganz and Mandel have excised everything funny in Hornby 's work . In Americanizing the story , they 've butchered it , removing all that was good and unique about Hornby 's work and replacing it with conventional drivel.<br /><br />They've transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy , never once veering from the wretched formula . Lindsey ( Drew Barrymore ) has three girlfriends , each of whom has a distinct function . One 's overweight , the second 's cynical and ambitious , and the third 's a romantic . Want to guess how many male friends Ben ( Jimmy Fallon ) has?<br /><br />What made " High Fidelity " such fun was not only a good leading man and lady , but engaging supporting characters . In this " Fever Pitch , " the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny . They 're so insignificant , they 're not even decorative . The only reason they 're in the film is because the formula demands it . Poor Ione Skye winds up as one Lindsey 's pals in a thankless role . The lovely Skye must have been wishing Lloyd Dobler would swoop in and take her away . Come to think of it , Cusack would 've made an excellent Ben . Of course , Cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script.<br /><br />There is n't a single , solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced . Every plot turn is predictable , every lame joke telegraphed . Ganz and Mandel labor for laughs . The first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow , you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy . You can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch . It 's almost as if Ganz and Mandel penned this with some screen writing guru 's formula pasted on the wall . When they got to a certain page , they looked up at the formula and said , " OK , the guru says this has to happen now . " And , presto!<br /><br />Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly do n't help the film any . They have no concept how to introduce their story and characters ( they hand over the V.O. narration not to the protagonist , but to another guy who sits behind Ben at Fenway Park ) . Thanks to some extremely clunky writing , we have to watch Barrymore and Fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings.<br /><br />Barrymore does cute and adorable better than most . She 's as good at it as Goldie Hawn in her heyday . But even her cuteness ca n't save this extraordinarily awful film . She tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story . About 30 minutes into the film , Lindsey tells Ben , " You 're funny . " The only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script . For Fallon 's Ben never says anything even remotely funny . Fallon is neither witty nor funny ; when he does comedy , he overacts.<br /><br />Fallon was never any good on " Saturday Night Live . " He was quite possibly the least funny person on that show . Remember that lame sketch about a radio DJ who did all the voices ? The only reason " Weekend Update " worked occasionally was because Fallon 's cohort , Tina Fey , knows a thing or two about comedy.<br /><br />Actors who think they 're funny and behave that way rarely , if ever , are actually funny . That 's true of Fallon . He thinks he 's hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle . His stuttering , unsure - of - himself shtick did n't work on the small screen ; it 's lousier on the big screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Fallon , his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments . If you thought his comedy was bad , wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff . Two scenes in particular - the first in a park , the second in front of Ben 's school - are painful to watch . The scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability , but Fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work . His range of emotions does n't even run the gamut from A to B.<br /><br />Ben has no personality or depth . Often , he comes across as an oaf . And not a lovable one at that . It boggles the mind what Lindsey would find attractive about him . Compare Fallon 's performance to Firth 's in the British version , and you 'll understand how terribly flat , unfunny and forced Fallon 's Ben is and how wrong he is for this role . Watching Fallon in " Fever Pitch " makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of Ashton Kutcher!<br /><br />Just as " High Fidelity " did , an Americanized " Fever Pitch " could 've worked brilliantly . It just needed better writers , more competent directors and , most definitely , a stronger , funnier , smarter leading man . Do yourself a huge favor : Avoid this rotten film ; rent the 1997 British version and read Hornby 's book , instead .
0 I am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many , but this was simply not a very good attempt . Its got nothing to do with comparisons with the British original -- have not seen , and doubt I will . It has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot , lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance / character from its supposed male lead ( Jimmy Fallon).<br /><br />Fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that . He 's supposed to be a teacher you see , and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach . The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable , but old reliables like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might have been able to give it a shot . Not Fallon , who is neither funny , nor an actor , but appears to think he is both . Not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe Fallon in his role , or believe that there is any way these two people should , or would be together . Near the end of the movie there is a scene where Barrymore ( who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone -- its hard to have a one person romance ) tells Fallon that its over , too much has happened , and she 's moving on . And rather than feeling bad about the scene , or sorry for Fallon , you are actively cheering her on -- finally she does what she should have done months ago . But of course the plot mechanics wo n't allow that to be the end of it ( an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess ) , and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions . Its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying , but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else .
0 I saw this director 's " Woman On The Beach " and could not understand the good to great reviews . This film is much like that one , two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else . Like his other films , you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog , wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten , pretty uninteresting characters . If you feel you can like this film , do n't let my review stop you . I do like minimalism in films , but I feel Tsai Ming - Liang 's films are far superior . He has a fairly terrific actor in Lee Kang - Sheng in his films . There is nothing here . I wish IU liked it , but I do n't . Oh , well .
0 This movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description . But to me it was a bit of a let down . Very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening . It was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed ( definitely not in sequential order ) . Also , nothing of any consequence was being filmed . I have viewed quite a few different Korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer 's part , which is different from the typical Hollywood film . But this one befuddled me to no end . I viewed the film a second and third time and it still did n't do anything for me . I still do n't really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey . If it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person 's life , I guess he succeeded . But I was looking for more . Needless to say , I ca n't recommend this movie to anyone .
0 This typically melodramatic Bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of Western critics . The script is ludicrous , the acting is over - the - top , and it looks cheesy . The only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary Meena Kumari . Watching the actress , who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released , has the same fascination as watching a train wreck . Her ex - husband , Amrohi , wrote and directed , but lacks the competency to execute either task well . Bollywood has produced far better films .
0 This was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares . For a horror or " thriller " film and hype , it 's way too tame . There are only a few tense moments in here , not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre . Even those " tense " scenes were n't much . The music made them more dramatic that they actually were.<br /><br />There is a lot of symbolism in here , so the elitist critics label this " a thinking person 's horror film . " Well , if they think about it , I 'm sure they will come to the same conclusion I did - a waste of money at the video rental store.<br /><br />Summary : a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting . Vastly overrated and certainly not what it is advertised .
0 After reading some very good reviews about this film I thought I would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film I thought I would give it my own review . This is my first ever so bare with me.<br /><br />First of all I would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest ( with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me . ) I would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as I was n't particularly thrilled either ! The film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times . During these times she visits a house which she has been drawing , after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality . As she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in . Until she adds her constantly away father to the house , due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches.<br /><br />Think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of A Nightmare On Elm Street but is more like a trip to the beach.<br /><br />In conclusion my generous 3/10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab !
0 normally i 'm not the sort to be scared by horror movies , but this movie is the exception . some how this movie got into my mind ! ! ! it is a very simple movie but at the same time extremelly effective , it has great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments , the girls father coming down the hill is a real standout . Another seen was the family photo i was n't expecting that and i jumped out my seat ! ! ! i would recommend everyone to see this movie , with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time ! ! ! ! !
0 I was rooting for this film as it 's a remake of a 1970s children 's TV series " Escape into Night " which , though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd , fascinating and disturbing . The acting in " Paperhouse " is wooden , unintentionally a joke . The overdubs did n't add tension they only reinforced that I was sat watching a botch . Casting exasperated the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth , chemistry or conviction . As in most lacklustre films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be comforted , consoled and reassured that they will not be held responsible . Out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen ... lamer than I could have dreamt.<br /><br />"Escape into Night " deserves a proper remake , written by someone with life experience and directed with a subtle mind .
0 An intriguing premise of hand - drawn fantasy come to life in a child 's fever dreams . However , I imagine the average nonfictional child is far more adept at scaring themselves than Bernard Rose is at riveting the viewer . The duel between Anna 's two realities drags on far too long to sustain interest , especially considering that the little girl playing her is the most abrasive child actor I 've ever seen.<br /><br />Use only for kindling .
0 In 1988 , Paperhouse was hailed as a " thinking man 's horror film . " Wow , you might say , sign me up . This thing is a mess . It features a one time young actress who has a range of like 1 to 2 . G. Headley with a bad British ( dubbed ) accent , and a story with no chills , thrills or spills.<br /><br />It is n't even interesting psycho - babble . One will only laugh at its cheap effects and long for a showing of Leprechaun 5.<br /><br />The story involves a girl with glandular fever who escapes in her dreams . WHat you get is n't good horror , art house or even a decent after - school special . I found myself after the two hour point saying .. where did my two hours go.<br /><br />The direction is uninspired and I wished it could even be pretentious ... something interesting .. it seems like the producers were on lithium.<br /><br />Even in the dream world things are boring.<br /><br />A short no on this one .
0 Films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning . While there are some exceptions , the majority of kids just ca nt act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes . The kids in Paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds , as they 're both very annoying and they do n't have an ounce of acting ability between them . In short ; they 're rubbish . This is n't good considering that they 're the leads , and it especially is n't good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors . It 's a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot is n't ( not completely ) . It follows a young girl who , after drawing a picture of a house in her notebook , wakes up in the fantasy world that she has created . It soon becomes apparent to her that she can manipulate this world through her drawings , and so sets about making various changes , until her dream eventually becomes a nightmare . Oh dear.<br /><br />As you can see , this plot line gives a nice base for a good fantasy horror movie . However , it is squandered through a number of fatal faults . First and foremost , in spite of the premise being an excellent premise for lots of inventiveness ; the movie is extremely stale . The central plot is hardly played with at all , and the result is an entirely boring experience . The lack of tension is another huge gaping flaw in the movie , as it sees fit to drag every sequence out to a point that you just do n't care any more ( which is due to a lack of ideas ) . Thanks in part to it 's lead characters , the film feels like a kids movie throughout . This is to be expected as it stars kids , but Bernard Rose should have decided the slant that he wanted to put on the story ; as the horror in the movie is laughable at best . The film is also very cheesy , and the ' romance ' between the two leads is extremely cringe - worthy , and makes for very painful viewing . In fact , if I had to sum this travesty up in one word , I would choose ' painful ' . Paperhouse is poorly acted , laughably plotted , very corny and dull on the whole . Save yourself the pain , see something else .
0 First I liked that movie . It seemed to me a nice comedy with some silly moments . The costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best ! ! ! The same as wonderful set decorator Robert R. Benton - this man really had a very good taste ! ! ! But the script writers disappointed me extremely . The best ending would be the scene on the ladder , but instead of it , they decided that the father and his daughter should be together . Do n't like the ending . The father becomes boyfriend of his own daughter and his ex - wife knows about it and finds it alright . It would be OK , if the scriptwriters would for example say that now there is a different soul in the body , but they did not , they only deprived him of memories . The actors were good , they were really funny . Cybill Shepherd was charming , Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dancing scene : ) ) ) ... But some of the moments spoil even the impression of good acting . For example , Corinne Jeffries , played by Cybill Shepherd after the death of her husband was waiting for him 23 years ( it 's a long time ! ) , she was true to him , she loved nobody but him , and when she met him and was just about making love to him , after a scene with her friend Philip Train ( Ryan O'Neal ) , she very easily betrayed the man she was longing for so many years ! ! ! It would be a good movie , if not the ending and some missed human psychology .
0 Predictable plot . Simple dialogue . Shockingly unemotional performances . But Robert Downey , Jr. is so cute , I gave this " poor man 's afternoon special " a 3 instead of the 1 or 2 it so richly deserved .
0 ' Chances Are ' a big mistake to see . You could know director Emile Ardolino from ' Dirty Dancing ' and ' Sister Act ' and should expect something amusing from him . But I guess I have to disillusion you . He made a really , really bad movie.<br /><br />According to the story Christopher McDonald dies to reburn as a baby . The baby grows up Robert Downey Jr , and Jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter , Mary Stuart Masterson ( complicated , huh?).<br /><br />They fall in love with each other . Then appears Jr former wife , Cybill Shepherd , and Jr falls in love with her too . I guess I do n't even have to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil.<br /><br />In one of his first roles Robert Downey Jr 's on his worst . He copies Michael J Fox.<br /><br />After the ' Moonlighting ' Shepherd proves that she 's not suitable for acting in movies.<br /><br />Anyway , there 's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used : as antidote to insomnia .
0 Chances are if I watched this again I might get physically sick , the film is so annoying ..... unless you believe in psychics , re - incarnation and the other hocus- pocus which this promotes big - time . The " re - cycling of souls , " they call it here . Puh - leeze.<br /><br />This story has been done several times before with such films as " Heaven Can Wait . " It 's also been done a lot better . Too bad they had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr. , Cybill Shepherd , Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson.<br /><br />At least it 's a pretty tame film , language - wise . That 's about the only redeeming quality of this movie .
0 Silly , simplistic , and short , GUN CRAZY ( VOLUME 1 : A WOMAN FROM NOWHERE ) goes nowhere.<br /><br />This brief ( just over sixty minutes ) tale is n't so much inspired by the classic spaghetti Westerns as it is a rip - off of Sam Raimi 's THE QUICK & THE DEAD ( his admitted homage to the spaghetti Westerns ) brought into a contemporary setting . In QUICK & DEAD , Sharon Stone 's character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff ( played by Gene Hackman ) who , when she was but an urchin , placed the fate of her father ( a brief cameo by Gary Sinise ) in her hands ; she accidentally shot him through the head . In GUN CRAZY , Saki ( played by the nimble Ryoko Yonekura ) seeks revenge against the dastardly Mr. Tojo ( played with minimalist appeal by Shingo Tsurumi ) , who , when she was but an urchin , placed the fate of her father in her hands ; she let her foot slip off the clutch , and dear ole dad was drawn and quartered by a semi truck . The only significant difference , despite the settings , is the fact that Tojo sadistically cripples Saki with   well , I wo n't spoil that for you in case you decide to watch it.<br /><br />In short , Saki  a pale imitation of the Clint Eastwood 's ' Man With No Name '  rides into the town  basically , there 's a auto shop and a tavern alongside an American military base , so I guess that suffices for a town  corrupted by Tojo , the local crimelord with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored . Confessing her true self as a bounty hunter , Saki takes on the local gunmen in shootouts whose choreography bares more than a passing similarity to the works of Johnny To and John Woo . Of course , by the end of the film Saki has endured her fair amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys , but she rises to the occasion  on her knees , in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending  and vanquishes all of her enemies with a rocket launcher.<br /><br />Don't ask where she gets the rocket launcher . Just watch it for yourself . Try not to laugh.<br /><br />The image quality is average for the DVD release . There is a grainy quality to several sequences , but , all in all , this is n't a bad transfer . The sound quality leaves a bit to the imagination at times , but , again , it is n't a bad transfer.<br /><br />Rather , it 's a bad film .
0 Oh dear . I was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip - off of Japan 's Ringu . Well , I guess the U.S. made their version of it as well , but at least it was an outright remake . So , so sad . I very much enjoy watching Filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country , so I ca n't believe this had to happen . Claudine and Kris are such big names there , surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism . To any aspiring movie makers out there in the Philippines : You do not have to stoop this low to make money . There are many movie buffs that are watching the movies Filipinos put out and enjoying them !
0 i would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it were n't for ms . Claudine Barretto 's performance . and i will take this time to overlook that Kris Aquino 's here . and ... end.<br /><br />i really AVOID watching Pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and i really think that ( some ) writers do n't give enough attention to the characters ( and their progression ) in their stories ( redundant ? ? ) . it was as if they ' pushed ' the movie onwards when their storytelling stank . and my goodness , creative exhaustion led them to rip - off other movies . why ? ? why did this movie get a good review ? ? i would n't give it that much merit . the movie was KIND OF scary , but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with Filipino folklore ... it goes into my list of ' most likely to happen ' category . i just wished they spent more time improving the story lines and fix those flash back sequences , never mind if the lighting sucked , it would n't matter much if the content would blow you away .. SAYANG .
0 How did this become a blockbuster ? Dear God I do n't know where to start why this movie sucked too much . The movie was predictable & there was no originality . The only thing I can admire is the acting of some characters . The movie was too bright , they should have done something with the lighting , eg . making the environment more darker . The make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick . This is 2006 ! People do n't get scared by other people wearing heavy make up . Most of the horror scenes we 're taken from other Hollywood or Asian horror movies . Total rip off ! This is why I do n't watch tagalog movies . The only reason why so many people " screamed " while watching this movie is because of conformity . How many times do we have to copy scenes from The Ring and improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the TV , its now coming from the window next door ? No matter how you put it , ITS STILL A RIP OFF . If you want a good horror movie , go watch the 50 best horror movie listed on this website .
0 So , I got a hold of this as an assignment for Trent Harris , who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the U of U. I guess this is his only real way to get anyone to see his film ... <br /><br />The documentary section at the beginning dragged on . Yes , the kid is a nut - job from no where , but that 's not good enough to keep it interesting.<br /><br />Seeing Sean Penn dressed as a ONJ is the only highlight ... and after about thirty seconds it loses all humor.<br /><br />When Crispin Glover takes on Larry , the story - telling was better , but I just could n't take anymore ...
0 It 's amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all . It is by far the number 1 worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />Not only have I ever been this bored before ( luckily not for more then 1,5 hours ) , the pre - adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted . After the first very awkward part , you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better . You hope in vain , it only goes downhill from there.<br /><br />The movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non - story three times . One can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and Trent Harris never lays his hands on a camera again ...
0 I do n't think any player in Hollywood history lasted as long as David Niven did given most of the weak films he had to carry by dint of his incredible charm . He could act , got an Oscar for it , but most of the material he did was as light as one ply of two ply tissue paper.<br /><br />Happy Go Lovely is a case in point . It 's a musical and for the most part you 'll remember Vera - Ellen 's dancing . You 'll remember that they are in Scot 's costume as the film is set in Edinburgh during their festival . But if you can recall a single song from it you must have a photographic memory.<br /><br />The plot is light . Vera - Ellen is the American lead in a musical that apparently is getting its out of town tryout in Edinburgh . She starts in the chorus and runs late one day . She gets a lift from the chauffeur of a millionaire greeting card king . Everybody now assumes she 's the main squeeze of the millionaire . Doors open up as they 've never opened before.<br /><br />The millionaire is David Niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake . Cesar Romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musical.<br /><br />In the end though Happy Go Lovely is light and harmless fluff which David Niven did so much of and got so tired of .
0 The oddly - named Vera - Ellen was to movie dancing what Sonja Henie was to movie ice - skating : blonde , girlish , always delightful to watch , but not an especially good actress and usually lumbered with weak material . When I watch Vera - Ellen 's sexy apache dance with Gene Kelly in ' Words and Music ' , I ca n't help noticing that her blouse ( yellow with narrow red horizontal stripes ) seems to be made out of the South Vietnam flag . For some reason , the very American Vera - Ellen starred in * two * musicals ( made several years apart ) set in Edinburgh , a city not noted for its tap - dancers : ' Let 's Be Happy ' and ' Happy Go Lovely'.<br /><br />In the latter , Cesar Romero plays an American impresario who for some reason is staging a musical in Edinburgh . There 's a vague attempt to link this show to the Edinburgh Festival , which is nonsense : the Festival is not a showcase for splashy leg - shows . We also see a couple of stock shots of the Royal Mile : apart from a few Highland accents , there 's absolutely no attempt to convey Scottish atmosphere in this movie . The funniest gag occurs at the very beginning , when we learn that the title of Romero 's show is ' Frolics to You ' : this is a cheeky pun that Britons will get and Yanks won't.<br /><br />Vera - Ellen is , as usual , cute and appealing and an impressive dancer , but the very few musical numbers in this movie are boring and bad . The plot -- mistaken identity between magnate David Niven and reporter Gordon Jackson -- is brainless , though no more so than the plots of several dozen Hollywood musicals . Romero is less annoying than usual here , probably because ( for once ) he is n't required to convince us that he 's interested in bedding the heroine.<br /><br />The single biggest offence of this movie is its misuse of Bobby Howes . The father of Sally Ann Howes was a major star of West End stage musicals ; his wistful rendition of " She 's My Lovely " was a big hit in Britain in 1937 . Here , he shows up in several scenes as Romero 's dogsbody but never has a chance to participate in a musical number , nor even any real comedy . It 's absolutely criminal that this movie -- with a title containing the word ' Lovely ' , sure to evoke Howes 's greatest hit -- would cast a major British musical star but give him nothing to do!<br /><br />The delightful character actress Ambrosine Phillpotts ( whom I worked with once ) shines in one restaurant sequence , and there 's a glimpse of the doomed beauty Kay Kendall . As Vera - Ellen 's confidante , somebody named Diane Hart speaks in one of the most annoying voices I 've ever heard : it sounds like an attempt to imitate Joan Greenwood and Glynis Johns both at the same go , but does n't match either . Val Guest has a story credit , but this movie does n't come up to the quality of his brilliant comedies . The colour photography is wretched , though I realise that postwar Britain could not afford Hollywood 's process work . ' Happy Go Lovely ' is at utmost best a pleasant time - waster , with ' waster ' being the operative word . I 'll rate this movie just 4 out of 10 .
0 " Happy Go Lovely " has only two things going for it . And those two things are Vera - Ellen 's legs . This is a British ( Excelsior Films ) version of an M - G - M musical complete with second tier stars . I would imagine that Vera - Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star . But , I 'm sorry to say , Ms. Ellen 's chance did not pay off.<br /><br />Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune , this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy . The predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin , and with the exception of David Niven , Cesar Romero ( who is way over the top in his role of a Producer ) and Bobby Howes ( who is totally wasted in a nothing role ) the rest of the cast is totally forgettable.<br /><br />The choreography is boring , but Ms. Ellen gives it her all . She was never as famous as most of the other musical stars(and she should n't be since she could n't sing and even had a " dancing stand in " in several of her pictures " . But when she did dance , it was just entrancing.<br /><br />It 's too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine.<br /><br />4 out of 10
0 Happy Go Lovely is a waste of everybody 's time and talent including the audience . The lightness of the old - hat mistaken identity and faux scandal plot lines is eminently forgivable . Very few people watched these movies for their plots . But , they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots -- not here . They usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs . Not Happy Go Lovely . And Vera - Ellen as the female lead played the whole movie as a second banana looking desperately for a star to play off it -- and instead she was called upon to carry the movie , and could n't do it . The Scottish locale was wasted . Usually automatically ubiquitous droll Scottish whimsy is absent . The photography was pedestrian . The musical numbers were pedestrian . Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performance , chewing up the scenery since no one else was doing his part , in the type of producer role essayed frequently by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou . David Niven is just fine , and no one could do David Niven like David Niven . At the end of the day , if you adore Niven as I do , it 's reason enough to waste 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely . If not , skip it .
0 * * * May contain spoilers . * * * < br /><br />If LIVING ON TOKYO TIME were some bold experiment where real - life wanna - be actors were given film parts on the condition that they would be required to take a combination of powerful prescription anti - anxiety , anti - depression , and anti - psychotic medications ( this is the classic psych ward combo that renders patients into drooling zombies ) all during filming , then this movie would hold far more interest . Or , if the film production was another type of experiment where all of the actors were sleep deprived before and during filming , then TOKYO TIME could be more easily explained.<br /><br />As it is , this film is filled with lifeless , low - energy actors . In the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking with his sister , it appeared that he was having trouble keeping his eyes open . In almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting down with every part of his body motionless . From beginning to end , his facial expression is best described as " near sleep." < br /><br />Fret not about the actors speaking over each other 's lines because these actors can barely finish droning out any lines of dialog . Everyone speaks with a depressing , monotone voice . No laughing . No yelling . No vigor . No one has energy enough to crack a smile . The result : complete and total boredom.<br /><br />And it does not help matters that the direction is simple and amateurish.<br /><br />Avoid this lifeless film at all costs . Better to watch GREENCARD which has a similar plot and has charm and energy . Or , for an unconventional Japanese romance story , check out THE LONG VACATION which has an ample amount of everything LIVING ON TOKYO TIME does not .
0 I caught this film on AZN on cable . It sounded like it would be a good film , a Japanese " Green Card " . I ca n't say I 've ever disliked an Asian film , quite the contrary . Some of the most incredible horror films of all time are Japanese and Korean , and I am a HUGE fan of John Woo 's Hong Kong films . I an not adverse to a light hearted films , like Tampopo or Chung King Express ( two of my favourites ) , so I thought I would like this . Well , I would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious , badly acted film ever again.<br /><br />I think the director Steven Okazaki must have spiked the water with Quaalude , because no one in this film had a personality . And when any of the characters DID try to act , as opposed to mumbling a line or two , their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake . I honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before ... the ONLY person who sounded genuine was Brenda Aoki .. I find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy , because I did n't laugh once . Even MORE surprising is that CBS morning news called this " a refreshing breath of comedy " . It was neither refreshing , nor a breath of comedy . And the ending was very predictable , the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things.<br /><br />AVOID this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting . I actually think that " Spike of Bensonhurst " is a better acted film than this ... and I walked out half way through that film !
0 I have never understood the appeal of this show . The acting is poor ( Debra Jo Rupp being a notable exception ) , the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring , the dialogue is weak , the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode . Furthermore the link between this show and the ' 70s ' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny , clichéd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that . Both " Happy Days " and " The Wonder Years " employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible , pathetic excuse for a show
0 I 've tried to watch this show several times , but for a show called " That ' 70s Show , " I do n't find much apart from a few haircuts and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the ' 70s -- the decade in which I grew up . Of the episodes I have seen , most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period . Take away the novelty of ( supposedly ) being set in the ' 70s , and the show is neither interesting nor funny.<br /><br />If you 're looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in America in the ' 70s , in my humble opinion you can do no better than " The Wonder Years . "
0 As someone who lived through , and still remembers that decade vividly , if the actual ' 70s had been half this funny and ( semi)normal , they would have been so much more enjoyable . Actual kids in that era did not act or behave anything close to as bright - eyed and normal as these kids did . The country 's youth was still under the influence of the hippies and the drug culture all that ' 60s rebellion that it spawned , especially in the behavior department;the petulance , the smugness , the self - righteousness , the childishness , the unreasonableness of them - none of the characters exhibit any of that.<br /><br />Someone compared to " Happy Days",and I can see why : They were both sitcoms that take place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast , and they both offer only surface , cliched depictions of the actual eras , not even close to the full scope of it , just showing the obvious things - the fashions , toys , music , contraptions , etc , and that 's it . For those too young to remember , or were n't born then , trust me , the ' 70s were n't like that , any more than " Happy Days " were like the actual ' 50s , as " M*A*S*H * " did n't accurately portray life at a US Army medical base during the Korean War , etc .
0 Why is this show so popular ? It 's beyond me why people like it . I think it 's one of the worst sitcoms out there . < br /><br />Because it 's so popular , I 've tried more than once to watch it and I ca n't make it through an entire episode.<br /><br />For one thing , the acting is horrible . Everybody is overacting to the point where it 's annoying to watch . They talk in unnatural voices , use unnatural tones , and have unnatural body language . I 've seen better acting in a kindergarten school play.<br /><br />For another thing , it 's NOT FUNNY . The plots are dull . They 're not creative , intelligent , or FUNNY . Should n't a sitcom be funny ? ? Why am I not laughing?<br /><br />Lastly , what is seventies about this ? It 's about as authentic to the seventies as " Happy Days " was to the fifties.<br /><br />OH and what is up with Ashton Kutcher ? Who cast this untalented dweeb ? And now he 's making movies ? ? Oh , save us all!<br /><br />If people think this is quality television , it worries me .
0 The Invisible Maniac starts as a young Kevin Dornwinkle ( Kris Russell ) is caught by his strict mother ( Marilyn Adams ) watching a girl ( Tracy Walker ) strip through his telescope ... Cut to ' Twenty Years Later ' & Kevin Dornwinkle ( Noel Peters ) is now a physics professor who claims to have discovered a way to turn things invisible using a ' mollecular reconstruction ' serum . However during a demonstration in front of his fellow scientists it fails & they all laugh at him , Dornwinkle goes mad kills a few of them & is locked away in a mental institute from which he escapes . Jump forward ' Two Weeks Later ' & a group of summer college students discuss the tragic death of their physics teacher when the headmistress Mrs. Cello ( Stephanie Blake as Stella Blalack ) says that she has hired a replacement , yes you 've guessed it it 's Dornwinkle . The student do n't take to him & treat him like dirt , however Dornwinkle has perfected his invisibility serum & uses it to satisfy his perverted sexual urges & his desire for revenge ... <br /><br />Co - written & directed by Adam Rifkin wisely hiding under the pseudonym Rif Coogan ( I would n't want my name to be associated with this turd of a film either ) The Invisible Maniac is real bottom of the barrel stuff . The script by Rifkin , sorry Coogan & Tony Markes is awful . It tries to be a teenage sex / comedy / horror hybrid that just fails in every department . For a start the sex is nothing more than a few female shower scenes & a few boob shots , not much else I 'm afraid & the birds in The Invisible Maniac are n't even that good looking . The comedy is lame & every joke misses by the proverbial mile , this is the kind of film that thinks someone fighting an invisible man or having Henry ( Jason Logan ) a mute man trying to make a phone call is funny . The Invisible Maniac makes the Police Academy ( 1984 - 1994 ) series of films look like the pinnacle of sophistication ! As for the horror aspect that too is lame . It 's also an incredibly slow ( it takes over half an hour before Dornwinkles even becomes invisible ) , dull , predictable , boring & has highly annoying & unlikable teenage character's.<br /><br />Director Rifkin or Coogan or whatever does absolutely nothing to try & make The Invisible Maniac an even slightly enjoyable experience . There 's no scares , tension or atmosphere & as a whole the film is a real chore to sit through . He does nothing with the invisibility angle , just a few doors opening on their own is as adventurous as it gets . There is very little gore or violence , a bit of splashing blood , a few strangulations & the only decent bit in the whole film when someone has their head blown off with a shotgun , unfortunately he was invisible at the time & we only get to see the headless torso afterwards.<br /><br />The budget must have been low , & I mean really low because this is one seriously cheap looking film . Dornwinkles laboratory is basically two jars on his bedside cabinet ! When he escapes from the mental institution he has all of one dog sent after him & the entire school has about a dozen pupils & two teachers . The Invisible Maniac is a poorly made film throughout it 's 85 minute duration , I spotted the boom mike on at least one occasion ... Lets just say the acting is of a low standard & leave it at that.<br /><br />The Invisible Maniac is crap , plain & simple . I found no redeeming features in it at all , there are so many more better films out there you can watch so there is no reason whatsoever to waste your time on this rubbish . Definitely one to avoid .
0 Take one look at the cover of this movie , and you know right away that you are not about to watch a landmark film . This is cheese filmmaking in every respect , but it does have its moments . Despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives , the story is actually interesting at some points , although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the cheerleading squads ' shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personality - free boyfriends . The acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot , which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audience 's attention.<br /><br />In The Nutty Professor , a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a potion that can turn him into a cool and stylish womanizer , whereas in The Invisible Maniac , a mentally damaged professor discovers a potion that can make him invisible , allowing him to spy on ( and kill , for some reason ) his students . Boring fodder . Do n't expect any kind of mental stimulation from this , and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone maniacal laughter which gets real annoying real quick ...
0 Here 's an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase " low budget " a horrible name . Our physics teacher who has about nine kids creates a strange serum that causes " molecular reorganization " . Students are hopelessly killed from fake coincidences of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies . Sounds like a resurrection of classic B - movies from the 50s , right ? Nope ! It 's not an example of high camp fun , which is way , WAY off the mark . A glamorous showcase of breasts and butts ensues our desire for pleasure , opposing the horror that should have had 99.44 % more in the first place . Bottom - of - the - barrel entertainment at its best , aided by pints of red blood and dead student bodies . Atrocious movies like this would make the ultimately catastrophic GURU THE MAD MONK ( 1970 ) the work of an intelligent genius who has a Master 's degree in film production ! It 's an automatic " F " , so rest easy !
0 Saw this late one night on cable . At the time I did n't know that the girl billed as " Shannon Wilsey " was actually porn star Savannah , but she was so beautiful ( and got naked so often , thank God ) that I actually sat through this brain - rotting drivel . I like cheesy flicks as much as the next guy -- more than the next guy , actually -- but this was way beyond cheesy and more into rancid . The truly annoying overacting by the mad scientist and the director 's , writers ' and special effects people 's virtually total incompetence detracts from the gratuitous nudity that is the movie 's only saving grace . Savannah , before she turned into the plasticized Barbie Doll she became as a porn queen , is really interesting to watch -- she 's drop - dead gorgeous , bursts into uncontrollable giggling at times , glances off - camera and laughs and just generally seems to be having a really good time , which is more than can be said for the audience . For even though Savannah and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this picture naked , it still ca n't hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid , badly made and annoying movie . If you know someone who has it on video , or if it comes on cable some night , check it out , but do n't waste your money on a rental .
0 This movie is just plain bad . It is n't even worth watching to make fun of it . The lunatic professor is just plain annoying . Even suspending disbelief to allow for invisibility ( which I glady do for the sake of good bad movies ) and allowing for exceedingly stupid victims in a horror movie , this movie asks for even more than that . If you are looking for women 's locker room shower scenes , and random sexual encounters , get a porn , if you are looking for a good - bad movie , get something else . If you want to simply waste your time on an annoying bad movie , rent this .
0 Okay guys , we know why we watch film like " The Invisible Maniac " ( just look at the cover , man ! ) . T and A all over the place ( with a lot more T than A ) . But ... shouldn't there be a story to go with it?<br /><br />"C'mon , " I can hear you say - " this is just girls gettin ' naked ! Who needs a story??!" < br /><br />Well , if this were called " The NAKED Maniacs " , I would n't have a problem . But since these guys are cribbing from " The Invisible Man " , they need to have a bit of story hereabouts , you know , to keep your mind busy.<br /><br />However , all they can muster up is how this crazy doctor creates an invisibility serum and , when he cracks , uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot of teenagers . And when you see the smarmy - looking teenagers he goes after , you 'll be grateful.<br /><br />One star , for the T and A , but there 's a little too much gore for you skin fans , so proceed with caution.<br /><br />TIDBIT - yes , it 's THAT Savannah .
0 I loved the Batman tv series and was really looking forward to this . But they tried to do too much.<br /><br />Why they had the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me . I do n't want to knock Burt or Adam for the way they look now ..... It 's been 35 years since they appeared at Batman and Robin , but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting ' badguys ' was kinda sad . I would rather of just seen the ex - stars do commentary . The batmobile side story was stupid.<br /><br />As for the flashback movie , I think it was too short and left out way too much . It was really just a quick overview in my opinion . I 'd like more background . They showed the Penguin and Joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff I already knew . The Joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex - smoker . That was it on those 2.<br /><br />I'd love to read the book . I am sure it has more in it that this showed . Like why was there 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman 's or 3 Mister Freezes . Where was Commishioner Gordon , Cheif OHara , Alfred , Mister Freeze , King Tut , etc . the List goes on . Like I said even the ones that were in this one were barely in it.<br /><br />Very disappointing . And really corny .
0 I may not be the one to review this movie because after 45 minutes of pure boredom and stupidity I turned the channel . The original series only lasted 2 years which can be said about the careers for Adam West and Burt Ward . Put these two " actors " in a stupid movie and the result is twice as bad .
0 How sheep - like the movie going public so often proves to be . As soon as a few critics say something new is good ( ie - " Shake - Cam " ) , everyone jumps on the bandwagon , as if they are devoid of independent thought . This was not a good movie , it was a dreadful movie . 1 ) Plot ? - What plot ? Bourne was chased from here to there , from beginning to end . That 's the plot . Do n't look for anything deeper than this . 2 ) Cinematography ? - Do me a favor ! Any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8 mm movie camera would do a far better job ( I am not exaggerating here ) . This film is a tour - de - force of astonishingly amateurish camera - work . The ridiculous shaking of EVERY ( I really do mean every ) scene will cause dizziness and nausea . 3 ) Believable ? - Oh yes definitely . This is a masterpiece of credibility . I loved scenes about Bourne being chased by ( local ) police through the winding market streets of Tangier . - I 've BEEN to Tangier . Even the guides ca n't navigate their way through those streets but Bourne shook off 100 police with speed and finesse . Greengrass must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples . 4 ) Editing ? - I do n't know what the editor was on when he did this film but I want some ! - Every scene is between 0.5 and 2 seconds . I felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the " scenes " flashing by . 5 ) Directing ? - Hmmm . This is an interesting aspect . The film appears to have actually NOT had any directing . More a case of Greengrass throwing a copy of the script ( all two pages ) at the cameramen and told to " shoot a few scenes whilst drunk " . - " Do n't worry boys , we 'll tie the scenes together in the editing room " . The editor should be tarred , feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6 ) Not one but TWO senior CIA operatives giving the tender feminine treatment to the mistreated and misunderstood Jason Bourne . - Putting their lives on the line for someone they could n't even be sure was n't a traitor . Talk about stupid nincompoops . ( Whilst the evil male CIA members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paper - clip on the floor ) . ( well , all men are evil , are n't they ? - Except for SNAGS of course ) . Yes , this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity . 7 ) When the you - know - what finally hits the fan , good triumphs over evil ( just like it always does , eh ? ) and the would - be assassin gets the drop on Jason Bourne - he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger ( Yeah - right ... ) - at that very moment , the evil deputy director just happens to turn up - gun in hand and he does pull the trigger . - How did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath ? Wonders will never cease 8) Do n't worry , there 's a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts . Well , we ca n't have nasty , politically incorrect , CIA operatives going round shooting people , can we ? How lovely to see a true to life P.C. film of the Noughties . -------------The Bourne Ultimatum is utter rubbish .
0 I do n't understand people . Why is it that this movie is getting an 8.3 ! ! ! ! ! ! ? ? ? ? I had high hopes for this movie , but once i was about a half hour into it I just wanted to leave the theater . In the vast majority of the reviews on this site people are saying that this is one of the best action movies they 've seen ( or of the summer , year , etc . ) They say it 's an excellent conclusion . WTF ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ? ? What has been concluded ( besides the fact that Bourne can ride motorcycles , shoot , and fight better than anyone else he comes across ) ? What do you learn about Bourne 's character in this movie?????????Absolutely f * * * * * * nothing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Okay , there 's a lot of action , but what 's so great about the action in this movie ? ? I do n't like the cinematography and film editing . The shaky camera effect and fast changing shots were used TOO much and they get old fast ( I did n't mind them in Supremacy because it was still easy to follow and was not used in excess ) and made me quite dizzy . I was quickly wishing I had saved my $ $ $ for something else.<br /><br />This movie has no plot . All this movie is is a 115 minute chase seen . Bourne , who you learn absolutely nothing about in the entire 115 minutes of the movie , is a perfectionist at everything he attempts . There is absolutely no character development in this movie , you know nothing about anyone , and there is a wide array of new characters that are introduced in this installment . Some people said that this movie has incredible writing and suspense . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! What writing ? ? ? ? What suspense ? ? ? There 's no suspense . Bourne is so perfect at doing everything he does , I do n't think he has anything to worry about . If this is the best movie of the year 2007 I may just quit watching movies entirely ! ! ! ! < br /><br />Many people have also said that Matt Damon 's performance in this movie is one of the best ( if not the best ) of his career . What performance ? ? How many lines did he have in this movie ? ? ? I have some respect for Damon because he has been in movies that I liked and has played different kinds of characters , but a good actor is someone that you can barely recognize from one movie to the next , someone who chooses different types of roles . Not someone who plays the same roles over and over again ( which Damon does n't do , but an example of someone who does is Vin Diesel).<br /><br />Anyways , this movie was a BIG disappointment to me . I do not recommend this movie but I do recommend the first two ( Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy ) and I most definitely recommend reading the three books ( which are much different then the movies ) .
0 Users who have rated this movie so highly simply ca n't have seen enough good films to compare it with . Have they all been brainwashed ? ? I have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie.<br /><br />From the first , BU is just a chase film . We pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another . And another . And another . And another . Do you see a pattern emerging ? There is virtually no time ' wasted ' on plot , character development , or boring old reality.<br /><br />If you have n't see the other two Bourne films , you 're pretty lost . If you have - you only WISH you were lost - somewhere a long way from a cinema.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass 's dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on United 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen , but on Bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character . He runs . He jumps . He punches . He gets blown up . He clears tall buildings . Yada yada yada . Above all - he SURVIVES . He survives like a plastic Action Man survives , which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension . So he drives off a building ? So what ? He 'll survive . Yawn.<br /><br />There 's a girl thrown into the mix because Bourne 's love interest died in a previous incarnation , but she 's just decor . I 've seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of Captain Scarlet.<br /><br />Bourne 's own journey of literal self - discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we did n't know from the first movie . He was turned into a killing machine . Big deal . He finds out his true identity . So what ? It does n't have any emotional resonance when it comes.<br /><br />The ' twist ' ending is telegraphed and weak . Oh , dear , the more I think about this film the more I hate it ! I 've already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment ! I 'd better end now before the slide continues.<br /><br />I love a good action flick and I love a good thriller . The Bourne Ultimatum is neither . It 's a loud , tedious series of flashy edits , ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence . < br /><br />The idea that it ' shows the way ' to the Bond franchise is utter crap . Casino Royale blows it out of the water .
0 Macy , Ullman and Sutherland were as great as usual . Ritter was n't bad either . What 's her name was as pretty as usual . It could have been a good movie . To bad the plot was atrocious . It was completely predictable , trite and boring.<br /><br />From the first 15 minutes , the rest of the movie was laid out like a child 's paint by numbers routine . The characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard . There was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting , which was a pity.<br /><br />Finally , too bad the script writer was n't the victim . Especially with the " precocious " lines from the child , which were completely unbelievable.<br /><br />Again , it 's only the acting that prevented a much lower score .
0 Undeveloped / unbelievable story line,(by the time I sort of figured out where it was going , I no longer cared ) bad casting.(come on ... William Macy as a hit man ? ? ? ) bad directing,(have you ever seen Tracey Ullman perform SO badly?)(Was I supposed to care what happened to the unethical incompetent , uncaring John Ritter character ? ) bad script ... ( Really , I 'm not looking for a formula script but this was really awful ) the only Really good thing in it was the kid . Ten lines ? It 's not OK if your comment is less than ten lines ? COme on-- whose rules are those ? Why ca n't I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines ? ? ? Is n't that kind of arbitrary ? Why is n't it OK to have less than 10 lines of comment ?
0 I watched this movie , and hoped for something to get better the entire time . What is so great about a guy with no emotion ? * yawn*<br /><br />You never see Alex show emotion for anyone other than his son . Yeah , I know that this is why his son is the only one to cause him to lose his temper ( if you can call it that ) , I get it.<br /><br />Characters are undeveloped , relationships are n't given enough time to be understood . In one scene Sarah says they wo n't fall in love , and the next time we see her she 's talking about how his death really shook her up because they were so close ? Logic synapses abound in this film.<br /><br />It 's like someone watched Boogie Nights and wrote this part to mimic Little Bill . Even the scene where he " loses his temper " is the same as when Little Bill shoots his wife , down to the facial expression ( or lack thereof ) . Yes , William H. Macy is good at portraying a man without emotion - been there , done that - can you say Magnolia?<br /><br />This movie did n't only lack emotion , it lacked substance , a good script , developed characters , and a plot . And it certainly lacks my recommendation . : ) < br /><br />~A~
0 I can not believe this woodenly written and directed piece of cliche film got made . There are about four good looking shots ( the director should think about switching to still photography ) and that 's it . A strong cast is utterly wasted , scenes repeatedly end at the least interesting moments and the script says nothing new . Please spare yourself this movie .
0 Some kids are hiking in the mountains , and one of them goes into a large tunnel and discovers some old mummified gladiator . He puts on the gladiator 's helmet and spends the rest of the movie killing all the other hikers.<br /><br />This thing is just so utterly senseless it 's maddening . Here 's a short list of things that do n't make any sense:<br /><br />1 ) A guy and a girl are in their tent and they think they hear something outside . The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside . Then he hears his girlfriend scream so they head back to the tent - arriving the next morning ? ! ? He was only 50 feet away!<br /><br />2 ) These two dunderheads then hear another girl scream ( What , 100 feet away ? ) , but do n't investigate because they 're afraid they 'll get lost.<br /><br />3 ) Another guy and a girl are walking around , and in about their 10th scene together the girl informs the guy that due to the circumstances , protocol no longer requires him to address her as professor . I mean , what the ... ? First off , that 's just a really stupid thing to say , secondly he never called her professor in the first nine scenes they were in together.<br /><br />4 ) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and he stops her , telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to wound without killing . Um , yeah , we kinda noticed she 's wounded and not dead because she 's up and walking around . But , thanks for that tidbit of information.<br /><br />5 ) One girl is tied up in Demonicus ' lair , and when someone attempts to free her , she instead instructs this person to go and get help . Um , look , idiot , if she set you free , which would take about 5 seconds , there would be no need to get help.<br /><br />And it just goes on and on . The whole middle part of the movie is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods , then they fight , then they pitch a tent and ignore the screams of their friends , then they wander around some more . It 's just so damned boring and pointless that I turned the DVD off halfway through . < br /><br />None of these characters are sympathetic , especially the ones that get the majority of the screen time . Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him - he looks like a kid in a Halloween costume , scrunching his face up to look evil . He runs , or should I say scampers around like he 's gay . The special effects are comedic , the acting is for the most part awful , and nothing makes any sense.<br /><br />Overall , maybe this concept could have produced an enjoyably campy film if they put some more time and effort into it , getting rid of the ludicrous dialogue , creating characters with actual likable personalities , having some sort of logical flow to the action , and maybe even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator outfit . But no , instead we get this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death .
0 My wife and I like to rent really stupid horror / sci - fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh . We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list . Now , when I say this movie is awful , I mean it in a good way . Everything about it , the acting , camera - work , story , costumes , is just so cheezy and low budget but that s what makes it so good . I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place . I really hope that whoever made this film was n't serious when they made it because if they were , then that would just be sad . If you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then I recommend this one .
0 This movie is so awful , it is hard to find the right words to describe it!<br /><br />At first the story is so ridiculous . A narrow - minded human can write a better plot ! The actors are boring and untalented , perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy Film.<br /><br />The camera receptions of the National Forest are the only good in this whole movie . I should feel ashame , because I paid for this lousy Picture.<br /><br />Hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline :-)
0 I mean really , how could Charles Band the head of Full Moon let a total stink - ball like DEMONICUS out . I mean it should never got the green light to begin with . The story is repetitive , the characters are weak at best , there is no real story on Tyranus other then he 's a bad dude . Then they writer or director goes out his way for a bad ending . That 's right a bad ending , Demonicus rises . The last survivor escapes a deadly cave in , then a picture of Chimera comes to life , cheaply I might add and chases her out . Then as she is walking home ala FUNHOUSE . A statue that has been destroyed centuries ago reappears for no reason just to collapse on top of her . I mean , that makes no sense . What the hell was Charles thinking allowing this pile of puke to be made , with four different movie companies they were that desperate for movies . They could have asked me , I had better ideas then DEMONICUS . THANKSGIVING TURKEY .
0 This movie is about Tyrannus , a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon Tyrannus , a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead . Tyrannus , we learn after about an hour , is also called Demonicus . This adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity , psychology and ourselves . < br /><br />The spirit of Tyrannus accomplishes his little to - do list ( killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in Latin ) by possessing the body of a college guy . He uses a magic mind - control helmet to do this , which the college boy willingly puts on his head , and then at several points in the movie , takes off and puts back on.<br /><br />Maria performs oral sex on a poor man 's Sean Willian Scott , and Tyrannus wears the Rollerball glove . Tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason , and has apparently been sitting next to CG fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this . Utter misfortune.<br /><br />This movie is empty and will hurt you . See it .
0 okay , this movie f*ck in ' rules . it is without question one of the most technically inept pieces of cinema ever made . absolutely terrible , but you GOTTA see it . rent this with your buddies and come up with a drinking game or just have fun , it 's hilarious . and the behind - the - scenes featurette proves it , you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint . awesome . okay , rent it just for this one scene : two characters are actually WALKING IN PLACE for about 3 minutes in a shot . the director ( on the commentary ) says " yeah , the tracking was so smooth it looks like they 're ... " . yeah , right man , they are totally walking in place . it 's so funny .
0 WARNING SPOILERS * * * * * A really stupid movie about a group of young excursionists in Italy that find an armor of mythical warrior with a demonic souls . One of them wears it and becomes possessed by the spirit of a demon . It 's killing time and several of his friends die under his blade to revive the demon corpse.<br /><br />A waste of time for the viewers , as the fine young ladies in the movie leave their clothes on , the gore is ludicrous at best , and the acting is terrible , perfect pairing for such a bad script < br /><br / >
0 For some reason , various young couples hiking through the Italian Alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first . James ( Gregory Lee Kenyon ) enters a cave , finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of " Tyranus " when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse . He then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead " Demonicus " back to life . This shot - on - digital Full Moon release is stupid , senseless , has terrible acting and sound and the ( Los ) Angeles National Forest is a poor substitute for Italy . However , it 's pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance . Whether bug - eyed running around in cheap - looking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic Latin gibberish about demons and resurrection , Kenyon 's ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed . Oh well , at least he 's not boring like most of the rest of the cast .
0 This film is exactly what you get when you really over stretch your abilities , it 's like someone who has just passed there driving test and then pitting them in a formula 1 Grand Prix ( not I might add , the US Grand Prix as everyone might pull out due to dodgy tyres and you might just win ) , that is how far short this film falls . Now do n't take this the wrong way , I love B - Movies , around half my collection is made of B - Movies but I do n't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is.<br /><br />First of the story ( for a B - Movie ) is n't that bad , it has potential there to make a B - Movie brand , were not talking Friday 13th potential , but potential none the less . But what really lets this film down is the acting , at not one second do I believe anything , it 's like watching QVC except the presenters on QVC tend to have a heavier tan.<br /><br />In summary I 'd like to say I 've seen worse films , but I ca n't .
0 I rented this one to see Vanesa Talor one more time . She can act , but does n't get a chance in this clunker . The opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes . Must have come from a stock archive , because the movie is shot direct to videotape . The production values make _ Blair Witch _ look professional . There 's a really cheesy animated statue , but no other effects worth noting . This movie is bad , but not amusingly so . The players would do well not to mention it on their resumes .
0 Seriously . I just wrapped up my first viewing of Demonicus and words have failed me.<br /><br />I remember a time when I would see Charles Band 's name on a film and my heart would race . He was never a Wes Craven or a John Carpenter . He was a bastion of hope for the little man . The guy whose movies arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex , but they still rocked harder than most of the trendy junk we otherwise had to endure.<br /><br />And now ... this.<br /><br />A painfully - obvious Californian walking trail doubles for " the Alps " and an abandoned train tunnel is actually supposed to be " an ancient cave " . I mean , they did n't even try to dress the thing up with moss or film it in a way that might suggest it was anything other than an old train tunnel ! Ugh ! Instead of a creepy demon gladiator , as the cover implies , we 're treated to a dude wearing the latest in Wal - Mart Halloween apparel . There 's a pretty cool looking corpse , who occasionally comes to life to belch and wiggle his fingers , but he does n't even learn to stand until the final five minutes . Why could n't he be the villain ? Instead , we 've got frat boy Joe with a plastic sword . Ouch.<br /><br />Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is attached to such tripe . I love movies that are so bad , they 're good . Hell , I occasionally enjoy a flick that s so bad , its just bad . This one , however , is just unwatchable . A perfect example of making a buck , rather than making a quality film .
0 Although I have to admit I laughed more watching this movie than the last few comedies I saw.<br /><br />The budget must have consisted of pocket change from the actors . The production values are so low that they actual made it kind of fun to watch . Reminds me of the Robot Monster made up of a guy in a gorilla suit with a cardboard diving helmet on.<br /><br />In one scene a hapless victim gets their arm and leg cut off . Geez , hard to believe but the Black Knight scene from Holy Grail was more realistic . I kept wondering why the victim did n't start shouting " None Shall Pass " and " It 's only a flesh wound , I 've had worse " . It was one of the funniest scenes I 've seen in the past year.<br /><br />The " gladiator / demon " was a stitch too . Between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky look of the guy in it the end result was hysterical.<br /><br />Truly a movie that is bad enough to be watchable . Kind of like seeing a slow motion auto accident on film.<br /><br / >
0 When George C. Scott played the title role in " Patton , " you saw him directing tanks with pumps of his fist , shooting at German dive bombers with a revolver , and spewing profanity at superiors and subordinates alike . The most action we get from Gregory Peck as " MacArthur , " a figure from the same war of debatably greater accomplishment , is when he taps mapboards with his finger and raises that famous eyebrow of his.<br /><br />Comparing Peck 's performance with Scott 's may be unfair . Yet the fact " MacArthur " was made by the same producer and scored by the same composer begs parallels , as does the fact both films open with the generals addressing cadets at West Point . It 's clear to me the filmmakers were looking to mimic that Oscar - winning film of a few years before . But while Peck looks the part more than Scott ever did , he comes off as mostly bland in a story that feels less like drama than a Wikipedia walkthrough of MacArthur 's later career.<br /><br />"To this day there are those who think he was a dangerous demagogue and others who say he was one of the greatest men who ever lived , " an opening title crawl tells us . It 's a typical dishwater bit of post - Vietnam sophistry about those who led America 's military , very much of its time , but what we get here is neither view . MacArthur as presented here does n't anger or inspire the way he did in life.<br /><br />Director Joseph Sargent , who went on to helm the famous turkey " Jaws The Revenge , " does a paint - by - numbers job with bland battle montages and some obvious set use ( as when the Chinese attack U.S. forces in Korea ) , while the script by Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins trots out a MacArthur who comes across as good - natured to the point of blandness , a bit too caught up in his public image , but never less than decent.<br /><br />Here you see him stepping off the landing craft making his return to the Phillipines . There you see him addressing Congress in his " Old Soldiers Never Die " speech . For a long stretch of time he sits in a movie theater in Toyko , waiting for the North Koreans to cross the 38th parallel so we can get on with the story while newsreel footage details Japan 's rise from the ashes under his enlightened rule . Peck 's co - actors , Marj Dusay as his devoted wife ( " you 're my finest soldier " ) and Nicolas Coaster as a loyal aide , burnish teary eyes in the direction of their companion 's magnificence but garner no interest on their own.<br /><br />Even when he argues with others , Peck never raises his voice and for the most part wins his arguments with thunderous eloquence . When Admiral Nimitz suggests delaying the recapture of the Philippines , a point of personal pride as well as tactical concern for MacArthur , MacArthur comes back with the comment : " Just now , as I listened to his plan , I thought I saw our flag going down . " Doubtless the real Nimitz would have had something to say about that , but the character in the movie just bows his head and meekly accepts the insult in the presence of President Roosevelt.<br /><br />The only person in the movie who MacArthur seriously disagrees with is Harry S Truman , who Ed Flanders does a fine job with despite a prosthetic nose that makes him resemble Toucan Sam . Truman 's firing of MacArthur should be a dramatic high point , but here it takes place in a quiet dinner conversation , in which Peck plays MacArthur as nothing less than a genial martyr.<br /><br />I've never been sold by Peck 's standing at the upper pantheon of screen stars ; he delivers great presence but lacks complexity even in many of his best - known roles . But it 's unfair to dock him so much here , as he gets little help defining MacArthur as anything other than a speechifying bore . Except for two scenes , one where he rails against the surrender of the Philippines ( " He struck Old Glory and ran up a bedsheet ! " ) and another where he has a mini - breakdown while awaiting the U.S. invasion of Inchon , inveighing against Communists undermining him at the White House , Peck really plays Peck here , not the complex character who inspired the famous sobriquet " American Caesar . " The real MacArthur might have been worthy of such a comparison . What you get here is less worthy of Shakespeare than Shakes the Clown .
0 This Film was done in really poor taste . The script was really bad . I feel really sad for the late Gregory Peck who took on the title role of this B - movie adaptation of one of history 's greatest generals . The movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the Japanese in World War 2 . There was a scene where I almost vomited , it showed Macarthur in a bunker in Corregidor island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded , one legged Filipino soldier . The soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says : ` no papa , no mama , no uncle sam ' and Macarthur gives his little pep talk that Americans ` would never abandon ' the Philippines . The scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by Macarthur 's words and gives him a smart salute . I mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the U.S. as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake . It showed that Filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great Americans solely for redemption . It blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the USAFFE ( United States Armed Forces of The Far East ) , these are Filipino volunteers that were integrated in the US military during world war 2 , who died side by side with the Americans fighting the Japanese , who walked side by side with Americans in the death march of Bataan and defended Corregidor island by launching a guerilla offensive after Macarthur left for Australia with his famous ` I shall return ' speech . My late grandfather , a Filipino world war 2 veteran and USAFFE soldier was one of the many who fought the Japanese with honor and love for the home country . I think this movie does not give honor to them and to the thousands of others that Macarthur relied on for intelligence preparations for his famous return in the Leyte gulf landing .
0 Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 film.<br /><br />There is a good story here about the Axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war . Unfortunately , this part of the story is not emphasized . Instead , we deal with a supposedly bungling Boyer . By the way , Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin.<br /><br />The real acting kudos goes to veteran Oscar winner Katina Paxinou . As was the case with her memorable Pilar in the 1943 Oscar winner , " For Whom the Bell Tolls , " Paxinou again plays a Spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double - crossing counter - spy for the pro - Franco group . She is quite a vicious character here;especially , when she throws a 14 year old child out the window . She believed that Boyer had given the child important material to hide .
0 Yet another forgettable Warners foreign intrigue " thriller , " this is rendered even less enjoyable by the irritating presence of Lauren Bacall , who , without Humphrey Bogart 's tender attentions to humanize her , comes off as her usual shrill , shallow self . Even master gigolo Charles Boyer can not feign romantic interest in her .
0 ( Review in English , since Swedish is not allowed)<br /><br />I saw this movie with extremely low expectations , and I can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to them.<br /><br />As much as I loved to see Janne " Loffe " Karlsson on the big screen again , the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water , is n't original or funny . The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable , the ones that ai n't , is just plain boring . I smiled like three times during the entire film.<br /><br />The placement of Swedish Findus products is ( unintentionally ) funny , why not just a big sign saying ; " Findus made it happen!".<br /><br />Göta Kanal 2 does n't need to be seen at the cinema or on DVD , just wait for it to air on TV , it wo nt take too long .
0 OK now , lets see . What was funny in the first movie ? I know , people with funny accents , people falling into the water , silly boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams . In this movie they have twisted the accent part to the max , no good . A whole a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons , no good . Boatcrash , check . Funny comments between the two teams , they tried but failed . Also , there are too may personalities they are following in this movie . This film should be about what is happening on the water , not on land . I am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the max . No good . All in all , I give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts .
0 ... for one of the worst Swedish movies ever ... forgive me for being dull.<br /><br />First of all i have n't seen the first one ( i was bored that 's my reason for watching the 2nd before the 1st one ) , well i hope the first one is better than this , it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes , For the people that have seen this and think 4/10 is high ( belive me so do i ) , but it made me laugh a few times , because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea , what 's next " Det sjunde inseglet II " . Sequels not based on novel or book does n't turning out great to often , and this is a perfect example of one.<br /><br />OK i 'm gon na be honest with you : i did laugh a bit , it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor . But do n't buy it , rent it . Just let some other idiot do it or download it.<br /><br />4/10 This movie will be remembered and the director is probably laughed out already ...
0 This must be one of the worst Swedish movies ever made . < br /><br />It is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas as recently as year 2006.<br /><br />I've never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie . It should n't be that obvious . < br /><br />I ca n't understand why so many known actors even thought the idea to even be visible in a movie like this . If I had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before I saw the movie , it is gone for sure now . < br /><br />I've heard that there will be a follow up movie to this one and I ca n't understand how that is even possible .
0 The story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no - brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring . Some of the audience seemed to find it funny but I like more intelligent humor.<br /><br />There were several known Swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script . Lena Endre was good looking as always.<br /><br />I do n't remember the original movie so I ca n't say if it 's better or worse.<br /><br />If you enjoy movies like Sällskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at .
0 do nt ever ever ever consider watching this sorry excuse for a film . the way it is shot , lit , acted etc . just does n't make sense . it 's all so bad it is difficult to watch . loads of clips are repeated beyond boredom . there seems to be no ' normal ' person in the entire film and the existence of the ' outside world ' is , well , it just does n't exist . and why does that bald guy become invincible all of a sudden ? this film is beyond stupidity . zero .
0 After buying the DVD in a Bargain Bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover , I popped it in the DVD player and everything looked good . Nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra features ... but when I played the movie itself , what a let down . It is the worst thing I have ever seen and I have seen some bad movies in my time . The comment that praises the movie here at IMDB is actually from the people who made the film . So Do n't Believe It unless you like to waste your cash !
0 I wrote a review of this movie further down after buying it on DVD and being sorely disapointed.<br /><br />I tried watching it again after reading a few of the comments made since then . Being a film student and making similar budgeted movies myself ( ie no budget , shot on digi cam ) , I stand by my original comments . This is a no budget student project ( and not a particularly good one ) , released on video / dvd to look like an award winning film ( if you read the cover ) . So deceving the public into thinking it 's something it 's not . I want my money back under the trades description act ! Complete Rubbish !
0 Yes , this movie make me feel real horror , when i realized that i paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to watch it . The bald guy just give me the impression of being a psycho - Junkie actor and the girl is the worst actress i ever seen . Believe me if you appreciate your time avoid this movie , i understand a movie requires money to be created and some movies do not have that money but that is no justification for a stupid plot and bad acting . I 'm always supporting independent movies , when it deserves the support , but movies like this makes a bad name for this kind of movies . I 'm still traumatized . I will not trust in any nice cover anymore .
0 An unmarried woman named Stella ( Bette Midler ) gets pregnant by a wealthy man ( Stephen Collins ) . He offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own . Things go OK until the child named Jenny ( Trini Alvarado ) becomes a teenager and things gradually ( and predictably ) become worse.<br /><br />I've seen both the silent version and sound version of " Stella Dallas " . Neither one affected me much ( and I cry easily ) but they were well - made if dated . Trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea . I guess Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of " Beaches " to get this made . This ( predictably ) bombed . The story is laughable and dated by today 's standards . Even though Midler and Alvarado give good performances this film really drags and I was bored silly by the end . Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason ( both good actors ) do n't help in supporting roles . Flimsy and dull . Really -- who thought this would work ? See the 1937 Stanwyck version instead . I give this a 1 .
0 " Stella " , starring Bette Midler in the title role , is an unabashed tearjerker . Set in upstate New York , Stella Claire works nights as a bar maid , pouring and dancing in a workingman 's saloon . One night , in comes a slumming medical intern , Stephen Dallas , who woos Stella , and in the course of their affair impregnates her . She spurns both his offers of marriage and abortion , sends him packing to a lucrative medical career , and raises her daughter herself in near - poverty . Flash - forward 16 years and the daughter has grown into a gorgeous , loving , young lady . Dr. Dallas is not out of the picture , still maintaining a tenuous , but caring relationship with his daughter and  .. I 'm rambling , and worse yet , making the movie sound somewhat interesting . The acting and screenwriting are so over - the - top you 'll let out a groan in almost every scene . The chief offender is Bette Midler , but close behind is John Goodman as her alcoholic buddy . Each scene seems more contrived than the preceding right up to the finale , which is truly a hoot . Taken as a dramatic piece , this film rates no more than grade D , but as camp , it scores an unintended B+.<br /><br / >
0 1937 's " Stella Dallas " with Barbara Stanwyck has n't exactly aged well -- how anyone thought a semi - updated version of the story would work now is a real puzzler . Perhaps they thought jaunty , cheerfully brash Bette Midler could make something out of it , but this hoary script defeats her . Plot about a female bartender having a baby out of wedlock , and years later giving the young girl over to the child 's wealthy father so she 'll have a shot at a better life , ca n't escape tatty , old - fashioned trappings and sentiment . Midler works best with a movie director who can control her excesses , but that fails to happen here ; Stephen Collins is stolid as the man who changes her life , but Trini Alvarado is well - cast as Midler 's daughter . This is what used to be referred to as a " woman 's picture " , a wallow , but it does n't pass muster because it stays too faithful to its 1930 's origins . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 I suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early Sofia Loren film . She was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953.<br /><br />I viewed this film because I wanted to see some of Sofia Loren 's early work . I was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an Ethiopian princess . Surely , today , this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making . It actually became annoying watching Ms. Loren in skin color paint throughout the film.<br /><br />Yes , this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie . Then , the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent . I discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight.<br /><br />As beautiful as Ms. Loren was at age 19 and still is today , the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage . After all , we do n't see beautiful young people on stage with " old opera singers " back stage singing from behind the curtain ! Do not discount the success of using heavy - weight opera singers . One only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the J. G. Wentworth Company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the company 's product . This is one of the best and entertaining TV commercials produced to date.<br /><br />The quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality . The color ink has faded much and that can not be helped.<br /><br />To improve this film on DVD the production company should add English language subtitles so that we , who do not speak Italian , can know what the lyrics are saying . It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes.<br /><br />Watch this film not because of the story of Aida nor the fact that this is an opera . Aside from Ms. Sofia Loren none of her co - actors are known nor remembered by this writer . Instead , watch this movie if you are a fan of Ms. Loren and wish to see her at age 19 -- no matter what the production is.<br /><br />Larry from Illinois
0 Sophia Loren plays Aida , in one of the worst films of all time . She ca n't lipsync . In terms of production values , the film is so bad , that at one point , while Loren is mouthing " O Patria Mia , " she leans onto what looks to be a stone wall for support , and the canvas set billows and shakes .
0 ... and not in a good way . BASEketball is a waste of film in all most every single way . It is offensive to all the senses . This does n't necessarily bother me , I 've seen plenty of bad movies , really bad movies before and will see them again . BASEketball though is a caliber film where you regret wasting ninety minutes of life sitting through it . The reason BASEketball offends me is that it stars Trey Parker and Matt Stone in a film they did n't write . Any respect I had for David Zucker has long since depleted . His recent spoof films are lazy messes that look and feel as if they were made by pre - pubescent boys snickering at penis jokes . " Airplane " was a revolutionary and very funny comedy , watching BASEketball you will be amazed to discover that they were made by the same person.<br /><br />I have so much respect for Trey Parker and Matt Stone . These men are the funniest and smartest comedians in mainstream entertainment today . Their pictures and South Park episodes are as relevant as they are funny . Every joke even the fart jokes have intelligence behind them . It 's easy to forget that there is a mature way to approach immaturity . I imagine BASEketball was a major growing experience for them because they hate the film for all the right reasons . It is a stupid mess with no sense of dignity or class . Parker and Stone have essentially whored themselves out . The film plays like a 90 minute episode of Family Guy.<br /><br />Parker and Stone have never been great actors . They 've been serviceable in their films . I ca n't really find a way to describe their performance in BASEketball , other than the fact that it feels like they are spoofing a spoof film spoofing a spoof film . Every line is delivered in such a silly winking way . It 's like they are trying to make fun of the worst of these type of pictures and yet they become them in the same way . I am reminded of the South Park episode " How to Eat with your Butt " where Cartman sits in a movie theater watching a gross out comedy with no plot or plausibility except to gross out , Parker and Stone use the same voices they did in that scene for this entire picture . Really it 's sad.<br /><br />And yet that is not my problem with BASEketball . My biggest gripe with the picture is that I sit there knowing that Parker and Stone are knowingly following this piece of crap script . I know that if they took the damn thing and rewrote it that this could have been salvaged to the point of being watchable . There is n't any indication that Zucker let them improv scenes either . Parker and Stone are merely tools to a bad director . BASEketball has some funny concepts and I think Parker especially if he were allowed to take Zuckers script could have elaborated on them more . Instead we get potty humor . Do n't rent BASEketball you can get the same laughs watching a group of grade schoolers joking around
0 On the 1998 summer blockbuster hit BASEketball ( 1998 ) : " This is one of those movies that is usually seen on the big jumbo - tron screen in a sports bar during the day - when everyone is quite drunk . Unfortunately , I was sober when I saw this movie." < br /><br />So quoted the late Gene Siskel for this lame - brained , supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior " There 's Something About Mary " in a one - upmanship game during July of 1998 . " Mary " was a gross - out fest , but in addition to the many gags , it had a lot of heart , which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer.<br /><br />"BASEketball " tried to outdo Mary , but it fizzled in more ways that one . You take the creators of " South Park , " Trey Parker and Matt Stone , who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera , the only member of ZAZ David Zucker helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck , and the other two Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture , a small bit by now 90 years young Ernest Borgnine , wasting his precious time in his distinguished career , dying on a hotdog and singing " I 'm Too Sexy " as he videotapes his will , Jenny McCarthy , who has little screen time as Borgnine 's not - too - weeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter , a bigger female part by Yasmine Bleeth as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters , and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey , Robert Vaughn as a corrupt archrival , and pointless cameos by " Airplane ! " alumni Kareem Abdul Jabaar and the late Robert Stack who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and it 's much fresher humor created by the ZAZ family . What do all these people make up ? A desperate cast and crew trying to replicate " Airplane ! " humor and mixing it up with the crudity of " South Park , " but failing in every way.<br /><br />To make this long 100-minute movie short , " BASEketball , " a real game invented by David Zucker and his friends in his hometown of Milwaukee , is about two lazy losers ( Parker and Stone ) and their pint - sized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball ( hence the title ) together on the driveway of one 's house . After Borgnine dies , he bequeaths the ownership of his BASEketball team , the Milwaukee Beers to Parker and Stone . Sure enough , the game goes national , and archrivals Vaughn and McCarthy want to take away ownership of the Beers team from them . But Bleeth is in love with both men , particularly Parker , and one poor , sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes ga - ga over them . Those are the characters , not strongly developed.<br /><br />Now witless gags ensue . Blood , electroshock hair , egg - throwing and screaming are among them . Parker and Stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital , but he pulls through the liver transplant . Borgnine sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will . McCarthy , who seemed to get over Borgnine 's death by choking on a frank right away , quickly massages Vaughn in the next scene . Cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits . There is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing . And David Zucker forces the parodies of " Riverdance " and " Titanic . " Parody forcing is nothing new to ZAZ , post " Airplane ! " and " The Naked Gun " series.<br /><br />And like Siskel , I was sober as well , but I was also getting sleepy . This movie should be played over and over to coarse - mannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers , but will they remain alert and awake , or pass out during the unfunny parts ? If they pass out , then they wo n't realize that they are luckily missing stupidity and absurdity . Hats off to them !
0 Eddie Murphy 's " Delirious " is completely and totally rude , crude , crass and lude . This is indeed the only way to describe this appalling , trashy piece of stand - up . Eddie Murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over . He does manage to be funny occasionally , but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex jokes.<br /><br />Forget it ! Unless you happen to enjoy Eddie 's foul style . I do n't think I will bother with " Eddie Murphy Raw " . I much prefer Eddie in the confines of a movie script.<br /><br />Saturday , January 17 , 1998 - Video
0 Two years before he wrote and directed " Arthur " , Steve Gordon had a minor hit with his screenplay for this crackpot comedic vehicle for Henry Winkler , then TV 's " The Fonz " . A 1950s college thespian ( and all - around jerk ) woos a co - ed and gets married without any employment prospects on the horizon ; to make ends meet , he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling , eventually becoming a " Gorgeous George "- like celebrity . Turning likable Winkler into an obnoxious goof - off probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time ( and a sure way to separate him from his television alter - ego ) , but the jokes and situations are often wrong - headed and mean , staged rather sloppily by director Carl Reiner . Particularly crude is a wincing bit involving Hervé Villechaize ( of " Fantasy Island " ) putting the moves on Polly Holliday ( Flo from " Alice " ) . As Henry 's beloved , Kim Darby looks a little out of her element -- particularly when surrounded by all these TV hams -- rendering the romance aspect of the script inconsequential . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 This film is awful . Not offensive but extremely predictable . The movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60 's . The father , the principal at the school , is going through a mid - life crisis . Enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students ' minds with some thought - provoking stuff , like think for yourself . The principal does n't agree with her teaching but she is pretty . You can connect the dots . His teenage daughter ( Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick ) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live . She gets some bad advice , hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning was n't being taught at her school . Shocking ! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro has mainly worked in TV , this movie plays like a more adult version of an after - school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms .
0 This movie was extremely depressing . < br /><br />The characters were so cold . The mother , who is he main character , is everything but " motherly " . OK , she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first . Her husband dies . She then goes to visit her son and meets this hunk who is sleeping with her daughter and ends up sleeping with him . Until this part , the movie is all right . Not excellent , but it can be watched . The guy is charming and who can blame her ? OK it 's not very motherly to sleep with your daughter 's lover but let 's blame that on the shock of losing her husband . < br /><br />She becomes totally obsessed with the guy . I think this is the part where I started to dislike the movie . She 's always there wanting to please him in an " old fashioned way " with snacks while he is working on her son 's house ( I guess this is the only thing she ever learned to do ) , as if it was the only way she could get his attention . The guy obviously is not very interested ( actually , it seems more like he considered sleeping with her a charitable activity ) and instead of being insulted by that , she continues to beg him to go to go to bed with her and to be nice to her when he becomes very abusive . " I want to please you " , she tells him in a desperate way while he is insulting her very badly . < br /><br />What outraged me in this movie , is the utter lack of self - respect the mother has for herself . She tells Craig something like " I am just a shapeless lump " the first time they sleep together . < br /><br />This movie is an insult to women kind . If it had been me , I would have bought myself a little object that would have brought me the same satisfaction and a lot less emotional pain ... :)
0 Although there are some snippets in this 4-part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform , these are not very well - developed , in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs.<br /><br />Although this program , as a whole , leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money , and for that it deserves some praise , almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to -- very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you , if asked , they think the drug war is designed to solve . For example , while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80 's , at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law , forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business . But instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence , the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame . Inexplicably , alcohol prohibition , the violence that ensued , and the subsequent reversal of prohibition , is totally ignored by this program.<br /><br />This program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users , and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war . The possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on . Use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems , but not all users do their drugs in excess , just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics.<br /><br />If you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government , for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science , has decided to totally prohibit , whose users it has decided to not - so - metaphorically wage war against , just forget about it . None of that is in here.<br /><br />On the other hand , this is hardly in the category of anti - drug propaganda . It is mostly an interesting neutrally - presented history of drugs in 20th century United States like marijuana , LSD , heroin , cocaine , MDMA , and Oxycontin . But there is a significant element of various people 's points of view with regard to drug laws , and most ( but not all ) of that is not very thoughtful or well - informed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality , especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana . < br /><br />The criminal justice system , along with its often harsh life - ruining penalties , is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem , but unfortunately there 's an epidemic in this nation of an as - yet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs , a lack of compassion for fellow humans , a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentally - approved , perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison / policing industry , and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity . It 's morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so , and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason . This is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs , yet this program ignores it.<br /><br />So , in sum , the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining . But when it comes to presenting a rational non - radical point of view with regard to drug policy , and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives , it 's pretty disappointing .
0 THE FBI STORY ( 1959 ) was Warner Bros. 149 minute epic tribute to the famous criminal investigation agency ! From a book by Don Whitehead came a somewhat laborious screenplay by Richard L. Green and John Twist and was directed with only a modicum of flair by Mervyn LeRoy . However it did have splendid colour Cinematography by Joseph Biroc and a helpful score by the studio 's musical magician Max Steiner!<br /><br />The movie charts the history of the Bureau from its lowly beginnings in the twenties to modern times and its all seen through the recollections of aging fastidious agent Chip Hardesty ( James Stewart ) as he relates his investigative experiences - in flashback - to a class of budding young agents . But it 's all very long - winded and episodic ! And as it progresses it begins to look like a TV mini series instead of a major movie production as the young Hardesty runs the American crime gamut from taking on such notorious criminal figures as " Baby Face " Nelson , Ma Barker , Dillinger etc . to sorting out nefarious organisations like the Ku Klux Klan , Nazi spy rings and the Red Menace . And here it has to be said that only for the screen presence and appeal of its star THE FBI STORY would probably have ended up a forgotten disaster . Moreover , this is another problem with the picture - Stewart is left to carry the entire movie almost on his own ! With the exception of Vera Miles - who has the thankless role of being his long suffering but devoted wife - he is surrounded by a cast of minor players ! Throughout you find yourself half expecting someone like Robert Ryan , Jack Palance or even Raymond Burr to make a welcome entrance as a mobster or a police chief or whatever . But nothing quite as imaginative as that ever occurs ! Pity!<br /><br />The film does however manage to give a good look inside the workings of the Bureau ! With the help of Stewart 's narration we learn about the thousands of men and women who work for the organisation which includes the hundreds of agents in the field . And we are also treated to a peek inside headquarters which houses the gigantic records section and we also get a glimpse of the chemists and fingerprint experts meticulously going through their daily chores.<br /><br />Another plus for the movie is Max Steiner 's remarkable score ! Heard over the titles is a powerful , rousing and determined march while for the picture 's gentler moments there is an attractive love theme . But quite ingenious is the menacing and ominous march theme for the Ku Klux Klan sequence . And better still is the rhythmic Latin - American music the composer wrote for the South American scenes especially the exciting Fandango like orchestrations for the arrival of the Federal troops on horseback . THE FBI STORY was one of five scores the composer wrote in 1959 which included Samuel Bronston 's naval epic " John Paul Jones " , the charming Rom - com " Cash McCall " , Delmer Daves ' seminal western " The Hanging Tree " and Daves ' " A Summer Place " from which derived the Young Love Theme - which was to become a major hit tune for Steiner better known as " Theme From A Summer Place".<br /><br />THE FBI STORY just about passes muster as a movie thanks to Biroc 's rich colour Cinematography , Steiner 's wonderful music and of course Jimmie Stewart who makes anything watchable!<br /><br />Classic but implausible line from THE FBI STORY ............. As the bland Nick Adams ( who has just blown up a plane with 43 people on board , including his mother ) is being led away handcuffed he turns to the arresting officer and blurts : " In case I get any mail you can send it to Canyon City prison for the next month or so - after that you can send it to HELL " . Wow !
0 Pedantic , overlong fabrication which attempts to chronicle the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigations . Begins quite promisingly , with a still - relevant probe into an airplane explosion , however the melodrama involving James Stewart and wife Vera Miles just gets in the way ( Miles had a habit of playing tepid wives under duress , and her frayed nerves arrive here right on schedule ) . Esteemed director Mervyn LeRoy helmed this adaptation of Don Whitehead 's book , but despite the talent involved , the picture fails to make much of an impression . Best performance is turned in by Murray Hamilton as Stewart 's partner , however most of the dialogue is ludicrous and the dogged pacing causes the movie to seem twice as long as it is . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 This film is to the F.B.I. 's history as Knott 's Berry Farm is to the old west . Shamelessly sanitized version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation fight against crime . Hoover 's heavy hand ( did he have any other kind ? ) shows throughout with teevee quality script - reading actors , cheesy sets , cheap sound effects and lighting 101 . With Jimmy Stewart at 20 % of dramatic capacity , Vera Miles chewing the scenery , the film features every c - lister known in the mid - fifties with nary a hint of irony or humor , from the ' Amazon jungle ' to the ' back yard barbecue ' , everything reeks of sound stages and back lots . Even the gunshots are canned and familiar . I imagine Mervyn Leroy got drunk every night . Except for a few ( very few ) interesting exterior establishing shots , nothing here of note beyond a curio .
0 This movie certainly proves , that also the good Americans can do terribly good propaganda . No questions being asked , no comments being made on power abuse or police terror , when James Stewart , solid and convincing as always , solves all the stories from Dillinger to 5th Column more or less singlehandedly . June Allyson as his regular love interest holds up the family values and E.J. Hoover is executive producer . And children or non guilty bystanders are never harmed , when the professionals execute . Not to speak of civil rights , which are never broken or homes , which are never intruded . And if the FBI service would not be enough , Steward also gives his son 's life for the country in WW II . Perfectly made , if you would n't know better ....
0 Not much to say beyond the summary , save that this is an example of J. Edgar 's Hoover 's constant attention to maintaining a good " PR " profile . They do n't make movies this bad very often , especially with the likes of Jimmy Stewart and Vera Miles in the blend . Too bad . < br /><br / >
0 Recap : Doctor Markov has developed a new theory how to produce energy , knowledge that might unbalance the world . He keeps his knowledge coded and secret and desperately wants out of the Soviet Union . KGB on the other side desperately wants the new technology . So , they sets a scheme in motion . During a rescue attempt to free Markov , KGB steps in , takes Markov to a secret location and lures him to reveal his secret by saying they are in Sweden , and working for the UN . As a backup , KGB kidnaps Markov 's estranged daughter . CIA now send their best agents , a team of ( Swedish ? ) Ninjas to thwart KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter.<br /><br />Comments : A cult movie that despite not being very good needs seeing . The movie is quite ambitious but lacking in many areas . First off is that it is very dark , probably to conceal locations and bad effects , that some scenes are hard to comprehend . You ca n't see what is happening . The second thing that it is lacking is martial arts , despite being a ninja - movie . Sure there are some , of quite poor quality , but mostly the ninjas fires automatic guns or sets of explosions . The automatic guns pose a problem too as they seem to have a endless supply of ammunition . And the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets while Soviet guards die like flies.<br /><br />What does it have that speaks for it then ? The idea and ambition foremost . Some actually , and especially for a Swedish movie , decent action - scenes albeit not of martial arts . Some nice slow - motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore . And some very interesting new weapons technology that makes the victims heart or brain explode . Mostly all parts that you look for in a B - movie.<br /><br />Because it definitely is a B - movie , no mistake could be made there . But if you expect it , and watch it like a B - movie , it is entertaining . But do n't forget , it is not only a B - movie it is set in the eighties . Some girls , for example , besides wearing ... lets say " interesting " clothes , have lethal doses of eye shadow and makeup.<br /><br />In all , see for the cult status and the ambition . Enjoy it , and then forget it.<br /><br />4/10
0 Even 20 + years later , Ninja Mission stands out as the worst movie I ever managed to sit through . Scandanavian ninjas silently enter a scene , fire their obnoxiously noisy sub - machine guns with wild abandon , and then silently leave . Wow , how will we find those silent invisible assassins ? Just follow the shell casings and smoke!Painfully bad dialog ( or was it brilliant and just poorly translated ? ) , not an Asian in sight in the cast , and a whopping total of 3 Asians among the stunt crew . The plot is ridiculous , the acting pretty much non - existent - then again , ninja ca n't act ! Save yourselves - avoid watching at all costs !
0 You 've been fouled and beaten up in submission by my harsh statements about " femme fatale " / " guns n ' gals " movies ! Now comes another breed in disappointing rediscoveries : ninja movies ! Many of these I 've seen before , and let me tell you , they are n't all that 's cracked up to be ! They usually do n't stick to the point . This , among all others , suffers from no originality ! What 's a ninja got to do with preventing a nuclear holocaust in Russia ? And is n't this supposed to be a " martial arts " movie , too ? Does plenty of gunfire sound like an incredible action movie to you ? Is blood the number one reason to love this to death ? Will you waste some of your hard - earned cash over a lady singing in her see - through tank top ? The answers to these important questions are found in THE NINJA MISSION , which should be in the martial arts section of your video store . For even more nonsense ninja fun , try checking out those Godfrey Ho movies put out by Trans World . You get what you deserve , and that 's a promise ! Recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts !
0 Having low expectations going in , the opening new footage ( clocked at over five minutes ) of ' Husbands ' came as a pleasant surprise . I wo n't say the new footage was grade A material , but it provided a very solid foundation for what " could have been " a good all - original film.<br /><br />Unfortunately , this was put together in 1955 , during a time of one day shooting schedules . After the new footage , Jules White decided to just thumbtack stock footage from ' Brideless Groom ' into this short , making for a not - so - smooth story transition , which Jules and Felix Adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new footage at the end , giving us the old , worn - out ending of the boys ( Moe & Larry in this case ) getting shot in the butt.<br /><br />3/10
0 Scary , but mostly in the sense that will it be over before I turn 70 . I saw this as a late night re - run in about 1976 and thought it would never end . Like crackers , it 's better than nothing ( but just).<br /><br />Ray Milland is a little scary because he looks as if he 's been stuffed by a taxidermist . Yvette Mimeux looks as if she 's smoked up all the Beautiful Downtown Burbank Brown . < br /><br />It 's a sort of Roy Rogers version of Rosemary 's Baby . This is one turkey that should never have been made . If you have insomnia and it 's 1:30 on Saturday morning and there 's nothing on but replays of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship , then I guess it beats that . But God help you if this is your only choice for entertainment .
0 Please note that I have n't seen the film since I discovered it in 2007 , and my town is smaller and does n't carry it . However , I really want to say something about it . I 'm actually doing research for university on the title character Richard Maurice Bucke and would like to point out that the person they based the main character on was in reality completely different ! ! ! Hollywood 's ideas of people and artistic license granted , the real Dr. Bucke totally endorsed hysterectomies to cure insanity in women , and would never have practiced anything as liberal as represented in the film . I think it 's laughable to see various film critics who write for legitimate newspapers who say this film has some historical basis ! The only actual fact I can see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman . Please do n't waste your time on a film with such a disregard to the horror that real women experienced at the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry .
0 This was a complete disappointment . The acting is n't bad , but the production was just so bad that at times I felt I needed to stop it , but I sadly made it through and was able to finish it a bit embarrassed by the whole poor movie . It is o.k . if you are o.k . with cheesy moral plots and do n't mind watching a movie that vastly misconstrues Whitman . If you want a cheesy fictional story go for it .
0 I tried twice to get through this film , succeeding the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and failing the second time despite a great DVD transfer . The problem ? It 's simply too boring.<br /><br />If you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene , which takes up most of the second half of the film , you have it made , but it 's tough getting to that point . There are some interesting talks by " Abraham Lincoln " ( Henry Fonda ) during the trial . The ending is touching as Lincoln walks off and they superimpose his Memoral statue over the screen.<br /><br />It 's a nice story , well - acted and such .... but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there . I suspect the real Abe Lincoln was a lot more interesting than this film .
0 Every movie from the thirties is dated , but if you were to watch only John Ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others . i.e. Grand Hotel is comparatively modern melodrama . With Ford , there 's always the hard - sell of someone 's nobility ( Abe , The Joads ) . Always the over - emphasis of some heavy 's badness . Always the poorly crafted , awkward and obvious scripts . This is no exception . It 's just a rather belabored device to deliver sentiment . And sentiment is all this has going for it.<br /><br />What Ford does here does n't make me appreciative of Lincoln , it just makes me wonder how the States were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here . Ford went on to make decent movies . This is too dated to be anything but bad . It feels entirely false . < br /><br />Henry Fonda with a fake nose is bizarre . And no one from Illinois would pronounce the trailing ' S , ' or say " Shonuff ! "
0 I have n't read a biography of Lincoln , so maybe this was an accurate portrayal ...... <br /><br />And maybe it 's because I 'm used to the equally alienating and unrealistic worshiping portrayals that unnaturally deify Lincoln as brilliant , honorable , and the savior of our country ...... <br /><br />But why would they make a movie representing Lincoln as a buffoon ? While Henry Fonda made an excellent Lincoln , his portrayal of him as an " aw shucks , I 'm just a simple guy " seemed a little insulting.<br /><br />[Granted , that was Bushie Jr. 's whole campaign , to make us think he was " just a regular guy " so we would n't care that he 's a rich & privileged moron -- but that 's a whole other story.]<br /><br />Not only did the film show Lincoln as sort of a simple ( almost simple - minded ) kind of guy , the film states that Lincoln just sort of got into law by accident , and that he was n't even that interested in the law - only with the falsely simplistic idea of the law being about rights & wrongs . In the film he 's not a very good defense attorney ( he lounges around with his feet on the table and makes fun of the witnesses ) , and the outcome is mostly determined by chance / luck.<br /><br />Furthermore , partly because this was financed by Republicans ( in reaction to some play sponsored by Democrats that had come out ) and partly because it was just the sentiment of the times , the film is unfortunately religious , racist and conservative.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this film !
0 As a Dane I 'm proud of the handful of good Danish movies that have been produced in recent years . It 's a terrible shame , however , that this surge in quality has led the majority of Danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism . In fact , it has become so bad that I no longer trust any reviews of Danish movies , and as a result I have stopped watching them in theaters.<br /><br />I know it 's wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie , so let me stress that " Villa Paranoia " would be a terrible film under any circumstances . The fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with Danish film . Furthermore , waiting until it came out on DVD was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money . < br /><br />Erik Clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in Copenhagen settings . I particularly enjoyed " De Frigjorte " ( 1993 ) . As an actor he is usually funny , though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies , namely that of a working - class slob who 's down on his luck , partly because he 's a slob but mostly because of society , and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community . < br /><br />This is problem number one in " Villa Paranoia " ; Clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer , which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible . < br /><br />It is much worse , however , that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on . For instance , the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near - death experience of the main character with the use of low - budget effects and bad camera work . After that , the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge . This is symptomatic of the whole movie ; there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters , and Clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is : Telling instead of showing . Thus , at one point , you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels , because the script would n't allow him to act out his feelings ; and later on , voice - over is abruptly introduced , quite possibly as an afterthought , to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the director 's ineptitude . Fortunately , at this point you 're roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters , let alone the so - called story.<br /><br />The acting , which has frequently been a problem in Clausen 's movies , can be summed up in one sad statement : Søren Westerberg Bentsen , whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on Big Brother , is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the cast.<br /><br />I give this a 2-out - of-10 rating .
0 I have seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts at one . A lot of the scenes work in a plug - and - play manner inserted strictly to conform to the romantic - comedy genre . Usually this is okay because we 're dealing with a genre , but the challenge generally resides in making it original , new and inventive . This movie fails to do so.<br /><br />There is no sense of who the characters really are , apart from Sylvie Moreau 's ( who is the real star of this movie , not Isabelle Blais ) . They fit into this one - dimensional cliché and they become nothing more than simple puppets serving the purpose of a very light narrative.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie can become annoying , rhythm lacks , and the editing is filled with unnecessary close - ups . I should also mention the overly stylized decors making some scenes devoid of any naturally , or rather , making the attempt at naturally seem too obvious . Of course , along with that , you have the right - on - cue sappy music which unfortunately often sounds mismatched.<br /><br />I ca n't believe that a movie who makes obvious Woody Allen allusions ends up being this deceptive . If you expect a good light - hearted romantic comedy , this is not it . Or rather , this a poor attempt at it . You will only leave the theater wondering why this film has been getting such praise when cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are far superior Quebecois directors making better flicks.<br /><br />Les Aimants is a good movie for what it is . But it 's a bad one if you regard cinema as an art and directors as auteur 's .
0 The point of the vastly extended preparatory phase of this Star is Born story seems to be to make ultimate success all the more sublime . Summer Phoenix is very effective as an inarticulate young woman imprisoned within herself but never convincing as the stage actress of growing fame who both overcomes and profits from this detachment . Even in the lengthy scenes of Esther 's acting lessons , we never see her carry out the teacher 's instructions . After suffering through Esther 's ( largely self - inflicted ) pain in excruciating detail , we are given no persuasive sense of her triumph.<br /><br />The obsessive presence of the heroine 's pain seems to be meant as a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence . Yet the causes of this pain ( poverty , quasi - autism , Judaism , sexual betrayal ) never come together in a coherent whole . A 163-minute film with a simple plot should be able to knit up its loose ends . Esther Kahn is still not ready to go before an audience .
0 A shame that even a talented director , Desplechin , could not muster a decent performance out of a bleakly - talented actress , Phoenix , Esther Kahn lacks the substance to convey a very concise and clear plot . In an attempt to fulfill the concentric circle of an actor 's plight , the performance and presentation is too contrived and poorly executed to draw any compassion from the viewer . In an overly long running time , the redundancy of Esther 's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the storyline into a frail frame of a disastrous display . The content is incoherent and gratuitous as Phoenix struggles to carry out Desplechin 's instruction , just as Esther is supposedly trying to do the same . Never feeling a convincing victory over Esther 's pain , we never feel a victory in Phoenix 's talent .
0 Overlong drama that is n't capable of making any real point . So she became an actress - so what ? She learned to love - big deal . There is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations , but the kind which is bad for the movie , causing it to often seem absurd.<br /><br />Summer Phoenix , playing the lead , talks and behaves like a semi - retarded person , so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater - which was clearly not the intended point . We are told early on ( in that " Barry Lyndon "- like narration ) that she learned to hide her emotions , which certainly explains her autistic stone - face , but the movie suffers for it . She basically walks around like a zombie , and her success as an actress is n't quite credible given her lack of emotions . Occasionally , the movie had that dull , sleepy feel of a Dogma 95 movie . Is it one ? I would n't be at all surprised.<br /><br />Summer Phoenix is sister of Joaquim Phoenix and the late River Phoenix . Nepotism rarely works.<br /><br />If you 'd like to see my Hollywood Nepotism List , with over 350 pictures / entries , contact me by e - mail .
0 I 've seen this film because I had do ( my job includes seeing movies of all kinds ) . I could n't stop thinking " who gave money to make such an awful film and also submit it to Cannes Festival ! " It was n't only boring , the actors were awful as well . It was one of the worst movies I 've ever seen .
0 This movie was one of the worst I 've ever seen . Pure drivel . How anyone could develop a connection with the heroine , or have empathy for her , is beyond me . I felt I was watching a case history of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder . Just terrible.<br /><br />In its most generous light , this can be seen as an attempt at producing and " art " film - except I could not , for the life of me , find any art in it at all.<br /><br />If this woman had lived in todays ' world , she would have been whisked off to a mental institution and given a couple of days treatment with anti - psychotic medications . That , or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a bag woman . Why other characters in this movie found anything redeeming in her - and tried to aid her in her quest to become an actress - speaks more to their pathology than any convincing characteristics she had that made her worth that effort .
0 Boring and appallingly acted(Summer Pheonix ) . She sounded more Asian than Jewish . Some of the scenes and costumes looked more mid 20th century than late 19th century . What on earth fine actors like Ian Holm & Anton Lesser were doing in this is beyond me .
0 I rented this thinking it might be interesting , and it might have been an interesting story except that is was told in such an uninteresting manner . Hard to follow , strange editing , disjointed storyline , the characters mumble , all in all a dreadfully dull waste of time . I just could n't get into it and did n't care what happened to the characters - not even Ian Holm could save this film . Unless you need a cure for insomnia , I 'd skip it . 3/10 , and that 's being generous .
0 I went to school with Jeremy Earl , that is how I heard of this movie , I do n't really know if it was in the theater 's at all . I do n't recall the name . I have seen it , it is like one of those after school specials . The acting is OK , not great . The plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny . So the only comment I can give this movie is " Eh " I borrowed the movie from Jeremy , if I was in a movie rental place , this is one that I would walk past and after watching it I would n't recommend it to anyone past middle school age . I 've also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed , the slang is overused or just outdated . Many times I think that s what makes their characters unbelievable .
0 The opening shot was the best thing about this movie , because it gave you hope that you would be seeing a passionate , well - crafted independent film . Damn that opening shot for filling me hope . As the " film " progressed in a slow , plodding manner , my thoughts were varied in relation to this " film " : Was there too much butter in my popcorn ? Did the actors have to PAY the director to be in this " film " ? Did I get my ticket validated at the Box Office ? Yes , dear reader . I saw this film in the Theatre ! This would be the only exception I will make about seeing a film at home over a Movie Theatre , because at home you can TURN IT OFF . Were there any redeeming values ? Peter Lemongelli as the standard college " nerd " had his moments , especially in a dog collar . Other than that this " film " went from trying to be a comedy , to a family drama to a spiritual uplifter . It succeeded on none of these fronts . Oh , and the girlfriend was realllllllllly bad . Her performance was the only comedy I found .
0 I did n't know it was possible to release a movie this bad . The labeling sounded so promising , but you would think that with a cast of 20 , at least one of them would be able to act . My wife left me and went to bed after the first 20 minutes . She made a wise decision .
0 The acting is some of the worst I 've ever seen , the characters are totally unconvincing . This could be overlooked to some extent if the plot was interesting , which the plot to " The Prodigy " was not . It 's sort of a bad mix between " Fresh " and " Animal House " , except that both of those movies were good .
0 Within the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller , we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps sans underwear , fantasizes about murdering his roommate , tries to steal a magazine from a news stand , and lusts after a studly young man he meets at the train station . And he 's the hero of this nonsensical movie that is all dressed up ( except for Krabbe in at least one scene too many ) but has nowhere to go . The basic plot is very simple but is dragged out to nearly two hours before reaching a pointless conclusion . Verhoeven has a nice visual flair but resorts to scenes of wild hallucinations , overt symbolism , and gratuitous gore when he runs out of ideas .
0 I saw this movie in my international cinema class and was grossed out from get go . This movie is nothing but one scene of blatant shock value after the next.<br /><br />The 4th Man is about an alcoholic writer named Reve , who has visions of his in - pending danger . He meets up with a woman named Christine when giving a lecture at a local book club , and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is . To put it plainer , Reve likes the Dutch sausage . So Reve concocts a plan to seduce Christine 's boyfriend so he can ultimately have sex with him . But its later discovered that Christine has had 3 previous husbands , who she all murdered . Now Reve and Christine 's boyfriend could be " THE 4TH MAN . " The storyline makes sense with no plot holes . The editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine . The movie is just gross and I felt the need to vomit in some parts . Basically , this is n't my cup of tea.<br /><br />The movie opens with Reve getting out of bed in JUST a t - shirt . So in the very beginning , you get to see Reve 's lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state . Later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors , and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues . Reve fondles a statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum . Plus there 's a lot of blood . More blood than all the Freddy Krueger movies combined.<br /><br />Not that I have anything against " shocking " scenes , but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking . The whole movie is revolved around the shock value.<br /><br />So if any of this is your cup of tea , watch this movie . Otherwise , stay far far far far far away from this one . My mind is still scarred .
0 Even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it 's still an awful film . If one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke ..... first off , Jeroen Krabbé is i guess the poor man 's Gerard Depardieu ..... naturally i hate Gerard Depardieu even though he was very funny in the ' Iron Mask ' three musketeer one . Otherwise to me he is box office poison and Jeroen Krabbé is worse than that . The poor man 's box office poison .... really that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised . If the ' 4th Man ' is supposed to be some sort of critique of the Bourgeoisie .... what am i saying ? it is n't . Let 's just say hypothetically , if it was supposed to be , it was n't sharp enough . Satire is a tricky thing .... if it is n't sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead ...... i think that is what happened . The story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either ..... (for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any Luis Bunuel film .... very sharp satire)<br /><br />[potential spoiler alert]<br /><br />Really , the blow job in the cemetery that Jeroen Krabbé 's character works so so hard to attain .... do you even care ? is it funny ? since Mr. Voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control ..... though i 'm guessing he did n't cast Jeroen Krabbé because he 's the worst actor and every character he 's played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass .... except he 's incompetent at it . So it becomes like a weird caricature . Do you think Mr. Voerhoven did that on purpose ? and Jeroen Krabbé is the butt of the joke as well ? I just do n't see it ...... So you understand the dilemma i 'm faced with here right ? It is the worst film ever because he 's supposed to be a good director . So there is some kind of dupery involved . I knew ' Patch Adams ' was horrible without even seeing it . Do not be duped by ' The 4th Man"s deceptively alluring packaging or mr . Voerhoven 's reputation as a good director etc . etc .
0 I was really horrified by this eerie movie . What an unusual dark atmosphere . And such a creepy musical score . Really promising ! Indeed , after ten minutes you really start sweating , and feeling uncomfortable , for you start fearing the worst . This movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare , and what 's worse - it all comes out . For one hour and a half I have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep , but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake . Nuit Noire is a truly horrifying picture - for your eyes , your ears , your intelligence , and most of all : your wallet , since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo is the biggest horror of all .
0 I do n't know what this movie is about , really . It 's like a student 's art school project . They never say why the world is dark , but it is always darkness except for seconds a day . There are long , interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason . What little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images . A black woman enters the main character 's apartment . Somehow she becomes pregnant overnight , then gets shot in the head . The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges . I have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be . Honestly , I would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think it 's about . But I would n't wish this level of hell on anybody else .
0 This movie appears to have been an on the job training exercise for the Coppola family . It does n't seem to know whether to be an " A " or a " B " western . I mean , the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God 's sake . William Boyd must be spinning in his grave.<br /><br />All the " B " western cliches are here . The two - gun pearly toothed hero in the white hat with the trusty steed ( " C'mon Thunder " ) , the all - in - black bearded villain , the heroine in distress , the rancher in trouble , the cowardly sheriff , over the top bad guys etc.<br /><br />The acting , with few exceptions , is strictly from the Yakima Canutt School of Acting . Chris Lybbert ( who ? ) as the hero and Louis Schweibert ( who ? ) as the villain look like they would have been more at home in a 30 's Poverty Row quickie . The addition to the cast of veteran performers Martin Sheen , Robert Carradine , Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps a little , but they are not given enough to do to salvage this one.<br /><br />What was the point of the Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine framing sequences ? Are we to believe that the Sheen character was a ghost ? What was the purpose of the black gloves ? It just did n't make sense.<br /><br />Being a great lover of westerns from all genres , I tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this film . The cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic . Aside from the hero and main villain , the other characters looked authentic.<br /><br />If the producers were going to resurrect the Hopalong Cassidy character , they might have given some thought to portraying him as he was originally written - a grizzled foul - mouthed ranch hand with a chip on his shoulder , the kind of part Lee Marvin would have excelled in.<br /><br />What else can I say but .. on Thunder , on big fellow .
0 We saw this on the shelf at the local video store , saw " Coppola " in the credits and got excited . That was the one and only time this movie raised any interest . I could never quite work out if it was an attempt at a humourous film that failed miserably , or an attempt at a serious film that failed miserably . In general , the entire production seemed incredibly amatuerish . The sound in particular was absolutely dreadful , especially in the scenes shot in the little bar ; the dialogue was so corny in parts it was unbelievable . Very disappointing .
0 In this day and age of incredible special movie effects , this one was a sore disappointment . The actors seemed stiff and uninspired , as was the dialogue . Westerns are not common fare for Hollywood so much these days , but movies like " Silverado " prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one . Considering that , it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing , much less creating such a weak film as this one . If you love and are looking for a good western , keep looking !
0 Hopalong Cassidy with a horse who is not white & not named Topper ? Go figure!<br /><br />This travesty does a gross injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes , Hopalong Cassidy . The actor who plays him is young versus old , blond haired versus white haired and kills people versus shooting the gun out of their hands . Will the real Hopalong please stand up!<br /><br />One of the worst movies ever made & , believe it or not , by the person who brought us the Grandfather saga !
0 I enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit . The script and dialogue is laughable . The acting was awful , where did they get them from ? Music was OK i have to say . Luckily i did n't buy or rent the movie but its now disposed of.<br /><br />I was geared up at the beginning when the stranger ( martin sheen ) started to tell his story . I have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex where Hopalong shot Tex 's finger off and told him to practise for 40 years to reach his league . But that s where it all went pear shaped thereafter . I had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better , never did .
0 The closing song by Johnny Rivers was the only great thing about this movie . Unfortunately that is all the positive I can say about this western movie . I have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted , but there is more than 8 lines of awful in this western . I am not sure if the movie was a tribute to Hopa Along , or just a spoof . The hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic . Not realistic at all . A lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic , but the shooting scenes were a joke . A previous commentator thought this movie was great , and in the comments took a cheap shot at President Bush . This was not a democratic or republican western . It was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially . I wonder if it made any money . At times I thought I was watching a movie made by college movie students . If that was the case , then it was a great movie .
0 One hour , eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and I decided it was pretty lame . That was right after Hopalong ( Chris Lybbert ) drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse . I was pretty mystified by the whole Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20 gimmick which did n't translate into anything at all . Obviously , the name Coppola in the credits could n't do anything to guarantee success here , even with more than one listed.<br /><br />If you make it to the end of the film , you 'll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions I did . What exactly was the hook with the gloves ? What 's up with the rodeo scenario ? Who was The Stranger supposed to represent ? Why did they make this film ? < br /><br />I could probably go on but my energy 's been drained . Look , there 's already a Western called " The Gunfighter " from 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the title character . Watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad . That one I can recommend .
0 This is almost certainly the worst Western I 've ever seen . The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family / friends have been murdered , so hero sets out to exact revenge , foils the ineffective lawman , rescues the kidnapped loving damsel , and murders the expert arch - nemesis in a brutal duel . This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it would n't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you 'll ever see . The scripting is atrociously simple - minded and insulting ; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth , maturity , and realism . The sound is bad ; it sometimes looks dubbed . The cinematography is lame , and the sets are sometimes just facades . The acting is pitiful ; sure , some of the performers could blame the script , but others can not use that excuse . I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role ever again ; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean , he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho . And speaking of Chris Lybbert , who plays Hopalong , check out his duds ( if you dare to watch this film ) : He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard - working , down - and - dirty cowboy . If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy , then get this , but if you have more than two neurons , watch something else .
0 A dreary and pointless bit of fluff ( bloody fluff , but fluff ) . Badly scripted , with inane and wooden dialogue . You do not care if the characters ( indeed , even if the actors themselves ) live or die . Little grace or charm , little action , little point to the whole thing . Perhaps some of the set and setting will interest -- those gaps between the boards of all the buildings may be true to the way life was lived . The framework encounter is unnecessary and distracting , and the Hoppalong Cassidy character himself is both boring and inept .
0 I read the back of the box and it talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron . I thought , " wonderful ! This will be great ! " I was so wrong . The story was all screwed up . In fact I still do n't get it . It just seems to me that all the characters did was drink , smoke ( opium ? ) and have sex . Not that those are n't good movie qualities , but please ! Where was the story ? I made myself finish the movie , and yes , it did pick up towards the end , but by then the movie was almost over . Rent it if you really want to . Just do n't trust the back of the box .
0 Do n't waste your time on this dreck . As portrayed , the characters have no redeeming values and watching them interact is sheer torture . " Gothic " was entertainment at least , this is crap . If you like watching pretentious and spoiled poets straining to outwit each other , this may be right up your alley . Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete jerk , and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is truly bewildering . Mary Shelly appears to be the only character with any spine whatsoever , but even she comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect . What a waste of time . See Gothic instead . I also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject matter , but did n't catch the title . I was hoping this was it , but no such luck . Not recommended .
0 Oh my . How can they make movies of such beauty , but that are so terribly bad . I mean , even Uwe Boll does n't make crap like this . There is not even a hint of a decent story , multi - layered characters , or attraction . It 's just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a ' movie ' . I suppose only children up to 3 years of age could enjoy it , given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent , that anyone older would be annoyed by it . But then again , it 's far too scary for anyone under 6 years of age , that there 's probably no one that should watch this movie at all.<br /><br />Take my advice and stay far , far away from this movie . Your little daughter can make a better storyline , and though she probably is n't able to draw pictures this pretty , her tales are much more worth listening to . And please , in the name of whoever you believe in , do not expose your children to this piece of * * * * . I 'll give it 2 out of 10 , and that 's exclusively for the graphics , because the story and character development are so awful they 'd deserve a negative rating.<br /><br />And if you decide to watch it anyways ... remember that I warned you .
0 This is one of the worst - written movies I 've ever had to sit through.<br /><br />The story 's nothing new -- but it 's a cartoon , so who cares , as long as it 's pretty and fun ? < br /><br />I'm not going to go as deep as the characterisations , or I 'll be here all day ( except to say that there are n't any ; the characters change personality whenever it 's convenient to the plot ) , but whoever wrote the script and visual direction should be forbidden access to so much as pencil and paper . Thumbs down ? I 'd vote to cut their thumbs off.<br /><br />"Narrow in on an object / prop . Cut back to character close - up . Character gives a knowing look , which the audience will not even remotely understand . Repeat that several times , with different objects / props." < br /><br />"Make the characters pay no attention at all the huge lumps of rock are floating around , crashing into each other , generally raining destruction all over , and which could kill them all at any moment -- but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see a harmless - looking , almost pastoral green rock in the distance . " < br /><br />The whole thing is a long succession of events , actions , and behaviour that are only there for the convenience of the writer , to save him having to think or make any effort at all to write the story properly.<br /><br />This is the Plan 9 of CG cartoons , except that it does n't have Ed Wood groan factor to make it fun to watch.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favour : spend your cartoon budget on Pixar movies .
0 As a young black / latina woman I am always searching for movies that represent the experiences and lives of people like me . Of course when I saw this movie at the video store I thought I would enjoy it ; unfortunately , I did n't . Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant , the story was simply not properly developed . The movie just kept dragging on and on and many of the characters that appear on screen just come and go without much to contribute to the overall film . Had the director done a better job interconnecting the scenes , perhaps I would have enjoyed it a bit more . Honestly , I would recommend a film like " Raising Victor " over this one any day . I just was not too impressed .
0 First off , I must admit that both films I 've seen by this director I saw without titles and so may have missed the points . My Czech is n't bad but , having sat through two of his films , I wish I had n't even tried to learn . Samotari is too cool . Way too cool . It 's about ten different story lines that weave in and out together . That 's not so deeply unusual in a town the size of Prague ( tiny , really . ) The main characters are between 20 and 30 . They 've got jobs and only one studies . The best character is the young Balkan girl . Her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day . That 's about it . The only great character . Everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own . How can I sympathise with such obvious incompetence ? Perhaps there are interesting bits with Japanese tourists but do I need another stereotype in film ? If you like alright music , see this film . If you want to laugh at others ' stupidity , see this film . If you like irony and dry humor , see an original Jarmusch not an imitation . And under NO circumstances see Ondricek 's film , Septej ( Whisper . ) That is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes .
0 This bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie . This installment tries to veer away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke , but it takes a wrong turn and journeys nowhere interesting or funny.<br /><br />There 's almost a half - hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert ( and lots of people watching on " free TV "-- since when does that happen ? ) Surely the script writer could have done something more creative ; look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation . Not in this film , which pretty much ended the Bill & Ted franchise . The joke was over.<br /><br />The Grim Reaper is tossed into the mix , for whatever reason . This infusion , like the whole plot , is done poorly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement . There 's a ZZ Top impression , hammered in for no reason . There 's lights , smoke , mirrors , noise . But nothing really creative or funny.<br /><br />Skip this bogus thing .
0 Since most review 's of this film are of screening 's seen decade 's ago I 'd like to add a more recent one , the film open 's with stock footage of B-17 's bombing Germany , the film cut 's to Oskar Werner 's Hauptmann ( captain ) Wust character and his aide running for cover while making their way to Hitler 's Fuehrer Bunker , once inside , they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel , the film then cut 's to one of many conference scene 's with Albin Skoda giving a decent impression of Adolf Hitler rallying his officer 's to " Ultimate Victory " while Werner 's character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizen 's are caught up in a fantasy world - some non - bunker event 's are depicted , most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a Russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the Flak unit 's and his family 's difficulty in surviving - this film suffer 's from a number of detail inaccuracies that a German film made only 10 year 's after WW2 should not have included ; the actor portraying Goebbels ( Willy Krause ) wear 's the same uniform as Hitler , including arm eagle- Goebbels wore a brown Nazi Party uniform with swastika armband - the " SS " soldier 's wear German army camouflage , the well documented scene of Hitler awarding the iron cross to boy 's of the Hitler Youth is shown as having taken place INSIDE the bunker ( it was done outside in the courtyard ) and lastly , Hitler 's suicide weapon is clearly shown as a Belgian browning model 1922-most account 's agree it was a Walther PPK - some bit 's of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable , this bit is shown as a cabaret skit , with a intoxicated wounded soldier ( his arm in a splint ) maniacally goose - stepping to music while a nurse does a combination striptease / belly dance , all by candlelight ... this is actually embarrassing to watch - the most incredible bit is when Werner 's Captain Wust gain 's an audience alone with Skoda 's Hitler , Hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench , drugged and delirious , when Werner 's character begin 's to question him , Hitler start 's screaming which bring 's in a SS guard who mortally wound 's Werner 's character in the back with a gunshot - this fabricated scene is not based on any true historic account - Werner 's character is then hauled off to die in a anteroom while Hitler prepare 's his own ending , Hitler 's farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is off - screen , the final second 's of the movie show Hitler 's funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into a ghostly image of the face of the dead Oskar Werner / Hauptmann Wust - this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent film 's such as the 1973 remake " Hitler : the last 10 day 's " or the German film " Downfall " ( Der Untergang ) if they wish a more true accounting of this dramatic story , these last two film 's are based on first person eyewitness account 's , with " Hitler : the last 10 day 's " being compiled from Gerhard Boldt 's autobiography as a staff officer in the Fuehrer Bunker and " Downfall " being done from Hitler 's secretary 's recollection 's , the screen play for " Der Letzte Akte " is taken from American Nuremberg war crime 's trial judge Michael Musmanno 's book " Ten day 's to die " , which is more a compilation of event 's ( many obviously fanciful ) than eyewitness history - it is surprising that Hugh Trevor Roper 's account,"The last day 's of Hitler " was never made into a film .
0 I was shocked by the ridiculously unbelievable plot of Tigerland . It was a liberal 's fantasy of how the military should be . The dialogue was difficult to swallow along with the silly things Colin Farrell 's character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers.<br /><br />I kept thinking , " Hey , there 's a reason why boot camp is tough . It 's supposed to condition soldiers for battle and turn them into one cohesive unit . There 's no room for cocky attitudes and men who wo n't follow orders . " I was rooting for Bozz to get his butt kicked because he was such a danger to his fellow soldiers . I would not want to fight alongside someone like him in war because he was more concerned with people 's feelings than with doing what was necessary to protect his unit.<br /><br />--<br /><br / >
0 I got this movie in the $ 5 bin at walmart . I would not recommend watching this move . I might give it to one of my friends if I am angry at them and want them to suffer for 2 hours.<br /><br />I looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie . I wish I would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on . It was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie . It 's just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another . The drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in Vietnam.<br /><br />Okay , here is my rant about this movie : To me , this movie is slow and hard to watch . It was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end . It does n't . After the movie was over I through it behind my T.V. because I was angry that I wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching it , and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it .
0 I realise that the US Army was demoralised by 1971 , but this film was unbelievable . It was supposed to be a training camp not the SS punishment battalion in a Sven Hassell novel . The writer must be a real Army hater . The psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people belonged in a prison cell , and the useless Black top sergeant should have been sacked as well . These men were going overseas , the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits were coming from , and an investigation would have ensued . The scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one . Farrell , the alleged barrack room lawyer , would have had the instructor over a barrel for issuing an illegal order ( to torture POWs in contravention to the Geneva Convention ) , actual assault on an enlisted man , sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer . Intead he just walks away . After this , discipline brakes down into a madhouse level and the film becomes unwatchable . I do n't know how it ended , I went to bed .
0 While some scenes of training were realistic , too many of them depicted military instructors as ex - Nazi types . Obviously , the people who wrote the screen play were either anti - military types or writing a film for that audience.<br /><br />I am a Viet Nam vet and , even during this period , military instructors who behaved in the manner some of these did would probably still be serving time in military prison.<br /><br />And I really loved the scene where the " hero " and his buddy ( both privates ) are sitting down in the Captain 's office , smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the Captain as if he were their buddy . This sort of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation , as was the purpose for the scene.<br /><br />At the end I asked myself , " What was this film about ? " as it seemed to wander around all over the place with no focus except " I hate all authority . " Thank God I got it from the library and did not pay to rent it .
0 I watched this a few days ago , so details are getting hazy . The film is shot on hand - held cameras , and a lot was made of this at the time it was released originally , since we had n't had many studio pictures made in this way . I ca n't help but feel this was more of a gimmick than anything , designed to make the audience think that what we are seeing on the screen has n't had all the compromises that come with a big budget , and so was more " real " . However what we have here is n't much more than a not - as - good rip off of the first half of Full Metal Jacket , so anyone who has seen that , or any one of the other rip offs there of , will know what to expect.<br /><br />The main problem I had was the stereotyped characters , with the weedy soft kids out of their depth , close harmony singing , Ebonics spouting black dudes , world weary sergeants , bitter and twisted psychos etc etc ... all being put into the sorts of situations that would provide the most friction and tension at any given time . Maybe this was intentional to highlight the stupidity and injustice of the situation , maybe it was laziness , or maybe it was just a committee trying to appeal to the biggest audience , all I know is it was annoying . One novel thing was the mixture of volunteers and draftees ( where normally all the characters would have been forced into the situation , ) although only the scenes between the two main characters really make much play of it . This seems to be the main pivot of the plot , with the volunteers coming to their senses and the draftees gaining a sense of duty and self worth , but its all done in a rather forced and unsubtle way . The other big bug I had was how all the characters ( with the exception of the psychos and the real softies ) would react to each inevitable conflict with at first aggression and threats of violence , faced with Farrell 's ubiquitous stoicism , immediately back down and be all reasonable and diplomatic.<br /><br />I guess if I had to find a plus it would be the acting from the two leads , which was strong and very convincing , tho considering the formulaic nature of the characters , this was n't too hard.<br /><br />In my imagination , Bozz grew up to be Zeke off Tour of Duty , and for my money , 4 episodes of that would be more fun to watch .
0 Hard to describe this one -- if you were a fan of Russ Meyer films back in the day , you will surely be pleased to see that Haji is still looking really hot , though Forry Ackerman has not fared so well ( what is he doing still making these movies anyway ? If I go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie ? ) . It was a pretty fun premise -- a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon -- but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length , and the jokes were on a level with your average Joe E. Brown comedy ( or , Abbott and Costello if that 's your thing ) -- basically just bad puns . Still , I found this movie fascinating to watch , and for more than 2 reasons . Good job , but still a fundamentally flimsy production .
0 Kitten Natividad , of Russ Meyer film fame , plays Chastity Knott , a woman who has found she has breast cancer , so she goes to South America to get some special fruit ( Crockazilla ? ) that is supposed to have healing powers . After going down on some of this fruit ( which appears to be plastic bananas on stalks ) Chastity is endowed with some mystical magical powers that makes her a super - hero , specifically , The Double D Avenger . Note that she 's also wearing a pair of panties as a mask . In writing , that all sounds pretty good . In execution , well , it leaves more than a little to be desired . It seems that Chastity owns a pub and a local strip joint is upset because she 's taking away their business so some of the strippers ( including Haji , also of Russ Meyer film fame ) go after her to ruin her . Of course , Chastity fights back in the guise of the Double D Avenger . Watch her do a " Wonder Woman " type spin to change into her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force . Bad jokes and lame double entendres fly like there was no tomorrow . With the inane theme song playing over and over this comes off like a twisted 70 's " live action " kid 's show with adult content , although while this is unrated it could probably get away with PG-13 at the worst . And it 's probably a blessing that the faded stars kept well covered . This makes Doris Wishman 's Chesty Morgan films look positively wonderful in comparison . Special appearance by Forest J. Ackerman but so what . Very stupid , and I 'm never buying another film with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover . 2 out of 10 .
0 Well , I suppose the good news concerning William Winckler 's 2001 opus , " The Double - D Avenger , " is that it manages to unite three of Russ Meyer 's mammarian marvels -- Kitten Natividad , Haji and Raven de la Croix -- in one picture . ( I can only assume that Lorna Maitland , Tura Satana and Babette Bardot were busy the week they shot this thing ... or else managed to see a copy of the script in advance ! ) The bad news , though ( and there 's plenty of it ) , is that this film -- if it can even be called that , having been shot straight to video -- is a complete misfire , a total abortion , an out - and - out atrocity , an absolute abomination , and truly one of the worst pictures that I have ever seen . Look no further for the lamest superhero movie ever made ! The plot here , such as it is , deals with Kitten gaining superpowers after fellating the rare cockazilla plant in South America to cure her breast cancer ( oy ) , and later battling a trio of megalunged bikini dancers back in L.A. Too bad that every lame boob joke trotted out falls completely ( you should pardon the expression ) flat , that there is ZERO actual nudity in the film at all ( other than some old photos of Kitten in her heyday ) , and that some shaving cream and a papier - mache boulder are the sum total of the special FX . The Meyer gals here are a bit long in the tooth / saggy in the chest , to put it kindly , although Sheri Dawn Thomas , as bikini girl Ooga Boobies ( ! ) , does manage to , uh , stand out nicely . So why have I given this juvenile , unfunny , failed embarrassment of a movie 2 stars instead of 1 ? To be succinct : Joe Bob Briggs . His voice - over commentary in the special features of the DVD I just watched is absolutely hilarious , especially when he pulls out around 100 synonyms for the word " breast " from the 1,000 + on his Web site 's " Canonical Hooters List . " The man is a national treasure , and he manages to upgrade this skeet of a disc to coaster status !
0 Dreary . Schlocky . Just plain dreadful and awful . Let 's be honest , when you sit down to watch something called The Double - D Avenger you are n't expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment . You are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts . You do n't get really either of these in the video . The story , as it consistent with most of these types , is inane : Kitten Natividad runs a local pub , finds out she has breast cancer , flies down to South America for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a super - human abilities giver , returns and fights , dressed as the Double - D Avenger , a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition . As stories go , I have seen a lot worse , but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous . The action sequences lack zip , drive , motivation , and are tissue thin . The acting is n't even properly campy and the dialog is the pits . Nothing , and I mean NOTHING is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy - handed boob references . All could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it , but they all fall way short . Kitten , Haji , and Raven de la Croix are all quite older(still lovely in their own ways ) yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be : older , campy caricatures of their former selves . Instead , they look so lame and desperate - more because of the vehicle they are " starring " in rather than their own abilities . There are some other lovely ladies , but you really do not see much of anything . PG -13 definitely could be an appropriate rating for this . The material , the actresses , and director are all tired , tiresome , and dated - and again - NOT FUNNY ! It was a brutal hour plus sitting through this , and that is a shame as I was expecting something campy and fun . The guy playing Bubba by the way was the only real laugh for me . Not that he was good at all mind you , but every time he opened his mouth I kept thinking how truly awful he was . The lone bright spot here at all is seeing Mr. Sci - fi himself , Forrest J. Ackerman , play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax Frankenstein affectionately called Frankie . Other than that this is a complete bust - now how is that for another tired , dreadful , trite pun !
0 this was the most pointless film i have ever seen as there was no plot and the actors did not seem to care . 90 % of the film had absolutely no plot whatsoever , i laughed so much my ribs began to ache . the bit where the old men when to capture Robert Duvall was ludicrous . on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character . this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes . seeing as this was based on a ' manuscript ' by john Grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as ' the firm ' or ' the rainmaker ' .
0 What 's up with Robert " Pretentious " Altman ? Was he saving on lighting ? Everything was so dark in this boring movie that it was laughable . I mean , have you ever seen a lawyer 's office where everyone works by candlelight?<br /><br />Don't waste your time . In fact , do n't waste your time with anything Altman makes : It 's all a pretentious waste of film .
0 Rarely have I witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent . There is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film . What few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings . Actors of stature - Robert Duvall , Robert Downey , Jr. - are deployed in roles which go nowhere ; a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee - stained camera lens ; a writer ( John Grisham ) who has never produced anything of merit , discovers new depths of under - motivated incoherence . The film has a cheap , lecherous feel about it - but barely at the level of commentary - its really part of the aesthetic . Normally , I come on to the IMDb to write balanced , generally appreciative comments . This egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless , bilious rant . I wo n't , but only because I no longer want to occupy my " mind " with this trash .
0 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . While featuring good actors the movie does n't live up to the expectations . The most dramatic thing about this movie is the music , which pretty much sums up the movie : compensating for a bad and confusing storyline by having known - good actors , loud and dramatic music . It does n't change the fact , that this is a very boring movie to watch . Earned itself a score of 1 .
0 In spite of its impressive cast and crew pedigree Gingerbread Man crumbles early and often . The plot is unrealistically convoluted , the actors sport bad accents and director Robert Altman 's participation amounts to collecting a pay check . Once again he has assembled an impressive cast ( Like Woody Allen , everyone wants to work with Altman)that this time around to the letter is miscast . But that 's only part of the problem.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder a high powered Georgia lawyer who in the film 's heavy handed opening scenes manages to get himself preposterously seduced by a mysterious catering company waitress who convinces him she is in grave danger from an ex - husband and a loony dad . With red flags everywhere the astute lawyer plods on even managing to get his children in harms way . Fights of gun and fist follow along with a requisite car chase and if that 's not enough there 's a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finale.<br /><br />Branagh plays MacGruder with a mealy and unconvincing Southern accent . Running around in a trench coat in all kinds of weather he 's blind to the obvious in order to keep the story going . Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is every bit as bad as a P.I. but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent . Robert Duvall as the old man is Boo Radely all growed up en crazier than a bed bug serving some thick slices of ham but at least his twang is plausible . The female leads ( Embeth Davidtz , Darryl Hannah , Famkhee Jansen)are lean leggy and unemotive . Even the celebrity lawyers doing cameos ( Vernon Jordan ) are wooden with the few throw away lines they have.<br /><br />In addition to paying little attention to his actors , Altman 's mise en scene dripping with Spanish moss is murky and shapeless , his action scenes comic book . It lacks his offbeat touches and observations ( he does inform the viewer that the Stars and Bars still wave in Georgia)that make a well done Altman so unique . Unfortunately , Gingerbread Man is Altman at his worst , even if the pay is the same .
0 Did anyone who was making this movie , particularly the director , spare a thought for the logic of the story - line ? These are not mere plot - holes , but plot graves , that become ever deeper as we lose any sympathy for the main character and his plight . That is , if you are kind enough a viewer to valiantly ignore the fact for most of the movie that the characters are either servants to the grave - hole plot , or boring and unlikeable . Or , in the case of Downey 's & Hannah 's characters , apparently superfluous . In pondering the reason for existence of Downey 's character 's significant screen - time in the movie , I decided that either the director had liked his character and unnecessarily increased his screen - time ( unlikley , as the director did n't change anything else about the script he actually needed to ) or that his character was going to be sacrificed on the altar of bad plotting . I 'll leave you to guess which one it was to be.<br /><br />I had to keep checking the cover of the DVD to confirm that this really was made by credible talents . I can not understand why Robert Altman would take this job . Surely he has some power to pick and chose . Actually , I ca n't understand why anyone would take this script on , except a first - time director looking for the experience.<br /><br />I suppose Robert Downey Jr. needed the money for his habit . I suppose Kenneth Branagh wanted to try a southern accent . I suppose Robert Duvall was only given a few pages of the script and thought the role in isolation sounded intriguing . These are the only motivations I can see that would coerce good actors to take on roles in this movie . As for Robert Altman , plenty of effort has gone in on his part to making the movie look fantastic . I found myself noticing how he had framed such and such a scene , or used the bright orange float vests in another scene to draw the eye 's movements , or imposed a beautiful filter to create a particular mood . I do not typically notice such things in movies , since most movies I bother to watch to the end actually engage me for reasons of good story - telling and interesting characters with understandable motives . I watched this to the end only because some ridiculous element of optimism in myself kept looking at that DVD cover and being convinced that , due to the talent involved , there had to be some redeeming factor in this movie.<br /><br />Nice direction . But that 's not why I watch movies .
0 I rented this DVD for two reasons . A cast of great actors , and the director , even though Robert Altman can be hit or miss . In this case , it was a big miss . Altman 's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester . After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good film like " Dead Again " , I did n't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey , and I hope it did n't ruin his reputation . Robert Duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one - time Oscar winners . On a downward spiral that includes acting in eating - money films such as this one . Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films , even though his best performance was not " Tender Mercies " , but " The Great Santini " . This movie was truly a big waste of time . I give it a 2 out of 10 .
0 This movie is like real life , by which I mean - not a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so , and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast ( their invisibility being due to the " experimental " lighting as mentioned by many reviewers ) . < br /><br />A big bore . No big surprise that Altman helms this - he is a very variable performer ( yes we all loved " Gosford Park " , but " Pret A Porter " anyone ? Kansas City ? Dr T. and the Women ? Aaargh ) , but the fact that the raw material is a John Grisham tale , and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber - makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film . And no , it is not " so bad it 's good".<br /><br />It 's just bad .
0 I think I 've seen all of the Grisham movies now and generally they 're all very poor , except for The Rainmaker , but this one is so bad it 's unbelievable < br /><br />WARNING SPOILERISH < br /><br />It 's one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do . He 's a lawyer for Christ 's sake . Why when his children go missing does he not call the Police . Oh yes it 's because all the Police hate lawyers so they 're just ignore him and let him be attacked.<br /><br />When he 's arrested for murder they just let him go free , he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing . < br /><br />Why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home.<br /><br />The Police do n't bother to try and find an escaped mental patient , they do n't bother to interview his daughter.<br /><br />As for the ridiculous ending  .<br /><br />In summary , silly , very unrealistic and a complete waste of time.<br /><br />0/10  One of the worst films ever made .
0 There is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie . Is it the lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh that we 're supposed to be pulling for ? Well , let 's see -- we learn he 's a sleazebag defense attorney who gets criminals off on technicalities . He treats his coworkers like cattle , gets them involved in his own personal crisis ( in the process , getting one of them killed ) , jeopardizes the safety of his kids , threatens his ex - wife 's new boyfriend , tries to strong - arm the police and school administrators -- and all this for what ? Because he was THINKING WITH HIS LITTLE HEAD ! I was really pulling for the father and his gang to beat the stuffing out of the lawyer and drown him in the swamp ... it would have made for a far more satisfying ending .
0 How a director of Altman 's experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with , or to care about what happens to , a lead character who is neurotic , a whiner , a jerk with no redeeming qualities -- that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work . A monstrous piece of trash . In addition to this crippling flaw , the plot line requires serious concentration to follow . The setup that the Branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience . This latter issue is at the core of the film : it represents directorial self - indulgence with profound contempt for the taste , values , and intelligence of the viewer . Very unusual for Mr. Altman.<br /><br />Patrick Watson
0 I feel like I 'm the only kid in town who was annoyed by Branagh 's performance . He is a fine actor by most accounts , but he simply could not pull off the Southern accent . I mean , it was deplorable . It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yank . One of the previous reviewers questioned why U.S. actors were not cast in this film . I second that notion . It 's wonderful when actors / actresses wish to expand their horizons , but it 's another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained . Maybe it was Altman , but he 's a such a great director ... <br /><br />Well , I really do n't want to bash Branagh for his absolutely hideous accent too much . Everybody deserves to screw up here and there . But it is hard to watch something so annoying that you 'd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of crap than sit through The Gingerbread Man .
0 Divorced lawyer Rick Magruder ( Branagh ) stumbles drunk out of a party hosted by his firm one night and has a chance meeting with a woman named Mallory Doss ( Davidtz ) , who was a waitress at the party and seems to have lost her car . Rick drives the woman to her home and there they discover that her car has been already parked there , seemingly by her father , Dixon Doss ( Duvall ) . Rick and Mallory walk into the house arguing about the situation when Mallory carelessly undresses in front of Rick , and he then spends the night with her.<br /><br />Rick wakes up in the morning and Mallory encounters him later in the day , asking him to file suit against her father because of his dangerous behavior . Rick , now obsessed with Mallory and willing to do anything for her , is successful in having Dixon put on trial and sent to prison , but when he is freed by his local friends , Rick finds himself in a trouble , trying to protect himself and his children from the danger he has unknowingly brought to life .
0 Have you ever heard the saying that people " telegraph their intentions ? " Well in this movie , the characters ' actions do more than telegraph future plans -- they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head . This could be forgiven if the setting had been used better , or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced . Embeth Davidtz 's character is not mysterious , just wooden , and Kenneth Branagh does n't succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have.<br /><br />The bottom line : obvious plot , one - note performances , unlikeable characters , and grotesque " Southern " accents employed by British actors .
0 This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen . Branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he could n't deliver his lines . The plot was definitely not worthy of John Grisham 's name . No wonder it was never published as a book or released in theaters . I did n't even watch the whole thing . I decided I did n't care who done it , then realized there was no " whodunit " to care about !
0 The only thing remarkable about this movie ? is that all the actors could bomb at the same time . Idiocy . I want my money back ... and I got it free from the library . Sheesh . I would rather chew on tin fool and shave my head with a cheese grater then watch this again .
0 I should never have started this film , and stopped watching after 3/4 's . I missed the really botched ending . This film was a disappointment because it could have been so much better . It had nice atmosphere , a top notch cast and director , good locations . But a baaaaaad story line , a bad script . I paid attention to Kenneth Branagh 's southern accent -- it was better than the script . The plot was stupid -- driven by characters acting in unreal and improbable ways . No one behaves like this outside of Hollywood scripts .
0 I ca n't believe that so much talent can be wasted in one movie ! The Gingerbread Man starts of on the right foot , and manages to build up some great expectations for the ending . But at some point the movie turns into one of the worst stories I 've ever wasted my time on . It 's just so unbelievably how the bewitched Mallory Doss manages to pull Kenneth Branagh 's character around by his nose . The movies climax is as uninteresting and flat as a beer , which has been left out in the sun too long . The Gingerbread Man is probably the worst Grisham - movie ever and this is n't changed by the fact that talented stars crowd the movie . Do n't waste your time here !
0 The first hour of the movie was boring as hell . There is no suspense , no action , not even a plot . The movie went no where . I mean they could have made the movie in 15 min short film . Overall , the movie was n't good at all , and I do n't recommend it .
0 A very weak movie , mainly because of a poor story , but also poor acting in the case of Robert Downey Jr. , and irrational behaviour by many of the characters . If you are someone who likes to switch your mind off and simply watch a movie for it 's creativity or acting criteria , then you may like this movie . Personally I ca n't do that with a drama and found this too far - fetched.<br /><br />I'm particularly annoyed when a main character , that is supposed to be an intelligent person , continually acts like a complete imbecile . In this movie , if the main character acted the way a person would normally act in these situations , there would be no movie.<br /><br />The first highly unlikely act is when the main character , a successful attorney named Magruder , played by Kenneth Branagh , is leaving a party and happens upon a girl , Mallory Doss played by Embeth Davidtz , who is screaming that her car has been stolen . They are standing around in a tropical rainstorm as he badgers her into accepting a ride home.<br /><br />She tells him about her weird father who belongs to some kind of weird sect and does crazy things . When they arrive at her dilapidated shack in the poorer part of town , they notice that her car is in the driveway . Also the house lights are on and some objects in the house have been broken.<br /><br />Things are very odd , she 's weird ( looking like a tramp , she undresses in front of him until she 's completely naked   oh yeah ! ) . Also , the father 's strange , the house is a wreck -- everything should have told Magruder , " hey this is too weird for me , I 'm out of here ! ' But not Magruder , he sleeps with her and then , motivated by her story and sex , takes up the case of trying to have her father committed . It all screams set - up!<br /><br />Then , being the top - flight attorney that he is , he arrives late at the office wearing the same shirt he had on the night before , ( a fact that all of the women in the office notice ) . Is it likely that a successful attorney would act like a 16-year - old ? Magruder has upset the police in some of his cases so when he goes to the police claiming , with ample evidence , that the father is terrorising them , the police ignore him . I could have believed begrudging assistance . But no help at all -- not likely!<br /><br />It 's just too unlikely .
0 I have seen some bad movies ( Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me , Batman Forever ) , but this film is so awful , so BORING , that I got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest . A pity . Boasting talent such as Kenneth Branagh , Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a story by John Grisham , what went wrong ? Branagh is a big - time lawyer who has a one - night fling with Davitz . Her father ( Duvall ) is a psychopath who hanged her cat , etc , etc , so Branagh has him sent to a nuthouse , and he promptly escapes . Somehow ( I could n't figure out how ) Robert Downey jr , Daryl Hannah , Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than stationary . I wanted to like this , and , being a huge Grisham fan , have read all about this movie and I ( foolishly ) expected something interesting . This is honestly the WORST film I 've seen to date and I wish I could have my money refunded . * out of * * * * * .
0 I saw this movie at the AFI Dallas festival . Most of the audience , including my wife , enjoyed this comedy - drama , but I did n't . It stars Lucas Haas ( Brick , Alpha Dog ) , Molly Parker ( Kissed , The Five Senses , Hollywoodland ) and Adam Scott ( First Snow , Art School Confidential ) . The director is Matt Bissonnette , who 's married to Molly Parker . All three actors do a fine job in this movie about 3 friends , the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third . It all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful . The film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama , and I thought it needed to be the other way around .
0 My wife and I just finished this movie and I came onto to IMDb to commiserate with the reviewers that found this movie less than satisfactory . However , of the 10 pages of reviews , only a handful are negative . I feel that this movie is a great concept gone horribly awry and I want to warn those who are looking to watch the movie into the future.<br /><br />I admit , I 'm more inspired to write reviews when I do n't like a movie than as to when I do , so my handful of reviews are all negative . Still , that does n't mean I 'm biased towards not enjoying a movie , but I often find more eloquent reviews of movies I do enjoy.<br /><br />Paris je t'aime is the most pretentious movie I 've seen in years . By using an " intelligent " concept and attaching some big talent to a couple of the WAY to many short stories , the movie ends up the worst of all worlds . It is art for arts sake , but something that a 2 year old could dream up and accomplish . Giving the director free reign of 5 minutes of screen time proves why there is a division of labor even in entertainment . Directors ca n't write , writers ca n't direct . ( I 'd like to throw in also that Clint Eastwood is overrated , but that is because he 's an actor turn director { which rarely works , either}).<br /><br />What ends up on the screen is a garbled mess of short stories that do n't make any sense , are not completed in 5 minutes and in total , spoil Paris to me . Why call it Paris je t'aime when a more apropos title is cluster f*ck ? There are only a couple stories that are watchable , most notably the piece by Alfonso Cuarón , but everything else will fall into obscurity . The Coen brothers short is passable , but can you name a movie of theirs that does not contain a scene with a pick guitar ? It 's as if all the directors decided on doing whatever it is they want to do and chose Paris as the place to do it . As we all love Paris , present company included , we are blinded by the fact that this movie SUCKS . In fact , I think they put the directors names on each of the shorts because directors saw how poor of a film this is and decided to make sure they were blamed only for their 5 minutes . Seriously . SERIOUSLY.<br /><br />People , Natalie Portman is NOT a good actress . She is is not a pixie dream girl waiting to be yours . And Maggie Gyllenhaal , why ? ! ? Are you people acting or just regurgitating performances from other movies ? I 'm looking at you Natalie Portman ( Garden State , Closer ) , Elijah Wood ( Sin City ) and Catalina Sandino Moreno ( Maria Full of Grace).<br /><br />One final comment on the acting : I give double kudos to Nick Nolte for acting and looking more humane than you have in ages or perhaps ever will again . Find his short on youtube as his 5 minutes are quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Writing short stories is very difficult and only a handful of authors have gotten it right . I 'm thinking of Ernst Hemingway , Raymond Carver , F. Scott Fitzgerald , and John Cheever , just to name a few . It is much harder than writing a full novel and only the truly talented can accomplish this . The same can be said about short films . It appears that only one director will live on in the annals of history.<br /><br />If you uphold Paris as a gem to be discovered and reflected through your own lenses with your own story , then do n't expect to enjoy this movie at all . The directors either did n't care or were lazy . In either scenario , by the time you are reading this it means you rented it . Praise be that you did n't pay 10 dollars a head in theaters for it .
0 Only a handful of the segments are engaging here . A segment with a garage attendant from Nigeria is heartbreaking . One with Fanny Ardent & Bob Hoskins makes its point , twist by twist until the final shot overplays things . < br /><br />The problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke Paris . The others are so scatter - shot in theme , tone , volition & production that you may as well be watching " The Years Best Commercials , 2006 . " It 's really all over the place . It does n't develop over it 's running time , and nothing reigns the directors in . No construct successfully joins the pieces ... tedium sets in . I 'm at the one hour , twenty minute point and Elijah Wood is in some dumb , over - commercial , overproduced vampire shtick . It has about as much to do with Paris as old ladies knitting in the Antartic . Fantasy shows up I think first in the Coen Brothers segment ( Uh , thanks J & E for ruining another movie ) and then makes way too many appearances . The point of being in Paris is that you do n't need make - believe crap to make your days extraordinary . Why divide it by neighborhood if Quartier de la Madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director ? Has there ever been a genre more over - represented than the vampire film . Every three years we get the same lame vampire clichés.<br /><br />Making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless . The transitions get lost . This does n't feel intentional , it feels sloppy .
0 I saw " Paris Je T'Aime " because a friend really wanted to see it so I went along with him . Going in , I was indifferent about the film but leaving the theater I really regretted wasting 2 hours of my life sitting through this tepid production . The " stories " are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were awful . What do Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara have to do with Paris ? The endless parade of American actors most definitely gave this French film a remarkably non - French feel . The clichés about Paris were endless . Yes , most of them were playing with clichés about Paris but by spending so much time making fun of French clichés , they directly and regrettably promoted them once more . Yes , Paris is the city of love . We get it.<br /><br />The worst segments were : the one directed by Wes Craven ( Oscar Wilde ) ; the one with Nick Nolte ; the mime one ( the worst ? ) ; the hair products one ; the one with Juliette Binoche ( Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of Paris ? ) ; the vampire one ( When I think of Paris I think of Elijah Wood ) . The one with Natalie Portman , which really looked like a Mentos commercial and it was stupid ( the blind young man should know Portman was just playing a part when she called him ) . On and on it went . It felt endless.<br /><br />I did n't like the Coen Bros one as well . It really plays with those Parisien clichés but I did n't find it funny . Just annoying . The Gus Van Sant one was interesting but it was so slight ( and the punchline was obvious ) that it barely registered.<br /><br />There were only two " successful " segments and they were the one about the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby at a kindergarten only to babysit a baby for a rich woman . Nice irony there . And the segment about the African who is stabbed . It 's the best segment in the whole film but this segment has nothing to do with Paris . The story could have taken place in any city around the world.<br /><br />The last segment , the one with the chubby middle aged woman was sorta interesting too but the underlying tone was bad . They wanted to celebrate her limited grasp of French but the segment came off as being condescending.<br /><br />The whole project felt forced and uninspired . Almost like the French government sponsored this film to promote tourism . All in all , with only about 10 to 15 minutes of interesting stuff , " Paris Je T'Aime " was an awful cinematic experience .
0 Based upon the recommendation of a friend , my wife and I invited another couple to this film . I really apologized to them -- all 4 of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end . Half the vignettes are bizarre , with very little entertainment value . There were few scenes of Paris -- for example , I was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the Latin Quarter , but I could n't really recognize anything . Most of the scene was inside a bar . No one in the theater laughed at anything , or reacted in any way . If you like bizarre , pretentious , pseudo - intellectual films , do n't miss this . If you are down to earth like me , you will be sorry you saw it .
0 be warned : this movie tells lots of love stories without any coherence.<br /><br />The only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways.<br /><br />Each story has only a few minutes , so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot . Just an sketchy idea of a plot . The writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer . However , that just did n't work out because you did n't get to know the characters in before or these " jokes " were just silly.<br /><br />This is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart . A dozen times . Or even more , I do n't know and I do n't care .
0 The idea is nice . Bringing so many stars in one movie is great . But .... too many stories , too short and lacking really any sense . No connection between the scenes . There were some 3 - 4 brilliant stories ... but these were out of 18 . The frame reminded me of " All the invisible children " - a movie which I liked a lot . Compared to it , however , " Paris Je T'Aime " lacks the intriguing short story , which develops - starts and has its end . And it lacks the topic connecting all those - children . I do not find Paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches together . Perhaps for people who know Paris it is interesting . Otherwise , I would n't recommend it ...
0 Ouch ! This one was a bit painful to sit through . It has a cute and amusing premise , but it all goes to hell from there . Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying , and he does not disappoint in this one . Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville turned in surprisingly decent performances . Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly , among others , played it way over the top . I know that 's the way the parts were written , and it 's hard to blame actors , when the script and director have them do such schlock . If you 're going to have outrageous characters , that 's OK , but you got ta have good material to make it work . It did n't here . Run away screaming from this movie if at all possible .
0 In its depiction of a miserable Milanese underclass , this film was probably quite revealing in its day . However , I get the feeling that neorealism was never really director De Sica 's bag , since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country . After spending most of his childhood in an orphanage , Toto ends up living in a shantytown in Milan . He organises the inhabitants into community action , and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables . That nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me , as these people have far more important things to think about , like where the next Pot Noodle is going to come from . Anyway , De Sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are . It 's all down to capitalism of course , and in order to illustrate this , he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land . Brilliant ! To his credit , though , by this time he has given up on making a serious film , and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures , all fur coats and cigars . They want that land , but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense . By a bizarre stroke of luck , his old , deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove . He uses it to shower gifts on his mates , who prove just as greedy as the cigar men . I reckon this film was a missed opportunity . To address the theme of poverty , as not many film - makers had done until then , and then get caught up in a fairy tale , to me seems a bit daft . How come ' great ' directors get away with child - like plot turns like the ones we see here ? Hans Christian Anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the Milan Duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks . De Sica , however , is proclaimed as a genius for this . Surely the fact that these people are so poor , that their faith is unswerving , and that miracles never happen to them , is enough for any story - teller to work on.<br /><br / >
0 OK , so it was written in 1996 , before 9/11 , so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the CIA director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world , is prescient . That 's it . That 's the good stuff . The acting ... fair . The plot ... silly . The " twist " ... unnecessary . DOOOOOOOOOOOM It is n't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated . Do n't you think bureaucrats have a manual for " plagues " and how to contain them ? Proper execution of such a plan is always a problem , as we saw after Katrina . But they have a plan . It is n't to send them off to Iceland and then to Mauritania . And if the virus is carried in the air , why was the plane door open and the " shooters ' standing there with no protection ? In fact , did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs ? That would stop her . But not as dramatic . I 'm a sucker . I always watch a movie to see the end , once I started it . But this was a waste of time , and for the most part , predictable . I saw it using a recorder so I did n't have to watch all the ads , that was a plus . It 's a good example of why I watch so little network TV . Rubbish .
0 I watched this movie last night and already I am struggling to recollect very much about it . The story is about a group of criminals who escape from a space penal colony . They fly to the Moon in a space - age dustbin carrier ; when there , they terrorise the dustbin men who work on the Moonbase.<br /><br />It strikes me that rubbish low - budget sci - fi films often involve either desert planets or , like this movie , criminals escaping from penal colonies . Why this is I have no idea . But I can say with some certainty that such films are always diabolical . This one is really no exception . It begins reasonably well with a decent credit sequence and a half - way alright dance music soundtrack . It then degenerates into a boring sci - fi thriller . So little of consequence actually happens in this movie that I am literally struggling to write a helpful review , so if you 're reading this I apologise for not being able to enlighten you to the film 's subtleties and nuances . For the record , I recall a tedious bunch of baddies , a tedious bunch of goodies , some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman . Other than that , I 'm struggling.<br /><br />If you feel you could be interested in the activities of lunar dustbin men then I would not hesitate to recommend this film . I would also recommend it to those of you who wish to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets .
0 No Fireworks Despite Violent Action.<br /><br />Science fiction films that reflect quality are scarce indeed , largely because transposal of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often falls short of effective execution as a result of insufficient funding or inadequate invention , and unfortunately for its producers , this work is lacking on both counts , woefully so in the case of the latter . With essentially no budget with which to operate , it is a grave mistake to attempt the depiction of such a gamut of events as those within this scenario and , in particular , special effects of space opera warfare which appear only clownish , while seeds from the scriptors ' imagination lie fallow due to some of the most fatuous misunderstanding of basic scientific principles to be found . Among these are frequent firing of weapons within a sealed environment , and a wayward law of gravity which enables freedom of movement of cast members while inanimate objects float weightlessly , but it is easier to accept these than it is to pretend that any of the episodes have a basis in plausibility . The plot involves an escape of life sentenced prisoners from a space station penal colony to a waste landfill upon our moon and their various attempts to obtain passage back to Earth , with some few capable players present who are execrably directed by first - timer Paolo Mazzucato , whose production team wastes effort upon such as holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for the creation of states of suspense and of impetus.<br /><br / >
0 I 'm sorry , I had high hopes for this movie . Unfortunately , it was too long , too thin and too weak to hold my attention . When I realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream , I felt cheated . Surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper , something more meaningful.<br /><br />So , do n't buy a large drink or you 'll be running to the rest room . My kids did n't enjoy it either . Ah well .
0 Diana Guzman is an angry young woman . Surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas , she takes her anger out on the closest targets.<br /><br />When she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club , she knows she 's found her home . < br /><br />The film progresses from there , as Diana learns the usual coming - of - age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing . Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the role , particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism.<br /><br />The picture could use some finesse in its direction of all the young actors , who pale in comparison to the older , more experienced cast . There are too many pauses in the script , which detracts from the dramatic tension . The overall quietness of the film drains it of intensity . < br /><br />This is a good picture to see once , if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power . Its limitations prevent it from being placed in the " see it again and again " category .
0 * Spoiler warning*<br /><br />First of all I rated this movie 2 out of 10.<br /><br />The idea is good , but there are too many stupid errors in the movie , failing to make it the psyching drama that it might have been . First of all she never fights alone . After an initial very strange doubt from her mother ( which is not believable when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the movie ) the rape victim is not alone . < br /><br />She is also unbelievably naive always falling into the Crew 's strange traps . < br /><br />Her friends are unbelievably nasty.<br /><br />The thing that I find most unbelievably is that Ethan fails to control the crew when he changes his opinon . Ethan is very much the leader of the Crew ( hey , they even say so ) and people seem to think the other guy is a jerk , but when Ethan changes his opinion he just does n't manage to convince even one single person in the Crew that he is right and that his former friend is wrong . Everyone just simply hates him ... why ? ? The movie provides no explanation . How did he ever become the leader?<br /><br />A funny note is that my girlfriend thought I was watching Beverly Hills when she came in . Two actors from the same successful TV - series .... a cheap way to get viewers ?
0 Rural family drama -- with perhaps a nod to " Ordinary People "-- concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap . Despite downbeat subject matter ( given mercilessly glum treatment by director Christopher Cain ) , there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring . Unfortunately , the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience . What with Robert Duvall , Glenn Close , and Wilford Brimley in the cast , the movie is nearly a small - scaled reunion of " The Natural " . Too bad this project did n't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping , memorable picture . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 Bizarre take on the Cinderella tale . Terribly poor script , but Kathleen Turner turns in a pretty decent evil step - mother performance.<br /><br />Visually stunning in some parts , but that 's about it . The period costumes range from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s . Fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivel.<br /><br />If you 're really in the mood for a Cinderella story - I suggest " Ever After : A Cinderella Story " or " The Glass Slipper " .
0 * * * * * THIS REVIEW MAY HAVE SPOILERS - but that determination would be negligible in such a classic and well - known story*****<br /><br />The CINDERELLA story ranks as my favorite fairy tale . The world will never have enough of this wonderful tale.<br /><br />The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale . This can not work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and scrumptious looking production designs with poor direction and editing.<br /><br />This Cinderella story is more like an Ugly Duckling that never hatches or rather , is never transformed into a swan.<br /><br />All the production value that money can buy , can not purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development - or good acting.<br /><br />The entrance of Cinderella at the ball as so poorly done , there was no drama of anticipation nor excitement of discovery.<br /><br />The writing made me very nervous , too . The Prince Charming was the most undesirable of memory . Why would any girl want to marry a boorish , self - absorbed prince who disliked women ? < br /><br />Turner 's turn on the Stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful showing that demonstrated one - liners more than acting nuance.<br /><br />Even the Cinderella part held little interest or sympathy.<br /><br />Perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt : So cheaply ' 90's,<br /><br />What MUST be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography , matte work and production design . It was a pleasure to peruse the landscapes , sets and settings as the story unfolded.<br /><br />For some Cinderella storytelling , go for two gems:<br /><br />1 ) Rodgers and Hammerstein 's Cinderella Musical with Lesley Ann Warren . Even with the obvious stagey TV - 60 's look to the sets , this is the best version on celluloid - bar none . An all star cast makes every effort to provide the highest entertainment . Engaging , diverting and memorable writing and music . This is the classic.<br /><br />2 ) Ever After- this Drew Barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective , alters the story line but not enough to derail the effective development of the salient points of this classic tale . The characters of the principals and of all of the supporting roles were written smartly and acted well .
0 Though Frank Loesser 's songs are some of the finest that Broadway has to offer , they 're bollixed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ' lethargic staging and uninspired presentation -- when it 's over it barely feels like you 've watched a musical . Mankiewicz does n't seem to know how to present Loesser 's challenging but tuneful melodies for maximum effect : for example , one of the best numbers , the showstopping ` Adelaide 's Lament ' , concludes by having Adelaide ( Vivian Blaine ) belt out the finale while sitting on a chaise lounge ; and Stubby Kaye 's faux - spiritual ` Sit Down , You 're Rockin ' The Boat ' has his backing choir sitting in folding chairs while he simply stands there . Mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go on too long and his dialogue ( adapted from Abe Burrows ' stage book ) has none of the wit that his films like ` All About Eve ' have . Part of the blame has to go to the leads , just about all of whom are miscast : Marlon Brando looks bewildered as to why he 's in a musical , Frank Sinatra plays way too nice a guy and has none of the edge which makes him so essential ( the songs are not tailored to his style ) and Jean Simmons barely registers the way a Shirley Jones might . Only Blaine , as the lovelorn showgirl Adelaide , commands our attention like a Broadway pro should . The colorful art direction is by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol created the flashy sets .
0 Nathan Detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in NYC , but the heat is on and he ca n't find a secure location . He bets chronic gambler Sky Masterson that Sky ca n't make a prim missionary , Sarah Brown , go out to dinner with him . Sky takes up the challenge , but both men have some surprises in store  < br /><br />This is one of those expensive fifties MGM musicals in splashy colour , with big sets , loud music , larger - than - life roles and performances to match ; Broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing , which I do n't . My main problem with these type of movies is simply the music . I like all kinds of music , from Albinoni to ZZ Top , but Broadway show tunes in swing time with never - ending pah - pah - tah - dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar are n't my cup of tea . This was written by the tag team of Frank Loesser , Mankiewicz , Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows ( based on a couple of Damon Runyon stories ) , and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak . Blaine 's two numbers for example are identical , unnecessary , do n't advance the plot and grate on the ears ( and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you ) . There are only two memorable tunes , Luck Be A Lady ( sung by Brando , not Sinatra as you might expect ) and Sit Down , You 're Rockin ' The Boat ( nicely performed by Kaye ) but you have to sit through two hours to get to them . The movie 's trump card is a young Brando giving a thoughtful , laid - back performance ; he also sings quite well and even dances a little , and is evenly matched with the always interesting Simmons . The sequence where the two of them escape to Havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise , bustle and vowel - murdering of Noo Yawk . Fans of musicals may dig this , but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show .
0 This movie has a very Broadway feel - the backdrop , the acting , the ' noise'- and yet that 's all it has . Some ' sense ' of a Broadway without the bang . < br /><br />The movie is slow - paced , the picture disjointed , the singing ' pops up ' on you so that you suddenly are reminded it 's a musical . < br /><br />Disappointing : Sinatra < br /><br />Intolerable : Sinatra 's fiancé --- surely , the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary . < br /><br />Tolerable : Mr " i remember the numbers on my dice " < br /><br />Delight : Brando 's understated singing ( very biased!)<br /><br />Surprise : how much Jean Simmons looks like Vivien Leigh in her Havana scenes . It 's the bone structure ! How i would 've killed to have seen Miss Leigh in a role challenging Brando again .
0 Raising Victor Vargas : A Review < br /><br />You know , Raising Victor Vargas is like sticking your hands into a big , steaming bowl of oatmeal . It 's warm and gooey , but you 're not sure if it feels right . Try as I might , no matter how warm and gooey Raising Victor Vargas became I was always aware that something did n't quite feel right . Victor Vargas suffers from a certain overconfidence on the director 's part . Apparently , the director thought that the ethnic backdrop of a Latino family on the lower east side , and an idyllic storyline would make the film critic proof . He was right , but it did n't fool me . Raising Victor Vargas is the story about a seventeen - year old boy called , you guessed it , Victor Vargas ( Victor Rasuk ) who lives his teenage years chasing more skirt than the Rolling Stones could do in all the years they 've toured . The movie starts off in ` Ugly Fat ' Donna 's bedroom where Victor is sure to seduce her , but a cry from outside disrupts his plans when his best - friend Harold ( Kevin Rivera ) comes - a - looking for him . Caught in the attempt by Harold and his sister , Victor Vargas runs off for damage control . Yet even with the embarrassing implication that he 's been boffing the homeliest girl in the neighborhood , nothing dissuades young Victor from going off on the hunt for more fresh meat . On a hot , New York City day they make way to the local public swimming pool where Victor 's eyes catch a glimpse of the lovely young nymph Judy ( Judy Marte ) , who 's not just pretty , but a strong and independent too . The relationship that develops between Victor and Judy becomes the focus of the film . The story also focuses on Victor 's family that is comprised of his grandmother or abuelita ( Altagracia Guzman ) , his brother Nino ( also played by real life brother to Victor , Silvestre Rasuk ) and his sister Vicky ( Krystal Rodriguez ) . The action follows Victor between scenes with Judy and scenes with his family . Victor tries to cope with being an oversexed pimp - daddy , his feelings for Judy and his grandmother 's conservative Catholic upbringing.<br /><br />The problems that arise from Raising Victor Vargas are a few , but glaring errors . Throughout the film you get to know certain characters like Vicky , Nino , Grandma , Judy and even Judy 's best friend Melonie . The problem is , we know nothing of Victor Vargas except that he is the biggest gigolo in the neighborhood . We know that he knows how to lick his lips , and comb his fro , and carry himself for the sake of wooing girls into the sack , but that 's all . We know that Nino plays piano , and quiet well , you could see it by the awards on the family piano . We know his sister Nicki , is a gossip - loving girl with an invested interest in watching TV . We know that grandma is a hard - working traditional Latina woman who 's trying to raise her kids with conservatively in a world of excess corruption . Yet where is the titular character , Victor Vargas ? He 's in this movie somewhere , but we only know what the movie tells us . This is by far the film 's biggest flaw . Victor Vargas is n't so much a character but a ping - pong ball , bouncing between scenes with Judy and his Grandmother , but we never get to know who Victor Vargas really is . This is important because as I 've mentioned the only thing we know of Victor Vargas is that he 's a sexually active teenager with a libido the size of Manhattan . He 's a total Alpha - male . Victor Vargas is not the kind of character I sympathize with at all . Why should anyone ? So by the end of the movie , in the aftermath of the climax are we truly led to believe that somehow Victor Vargas has attained ANY depth and learned the errors of his ways ? How could such a two - dimensional character have any depth ? If only the director had worried a little more about fleshing out his main character instead of worrying about getting that perfect hand - held shot.<br /><br />Raising Victor Vargas brings to life the world of the Latino inner - city neighborhood to the big screen . Something that few films have done before in the past . The film has been complimented for feeling so real , and I won't < br /><br />argue with that . I have n't seen this level of reality since CBS aired Survivor . Seriously , although the movie has some nice shots of the city , the writer / director Peter Sollett was way too dependent on close - ups and hand - held shots . This problem is particularly noticed in indoor scenes that are so claustrophobic I was forced to perform deep - breathing exercises to keep from passing out . As the film continues , the shots get tighter and tighter with faces cropped from brow to chin on the screen ; you can practically smell Victor Vargas 's cheap cologne . The overall effect is unrealistic in contrast . The indoor scenes of inner - city apartments make them look small and cramp , which is not true . I 've been in those type apartments ; I used to live in one . They 're not splendorous but they have high ceilings and they 're decent living spaces . By the movie 's standards you 'd think that these apartments were 5x5 cells of brick - and - mortar , chipped paint and cracked walls . Unfortunately , Sollett 's constant use of close - ups and one particularly bad shot with a zoom - in on one scene come off as totally amateurish . But Raising Victor Vargas is only Sollett 's second film , and his most well known , a solid effort in filmmaking that will hopefully get better as he continues to make films . One review I read summarized the movie as , ` Ethnicity for Ethnicity 's Sake , ' and I can not agree more . If Victor Vargas were truly a great film and story , then the characters ' applicability would n't matter whether they were Latino , Chinese , etc . Yet if you were to take this story and stick it in middle - class suburbia with a bunch of teeny - bopper white kids the results would n't be such glowing reviews , and we 'd see the film 's flaws more clearly . Indeed , some other aspects of the use of Latinos in this film bother me . While some aspects of Victor Vargas are accurate others I have to question . For example , Victor , Nino and Vicky all share the same room to sleep . This set off an alarm for me because it seemed contrary to what I believe . Any self - respecting Latino family would n't have two older brothers sharing the same room with a thirteen - year old girl . At first I was unsure , perhaps I was wrong , but after speaking with my grandmother I knew my problem with this was justified . Considering how conservative the grandmother is , you 'd think that Vicky would have been sleeping in her room.<br /><br />As a Latino who grew up in a somewhat conservative Cuban household , raised by my grandmother while my mother was working full - time , I could relate to the movie in many ways , which is why my critical viewpoints are bittersweet because I really wanted to love this movie . Unfortunately , my lack of respect for Victor Vargas sabotaged my feelings for the film . Maybe it 's because Victor Vargas reminds me of those guys who were getting laid while I was playing with my Sega Genesis when I was seventeen . Maybe it 's because without any further introspection by the film , Victor Vargas is merely a stereotypical hot - blooded Latino , who 'll just end up shouting to girls from his car , ` Hey bay - bee , ju want to get into my luv Mah - Cheen ? ' Either way I do n't like him , so ultimately how can I like a film about him ? So if you 'll excuse me , I 'm going to go stick my hands into a bowl of grits.<br /><br / >
0 Someone will have to explain to me why every film that features poor people and adopts a pseudo - gritty look is somehow seen as " realistic " by some people.<br /><br />I did n't see anything realistic about the characters ( although the actors did their best with really bad parts ) or the situations . Instead , I saw a forced , self - conscious effort at being " edgy " , " gritty " and " down and dirty".<br /><br />Sadly , it takes a lot more than hand - holding the camera without rhyme or reason and failing to light the film to achieve any of the above qualities in any significant way.<br /><br />It 's a sad commentary on the state of independent film distribution that the only films that see the inside of a movie theater are nowadays all carbon copies , with bad cinematography , non - existent camera direction and a lot of swearing striving to pass themselves as " Art".<br /><br />It 's little wonder that films like " In the Bedroom " or " About Schmidt " get such raves . I found them to be meandering and very average , but compared to the current slew of independent clones like " Raising victor Vargas " they are outright brilliant and inspired.<br /><br />A few years ago seeing an " independent " film meant that you would likely be treated to some originality and a lot of energy and care , and maybe a few technical glitches caused by the low budgets , nowadays , it means that chances are you 'll get yet another by - the - numbers , let's - shake - the - camera - around - for - two - hours attempt at placating the lack of taste of independent distributors . And of course all that to serve characters and situations that are completely unreal and contrived.<br /><br />Is it any surprise that the independent marketplace has fewer and fewer surviving companies ? Not at all when you see films like Raising Victor Vargas that do nothing but copy the worst of the films that preceded them .
0 .... this movie basks too much in its own innocence . It does n't tell a story ; it 's more a big time snooze fest . While the actors are all personable , the story is so trite and goes nowhere . I think Victor Rasuk has great charisma , but deserves a real film from a real storyteller .
0 Raising Victor Vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be : being real . Unfortunately , there is no reality to this film . The characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake.<br /><br />The reason ? Bad directing . Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal . It seems Mr. Sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give it an authentic feel . Wrong ! It just gives it a badly - made feel . Similarly , shaking the camera does not give a documentary style to your film , it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what 's on screen instead of enhance it.<br /><br />Of course , what 's on screen is so painfully fake , as if Mr. Sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look " hip " to his Sundance buddies and show how " edgy " a filmmaker he is.<br /><br />Overall , the only lasting impression this film leaves you with is what a bad director Mr. Sollett is . Next time , how about taking a few writing and directing classes ?
0 " Raising Victor Vargas " is one of those light , family movies that you can watch and do the N.Y. Times crossword puzzle at the same time . And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a Corona , you do n't have to " Pause " the DVD . Just let it roll , 'cause you wo n't be missing anything really important . No twists , turns , or tension . It 's not really an ethnic movie , it 's a movie about a poor , struggling immigrant family that happens to be Latino . They could have been any ethnic group . It made very little difference . I 've seen it all a zillion times before . Just plug in a Jewish family , an Italian family , a Black family , or an Irish family . Just the accents and names were different . If the Vargas family was named Bush or Clinton and were Presbyterians , the movie would have been a total snooze . < br /><br />It 's funny that the critics here could n't get the locale straight . Some said it was Spanish Harlem . Some the Bronx , and another Brooklyn . As a life - long New Yorker , I vote for the Lower East Side . And it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other Latinos . They lived in an insulated / isolated little enclave . Some interaction with non - Latinos might have created some excitement , interest , or tension . Remember West Side Story?<br /><br />And now for the oft - criticized cinematography . I do n't know if it was my TV or what , but all the indoor shots looked very ORANGE to me . The apt , the furniture , and the faces were all ORANGE . What was that supposed to mean ? And the apt . did look pretty cramped to me . Somebody here mentioned that the old apt's / tenements had very big rooms . Well , maybe 50 years ago . What landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them . < br /><br />And another annoying thing .... This is the second family movie I 've seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy " jerking off " . Is this private sex act necessary for us to watch ? Please spare me ! What 's up with these directors ? < br /><br />So " Victor Vargas " is a pleasant little movie . It was nice for a change to see young Latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents , which they did . But the writers let them down , giving them a flat , unspectacular script to work with . Enjoy the show , but keep your fingers near the " fast forward " button .
0 What a bad , bad film ! ! ! I ca n't believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious , amateurish excuse for a real movie ! ! I left the theater before the end , stunned by how bad the direction and camera - work of that movie were ! ! And to read adoring paeans that claim there is truth and reality in this film when all it is in reality is a brazen attempt at pulling the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals by being cheap and tawdry.<br /><br />At least this film showed me once and for all that the Sundance Festival has become a complete joke and that being shown here is more a label of bad film - making than anything else.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs . You 'll want your time back ! I know I did .
0 First of all , write the script on a napkin . Who needs more than that ? After all we 're not a Hollywood film.<br /><br />Then get amateur actors . It will be good for the festival hype . After all , who needs people who have spent years honing their craft ? Then , hire a cinematographer who does n't know how to light . You see , if it 's well - lit , it wo n't look " real " and the festival people wo n't like it . Who needs to have professional level photography anyway ? Then hire a ten - year old who has never held a camera to be your operator . It will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival screeners will mistake for " reality " and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people , critics and a small sliver of the audience who over - intellectualize will scream " genius " because they wo n't believe this was just complete amateur - hour.<br /><br />Once you 've done that , buy your ticket to the Festival of Bad Movies aka Sundance.<br /><br />What a sad waste .
0 How many more of those fake " slice of life " movies need to be made ? Hopefully not too many.<br /><br />Raising Victor Vargas is a very self - conscious attempt by the director Peter Solett at garnering the attention of Hollywood . Nothing wrong with that in general . What is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every cliché in the book of supposedly " edgy " Hollywood independent production.<br /><br />It 's supposed to be " real " so left shake the camera " documentary style " , except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose ... <br /><br />It 's " edgy " so let 's not waste any time lighting the film.<br /><br />It 's " hip " , so let 's have the children use swear words like Al Pacino in Scarface ... <br /><br />And so on , and so forth . All that you are left with is a very self - conscious attempt at impressing Hollywood that wo n't impress anyone outside of the " rarefied " indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film .
0 I ca n't believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6 ! It is barely watchable and unbelievably boring , certainly one of the worst films I have seen in a long , long time.<br /><br />In a no - budget way , it reminded me of Star Wars Episodes I and II for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck.<br /><br />This film should be avoided at all costs . It 's one of those " festival films " that only please the pseudo - intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it " different " , therefore good.<br /><br />Bad film - making is not " different " , it 's just bad film - making .
0 This " film " is one of the most dreadful things I have ever seen.<br /><br />Please do yourselves a favor and avoid this incompetent concoction.<br /><br />Shaking the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as " direction " , which this film needed in droves . Not that the writing was all the wonderful , rather we were left with a bunch of completely artificial characters directed in that most artificial way ( the pseudo - documentary " style " prized by those who do n't know how to direct).<br /><br />This film gives the impression that it was done cynically to appeal to critics who do n't know the first thing about film - making ( which is most of them).<br /><br />Just terrible . It says a lot about Sundance and what it 's become that Victor Vargas was showcased there .
0 Raising victor Vargas is just a bad film . No amount of denial or ad - dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact.<br /><br />Maybe Peter Sollett saw he did n't have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current " edgy film - making " . Maybe he just does n't know any better . It 's hard to tell.<br /><br />What 's not hard to tell is the result . Except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film - making into an attempt at pseudo - realism , few will enjoy it.<br /><br />I know I didn't.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor and pass on this film .
0 That this poor excuse for an amateur hour showcase was heralded at Sundance is a great example of what is wrong with most indie filmmakers these days.<br /><br />First of all , there is such a thing as the art of cinematography . Just picking up a 16 mm camera and pointing it at whomever has a line does not make for a real movie.<br /><br />I guess we have to consider ourselves lucky the director did n't pick up someone 's camcorder ... <br /><br />Second , indie films are supposed to be about real people . There 's nothing real in this film . None of the characters come across as being even remotely human.<br /><br />What they come across as being is figments of the imagination of a writer trying to impress his buddies by showing them how " cool and edgy " he is.<br /><br />Sorry , but this is not good writing , or good directing.<br /><br />What is left is a husk of a bad movie that somehow made its way to Sundance . Hard to believe this was one of the best films submitted ... <br /><br />In any case , it made me loose what was left of my respect for the Sundance brand .
0 Ho - hum . An inventor's(Horst Buchholz)deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands . Unknowingly his son(Luke Perry)has been working on the antedote all along . Enter CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and the cat - and - mouse car chases and gunfire begins . Also in the cast are : Tom Conti , Hendrick Haese and an aging Roger Moore . Moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts . Perry fans will be accepting . d'Abo is wrong for the role , but nice to look at .
0 Horrible acting , horrible cast and cheap props . Would 've been a lot better if was set as an action parody style movie . What a waste . Starting from the name of the movie.<br /><br />"The Enemy " Naming it " Action Movie " would 've made it better . ( contributing to the parody effect ) . The cop looking like a 60 Year old player , the blond girl just having the same blank boring look on her face at all times . Towards the end of the movie him and her are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it just feels like the cheap lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie . Horrible . Do n't waste your time .
0 After the success of Scooby - Doo , Where are You , they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show . But unfortunately , they added a new character that spoilt Scooby - Doo success forever . They invented a new show with a new title , Scooby and Scrappy - Doo . It was Scrappy - Doo that made this show a complete failure , probably for both adults and kids together . Scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up . Scooby and Shaggy were getting scared of the villain , and they were also trying to stop him . Scooby - Doo does n't need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews . If they wanted Scooby - Doo to be more successful , they should have either killed or never thought up Scrappy . This was just poor , maybe your kids will prefer it !
0 I grew up on Scooby Doo Where Are You , and I still love it . It is one of my favourite cartoons along with Darkwing Duck , Talespin , Peter Pan and the Pirates and Tom and Jerry . This show though is good for kids , the voices are good(Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy ) , the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation . However it is rather disappointing . I normally do n't mind Scrappy , but when he appears to be like the main character , it gets annoying fast . Complete with the catchphrase Puppy Power , Scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual . Also half the gang are missing after the first year , somehow it did n't feel like Scooby Doo . And the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal , very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies . All in all , not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo : Get a Clue , but this show is disappointing . 4/10 for the animation , voices , theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids . Bethany Cox
0 While I have never been a fan of the original Scooby - Doo ( due to its horrid production values ) , it appears like Shakespeare compared to this pile of crap brought to us by Hanna - Barbera ! Without a doubt , Scrappy - Doo is about the most annoying and awful character created for children ( and this includes the Teletubbies as well as Tommy the Tapeworm ) . Whose bright idea was it to create some sort of short mutant dog and enable it to speak and then saddle the Scooby - Doo characters with it ? ! Whoever it is deserves to die or watch this show ( I think death is preferable ) . The bottom line is that the little dog is simply unfunny , annoying and grates on the nerves -- and this is only in the BETTER episodes ! ! After many years , it would have been better to just end the franchise than create this mess ! I can see why in the live - action Scooby - Doo movie they made the villain Scrappy - Doo -- since practically everyone hates him !
0 This movie is one long chiche after another . First of all , though they did their share , there is a unwarranted dope scene where John sniffs weed like an idiot . The wigs and accents are terrible . They sound worse then the old Beatle cartoons . John is the nasty , envious , closet homosexual , slave to Yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited Albert Goldman book . They even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation " it was always just the Two Of Us " ! John would not have been mean to his fans like this either . Like his death showed us he was too nice if anything . The one funny scene is where a dumb Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul 's Yesterday . An insulted John says something along the lines of " Sure and while I croon why do n't you get down on your knees , put on your wife 's wig , and lick my liggin " . That made me laugh for days . Really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous . John and Paul also did not sit pontificating all day , they were funny light hearted guys who even during The Beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here . Forget it .
0 I do n't understand how " 2 of us " receive such a high rating ... I thought that the first half dragged on and the second half did nt make sense , followed by an unresolved climax which was not worth the trouble . However , I did like Jared Harris ' performance of John Lennon which was worth the wasted 2 hours .
0 My dad is a fan of Columbo and I had always disliked the show . I always state my disdain for the show and tell him how bad it is . But he goes on watching it none the less . That is his right as an American I guess . But my senses were tuned to the series when i found out that Spielberg had directed the premier episode . It was then that I was thankful that my dad had bought this show that I really ca n't stand . I went through his DVD collection and popped this thing in when i came home for a visit from college . My opinion of the series as a whole was not swayed , but I did gain respect for Spielberg knowing that he started out like most low tier directors . And that is making small dribble until the big fish comes along ( get the pun , HA , HA . Like Spielberg did . It 's like Jesus before he became a man . Or that s at least what I think that would feel like . Any ways if your fan of Columbo than you would most likely like this , even though it contains little of Peter Falk . I attribute this to the fact this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet . This episode mainly focuses on the culprit of the crime instead of Columbo 's investigation , as many later episodes would do .
0 I do n't remember the last time I reacted to a performance as emotionally as I did to Justin Timberlake 's in " Edison . " I got so emotional I wanted to scream in anguish , destroy the screen , readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism . Timberlake is horribly miscast ; in fact , casting him is like casting Andy Dick to play the lead role in " Patton , " or Nathan Lane to play Jesus . But that is almost beside the point.<br /><br />Timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role . I used to have problems with Ben Affleck 's acting talent , but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench . With his metrosexual lisp ( read lithp ) , his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like " The 25 Cliché Expressions for Actors , " he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly , and no matter how you slice it , I do not and will not buy his role as an amateur - turned - crusader - for - justice journalist . It simply will not fly.<br /><br />However , Timberlake alone is n't to blame for his failure . Director David J. Burke puts him not only in the ( essentially ) primary role , but also places him aside Morgan Freeman , Kevin Spacey , John Heard , Dylan McDermott , Cary Elwes and ( I 'm surprised he was as good ) LL Cool J. I can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with Timberlake.<br /><br />There is an upside to this of course : the moment any of these actors interact without Justin there it feels like a double relief . A pleasure , if you will . Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together , but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so - called hero . Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />But enough of Timberlake bashing - words are n't enough in this particular case to do the trick . " Edison " is a very , very run - of - the - mill corruption story . It 's plot ranges from cliché to simply preposterous . I do , however , admire the motivation behind making it , which I interpret as an homage to films like " Serpico , " or " Donnie Brasco , " or maybe even " Chinatown . " Do n't get me wrong - " Edison " is not even in the same ballpark as these films , but I can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence , perhaps to justify my sitting through it.<br /><br />The script , in and of itself , features some surprisingly bad writing . Yes , it has some decent interchanges , but any conversation between Piper Perabo ( who is wasted here ) and Timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a Dawson 's Creek episode . It 's your typical far - too - glib - for - reality , let's - impress - the - audience - with - how - well - we - articulate ( and fail ) dialogue . This dialogue , mind you , is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments - sometimes it feels like " Edison " wants to morph into a music video , where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting , but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds ( read slow - motion).<br /><br />Thinking about it , " Edison " is a curiosity . It 's sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by Timberlake who simply does n't work . In film as in most art , if one thing is off , the whole thing feels off . Directors must make tough choices . David J. Burke missed the mark here . Some of the scenes play well in and of themselves , but as a whole , they do n't seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture . And it 's not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with .
0 Normally , I have much better things to do with my time than write reviews but I was so disappointed with this movie that I spent an hour registering with IMDb just to get it off my chest.<br /><br />You would think a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bankable bet ... well , this movie was just terrible . It is nigh on impossible to " suspend disbelief " ; I tried , really , I wanted to enjoy it but Justin Timberlake just would n't let me . < br /><br />Timberlake should stick to music , what a dreadful performance - NO presence as an actor , NO character . Ca n't blame everything on Justin : The movie also boast a dreadful plot & badly timed editing ; its definitely an " F".<br /><br />After seeing this , I have to wonder what really motivates actors . I mean , surely Morgan actually read the script before taking the part . Did he not see how poor it was ? What then could motivate him to take the part ? Money ? Of course , acting is at times more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work . < br /><br />LL Cool J is a great actor ; he gets a lot more screen time than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script . < br /><br />Meanwhile , the audience goes : " What the hell is going on here ? You expect me to believe this crap?" < br /><br />In short , apart from Justin a great lineup badly executed - very disappointing .
0 Wow . I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast . Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison had.<br /><br />His acting was PAINFUL to observe . The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors , heck , even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on . How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend.<br /><br />His character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass , and he is supposed to be the hero ... I would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video . MAYBE if you have HBO and have NOTHING else to do at 2 am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned , this may be OK.<br /><br />Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human ' Kermit the Frog ' act in a Hollywood Blockbuster , just did n't work at all .
0 That is the only question I am left with . Why did this movie suck so much when it had such a great cast ? Why was the writing so bad , it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters ? Why did it not make any sense at all ? Why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and " Hollywood " the hell out of it when all it needed was good , smart story telling ? Why ? I never understand why movies that start out good turn into a pile of crap by the time they 're released . I hope for the sake of Freeman an Spacey , who are Oscar WINNERS , that this never is released to the big screens in America.<br /><br />As someone that holds a Bachelors Degree in Journalism , the whole story is just utterly laughable . I just ... think the script had potential , but the execution turned it into a cliché , and an awful one at that . Just . No .
0 i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations . the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good , right ? how wrong i was . < br /><br />i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey ( a director / writer of wiseguy making his feature debut = blah ) ... well the director / writer of Edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man , because i can not see how he ( along with the other actors in the film ) would ever agree to be in this disaster . < br /><br />this movie is absolutely appalling ! it 's a mixture of every cop hard boiled cliché ever . there is nothing new with Edison . the acting was bad and the direction was even worse . it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy . this was the best casted direct to video movie i 've ever seen . < br /><br />some examples of just bad silly moments in Edison ... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music ... justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles ... llcoolj driving a vintage firebird ... 3 guys being shot in the head ... <br /><br />this movie is the opposite of good.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM EDISON !
0 Three tales are told in this film , that seemed to have been shot without knowledge of this being a combined vignette film . The makers relate the three vignettes by having them all connected to shrink Martin Kove , although you never see some of the leads with Kove.<br /><br />The first vignette has sexy Vivian Schilling , a woman afraid of everything under the sun(she makes Adrian Monk look brave ) , having a paranoia laced evening at home alone . You will literally scream at Vivian for doing some ridiculous things . She spends the majority of her time in a nighty which shows off her amazing features . But her film is the worst if not the most nail - biting.<br /><br />The second vignette is owned by Bill Paxton as he portrays the roommate from Hell . His geeky roommate allows him to take complete advantage of him , and Bill does so whenever he can.<br /><br />The last vignette was funny as a man fears that death will take him at any moment , much like his pal who choked to death on an olive.<br /><br />Not very interesting , as the movie as a whole seems chopped together with very little thought involved . A must for Bill Paxton fans .
0 Imagine a woman alone in a house for forty five minutes in which absolutely nothing happens . Then this goes on twice more . The writing is flat and lifeless , and jokes unfunny , and the bad acting keeps you from caring about any of the characters , even when they battle wolf packs and get beaten up by fraternity goons . Anyone that ranked this movie higher than a two is not fully sane .
0 This movie still chills me to the bone thinking of it . This movie was not just bad as in low - budget , badly acted , etc . although it certainly WAS all of those things . The problem with this movie is that it seemed to be intentionally trying to annoy the viewer , and doing it with great success . What I want to know is , is this supposed to be a horror movie ? I mean , it 's definately horrifying , but not in the way horror movies are supposed to be . I could see the first segment trying to be horror and failing , but what the hell is the second segment ? It 's just annoying . The third segment is like watching an artsy student film , which amazingly enough makes it the least painful segment . It 's an atrocity that this movie is n't way low on the bottom 100 , so get your votes ( 1/10 ) in people ! ! I know some people gave this good reviews , but , well , they 're lying in a sadistic attempt to trick you . Trust me , it is impossible to like this movie . The only benefit of this movie is an amazing life - extending effect : it feels like you 've been watching this movie for years after only the first half hour has passed .
0 This is the single worst movie I have ever seen . Let me say that again : THIS IS THE SINGLE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.<br /><br />It had all of the ear - marks of a bad movie : continuity errors , bad writing , bad acting , bad production value , bad music . I thought that there were a couple points to horror movies . The first is that it is supposed to be suspenseful enough to scare you . This movie gets and F in this category . The second point is that when a character dies , or something bad happens to them , we are supposed to care . This movie gets an F in this regard as well . < br /><br />The first story , a woman gets mauled by wolves after being afraid that this would happen to her . The next story , an OCD guy dies from not being careful and talks to a dead friend of his . Oh , and then there is the horrific , nail - biting story of a bad roommate . Come on , could you pick topics a little more interesting and a little less common than being alone in a house , being anal - retentive , and having a roommate ? Turns out all of these stories where hallucinations , virtual reality induced by a Doctor who in turn uses it himself . Wow , stupid.<br /><br />Let me explain something , I enjoy watching bad horror movies and laughing at how bad they are . I could n't do that with this one . It was utter pain to sit and watch . Do not under any circumstance watch this movie . You WILL regret it .
0 This is a horrible movie . All three stories are bracketed with a psychiatrist hypnotist line which is unnecessary and all the stories are bad . The first is about wild wolves and some lady , there are some things that do n't make sense , but the hypnotism thing makes up for that . The second one , with bad Bill Paxton as a maniac roommate should not be viewed by anyone . The last one , sadly the best is almost incomprehensible which I guess makes it better than the other garbage .
0 This should have been a movie about Sam and his wife , the glorious Peter Falk and equally glorious Olympia Dukakis . That would have been a movie worth seeing . Instead it 's a Paul Reiser vehicle , with a little Falk thrown in . The wonderful Elizabeth Perkins is also in this movie , but you 'd hardly know it . I presume Reiser is under the impression that he 's a giant movie star who needs an appropriate vehicle . He 's not . Even more galling is that Reiser took the trouble to hire some of the best women character actresses on the screen today and then shoved them all into his background . Dukakis does not show up until the last 15 minutes , but when she does , the screen glows . The story is about Falk and Dukakis really , but we 're subjected to a pointless , silly , preposterous road trip in which Reiser gets to show how very cute , precious and oh - so - deep with psychological insight ( wrong ! ) he can be . For instance , In a restaurant scene that I imagine Reiser had hoped was " Cassavetes - like " there 's a laughably false confrontation between Reiser and Falk that is so patently ridiculous , I was embarrassed for Falk .
0 I have two good things to say about this film : the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance ( considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction ) . However , that said , I found this film extremely tiresome . Watching paint dry would have been more entertaining . It seemed much longer than 97 minutes . Beginning with opening sequence , where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything that 's said to him on the phone , the movie is annoying . The film is filled with clichés and shtick , not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by Falk . Also , the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears . There are some sequences that are touching , but they 're all played for laughs . If schmaltzy , sentimental , and " cute " appeal to you , you 'll love it . But if you were hoping for something with more substance , see a different movie .
0 Did anyone else notice whenever they are in the car each time the camera takes a new angle they switch roads . Like in one scene it is a one lane residential with sidewalks , next they are on a multiple lane highway with a divider , next a two lane country road with double yellow lanes . I can understand a low budget but that was just sloppy film work.<br /><br />I also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie . I think that if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy then you may enjoy this movie . If , however , you find his work / not funny then I would recommend staying away from this one .
0 This movie could have been 15 minutes long if it were n't for all the bickering between son and father . Very predictable . Both Male " stars " need a good slap in the face ! Would you like some cheese with that " whine ? " Two chuckles ... and a headache . I can understand why the mother left her hubby after 47 years ... I do n't know how she lasted that long ! The first 5 minutes made me want to turn the movie off wishing I had never paid the $ 3.99 to watch it ! The movie did n't flow well and was painfully long . I kept watching my watch hoping time would fly faster ... It did n't . The script had so much repetition that it had to be easy for the writer to fill space . On a positive note ... the scenery was pretty , fall being my favorite season . The car , the 40 Ford was also quite nice . This movie gets an D- rating approaching an F
0 Herculis Puaro is , in general , a well established ' hero ' we know well from books and movies . This movie or this story do n't work and i felt its not Agatha 's mistake . The cast is n't good , the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures , the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything ( even Arab clothes ) look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama . The actor playing Herculis Puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic . The scenes are , as said before , perfect and looking fake . The story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45 + woman in the iraqi desert ? ! The ' victim ' is not likable .
0 This series gets 2 stars solely because it puts some of Dickens ' Bleak House on film and perhaps someone will read the book . Contrary to what is probably received opinion , Diana Rigg was poor as Lady Dedlock . She was clunky and wooden . Lady D. is a reserved character but not a martinet . Denholm Elliot is wrong , wrong , wrong for Mr. Jarndyce . So I 'll interrupt myself and respond to all those people who are saying : " I did n't read the book , so I do n't have to take this guy 's opinion because he 's basing his evaluations on the book . " True and not true . For ex , Diana Rigg is bad in her role because of poor acting whether or not you 've read the book . On the other hand , Denholm Elliot is a passable Jarndyce ( although too old ) . The series fails not because it 's unfair to compare it to the book , but because the various plot lines and characters just do n't coalesce to make a coherent , dramatic , mysterious andcompelling entertainment . It is dull and flat . If you want to make apossibly good Bleak House , you need to expend 20 hours of film in 10 two hour episodes . But I suggest that producers etc . leave Dickens alone ( even A Christmas Carol ) . Television deadens the genius of Dickens as manifested in his ingenious plots and unforgettable characters .
0 Oh what a condescending movie ! Set in Los Angeles , the center of the universe from the POV of Hollywood filmmakers , this movie tries to be a deep social commentary on contemporary American angst.<br /><br />Stereotyped , smarmy characters of widely varying socio - economic backgrounds cross paths in their everyday , humdrum lives . The plot is disjointed and desultory . Numerous unimaginative plot contrivances keep the film going , like : a drive - by shooting , an abandoned baby left in the weeds , a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer , a guy flying through the night sky over the city , a kid at summer camp.<br /><br />And through all these events , the one constant is the generous helping of sociological " insights " imparted through the dialogue , as characters compare notes on their life experiences . One character tells another : " When you sit on the edge of that thing ( the Grand Canyon ) , you realize what a joke we people are ; ... those rocks are laughing at me , I could tell , me and my worries ; it 's real humorous to that Grand Canyon".<br /><br />And another character pontificates about the meaning of it all : " There 's a gulf in this country , an ever widening abyss between the people who have stuff and the people who do n't have ... it 's like this big hole has opened up in the ground , as big as the ... Grand Canyon , and what 's come pouring out ... is an eruption of rage , and the rage creates violence ... " .<br /><br />Aside from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue , aside from the shallow , smarmy characters , aside from the dumb plot , the story 's pace is agonizingly slow . Acting is uninspired and perfunctory . The film 's tone is smug and self - satisfied , in the script 's contempt for viewers.<br /><br />This was a film project approved by Hollywood suits who fancy themselves as omnipotent gurus , looking down from on high . They think their film will be a startling revelation to us lowly , unknowing movie goers , eager to learn about the real meaning of American social change .
0 Why me ? Why should I be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot ? ! At least if I can warn other people off , it will have been worthwhile.<br /><br />I had to watch this horrible movie for a college course . Otherwise , I would have looked at the synopsis on the back of the thing and steered clear . The movie was slow , had PAINFULLY little character development , and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man can become cool if he hangs out with an LA - style token black man.<br /><br />If you want to experience the stereotypical LA feeling of dizzying superficiality - watch the movie . Note , though , that this movie does not DEPICT what we have come to think of as an " LA lifestyle " , it is a wonderful example of the products that ARISE from it .
0 If there is a hell , it contains a screening room in which GRAND CANYON is playing over and over again on an eternal loop . One would hope that the presence of so many marvelous actors - Danny Glover , Alfre Woodard , Kevin Kline , Mary Louise Parker - would help make up for the presences of Mary McDonnell ( whose penance is to watch her own films for all eternity ) ... But , no . Apparently they injected those other actors with a serum made from McDonnell . The entire affair is pretentious , overblown , insulting ( if you are deaf or know anyone who is , be prepared for your blood to boil at the ludicrous TDD scene ) . GRAND CANYON is filled with obnoxious , self - involved people , but never gives us a reason to like / understand / sympathize with or even tolerate them . With rare exception , they are insufferable losers that the gene pool would be better off without . There 's no plot to speak of , no character development ( these people wo n't EVER develop ) , no break - out performance and the most arch writing you 'll ever encounter in a film . The best thing about GRAND CANYON ? Its title . This is one large HOLE of a movie .
0 I first did n't want to watch this film , for the trailer gave the impression of a common and too expected film ... but as I recently had the pleasure to discover the surprising " Mensonges et trahisons et plus si affinité " " which was beautifully directed and written by Laurent Tirard ( screenwriter of " prête - moi ta main " ) , I changed my mind and decided to try it , thinking that " Prête - moi ta main " , would be as good as " mensonges ... " . And it is absolutely not . The script is not bad , but it is not as well directed as " Mensonges ... " , the actors not as generous ( especially Charlotte , as boring as she usually is ) as Edouard Baer or Clovis Cornillac , and too be honest , I still do n't understand how such crap can have such a success , even with such a casting ... Anyway the story could have been a pretext to create so many interesting plots , but it is not as good as Tirard 's " Mensonges ... " though it 's also written by him . Easy , unsurprising , and lazy work . Totally overestimated !
0 This movie does n't have an awful lot to do with it 's predecessor " Robot Jox " . This must be also the reason why its most common name is " Robot Wars " and not the alternate name " Robot Jox 2 : Robot Wars".<br /><br />"Robot Jox " was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a nice premise of giant robots battling each other in the near future . This concept has been abandoned for this movie and instead it features a totally dull story that besides is n't very original or cleverly written . A shame it tried to be so much different from its predecessor really , for else this perhaps could had been a more fun movie to watch.<br /><br />Just like " Robot Jox " this is a B - movie but with as a big difference that it 's just not a very good one . Perhaps this also has to with the fact that " Robot Jox " got made during the ' 80 's , when B - movies still had a certain bit of charm and class over it , even though the movie got released in 1990 . This really ca n't be said about this movie . It 's just lame , badly made , poor looking and not exciting enough . It also has an ending which leaves you thinking ' This is it ? That 's all?'.<br /><br />What the movie its story is lacking is good clear main plot - line really . Perhaps a good main villain would had been a good idea and some other stuff such as an actual point to the story , some action , or likable main characters.<br /><br />Seriously what were they thinking when they picked the actors for this movie . All of them are simply not likable in their roles and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as the main character , who behaves as if he 's God 's gift to woman and Mr. Perfect who can compete with anyone . Were n't they even simply able to get the actors from the first movie?<br /><br />For such a futuristic movie , with a concept of having large battle droids in it , this movie surely is lacking with its action . Had they put some more and bigger action into the movie , the movie would at least had been a more entertaining one to watch . Instead now we have a movie that fails to impress in basically every way imaginable.<br /><br />You can better watch a " Mighty Morphin ' Power Rangers " episode , for some more action and likability.<br /><br />3/10
0 There 's nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland , and Robot Wars does deliver . Sure , the acting is lousy , the dialogue is sub - par , and the characters are one - dimensional , but it has giant robots ! The special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period . They are certainly not as polished as today 's standards , but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures , so it has aged fairly well . Its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime , and it does have a certain tongue - in - cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable . I would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci - fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction .
0 This film has a weak plot , weak characterization , and really weak special effects that I question why I lost valuable life by watching it . It has random characters who add nothing to the story and seem like excuses for the director to get his girlfriend in the film . The robots are sad and the main " hero " ' bot is turned on by a huge knife switch . If this movie were n't so bad it would be laughable , but there 's nothing funny about it . The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming characters , and he is killed . It 's sad when you root for the bad guy , because he 's the best one to cheer for . When all is said and done , this movie was better left on the cutting room floor , or never funded at all .
0 I 'm a Jean Harlow fan , because she had star quality . I do n't think her movies are good and I do n't even think that she was a good actress , but she certainly was Great in comedies . Every bit of comedy in The Girl from Missouri is very good . But this movie is perhaps more like a love story . Jean Harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast - their performances bring nothing new . It always impresses me much to think that Harlow 's beautiful body was that of an ill woman . Well , in this movie she does look beautiful .
0 Yes , CHUNKY , this is the nick - name that Donna Reeds ' romantic lead played by Tom Drake tags her with ! So lets get this clear right away . From her first ingénue role in THE GET - AWAY ( 1941 ) too her last , DALLAS ( 1984 - 1985 ) Ms. Reed could NEVER be described as CHUNKY . Not this attractive and slim actress . Whose roles at M.G.M. seldom lived up to her talents.<br /><br />Ms . Reed is supported by a cast of competent character actors , who unfortunately must flounder through this alleged ' screw - ball ' comedy . Clearly M.G.M. was out of their depth making this type of film . A type better produced over at COLUMBIA , PARAMOUNT , RKO and even UNIVERSAL . Neither the ' touch ' of Ernst Lubitsch nor the wit of Preston Sturges could save this film . A rather conventional romantic comedy that had all the markings of a pre - war ( WWII ) effort.<br /><br />If Irving Thalberg had still been alive the screen - play would have either gone through a significant rewrite or never seen the light of day . It did fit into Louis B. Mayer 's ' safe - zone ' of none challenging family entertainment . A form that could not stand up to the post - war challenges of the ' DeHavilland Decision ' , loss of their theater chains , television and would contribute to M.G.M.s decline . Fortunetly for Donna Reed her best days are ahead of her culminating in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY ( 1953 ) and her Oscar win as Best Supporting Actress .
0 Thank you Hollywood . Yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap , shallow , effect - heavy and redundant remake . The original " Planet of the Apes " was an intelligent and thought - provoking movie with a very clear message . It was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue , which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting . < br /><br />This movie , on the other hand , seems to have done away with pretty much ALL the dialogues . Instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie . Dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum , character interaction and development are non - existent and most of the time it 's extremely hard to figure out what 's going on . Instead , we get a bunch of pointless action scenes , some marginally funny one - liners and some very hollow quasi - intelligent conversations . < br /><br />The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic . The make - up of the apes is magnificent , and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too . However , this does not distract from the fact that " Planet of the Apes ( 2001 ) " is a very shallow and simplistic movie , filled with paper - thin characters , stupid dialogue and a nearly non - existent plot . Please Hollywood , stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters.<br /><br />Oh yeah , the ending did not make ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.<br /><br / > * out of * * * * stars , mainly for the visuals < br /><br / >
0 Warning : Spoilers Galore!<br /><br />Tim Burton remaking this sui generis movie is about as sensible as remaking Psycho - oh , that 's right , some idiot already did that - I rest my case.<br /><br />Movie opens with chimpnaut blundering a simulation , proving he 's not that smart from the outset . Marky Mark appears in shot without his characteristic underpants showing , then is turned down by a plain woman who prefers the touch of chimpanzees.<br /><br />The perfunctory establishing shot of the space station orbiting Saturn for no apparent reason , interior of ship a - bustle with genetic experiments on apes . Must we travel 1,300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments ? The special effects team decrees it.<br /><br />Marky 's chimp gets lost in that staple of 60s sci - fi cinema - the Time Warp . Marky then demonstrates the space station 's mind - boggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing , while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deep - space rescue mission into a worm - hole for an expendable test chimp , with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies.<br /><br />Before anyone can say ` Pointless Remake ' Marky has surfed the worm - hole , crashed on an alien planet , removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest , if it were n't for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees.<br /><br />Surprise ! It 's APES doing the chasing - or at least , it * would * have been a surprise if no one saw Planet Of The Apes THIRTY - THREE YEARS AGO.<br /><br />Since Marky Mark did not get to show his pecs , take down his pants , or bust his lame whiteboy rap , he was characterless . Michael Clarke Duncan 's gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing * his * lack of character . Helena Bonham - Carter ( aka irritating chimp activist ) , at a loss without a Shakespearean script , did a fine job of outdoing both Marky and Clarke as Most Cardboard Cutout . Paul Giamatti , the orangutan slave trader , secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz . Though I have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie , one review headline captured the essence of this Planet Of The Apes ` re - imagining ' : ` The Apes Of Roth ' . While everyone else minced about looking like extras from One Million Years BC or Greystoke , Tim Roth , as Chimpanzee Thade , chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously . As entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic Thade was , his character lacked a behavioral arc : Thade is mad when we first meet him ... and he 's pretty much at the same level of mad at film 's end . Nice twist.<br /><br />The original POTA ( 1968 ) featured a leading character , Charlton Heston 's Taylor , who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets - yet as that film progressed , Taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankind 's worth - as their sole champion ! The original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation , not salvation : when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty , he is forced to realize that his species had NOT prevailed . Is there anything that cerebral or ironic to Marky Mark 's Leo ? Or Roth 's Thade ? No , but there 's lots of running.<br /><br />The slogans cry : Take Back The Planet .but it 's the APES ' planet . In this movie , humans and apes crash - landed here together , the humans having degenerated to cavepeople , allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor ; the apes DESERVED to inherit the planet ! Along comes Marky Mark , in true anthropocentric arrogance , taking it for granted that humans HAVE to be the apex predators , simply because they 're there . ` Taking it back ' is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001 , complaining , ` A planet where men evolved from APES ? ? ! ! ' and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses.<br /><br />Heston was cast in the 1968 POTA because he had established his reputation as a maverick : he WAS Ben - Hur , Michelangelo , Moses ! To cast him as the mute , dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audience 's expectations : how crazed must a world be where Our Man Charlton can not command respect ? Marky Mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants.<br /><br />Though Heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council , he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting . When Marky Mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans , it 's like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor , who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him . Burton tries to elevate Marky to humanity 's icon , but he comes off as a chittering deviant . In the original film , the apes deem Taylor a deviant , yet he was , to audience and apes alike , an icon of humanity . That irony again.<br /><br />It was apt that a man who elevated scene - chewing to an acting technique - Heston - should play the father of this film 's primo scene - chewer , Thaddeus Roth . As Roth 's ape - dad , Charlton utters his own immortal lines , turned against the HUMANS this time , ` Damn them ! Damn them all to hell!'<br /><br />The movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end . While Thaddeus is giving Marky an ass - beating lesson , a pod descends from on high with Marky 's chimpnaut in it . Apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature , while Marky proves his own hebetude by muttering , ` Let 's teach these monkeys about evolution . ' Firstly , they 're not monkeys , you ape ! Secondly , it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point , not evolution . And what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy , not evolution.<br /><br />Giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that Estella Warren 's half - nekkid role was actually integral to the plot ( be still my pants.).<br /><br />No matter that he was humankind 's last underpanted hope ; in the end , cop apes take Marky away to Plot Point Prison where he was last heard ululating , ` It 's a madhouse ! A MADHOUSE ! ! ... '
0 If there 's one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film , it 's seeing it done by experienced film - makers who ought to know better . This " re - imagining " of Planet of the Apes could have used some imagination , to say nothing of essential elements of character development . Nova , the girl in the original Planet of the Apes , was a better developed character than Daena in this version , for all that she does not say a single word . One certainly expected a lot better from Tim Burton , a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence , wit and humour , all of which were notably absent from this production.<br /><br />There were problems in basic plot development . The first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk . This was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made * all * the difference in the original film . Even while he was mute , his ability to communicate was what marked out Heston 's Taylor as being different from the other humans . In the current film , Mark Wahlberg encourages the ( talking ) human slaves to revolt , but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already . They are dexterous tool - users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans , something mute humans ca n't do . It needs no man to fall from the stars to save them . Indeed , since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre - technology era without ( at first ) any gadgets to help him , it is Wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage , not the humans who are used to living there.<br /><br />It was sad to see Helena Bonham Carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall Mark Wahlberg . Her best scenes were with the villainous Tim Roth.<br /><br />The humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act , at which point Daena started showing some actual interest in Davidson ( Wahlberg ) , and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung - ho freedom - fighter . This was poor character development . ( Estella Warren , in particular , looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script ) . Wahlberg 's puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me , as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout.<br /><br />Creating the apes : half a plus point and two minuses : Ape make - up was excellent on the males , particularly Michael Clarke Duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes ( which was why he was so good in The Green Mile ) , and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully . But the ape females looked like nothing on earth , neither ape nor human . The minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as Flash Gordon 's rocket : jumping apes looked as if they 'd just been fired from a catapult , they had none of the long - limbed grace of genuine apes . Secondly , the poor sound mixing - when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal , probably feline , making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic.<br /><br />In the original film , the various " human " things the apes do and say are handled as light relief ( " I never knew an ape I did n't like . " " Human see , human do ! " ) . Here , the apes just talk matter - of - factly exactly as 21st Century humans do , and there is no humour in it at all . The only genuinely original idea was Ari writing with her feet.<br /><br />Nothing made me cringe more than the " V - Ger from Star Trek " moment near the end of the film . First of all , the apes had apparently been able to read Roman lettering in the distant past , for them to know the name of the Forbidden Zone in its partly concealed form . Secondly , the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which Wahlberg just brushes away , something any ape could have done centuries ago . This moment was , for me , far worse than the much - maligned ending of the movie.<br /><br />Things of that nature , however , are typical of most science fiction movies of today . Back in the ' 60s and ' 70s , they generally did n't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets , but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional . I 'm thinking of 2001 : A Space Odyssey , the 1967 Planet of the Apes , THX1138 , Soylent Green , Silent Running and the 1972 Solaris . The first Planet of the Apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time . However , this film includes just about every bad science fiction cliché going : space storms , anomalies and worm holes straight out of Star Trek ; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes ( in reality from any one planet , all other bodies , even their own moons , are just points of light ) ; a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from Saturn to Earth in a matter of minutes instead of years ; two - thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button . To say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door . In a contemporary setting , you 'd have to explain * why * it was bullet proof , but because it 's " science fiction " you do n't have to!<br /><br />Overall , Burton 's most disappointing film .
0 This film is another of director Tim Burton 's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his ` vision ' to the screen . He has done it with ` Batman ' , ` Sleepy Hollow ' and now this . This is not a remake . The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak ( and Charleton Heston makes a cameo ) . Burton has reconstituted the entire story , watering it down for today 's mass viewership.<br /><br />The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time . During the 1960 's America was struggling to redefine its civilization . It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms . It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal . In that context , POTA was allegorical , reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day . POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior . The dialectic between Colonel Taylor ( Charleton Heston ) , Dr. Cornelius ( Roddy McDowall ) and Dr. Zira ( Kim Hunter ) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.<br /><br />Burton 's version is as much a product of today 's times as POTA was of the sixties . This is Apes for Dummies . It is superficial and jejune , substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance . The ` surprise ' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel . While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene , Burton 's ending simply mocks the audience , taunting , ` I know something you do n't know , and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'<br /><br />From a technical perspective , as is always the case with Burton 's film , the film is excellent . The makeup is fantastic and Burton 's camerawork is outstanding ( though I continue to dislike his dark look ) . However , thirty - three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script.<br /><br />The story has been reduced to a monster movie . The humans band together behind Captain Davidson ( Mark Wahlberg ) to fight the monstrous Apes , aided and abetted by a few turncoats ( notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari ) . The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence , perfect for today 's fast food mentality.<br /><br />The acting is mixed . Mark Wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role . Walberg is excellent at playing dark , sullen characters that are tormented but strong . This part requires an inspirational hero , a profile not in Wahlberg 's repertoire . Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable . She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character , but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager.<br /><br />Then there is Tim Roth . His is a virtuoso performance , single - handedly saving the film from total ruin . Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade . He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time . Additionally , his physical acting is superlative , rendering a chimp - man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists.<br /><br />This film is a great disappointment . It is decent entertainment , as long as you check your brain at the door . I rated it a 3/10 . From a technical perspective it is much better than that , perhaps a 9/10 . However the story is an insult to the original franchise . It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation , using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is . Of course it 's true , but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films , instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption .
0 The acting was bad , the script was bad and the ending was just terrible ... the only good comment i could make about this movie would be the special effects and make up ... but apart from that ... this movie would be one of the worst movies of 2001 ... why on earth did they have to remake such a perfect movie and ruin it ... why ! ! ! !
0 I have seen and liked the original film , and expected more from a remake than this.<br /><br />GOOD : Effects and makeup are good . No complaints about the score and visuals , they are adequate , and the performances were okay ( Tim Roth was excellent , the other principals were fine , and a handful of the " supporting supporting actors " did very well with extremely limited roles ) . The action scenes were exciting and fun.<br /><br />BAD : The escape from the ape city was terrible . The characters are going in circles , then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape . Plus , what escape route leads through everybody 's bedroom?<br /><br />The story was pared down to include as much action as possible . I like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect.<br /><br />Finally , the ending was completely nonsensical as presented . Without seeing the inevitable sequel , there is no justification for it.<br /><br / >
0 I read somewhere that Hollywood should concentrate on remaking bad movies and leave the classics alone . We can only hope . While this remake was n't a total waste , I still wish I had the six bucks back to go toward a DVD of the original . Lots of violence and one of the worst endings I 've ever seen . This version does n't add anything new . It only reiterates why Hollywood should leave the good stuff alone .
0 After looking at monkeys ( oops apes ) for more than one hour , I was feeling like one too . I was an ape , spending money on this movie . Please people , hold you money in your pocket and go see some funny movie like Bridget Jones 's Diary ..
0 Apart from Helen Bonham Carter , there is nothing worthy about this movie .... And the surprise ending ? ! The thought of a sequel is even more annoying . Save your money , wait for the video and ignore that too .
0 I have to admit that this " re - imagining " of the original 1968 film was a huge disappointment . Specially when taken into consideration that this is a Tim Burton film . He is defenetly one of the most original and , might I say , cool directors Hollywood has produced.<br /><br />I am personally a great fan of his work , but something obviously went wrong with his latest flick , The Planet of the Apes . I really enjoyed the original film . When it first came out people expected just another cheezie 70 's science fiction film , but a very surprise anding totally proved that theory wrong . It had indeed a clear cut message . An obvious anti - war message . Fear of the cold war , where it was taking the world and fear of the use of nuclear weapons played a big role in the mind of the film - makers . Those reasons made the film rise above all expectations and it became a instant classic . Although , the new film , the " re - making " or whatever , leaves us with nothing . No message , no ideals behind it . It is just another money - minded summer blockbuster.<br /><br />Visually Tim Burton does not let you down . The dark and creepy settings were excellent and of course the make up was terrific.<br /><br />Obviously that is not enough to keep people intrested in a film . There has to be an exciting plot or storyline . In this movie the plot is highly uninteresting and it is extremely badly thought out . The script is very lame and it is full of gaps . It looks like this film had been written in a big hurry . The explanation for why the apes where there , and why the ruled the planet was indeed very stupid and proved the script - writers ignorance.<br /><br />It raised a lot of questions , which had no reasonable answers to.<br /><br />For example ; Why did the apes speak English ? , why were there other ape - species than chimps on the planet ( given that there were only chimps in the space ship that crash - landed on the planet ) Where the hell did all of those humans come from ? How were a few chimps able to evolve into a huge raise of all kinds of monkeys in only a few thousands years . ( I mean it took a few million years for us to evolve from monkey to man!)<br /><br />And finally , the bad surprise ending was just plane dumb . It was probably just thrown in because the original film had such an end , then they felt that the audience were expecting the same kind of ending . The ending also raises a lot of questions , which I KNOW , don´t have intelligent answears . Did Theid learn to work the space ship ? , which was power - less , and learnt to fly back in time and take over the earth single hand ? , and , what did he do , breed with all the women ? And lets say that that would happen , I higly doubt that history would stay the same , like Washington would be built exactly like it is today ! ( I mean wouln't there be a huge banana instead of the memorial?)<br /><br />Well , just to say something posative about the film . Some of the cast was great . Helen Bonham Carter 's character was interesting and well - acted , as for Tim Roth as Theid . He was very good , a little exaturated at some points of the film . Michael Clark Duncan was also fine . I was not happy with Marc Whalberg . He is not much of an actor , and plays here a very macho colour - less character . Very unbielevable and is nothing compared to Hestons character in the original . And the main female character had no reason or place in the film . She was just casted for the looks . Hardly said a word throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Well , I think that in the future when people think about the Planet of the apes , they will think about the original one . The latest will soon be forgotten .
0 What a disappointment , especially in light of the budget provided , the technical resources available , and the talent assembled . Is n't the fundamental rule for science fiction / drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief . POA 2001 creates a plausible beginning , suckering us in , but thereinafter Mr. Burton forgets that his moviegoers have working brains . The over the top libertarian of Helena Bonham Carter 's chimp , the worthlessness of the humans ' lockup , the ease of their escape , their extraordinary skills of horsemanship ( this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt ) , the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable . Mark Wahlberg never once projects any sense of real fear , danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down . Compare to the original , in which Chuck Heston 's nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events . The uniformed Wahlberg preserves his modesty , but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation , and we never really wonder about his well being . Unlike Heston , he seems never to be in real jeopardy . Tim Burton should have used some of the f / x budget for some competent screenwriting . In fact , after this inferior fiasco , I wonder why Hollywood 's producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats . Let them walk . Trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in Planet of the Apes 2001 . I 'll bet the repeat viewings of this effort will be nonexistent . It could have been a new franchise , and a wonderful new step for imagination . Another opportunity lost .
0 This film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it . It was sort of a remake but then again , not really . I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal . He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money ( $ 100 million ) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $ 6 million ? Heck no . So in that regard , the film fails.<br /><br />At least in the original film , the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming . And , by the way , if you give it some thought , and I did , you can figure out how the ending could come about . I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it.<br /><br />This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of " Beneath the Planet of the Apes " . Here 's how I would have written it:<br /><br />An astronaut ( it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he 's not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys ) that would land on what they would think would be another planet , encounter humans ( not mutes ) , a city ruled by apes , were hunted , made friends with some good apes , discover that they 're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins , end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth , a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes , and then .... well , let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.<br /><br />But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film . Sadly , Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing . Consider what he did with the Batman series . He 's a rotten director inspite what of people think . He 's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking . Sorry , but no . If anyone else had done this film , it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying .
0 Not good ! Rent or buy the original ! Watch this only if someone has a gun to your head and then .... maybe.<br /><br />It is like claiming an Elvis actor is as good as the real King .
0 Spoilers I guess.<br /><br / > The absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie . I just could n't get over it . And what is wrong with Mark Wahlberg 's character ? If I suddenly found myself crashed - landed on a planet full of talking apes , I 'd be all like , " AAAAhhhhHHH ! ! ! Run for your lives ! The monkeys have inherited the Earth ! " But he 's all like , " talking apes , okay . Next ? " That 's pretty jaded I 'd say . He must run into even stranger things on a regular basis . Besides that , this is Rick Baker 's best work yet . This film is a true testament to how far we 've come in the monkey makeup field . 3/10 .
0 Absolutely the worst film yet by Burton , who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs . A miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film . This is the kind of movie where every time something happens , you 'll be sure to hear someone shout out " he 's lost his gun ! " or whatever it is to let everybody know . Carter is really awful and so is Wahlberg , who ca n't play this straight and be convincing . Very nice effects and photography , but poor music in the John Williams mold by Burton 's crony Elfman . Heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch - phrases from the first movie . Very poor results.<br /><br />If anyone else out there also saw " Sleepy Hollow " , they will probably have noticed , as I have , the declining quality of Burton 's films . I 've heard that this particular project was produced by others and that Burton was brought in as director , in which case his judgement should be questioned . But I think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip ; the evidence is there in the films . In " Sleepy Hollow " , he could n't decide what kind of movie he was making , whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie , and the population of british character actors ( Chris Lee , etc . ) made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film ( those are never scary , as horror fans know ) . The movie could n't succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic , and no style had been developed to smooth the two together . " Planet of the Apes " is much the same way , and the result comes off more like " Total Recall " or " Tango and Cash " than like sci - fi . He 's also fallen into the rut of so many other " big " directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience . Word to Burton , if you 're out there -- pick something and do it straight , or use some style to peice it all together ( as in " Mars Attacks " or " Beetlejuice " ) or you might as well retire , because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going .
0 This is a bit of a first for me , the first time I have ever been disappointed in a Tim Burton film . POTA is n't a bad film ( great sets , costumes and the odd great performance ) but it could have been made by any off - the - shelf hollywood director . The pacing was very odd , the last third was just spent waiting for the film to end , by myself and the cast . Tim Roth was excellent , probably the only pleasure in the film . Come back Tim .
0 This movie was 100 % boring , i swear i almost died from boredom at the theater . It was nt funny and did nt really hve that much action in it either , it was BORING and i hope whoever out there that liked this movie , god be with you in the future when you find out what this movie was really like and try to jump off a bridge or something like that
0 while watching this piece of crap ! The Day after , I saw a 1min Trailer - that one minute included all , ALL what was at least not boring to watch ... <br /><br />so do n't waste money or time on this one , get the original , it 's much better though the effects might not be up to date ...
0 This is the worst movie I have seen for years ! It starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way . I thnik when is something going to happen in this film , , , , and the the acting is worse . The ending lifts it a bit and saves the movie from a total flop . Mark Wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie . Sorry Tim Burton Batman was good but this one sucks .
0 I think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci - fi flick . For one thing , it was directed by Tim Burton . Another thing , it 's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic . I found it boring , gross , and ridiculous . If you 've seen it , you know what I mean . Just about everyone at Imdb say it 's crap and boy , are they right ! If you have n't , avoid it . It 's a snorer . 1 out of 10 .
0 Being a big fan of the " other " PLANET OF THE APES films , I rented this DVD despite my aversion to all things Tim Burton . Once again , he does n't fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction . Even the ape makeup looks second rate , which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity . Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor ( as if BOOGIE NIGHTS was n't proof enough ) . I was embarrassed for genuine talents such as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter . No doubt their paychecks motivated them since it could n't possibly have been the cliche - ridden screenplay . I rented this DVD on a special $ 1 night and I still feel ripped off .
0 This Tim Burton remake of the original " Planet of the Apes " from 1968 ( and starring Charleton Heston ) is a far , far cry from the quality and plot of the original.<br /><br />Certainly special effects have improved since 1968 , but writing has not . The characters were boring and the dialog was awful . I sat through the entire film with a friend ( who thankfully only rented it ) and completely understood why , before Christmas , all of the " Planet of the Apes " toys at Target were in the clearance bin.<br /><br />My advice to Tim Burton : do n't put this on your resume.<br /><br />My advice to everyone else : watch the original 1968 " Planet of the Apes " movie .
0 I had VERY low expectations for this alleged " re - imagining " of the original -- and they were n't even met ! What were they thinking ? ( Answer : They were n't . ) Please do n't waste your time on this Hollywood trash fest . Clip your nails , balance your checkbook , do anything besides watch this . Remember : If you rent stuff like this , it will only ensure they make more .
0 What ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time ? Well , he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could 've been directed by anybody available out of film school ... and in fact , they probably would 've done a better job . They would 've at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes . ( gasp ! ) Except this time around , the apes squirm through groan - worthy dialogue , nonsensical plotting , and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could 've been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered ' masterpiece ' next to this tripe.<br /><br />As much as I enjoy the superb acting talent that is Tim Roth , his performance as evil ape leader Thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing . Luckily for him , the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap - dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles.<br /><br />And alas , the always dependable Hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause . And the " haha , we 're so clever , are n't we ? " way that Hollywood intermingles references from the original POTA into this one . Sigh ... <br /><br />Instead of seeing this , spend the night in and call up some friends and rent ' Ed Wood ' , ' Edward Scissorhands ' , ' Batman ' , or even to a lesser extent ' Sleepy Hollow ' , and reminisce about the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality ... not shame and ridicule .
0 I really looked forward to see Planet of the Apes , but it was a huge dissapointment.<br /><br />The settings and masks are great , but that is the only good aspect of the film . All other things are really annoying . Mark Wahlberg is not acting , he is just in the movie , looking stupid . The other actors are also not very good.<br /><br />But the worst point of all , is the story . It is absolutely ridiculous ! For example : the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground , but the humans don`t attack them , no , they wait until they are up again ! This is just one example for the stupid story , but it would take too long to tell them all .
0 Well , it turned out as I expected : visual overload but nothing else added to the original . What did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick . Initially this awoke my interest , but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns ( a ) were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical Hollywood - like product and ( b ) made the whole storyline improbable ! The 1968 story was breathtakingly straightforward , and included no time - storms or any bogus of that sort : it just stated that when you come home after a long journey , things might have changed a bit . Earth might have fallen in the hands of apes , for example . Like many ' old ' movies , it 's main ingredient was suspense ( hell , does anyone understand that word these days ? ) . In this Burton movie , an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie , but at what cost ? Surely , the images are overwhelming , and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete ape - culture ( even ape - music ! ) , but what 's wrong?<br /><br />First , the suspension of disbelief is made very hard , because the apes have a lot of Hollywood - human traits . I refer especially to Ari and the slave - trader . These traits include emotional skills like irony , sarcasm , and an overtly displayed array of ' subtle ' emotions . It makes you forget that the apes are apes , which is essential.<br /><br />Second , the humans TALK . Of course , we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak , but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans did n't made the ape / human role - switching very tangible and stressing in the 1968 version . The wound in the throat that Charlton Heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later regained speech essential to his uniqueness and the interest that Dr. Zira has in him ( so , no need for things like human rights activists or ape - human love in order to explain things).<br /><br />Third , the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the implausibility , but is a necessary twist in the new movie , since Capt . Davidson has to play the Hollywood - let's - save - the - whole - world- and - have - a - good - ending - for - everyone- and - still - make - it - to - the - lounge - bar- for - a - cool - diet - coke character . Oh my god , will they never learn ? I new it from the start , when there was only one guy who got lost ! They were in need of a hero ! And then the script writers go on reasoning : we need one guy ... so , why would one guy get lost ... because he tries to save an ape from an electromagnetic storm ... implausible ! But it 's necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes ! Since , in these modern and politically correct times , we ca n't have a xenophobic ape - hater like Charlton Heston 's 68 character loose on the screen : let 's give them a bubblegum version!<br /><br />Fourth , okay , the general twist of the original ' discovering the truth ' of the 1968 film to the modern version ( he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their lab - apes developed their society , where Heston simply discovered that just , somehow , the apes overtook the earth while he was away ) is nicely done . The second , battle - part comes as an anti - climax . That 's because this movie has added the first two Planet Of The Apes movies in one plot . Nice try , but the chill you feel when Davidson and you discover that he 's lost on the planet forever just washes out due to the uninteresting battle - part.<br /><br />Fifth : the ending ! ! ! For chrissakes , who came up with that ? ! ( a ) Davidson crashes TWICE with his escape pod , which seems an unsteerable object , while the chimp manages to simply land gracefully ? Come on , who 'd believe that ? If the pods are really small space crafts ( Davidson simply flies off into space at the end ) and not merely escape vessels , he might have managed a safe landing at least once , no ? And what about that ending ? ? ? ? I mean , in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth . But here : the whole movie takes place on a distant planet , and suddenly the same ( there 's a Thade statue ) ape culture is on earth ? ? ? How come ? Did the apes of the far planet evolve technologically , flew into the time storm and colonised earth before Davidson 's mission took off ? Why is Thade worshiped ? Stupid stupid stupid.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape , but I 'd expected no less . I preferred her ape above Estella Warren as a human , but maybe I got some loose wire in my head . Nevertheless , the only convincing apes were Tim Roth as Thade ( wonderful ! ) and Ari 's household ape ( the ex - general , but I forgot his name).<br /><br />Nonono , a lot of things could and should have been added / altered to the 1968 pic , but not the plot , at least not in that way . It was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining . It was nicely tongue - in cheek and caricatured . Do n't stylize everything ...
0 Oh my god . the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me . besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old . the plot , the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace.<br /><br />I am not usually this critical about any movie , cause every person has his / her style . But this movie , however , was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008 . I can honestly believe that this movie is unknown , and i think it should stay like this , for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke.<br /><br />I advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies , or even simply movies to stay far away from this one .
0 It says that a girl named Susan Montford both wrote and directed this " movie . " No wonder she has no other credits to her name for writing or directing . She made a severe vocational error in choosing this as her career . This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium.<br /><br />The fundamental thing wrong with this movie other than its ridiculous story of a woman running away from four weak thugs , is the blatant and complete lack of LOGIC.<br /><br />**After she leaves the mall , she gets approached by four thugs as they surround her . Tell me , what woman would aggressively SHOVE a potential attacker while being surrounded , and insult them verbally ? I do n't mean after an attack had already started , because then of course it 's completely normal for someone to fight back . But she shoved that guy and pretty much escalated it to the next level . No woman would do that unless she 1 ) had a weapon , 2 ) has the confidence of knowing that backup is very close , and so is relatively safe from harm , or 3 ) the attackers are so young , and weak looking that she 's pretty sure she can take them . None of that applied in this situation , so she was just acting like someone that 's asking to get raped or mugged . And by the way , when the security guard approached , as SOON as he came within viewing distance of Kim Basinger , why would n't she immediately either run towards him for help , or scream ? ? < br /><br />**When she drives off after the security guard gets shot in the head , she drives into a deserted part of town , and crashes . She had a good three minute lead on the pursuers , instead of simply running off on foot in a diagonal direction behind houses and climbing fences and continuing , she gets out her Red Toolbox and starts messing around under her hood . I understand she was trying to fix her car , but she should 've ran.<br /><br />(I did n't even mean this to be a chronological summary of the movie , because I loathe people who do that in their reviews , but it just so happens that every main sequence of this movie has something so blatantly stupid that I have to comment on it).<br /><br />**Why would she carry a loud , Red Toolbox as she 's trying to sneak away in the dark ? When she does get caught , one of the jokers demands for her to open the toolbox . First she resists , then eventually opens it . And takes out a wrench . This scene here is so rich in subtle overtones of the complete failure of dramatic effect I have to break it down , it 's one of the dumbest scenes in the entire movie . When asked to open the box , she 's resisting at first as if it were her plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it themselves out of anger after she did n't open it , in the same way that someone in some action movie might have some device that an enemy demands that person to touch / push / open / manipulate , and once that hero refuses to open it , the enemy grabs that device , only to have that device automatically dispense a chemical / shoot him in the face / render him unconscious , which was the hero 's plan all along . It feels like that 's what they tried to do with Kim Basinger here , as she opens the toolbox dramatically and quickly takes out a WRENCH and dispatches one of the thugs , and somehow GETS AWAY from him and the three other thugs.<br /><br />**Throughout the rest of the movie , basically what you see is this suburban house wife , sneaking around the woods as she carries her Red Toolbox , taking out various tools used as weapons to KILL HER ATTACKERS.<br /><br />**When she was running away , how did she end up moving BACK to where the thugs were ? I think it was the scene where they had that radio playing loudly in tribute to the dead dude . She somehow crept up on them when I thought she was moving AWAY from them.<br /><br />**Finally , this whole premise is so weak because the whole reason she 's being chased in the first place is because from the thugs ' perspective , she was a witness to a murder they committed against the security officer earlier , and so they felt they had to kill her . How ridiculous . As one of the thugs even said , they could 've just left town and returned back to whatever city they drove from , no one but her had seen them anyway , and she probably did n't get the license plate . Even if these possibilities would n't work in their favor , how is raising hell and hunting down someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder ?
0 Della Myers ( Kim Basinger ) is an upper - class housewife that lives in a private condominium in the suburbs with her twin children and her abusive husband Kenneth ( Craig Sheffer ) . Della gives all the attention to the twins , neglecting their house and her appearance and upsetting Kenneth . On the Christmas Eve , she drives to the local mall in the night to buy wrapping paper for the gifts , and she does not find any parking space available . When she sees an old car parked on two spots , she leaves a message to the owner calling him " selfish jerk " . When the mall closes , Della 's car is hold by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks  Chuckie ( Lukas Haas ) , the Afro - American Huey ( Jamie Starr ) , the Chinese - American Vingh ( Leonard Wu ) and the Latin Tomás ( Luis Chávez ) . When the security guard of the mall protects her , he is shot on the head by Chuckie , Della speeds up her car trying to escape from the criminals . However she crashes her truck nearby a forest while chased by the gang . She takes the toolbox and hides in the wood , fighting against the gang to survive.<br /><br />A couple of days ago , I saw the trailer of " While She Was Out " and I was anxious to watch the DVD . Unfortunately the trailer is better than the movie , and I am totally disappointed with this dull and implausible collection of clichés . Della Myers is presented as an insecure and neglectful housewife and inexistent as wife ; the motherhood is her only interest in her concept of family . She is chased by four mean criminals but she defeats them with a toolbox that seems to be the Batman 's utility belt . Therefore , the plot is so absurd that irritates . The gang of criminals is formed by the favorite cliché of American movies , with an Afro - American , a Chinese - American and a Latin together with an American lord to be politically correct . Kim Basinger has a decent acting , but their children are too young for a fifty - five year - old woman . My vote is four.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Enquanto Ela Está Fora " ( " While She Was Out " )
0 Words ca n't describe how utterly stupid this story ( and therefore bad this movie ) is ! Basinger , Del Toro ... what were you thinking ? ? So there 's a mall and its parking space is totally full . Basinger 's character goes in to buy a cup of tea and some packaging paper.<br /><br />When she comes out , the whole place is so empty , that nobody hears two gunshots fired nearby ? ? Even though she lives there , when she drives away from the baddies , she goes to the most remote and godforsaken place possible instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place ? ? COME ON ! ! ! I wo n't even go into the infamous red toolbox , since other people have done that before . Let alone how she kills the moronic thugs one by one.<br /><br />This is so stupid , without the least bit of logic , I can only warn you watching it , it 's a TOTAL waste of time , honestly ! !
0 Sorry , but aside from Kim Basinger doing a good job acting scared , this was one of the worst thrillers I 've seen in awhile . Logic is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall then shoot a security guard . Yet no one seems to notice . Then , instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall , she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit . I ca n't even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from 4 retarded thugs , carrying a red toolbox , screaming for God to come help her , and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others . Please trust me , this is bad and a bit tasteless as well .
0 Wow . Rarely have I felt the need to comment on movies lately , but this one especially is begging for a beatdown . Let 's start at the beginning . First , writer - director Susan Montford puts Kim Basinger in the tired old victim role , complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence . Let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite . Montford 's pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the Christmas tree with no star is laughable.<br /><br />When She Goes Out for some Christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night , Della is furious that somebody double - parked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year . She decides to do something about it , so she leaves a nasty note on the car 's windshield . The next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to Della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall . When she finally gets to her car , the thugs confront her about the note , a cop is killed , and she runs , and they catch up to her , and she gets away , and they chase her some more , and on and on . Everything is completely predictable and uninvolving . The thugs are not scary or menacing at all , and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways.<br /><br />This is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine . Why the bad guys do n't just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me . And once , just once , in a film like this , does the leader of the pack have to die last ? What does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept ? Much of the movie simply consists of Lukas Haas running around in the woods screaming " Della ! ! ! " And the inclusion of Joy Division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting.<br /><br />The part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when Della , exhausted and hurt , cries out to the heavens , " Where are you , God ? " Where , indeed , was god when this movie was being made ? I give it a 2 only because of competent cinematography and lighting , and it 's not as bad as ' BTK Killer , ' the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film . Cheers !
0 Even though many people here praises this movie , I have to warn you . It has no logic whatsoever . I think that Basinger does a decent job at acting , but you ca n't make a thriller if there is a great lack of realism.<br /><br />This scene paints a good picture for you of the movie : while Basinger is pursued by murderous thugs she decides to sit down and gaze upon a picture she finds from her pocket . The picture is from her daughter and it reads " we love you mommy " . Who does something like that ? What the eff ? And believe me when I say that it is not nearly as stupid as some other scenes of the movie . Someone stated that this is a " hidden gem " . Well , I have to strongly disagree , this movie has stayed hidden for a reason . And it 's not a gem . Oh , and please , I do n't even want to start commenting about the red toolbox . It hurts my brain :D Usually the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small amounts , but this movie basically is made possible only because of the lack of logic . But , i still give it a 4 because even though it is embarrassingly flawed in logic , it has certain mood that kept me watching till the end.<br /><br />So if you choose to watch this , you know you have been warned .
0 My , how the mighty have fallen . Kim Basinger is a great actress but she was definitely slumming when she took this role . This movie is bad for one reason in particular : lapses in logic . Its looks like one of those movies that would have been passable with all its plot holes if it had came out in the 80s and 90s but in 2008 it just looks real stupid . This is the worst thriller I 've ever seen and I 've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted.<br /><br />The story details Della(Kim Basinger)is just getting from buying gifts in a mall an is harassed by a gang of thugs that end up killing a cop that came to her aid . From then on she is chased by these idiotic goons through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools.<br /><br />So many things are wrong with this movie . As I said this movie leaps over logic at every turn and with the exception of Kim Basinger , the acting is made - for - TV bad . Hell , this pseudo thriller is made - for - TV bad . The way she kills each of these politically correct thugs(1 Caucasian , 1 Hispanic , 1 Asian and 1 African American all coming together to stalk a Caucasian woman . Do n't you just love America?)is laughable to a fault . The way she killed the Hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically . The sex scene with the main hoodlum was so out in left field that it make you shake your head in shame . I only recommend this to lovers of bad films and no one else . Anybody else especially Kim Basinger fans would do well not to own this flick . You do n't want see an actress you respect in a film this bad now do you ? Of course not . You were warned .
0 Well , let me start off by saying how utterly HILARIOUS this film is , I simply could n't keep myself from laughing at the sheer stupidity of it . Do n't get me wrong , it IS well acted particularly by Bassinger but the script is just , well the mind boggles truly.<br /><br />The premise is good and up until Della actually witnesses the murder it is engaging but after that it just goes downhill . Half way through the film the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and of course instead of lobbing it at the guy 's head , she decides to pull out a screwdriver , car jack and finally a flare ( as in for a sinking ship ) respectively to kill her victims.<br /><br />Then there is the final line that I promise , if it does n't have you in stitches then I will eat my own left foot.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to those who simply want to laugh at some good old fashioned , appalling film making . Might I also suggest you watch out for the scene in the scrap yard with the guy falling from the one foot high plank of wood , gets me every time .
0 Who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie?<br /><br />Accidental killing of a security guard ... characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them ... and better ... <br /><br />A red toolbox of death ? Please .... <br /><br />Hypothermic weak thugs ... <br /><br />Acting from hell ... <br /><br />Stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy , thriller , voyeurism and ... female ... ( uhm ) Rambo?<br /><br />Unbelievable and it 's an insult to any thinking person . Do not watch , walk away it 's more horrible than you may imagine ... <br /><br />And on top of it all it 's trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it 's violence ... <br /><br />Mrs Montford : Shoot ' Em Up was fun and funny , this is just pathetic and terrible . Good luck next time . :-(
0 What a weekend . Two days ago I watched the first half of " War Games 2 : Dead Code " , now " While she was out " . I am trying to come to a decision which one was worse in terms of pain in my mind while watching . I guess , " While she was out " was worse.<br /><br />It has all been said before in other comments : Unrealistic , illogical etc . - the only thing I really have to add is that at some point I started feeling more for the evil guys than for the woman because I would have recommended her for a Darwin award if she actually died ( only watched first half , so I do n't know ) . Soon I was at two Darwin awards ( if that 's even possible ) for her immense stupidity.<br /><br />And , hey : Produced by Kim Basinger ? So she did not only know the script but was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us , the people ? I consider humans who waste considerable amounts of money to be evil because the money could have used to feed and clothe quite a few people instead of hurting 80 percent of those who saw it in the cinema and giving 20 percent , which are idiots , a good opportunity to show just how much of an idiot they are .
0 This is one seriously disturbed movie . Even Though the boys deserved some of what they got ..... the sadistic gruesome executions were " slightly " over the top . The only character showing some conscience early in the hunt was killed off before he could offer some help to the sad plot.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie , there looked to be some promise of a mediocre affair , but this was just a ploy to lull the viewers into a false sense of security , before the joy of what was to come . < br /><br />The only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if Jack Nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and yelled , " and , where is the batman ? " . Kim Basinger could have screamed . < br /><br />Now that would have been cool !
0 I remember the days in which Kim Basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb Blondie , romantic interest or damsel in danger . But , everything changed when she won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her role in the excellent movie L.A. Confidential , and I think I was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance . However , after that moment , her career did not follow the ideal path . Sure , the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies ( like People I Know or The Door in the Floor),but we have never seen her again on a substantial character . The movie While She Was Out does nothing to put her on that situation ; and it is not only that her character is not too tasty , but also that the movie is really crappy . The screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic . However , Basinger brings some conviction to her character , and that makes this poor movie to win a few points . This movie is full of clichés and generic villains . The work of director Susan Montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly , because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone . The ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous . I do not recommend While She Was Out at all . This film commits the capital sin of being boring .
0 She may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe , but this film shows why she also is a perennial Razzie nominee . To do a film that is so bad must be an indication that she needs money . She could do ads on why you should n't talk on a cell phone while driving , especially at night on the way to a crowded mall.<br /><br />Susan Montford should stick to producing ( Shoot ' Em Up ) as she is not very good as a writer / director.<br /><br />She is accosted by four thugs in the mall parking lot , and the first thing they do is tell her they have a gun . What does she do ? She starts pushing and cursing them like she knows martial arts or something . She manages to get away , but gets lost in the forest after crashing . Why did n't she run to someones house ? We get four thugs with guns chasing a lady with a toolbox . Of course , their guns are no match for her wrench . Ha ! Of course , she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver . Those poor thugs.<br /><br />Now , she 's home for Christmas - and she brought a gun !
0 First of all , really Kim Basinger ? Your rich banker husband leaves you alone in your beautiful , most likely paid in cash for home , and you ca n't even put on a decent shirt ? I 'm a woman , and yes , I 'm going to come right out say it -- clean something , starting with your hair . And while you 're at it , it 's Christmas Eve . Buy your kids some presents ... or at least a Christmas tree . Do n't drive 40 minutes to the crowded mall , park your car 3 miles away and cry about it the whole walk in , and simply buy wrapping paper . Also , the next time you decide to leave someone a nasty note , do n't sign your name . I refuse to feel sorry for Della . Obviously , due to the fact that Kim Basinger is this masterpiece 's executive producer , she wants you to feel bad for the poor white blond woman . We get it . Alec Baldwin is a jerk , but seriously , do n't model horrible films after your own life . Also , you 're in you 50s . You definitely would n't have 8 year old twins . AND THOSE NAMES ? Terry and Tammy . Way to let your kids grow up with any decent chance of ever respecting themselves . It 's also pretty fantastic to hear the characters in the film constantly call her beautiful or refer to her as a " girl" ... obviously Ms. Basinger had some say about what goes in the script . It 's also pretty awesome how none of the criminals can fight back . Apparently , Della 's magical ninja skills are impossible to beat . Her driving skills are pretty nifty too . This film is so cliché , it hurts . Wahhhhh ! They spelled your name wrong on the tea cup . Or your husband put a hole in the wall but all you can think about is buying nail polish when you 're at the mall instead of maybe some plaster and paint . Or the woman you went to high school with bought the teddy you were looking at . Boohooo ! The fact that she refuses to take off that BRIGHT trench coat while running through the woods screaming and breaking everything in her path proves my point -- this woman is a moron . Who thinks to grab the toolbox out of the car , but not their purse , full of identifying artifacts such as your ADDRESS . I have never wanted the " bad guys " to succeed as much as when I watched this film . And did anyone else happen to catch the " African American " shirt the black guy was sporting ? Oh yes , rewind and feast your eyes on perhaps the most racially stereotypical prop in a film yet . Do n't waste and hour and twenty minutes of your life . Instead , go do what Della could n't figure out how to do ... take care of your kids , and maybe brush your hair . That powerful ballad at the end though was pretty impressive . Singing " I 'll Be Home For Christmas " in the rain while your bloody arm clings oh so tightly to your wrapping paper is about as emotional as it gets . Thanks Della !
0 So this is what actress Kim Basinger has succumbed to ? Mmm   to tell the truth the film 's title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic , but simplicity can have its strengths . Anyhow by the end of ' While She Was Out ' I was left feeling rather indifferent . Not the worse ( despite being engulfed by negatives ) , but there 's easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm , but compact and unbalanced late - night survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid , when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park.<br /><br />The problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material ( taken from a short story ) , along with the very variable performances . The flimsy script was poorly thought - out ( which is n't so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off ) , so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events . As for the bunch of stereotypical goons ( led by an unconvincing Lukas Hass as a loose canon ) terrorizing Basinger , well they were less than threatening , but hopelessly clueless . Watching Basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand ( do n't ask me why ? ) knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it did n't elicit tension or emotion   but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up . Basinger 's performance is stout - like , but does n't craft much empathy . Craig Sheffer shows up as her hot - headed husband . Strangely I could n't keep my eyes off the screen   thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic ( why would she be constantly carrying it ) and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug   her choices were quite disappointing . Watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty , due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead.<br /><br />Susan Montford 's soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy , as it pretty much chugs along . I liked the opening credits though , with its hauntingly sullen score ( which is the most effective thing throughout the feature ) and polished photography.<br /><br />No great shakes . Does n't ask much of your time , but I would n't care to see it again . However with the inclusion of a Joy Division song , it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen .
0 Its Christmas Eve and lazy and submissive housewife Della ( Kim Basinger ) receives some violent threats from her troubled and abusive husband . Leaving her twin children in bed she ventures off into the night for one last shopping spree at the local mall . Its busy there and finding a parking space is nigh on impossible , Della takes umbrage at one motorist who parks in two spaces , she leaves them a note saying as much . Returning to her car after visiting the shops she is confronted by some yobs , Yup the owners of the car she left a note on , they are very angry and want some fun with her , a kindly security guard steps into assist her , but things get out of hand and the guard is shot , Della flees with the now murderous yobs in hot pursuit , they shoot at her , she looses control of her car and crashes , quickly grabbing her toolbox from the trunk , she hides in a deserted building site , but is soon caught , just before they try to rape and kill her , from her magical toolbox she produces a wrench , wounding their leader " Chuckie " , she manages to escape again into the nearby woods , in the fracas one of the gang is killed , it just happens to be the black guy Here the night gets worse for all involved as a deadly game of cat and mouse ensues . A similar plot line to Eden Lake drew me to this , but that is where the comparisons end . This is a brainless and dumb film , shockingly scripted and horribly acted by all involved , the doe eyed Disney - esquire twin kids are horrible to watch , but its Lukas Haas as Chuckie , that must take the plaudits in the bad acting department , although he is given a run for his money by the equally awful husband . As a film its plot line is completely telegraphed all the way through , even in the set up early on Della 's cell phone goes dead and then in the shops her credit card has been cancelled by her hubby and she has no cash and its Christmas Eve , now where could they be going with this I wonder ? ? ? The only surprising part of this $ hit is when after killing all the clichéd bad guys with the contents of her magic toolbox , she demands Chuckie to f@ck her , if my jaw had not already been on the floor at this films awfulness , it would surely have dropped and smashed on the floor . even the ending is messed up , all the feminist grannies wanting their pound of flesh are left utterly disappointed .. I did n't think I could be further disappointed , but then I saw that Guillermo del Toro produced this dreck
0 The genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one . The big problem is IMPLAUSABILITY . I realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of what s going to happen next , but this movie was so predictable , and is just not believable . I find that the more I watch this kind of movie , the more I am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger . Continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid . If they took the time to make it more realistic , I might have enjoyed it a little . Having said that , you might be better off staying away from this one .
0 I do n't often give one star reviews , but the computer wo n't let me do negative numbers.<br /><br />The opening titles tell us we 're in deep water already . Although this is a low budget exploitation film , there are 17 producers credited . No . No.<br /><br />At the beginning of the story abusive husband Kenneth comes home to his family in an upscale gated community . The house is a pigsty . His wife , Della ( Kim Basinger ) has let the children run amok all day.<br /><br />OK . We 're already in deep water . Ms. Basinger was 55 years old when the film came out . Uh , are these her children or grandchildren ? It 's Christmas Eve . Della drives to the mall , a lengthy scene that could have been cut . To bludgeon home the idea of eeeeeeevil male aggression rampant in the universe she drives past football players in full uniform playing in pouring rain on Christmas Eve . Sure . For a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it.<br /><br />We get some actual suspense in the driving scenes , though . It 's raining and traffic is bad . First we see Della try to drive and smoke at the same time . Then later Della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time , at one point turning completely around to check the cluttered back seat for the charger for the phone.<br /><br />She wanders the mall , sees an old friend from college , tries to buy stuff but her credit card is declined- gosh , maybe her husband is grumpy because he 's going broke , but that 's too complicated for the script to follow.<br /><br />In the parking lot she runs afoul of the most ludicrous gang in the history of films . One White boy ( Lukas Hass watching his career go down the toilet ) , one Black , one Asian , and one Hispanic . Imagine a company of Up with People gone to the bad and you 'll have the idea.<br /><br />Although they have a gun she gives them attitude . A mall cop comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head , firing more than once . The parking lot is crowded as can be , people everywhere , and nobody notices.<br /><br />Della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well lighted safe area , she drives to a construction site , where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools ( literally ) at hand.<br /><br />MAJOR spoiler ahead.<br /><br />She drives back home . The car poops out so she walks through the pouring rain . Checks on the children , goes downstairs , and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank range.<br /><br />The experience with the four punks was supposed to result in personal empowerment for Della . Instead we know that her children will probably spend Christmas in foster care or a group home , because the State will collect them while she answers to murder one charges . The four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self defense . The husband , different story.<br /><br />I'm so glad I saw this on cable . If I 'd seen it in a theater ( did it get any release ? ) I 'd have been furious . As is , I 'm just sad seeing talents like Ms. Basinger and Mr. Haas waste themselves on garbage like this.<br /><br />One very good thing , though . This was written and directed by Susan Montford . Ms. Montford has not gotten another writing or directing credit since passing this turd . There is justice in the world .
0 A friend once asked me to read a screenplay of his that had been optioned by a movie studio . To say it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts I 'd ever read would be a bold understatement . Yet I never told him this . Why ? Because in a world where films like " While She Was Out " can be green - lighted and attract an Oscar- winning star like Kim Basinger , a screenplay lacking in character , content and common sense is no guarantee that it wo n't sell.<br /><br />As so many other reviewers have pointed out , " While She Was Out " is a dreadfully under - written Woman - in - Peril film that has abused housewife Basinger hunted by four unlikely hoods on Christmas Eve . Every gripe is legitimate , from the weak dialog and bad acting to the jaw - dropping lapses of logic , but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promise . Here are a couple of things that struck me:<br /><br />1 ) I do n't care how much we are supposed to think her husband is a jerk , the house IS a mess with toys . Since when did it become child abuse to make kids pick up after themselves?<br /><br />2 ) Racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except Hollywood , where they are usually the only racially balanced groups on screen.<br /><br />3 ) Sure the film is stupid . But so are the countless " thrillers " I 've sat through where the women are portrayed as wailing , helpless victims of male sadism . Stupid or not , I found it refreshing to see a woman getting the best of her tormentors.<br /><br />4 ) I LOVED the ending ! < br /><br />5 ) Though an earlier reviewer coined this phrase , I really DO think this film should be retitled " The Red Toolbox of Doom . "
0 I ca n't believe the likes of Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger got involved ins this piece of garbage ! The script is so poorly written and the directing so weak ( both by the same person ) that its hard to find more one - dimension characters in a film . The dialogs are so lame that this so called thriller got laughs out of the few fools that got into the theatre . The setup it 's tricky , inviting you to believe you are going to watch a chilling thriller and suddenly it turns out into the most stupid persecution film . Bassinger 's character is so dumb , that she actually stops to scream to God " Where are you ! " so the people after her can follow , and then takes a leak ! ! ! ! And then she apparently got into the smallest wood in the world , I mean , she runs all over the place and the killers never loose track of her , and this happens in the middle of the night . It really makes me wonder , is that really the best writing people in Hollywood can find that they spend millions producing it .
0 Overall this movie is dreadful , and should have never been made . One of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters , for example , if she is about to be attacked , you want to feel , " Oh My God , No ! " , but you do n't in this case , you do n't care because there is no link that has been made to know the character . In the trailer , it seemed as though the movie would be great , yet there is no suspense what so ever really . There could have been maybe some mystery but there is not . " All she has is a toolbox . " was said on the DVD 's back , you would think that it was carefully planned this movie , and cleverly made , but it is not , The ending , was just awful , very straight forward , and pointless too . The acting is either average or below average , maybe even lower . In my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life . The " Special Effects " and sets were average too , nothing special what so ever . There is not much gore , or bloody violence , not much blood is shown . This movie was advertised to make it sound quite amazing , yet really , its not even worth looking for , I do not recommend this to anyone , unless they are easily satisfied , by a few fights and a boring story .
0 The only redeeming qualities this movie has are the fairly original death scenes . Other than that this movie is a big DUD . We have Kim Basinger , the beleaguered housewife slowly meandering thru the local mall for the first 30 min . of the movie , which added nothing . Then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with 4 punks who took up 2 parking spaces on this busy xmas eve . They begin to chase her after offing the local security guard who tried to help her . From there this movie gets worse , way worse . I know its only a movie and you 've got ta go with the flow but she 's got about a 5 min . headstart and she ca n't hide or find someone to help her . Instead she drives to a half built subdivision beside a forest . In typical fashion she does everything she can to allow her followers to easily track her . But now she turns into one tough mofu . You get the point . Do not under any circumstances buy or rent this movie no matter how much you like this type . It 's so illogical you 'll be questioning every scene . It is embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the cast , as well as the consumers .
0 Where to start ... Oh yea , Message to the bad guys : When you first find the person you have been tracking ( in order to kill ) that witnessed a crime you committed , do n't spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away . Message to the victim : When the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing , take that opportunity to " RUN AWAY " , do n't sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear . Message to the Director : if someone has a 5 or 10 minute head start in a vehicle or on foot , you ca n't have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away ! time and motion does n't work that way . It would also be nice to think that a woman does n't have to brutally kill ( 4 ) men in order to empower herself to leave an abusive relationship at home .

0 Kim Basinger stars as Della , a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband , who gets into trouble while she 's out at the local mall doing some last minute Christmas shopping . After placing a hastily scrawled hateful note on a piece of paper and sticking said paper in the windshield of a car that took up two parking spaces , she finds out the owners of the car are the Rainbow Coilition of villains comprising of a white guy , a Mexican , a Chinese guy & a black . They confront her about the note , cap a helpless security guard , and the chase is on . During the course of the film Della will go for hunted to hunter as she unleashes her inner Bronson.<br /><br />I found this to be a somewhat tense little thriller . The acting was good enough ( except for a few scenes , the " Why God why " bit was cringe worthy in it 's badness though ) It comes undone a bit due to the sheer fact that the villains Della chases from / after are mind - numbingly stupid . If they had n't had the intellect of any given " Home Alone " baddie , perhaps their eventual defeat would be something to savor instead of the meh reaction it evokes . The unbelievability factor I 'm willing to overlook as both the director & one of the producers had part in bringing " Shoot em up " to the screen ( a film which while throwing credibility out the window was immensely fun ) . This film while never attaining the heights of that film , was good in it 's own rights.<br /><br />My Grade : C- < br /><br />Anchor Bay DVD Extras : Commentary with Writer / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy ; a 25 and a half minute ' Making - of ' ; a trailer & two TV spots for this film ; and trailer for Lower Learning
0 This thought long lost flick sometimes comes available on the web . So I bought me a copy . Well , of course the acting is terrible and the story line is childish but it does have his moments . I think people who searched this one also knows the backstory of it . It was made by a grindhouse cinema owner for an extreme low budget . But for me he surely did n't spoiled the money on props but on the make up . The make up is for that kind of flick well done . The zombies are watchable and the gore is intact . The only problem with that kind of movies is the quality of the pelicule . It 's terrible , luckely no hiss on the sound but sometimes it 's way too dark . So you have to watch clearly to see the gore . In a funny way they tried to sell this one as really not for the squeamish . A voice - over tells in the beginning of the movie to watch out for a sign and a man appearing with green flashes , that tells you there is gore on the way . Of course that does n't work , made me think of Cannibal Girls , had that annoying bell when the red stuff started to flow . They had the original idea , Cannibal Girls was made a year earlier . Do n't go for the storyline , go for the zombies and notice a continuity mistake . When the girl and guy are making love first she takes of her bra , then they make love and suddenly her underwear is back on ... try to do that , or am I getting a bit offline, ... eat it you ugly corpses
0 What 's this ? A Canadian produced zombie flick that I have never heard of before . A mortician works on the body of a recently deceased young man . This allows for an extended flashback that show how the guy got there . Basically , he and friends went to a cemetery on Friday the 13th and raised the dead thanks to his silly chanting . Cut back to the morgue where our dead body comes back to life and kills the mortician and owner ( who gets his eyes popped out ) . The final WTF ? shot has the funeral home owner in a straight jacket and screaming , " I 'm not crazy ! " Amazingly , he has his eyeballs back.<br /><br />Running a scant 58 minutes , this is certainly one oddity in zombie cinema . It feels a lot longer , but put me in some kind of trance where I could n't stop watching . The film also has one of those " if you see this image , turn away from the screen " gags . It is the image of an old man getting sick in a theater ( prophetic ? ) and when he pops up ( only twice ) the blood begins to flow . The scenes are pretty damn gory for the time period . There is a great gaffe where a zombie chops off a girl 's right hand with a shovel , but - when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to chomp on - it is a left hand .
0 I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago , and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day . It 's not that bad for a made - for - TV horror movie , but it is derivative ( mostly of The Exorcist ) and businesslike , for lack of a better word . It wo n't blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting , but it 's not a waste of time , either . It 's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you are n't in the mood to think too hard.<br /><br />However , if you go into the movie looking for some laughs , you wo n't be disappointed . The early scenes , with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are hilariously non - threatening , and the climactic blue - screen effects of a giant black dog ( with horns ! ) are pretty side - splitting . And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning.<br /><br />Not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination , but I wish they still made stuff like this for TV .
0 The concept of this made - for - TV horror movie is ludicrous beyond words , but hey , it was the late 1970 's and literally all stupid horror formats were pretty damn profitable , so why not exploit the idea of a satanically possessed dog ? The plot of " Devil Dog " is easy to describe to fans of the horror genre : simply think of " The Omen " and replace the newborn baby boy with a nest of German Shepard pups ! Seriously , I 'm not kidding , that 's what the movie is about ! During the opening sequence , members of some kind of satanic cult buy a female dog in heat only to have it impregnated by Satan himself . You 'd think that the Lord of Darkness has other things on His mind than to fornicate with a German Shepard and take over the world one evil puppy at the time , but apparently not . Exactly like little Damien in " The Omen " , one of the puppies is taken in by model family and grows up to become a beautiful and charismatic animal . But Lucky  that 's the dog 's name  is pure evil and liquidates annoying neighbors and nosy school teachers in derivative and tamely executed ways . He also inflicts his malignant character on the family wife and children , but he can not force the father ( Richard Crenna ) to stick his arm into a lawnmower because he 's a " chosen one " . The whole thing becomes too moronic for words when Crenna eventually travels to Ecuador to search for an ancient wall painting and gets advice from an old witchdoctor who speaks perfect English . I guess he learned that living in isolation atop of a mountain his entire life . Director Curtis Harrington ( " What 's the matter with Helen " , " Ruby " ) and lead actor Richard Crenna ( " Wait until Dark " , " The Evil " ) desperately try to create a suspenseful and mysterious atmosphere , but all is in vain . Scenes like cute puppy eyes spontaneously setting fire to a Spanish maid or a dog dodging bullets without even moving evoke chuckles instead of frights , and not even spooky musical tunes can chance that . The " special " effects are pathetic , especially near the end when the Satan - dog mutates into an utterly cheesy shadow on the wall . " Devil Dog " is a truly dumb movie , but it 's definitely hilarious to watch late at night with some friends and loads of liquor . There are entertaining brief cameos of Martine Beswick ( " Dr . Jekyll and Sister Hyde " ) as the terrifying cult queen and R.G. Armstrong ( " The Car " , " The Pack " ) as the evil fruit , vegetable and puppy salesman . And , yes , that annoying daughter is the same kid who gets blown away complaining about her ice - cream in Carpenter 's " Assault on Precinct 13 " .
0 A dog found in a local kennel is mated with Satan and has a litter of puppies , one of which is given to a family who has just lost their previous dog to a hit & run . The puppy wants no time in making like Donald Trump and firing the Mexican housekeeper , how festive . Only the father suspects that this canine is more then he appears , the rest of the family loves the demonic pooch . So it 's up to dad to say the day.<br /><br />This late 70 's made for TV horror flick has little going for it except a misplaced feeling of nostalgia . When I saw this as a kid I found it to be a tense nail - biter , but revisiting it as an adult I now realize that it 's merely lame , boring , and not really well - acted in the least bit.<br /><br />My Grade : D
0 Devil Dog sets your heart racing . It 's brilliantly paced , the ending comes like a bolt out of the blue and plunges itself into the very centre of your being . You 'll never look at your dog the same way again . In fact you 'll start thinking of having it put down - BY A PRIEST ! FANTASTIC !
0 VERY dull , obvious , tedious Exorcist rip - off featuring a Doberman with red eyes - that 's the extent of the special effects in this made - for - tv cheapie . Richard Crenna is about as animate as a chew toy . Very 70 's dress & music only add to the torture . Should put you to sleep almost as fast as " The Corpse Vanishes " , or " The Blue Hand " . Practically worthless . MooCow says eaghhh what a stinky dog ! : = 8P
0 This horror movie is really weak ... that is if this is the correct movie I am commenting on . Nothing really terrible goes on as a family adopts a cute little German Shepard pup . I had a German Shepard and it is a really good dog . I did not get the idea to get one from this movie though , but rather from the comedy " K-9 " . That is another story all together though . This movie really does n't have much horror at all as the most horrific scene is at the end and it looks really cheesy . Also , we see a guy almost put his hand into a lawn mower . That is about it . The father suspects something though , as his family seems to be getting rather strange , somewhere he finds out if you hold a mirror to them while they are sleeping you can see if they are possessed . All in all a really weak horror movie even by television standards ... television movies that do work are out there as " This House Possessed " is pretty good and there is another haunted house movie about a woman and these strange creatures that is also rather good . This one is really rather dull .
0 Amy Poehler and Rachel Dratch are among the funnier women to have been on " Saturday Night Live " . It 's unfortunate that they , along with Tina Fey and Maya Rudolph , were on SNL during the longest stretch of unfunny writing and sketch - making ( circa 2002 - 2006 ) the show has ever had . Still , these two women most especially know what 's funny , and they know how to write a funny movie.<br /><br />You'll notice in the credits of this movie that Dratch and director Ryan Shiraki wrote the story for " Spring Breakdown " , but who wrote the actual screenplay , consisting of dialogue and all the important fill - in - the - blank material that makes a story into a multidimensional movie ? Yep , just Shiraki . Just one guy wrote the dialogue for this movie , and no women apparently wrote the script with him . The result is a pretty cliché spring break movie that does n't so much spoof the faux holiday as much as exploit it equally as much as MTV does every year.<br /><br />If Dratch , Poehler , and even co - star Parker Posey could have contributed their handwriting to the screenplay , it would have been far less cliché . The premise is original , being about three thirty - something women who were unpopular in high school ( and apparently college , too ) who never had the fun spring break trip they allegedly dreamed about . I say " allegedly " because you never quite know what fun is to these characters . They entered talent shows in the past where they sing stale pro - woman anthems like " True Colors " , and spend their nights together holding make - your - own - pizza parties . Even though none of them are especially unattractive , the outside world appears to treat them like they are . There 's a scene where a blind student of Poehler 's ( played by Poehler 's real life husband Will Arnett ) asks her out on a date , only to touch her face and immediately change his mind . If Poehler 's character is supposed to be unattractive , they obviously hired the wrong actress.<br /><br />The movie continues to show promise , even though we have our doubts about the main characters , when Posey 's boss , Texas Senator ' Kay Bee ' Hartmann ( Jane Lynch , funny as always ) hires Posey to watch over her unpopular college - age daughter ( Amber Tamblyn , playing yet another woman who 's attractive in real life , but not in the eyes of any characters in this movie ) while she goes to a Laguna Beach - like vacation spot for Spring Break . Poehler and Dratch come along , they reluctantly get boozed up , party like they apparently should have when they were in college , and then comes the ultimate showdown with the sorority bitches lead by Sophie Monk.<br /><br />Sophie Monk is an incredibly attractive woman who has a body both women and men would kill to have for different reasons . Unfortunately , her movie career is off to a rough start with the abominably unfunny " Date Movie " ( 2006 ) and the disappointing " Click " ( 2006 ) . Here , she plays a Southern belle , although her voice sounds like she stole Delta Burke 's voice box . She hams it up a little too much , trying too hard to play a conniving bitch that she comes off as much like a caricature of spoiled college kids as the rest of the extras.<br /><br />"Spring Breakdown " was released straight to DVD despite the star power of Amy Poehler , but rightly so because the story is way too cliché . It may as well have been called " National Lampoon 's Spring Breakdown " , and the magazine probably would n't have sued for trademark infringement because of the free publicity . If director Shiraki had given at least one woman the creative input , especially Rachel Dratch , this movie would have been great and not nearly as run - of - the - mill as frat - house comedies we 've seen before . I know Dratch will come up with another funny concept , and hopefully be allowed to fill in the rest of the screenplay herself . She 's funny enough , and she deserves better than this half - baked comedy that would accept Stiffler 's brother with open arms .
0 They really ca n't get stupider than this film dealing with 3 losers who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning . The problem is that these losers try to do this 15 years after their college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice president.<br /><br />Trouble is that her daughter is anything but popular , but of course she comes out of all that . The girls go through drunken rages , exotic dancing and other absolute nonsense.<br /><br />It really ca n't get much worse than this awful film .
0 How can a movie with Amy , Posey and Raechel have NOTHING funny in it ? Believe it or not ' House Bunny ' did this better and funnier . Hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money - this movie is an embarrassment to all of them . It is a cliché from beginning to end . Clichés can work well with a script , or at least an idea . This movie does nothing but use cliché after cliché rather than ideas or script . It uses the preexisting persona 's of the actresses rather than develop characters . Bad , sad , and rubbish . Now I apparently have to have ten lines of text for a comment . Really ? Why ? As an IT ops manager this is another example of sloppy coding .
0 This is the single worst movie I have ever seen . I can not express how bad it is . I honestly wanted to kill myself several times through this atrocious experience just to have the pain end . I recommend instead of seeing this movie , you bathe in acid then you will at least know a fraction of the pain without all of the scars.<br /><br />I had such high expectations when I read the back of the DVD case , and when in the beginning it added that Jesus was following them I was so excited ... then by the end I wanted to kill myself . I mean a twenty - three minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema ... JUST PAIN ! Monkeys could have done a better job editing this trash . At least they would have thrown feces and blurred some of the garbage . It would have made it better to have not seen any of the horror.<br /><br />It was n't that I did n't get the jokes , it 's that they were not only not funny , they repeated themselves like twenty times . Apparently , something is n't funny unless you see it like a million times.<br /><br />Do not under any circumstances see this . People have rated ' Manos the Hands of Fate ' as the worlds worst movie . I have seen that too and agree that it is bad ... but ALAS it is only the second worst . ' Fatty Drives the Bus ' is by far worse.<br /><br />This deserves all kind of harsh language , but I ca n't write that here so just imagine I swore a whole bunch .
0 I have seen a lot of movies in my life , but not many as bad as this . It is a movie that makes fun of fat people , has no real story , has bad actors , is not funny and much more . Is this a movie that you would like to see ? I guess not!<br /><br />I guess that the makers of the movie was trying to be original and creative , but it looks like it was made by a 12 year old child with absolutely no cinematic skills at all . The so called funny parts is as funny as throughing pies in the faces of people , or breaking wind . Of cource if this is the kind of humour that you like , then this is the movie for you!!<br /><br />Dont waste your money on this movie !
0 You know how sometimes you can watch a crappy movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie ? Well this was beyond that . I bought the DVD at Tower Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I 'd heard this was a movie you could laugh at . It is really nothing short of pathetic . About 30 minutes into the movie , my friends started asking me to turn it off . Around 45 minutes they begged me . After an hour , we compromised to fast forward to the end , so we could see how the conflict was resolved ( and because we had been watching the whole time for Matt Walsh ) . Seriously , do n't watch this movie . It is beyond painful .
0 i completely agree with jamrom4 .. this was the single most horrible movie i have ever seen .. holy crap it was terrible .. i was warned not to see it .. and foolishly i watched it anyway .. about 10 minutes into the painful experience i completely gave up on watching the atrocity .. but sat through until the end .. just to see if i could .. well i did and now i wish i had not .. it was disgusting .. nothing happened and the ending was all preachy .. no movie that bad has the right to survive .. i implore all of you to spare yourself the terror of fatty drives the bus .. if only i had heeded the same warning .. please save yourself from this movie .. i have a feeling those who rated it highly were involved in the making of the movie .. and should all be wiped off the face of the planet ..
0 I 'm a big fan of Troma but I ca n't figure out why they bought the rights to this movie , It 's so boring I felt like I was watching for 3 hours . Some where on the plot summary it says " but what Satan does n't know he 's stuck with annoying tourists " Well they did n't seem to bother him in the movie , just me.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays Satan , I like bad movie 's but it was just boring .
0 Weak Bobby " Pineapple Salsa " Flay and Mario Batali bring this down.<br /><br />Flay being the worst . Definitely a one trick pony , I think they could have gotten other American chefs to come to the table on this one as the Iron Chefs . The kind of dishes this duo come up with really ... don't reflect on the creativity of the original Iron Chef Series . I do n't think Batali even went to chef school , actually . There are a lot of great chefs in America , I just wonder why they do n't appear on the Food Network.<br /><br />It would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhaps co - hosts who can handle the pressure . I like Alton Brown , but he is a bit too flippant / funny for this role .
0 The show 's echoed ' bubbling ' sound effect used to put me to sleep . A very soothing show . I think I might have slept through the parts where there was danger or peril . I had also heard that some set up shots for a show on sponge divers was shot in Tarpon Springs , Florida . I would assume Lloyd Bridges never dove there . I only remember the show in reruns and although it was never edge - of - the - seat exciting we would make up our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother 's house ... imagining the echoed bubbling sounds and narrating our adventures in our heads . I thought ' Flipper ' had better undersea action . Of course , he had the advantage of being in his natural environment .
0 Kurosawa really blew it on this one . Every genius is allowed a failure . The concept is fine but the execution is badly blurred.<br /><br />There is an air of fantasy about this film making it something of an art film . The poverty stricken of Tokyo deserve a fairer and more realistic portrayal . Many of them have interesting stories to tell . A very disappointing film .
0 Nope , I am just not going to get with it here . I refuse to go along with the program . Do n't you supposed that perhaps this movie is just a tad over - rated ? Look at the reader comments and their star ratings : Most are 6/10 , 7/10 or better . I think this is an instance when the ratings may say more about the people rendering them than the movie itself , which is unique . How many other sex fantasies about simulated bestiality complete with horse couplings have become mainstream hits as catalog DVD titles ? I watched this movie with a pervading sense of anticipation , expecting fireworks , and instead got someone popping a Gucci shopping bag . It looked great , but once the thrill had been spent even the twist ending did n't do much to save it.<br /><br />The film 's background story says it all : Director films about 25 minutes of borderline hardcore fake bestial sex for another movie , is informed the footage will not be appropriate , sets it aside , waits two or three years for a smattering of critical acclaim to build up , then constructs an entire feature around that 25 minutes , filming roughly 70 minutes of otherwise unrelated , excruciatingly boring footage and inserting the 25 minute chunk in as a dream sequence . That the 25 minutes of film in question is strikingly odd , original and shocking in a deliberate , calculated manner goes without saying . But we are n't here to evaluate that 25 minutes alone , we must consider the entire film , and ask ourselves why people are so enthusiastic about the movie ? Or are they just enamored by it 's background story and history of having been banned by people who were stupid enough to be offended by it?<br /><br />Perhaps it is an anti - clerical agenda that appeals to them . Hating the western religions of catholicism and Christianity is one of the few remaining socially acceptable bastions of intolerance -- Just today it was revealed that the BBC routinely skews their broadcasts with anti Christian & anti Western sentiment in the furtherance of political correctness . You can say anything you want about the Bible , pedopheliac priests , the institutionalized cruelty of the church , and how much white men and their inhuman religions suck the dimpled skin off a golf ball ... But say one negative thing about non - westernized religions , and you are toast . This movie was tailor made for such a sentiment , with a wrinkly old dried up priest who has an entirely unwholesome on screen relationship with two pretty 14 year old French boys complete with inappropriate touching , fawning , fondling , fumbling , groping , and patting of the backsides . Ewww.<br /><br />And then there is the horse couplings , photographed in such fetishistic closeup detail that portions of the film could be used as visual aids for a biology class on animal husbandry . Yes I understand the thematic relevance of the imagery -- large animal phallus 's with a wealth of reproductive fluids just waiting to be unleashed like fire extinguishers -- but if I wanted to watch horses , you know , do it , I would like go live on a farm . Having their genitals in my face is about as entertaining as watching someone use a bathroom.<br /><br />Is this movie just a sort of artsy diversion for social deviants ? Probably , though I will grant the artistic execution of most of it , filmed in a kind of arty Euro detail that even has a dappled forest pond right out of a Monet painting , complete with a spanning arched bridge . And the ending ( which even I managed to be surprised by ) does sort of wrap it all up into a neat if distasteful package . But you have to remember that there are certain things that can not be deconstructed for their design elements and many artists are guilty for exploiting them in their work to lend a sort of gravitas that would not have been achieved without it . That is n't fair , and even Clint Eastwood has fallen prey to the urge with his new movie about Iwo Jima . Whether or not his film is any good stands as a separate consideration from whether or not that battle was a noble cause fought by men who were heroes . The problem is that most people will not be able to separate out the two aspects of the movie and will be lining up to give it Oscars because of it 's noble message -- not because it is a particularly good or original movie.<br /><br />While it may seem like an odd parallel , I see one with THE BEAST : How can anyone not see the basic beauty of nature in the sight of two horses mating ? And who can not see the logical culmination of the repressed sexuality from fairy tales in the film 's explosive set - piece where Beauty and the Beast finally do the nasty ? Somehow I managed to miss both points , and am delighted that I have seen this film so that I can trash it as being what it really is : 25 minutes or so of eye opening over the top adult fairy tale imagery surrounded by 70 minutes of skull drainingly boring artsy - fartsy Euro Trash dreck about some guy getting a haircut , and a great ending . It 's art for sure , but it sucks hard.<br /><br />3/10
0 Walerian Borowczyks La Bete ( 1975 ) was obviously received in different ways : Some were appalled , some were shocked others applauded the courage . I however am completely untouched , bored and can not stop asking myself why the display of incoherent , inconsistent images which vaguely orbit around a central theme are considered an intellectual journey.<br /><br />What was this movie actually about ? Growing sexuality in a woman ? I 've seen great films on this subject , but this is not one of them . How can one attempt to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person not only as a narrative device to dream ( in the nude ) of beasts . Where there are no characters , there is no character study . The woman persecuted by the beast was not adolescent , the girl having sex with the black butler ( is he also characterized as a beast ? ) has a very grown up attitude to sexuality , so where is the consistency ? Is it a movie about religion ? If yes we would need a bit more thematic material than a priest without function , character and charisma , but with a strong desire towards two young boys.<br /><br />Is it about bestiality ? The metaphoric feel of the movie forbids any realistic examination of bestiality , especially as realistic examination requires realistic characters . So no real bestiality here . Some mythic beast and two priests talking to each other about the sin of bestiality . Enough for a college essay on the topic ? I do n't think so.<br /><br />Is it about sex ? Is it about anything ? I do n't know . I only know that showing a fired gun does n't make a film a war movie . Dealing with a topic must mean more than displaying its own associations with the theme.<br /><br />So look across the controversy . Do n't be scared by the bestiality , nudity , ejaculations , masturbation and stuff . I am not . Look at it as you look at any other story and you might discover that this is a poorly made , poorly edited , poorly acted , really poorly written ( okay , some pictures are quite nice , and the main character is a really good looking girl ) cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks beating around the bush in a hypnotic slow manner will make a story intelligent . It does n't . It makes it boring .
0 Another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved children tale , La Bete ( 1975 ) aka The Beast tries to imagine ( in very graphic and what may seem offensive and disturbing but in reality rather silly and comical way ) , what actually happened between Beauty and the Beast ? I am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this movie . I would not go so far as saying that it is a serious and dark exploration of such subjects as sexual frustration , longing , fulfillment , or satirical criticizing of the catholic Religion . I would not even call it a horror - erotic movie . It 's more of the parody on all genres it touches or mentions even though it 's got some shocking moments in all departments that sure will stay in your memory.<br /><br />The long ( way too long ) scene between an Aristocratic young woman and the supposedly horrifying but the most laughable I 've ever seen in the movies creature with truly impressive ... well anatomy , is set to the clavichord music of Scarlatti and is hysterical . My husband and I both laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the encounter . The moral of the scene is - beauty can and will defeat the monster . The question is - who is the target audience for the film ? For an erotic picture , it is too verbose ; for an art movie - it 's got too many jaw - dropping scenes of sheer madness and I 'd say an abrupt ending . IMO , the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama . As a parody of art house / horror / erotica , it is funny and certainly original . Have a good laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning . This story of the curious Beauties and the lustful Beasts certainly is not recommended for co - viewing with the children . The opening scene that may shock an unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of bestiality can be successfully used On Discovery channel for the program like " In the world of animals - mating habits and rituals of horses " .
0 this movie had a fairly good sounding plot , but the paste was very slow ... very slow indeed . even if someone thinks this is a cult classic , i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched.<br /><br />the cinematography is not excellent , but not the worst either . the sounds are OK . lighting OK.<br /><br />i still would n't recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film - student.<br /><br />the movie does not contain music , and the horses having sex do n't make it a good one either . and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain stupid.<br /><br />no winnings here , skip this utter boredom . i 've seen worse believe me , but this is just waste of time , and i do n't get the good reviews here . especially the high ratings ...
0 This , and Immoral Tales , both left a bad taste in my mouth . It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted by sex , and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex . As a film , it 's not very well done -- some of the acting is truly epically bad ( such as the " American " woman with the French accent ) . The young woman 's sudden flip - flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested ( when it seems like it should have been the other way around ) , and the aunt 's sudden realization of the young man 's secret do n't make sense -- they 're not explained at all . I also did n't like how the daughter 's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family 's perversion or predilection for bestiality . The central idea , the idea that there 's this " sexy beast , " if you will , that lives in the woods , could have been a foundation for a perverse but fun story , but instead is just used as a basis for a nasty , sex - negative , morality play .
0 This movie is little more than poorly - made , fetish porn , and this is saying a lot considering the similar crap that was made in that era . This was recommended to me by friend as a " unique film experience . " He was right . I suppose he meant that as a joke . Not disgusting , not even that shocking . Just mediocre acting and poor attempts at shock art . A little bit of camp value , though I do n't believe the makers of this film intended this . And yes , as a previous reviewer mentioned , it 's sex with a guy in a bear suit . Do n't spend a lot of money on this . Try to borrow it , if you must see it . Or contact me , I 'd be happy to sell you my copy for half price.<br /><br />I may have to see another of this particular director 's films , as he seems to have a certain following . But if it 's anything like this , I will again regret another 2 hours of my life gone forever .
0 this film was shrouded in scandal for so long that it became a very sought after item ... the outrage , the mystery , etc . it had everything to be a great piece of film - making , but ultimately fails in every extent . it 's a terribly bad comedy , a pathetic horror movie , a lame erotic film.<br /><br />the 2 disc DVD includes a gorgeous booklet with stills , interviews , essays on bestiality , etc . as well as an extensive interview with the more - than - pretentious director . for those who have heard about it but never seen it , the package will seem fantastic until one actually sees the film . disc 1 contains the edited film , badly translated to English but with good visual quality . disc 2 contains the director 's cut , in an awful transfer , in french.<br /><br />what can I say about the actual beast ? a hand puppet of Kermit the frog would have been more effective and shocking .
0 Notorious for more than a quarter century ( and often banned ) , it 's obscurity was its greatest asset it seems . Hey , it 's often better to be talked about , rather than actually seen when you ca n't back the " legend " up with substance.<br /><br />The film has played in Los Angeles a couple of times recently , and is available on home video , so that veil is slowly being lifted . While there is still plenty to offend the masses , it is more likely to bore them , than arouse much real passion . Except for a gratuitous and protracted XXX sex scene between a pair of horses ( " Nature Documentary " anyone ? ) , there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama . < br /><br />Once the sex and nudity begins , it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation , a looooooooong flashback to an alleged ' beauty and the beast ' encounter , and a naked woman running around the mansion ( nobody , even her supposedly protective Aunt , seems to even think of putting some clothes on her ! ) . On video , I guess you can fast - forward thru the banality , but it 's not really worth the effort . The nudity does n't go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as Bertolucci 's THE DREAMERS.<br /><br />Try as one might to find some ' moral ' or ' symbolism ' in the carnality , I doubt it 's worthy of anyone 's effort . Unfortunately , for LA BETE , now that you can more easily see the film , the notoriety of something once ' forbidden ' has been lifted . And this beast has been tamed .
0 Unreal " movie " , what were these people on ? ? A mix of French Upstairs Downstairs , mating horses , porn ( not suggested , its pretty full on for a film ) & bestiality with a bit of Benny Hill music & chase scenes thrown in , its sounds crazy & its even more so to watch . * * spoiler * * It plods along in a tedious fashion for quite a while , .... then a Lamb does a runner , prompting woman in period dress to run off after it , she goes into the woods where she is set upon by an erect " penis " attached to a man in a bear / rat manky suit , I put it like that as its obvious the " penis " is in charge & gets way too much screen time , ejaculating for the most of it , anyway , in a nutshell , it turns out she liked a bit of bear / rat tadger & that s about it , the rest is just padding . * * end spoiler * * A film made to shock & offend , thus getting talked about , any publicity is good publicity I suppose , a waste of time really , but the " main event " has to be seen to be believed , its hard to imagine that anyone thought it was a good idea as they filmed it .
0 Completely ridiculous " period " film is only a thin excuse for its extensive , graphic depiction of the heroine 's affair with " the beast " , a monster who supposedly appears every century to rape some women . That 's pretty much what he does , and the film 's depiction of the beast is really really awful ; it 's basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC tube for a hard - on that squirts copious amounts of white liquid . For fans of fake animal porn , I guess maybe this is a real turn - on . I was amused , however , by the opening shots of horses having sex in a public square .
0 This Movie is complete crap ! Avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs , it is rambling and incoherent . I pride myself on plumbing the depths of 70 's sleaze cinema from everything from Salo to Salon Kitty . I like being shocked , but I need a coherent story . However if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you . The saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang . I mean its just plain hard to sit through , not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly . Please , I know the cover is interesting ( what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a woman 's bare ass)but do n't waste your time or money as you wo n't get either back .
0 Revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since , in fact , most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events . Unfortunately , what this film lacks in drama is compensated for by an overabundance of boredom . One cares not who wins , loses , dies or lives -- just end it as soon as possible . This is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology . Scenes of Paris and the French countryside have a cardboard quality about them . They might better be done on a bare stage and left that way . One can not expect the amazing effects of " The House of the Flying Daggers " or " The Golden Compass , " but , after all , this is a 2002 digitally mastered production . Characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene , so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms . In my view , this film turns the French Revolution of the 1790s into the " papier - mache " revolution of a " papier colle " world .
0 Much has been made of Rohmer 's use of digital technology to ' fill in ' the background . At times it works well , the scene where Grace and her maid witness from afar the King 's execution is particularly striking . At other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look , resembling a home video . However , the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer . We know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters ? To be frank , I did not care at all what happened to the Lady or the Duke.<br /><br />The other major failing , I regret to say , is the performance of Lucy Russell in the leading role . She is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance . OK she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion . Her emoting in the scene where she recounts to her friend Mme de Meyler ( an excellent performance by the debutante Helena Dubiel ) seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience . Also , watch her hands when she is expressing emotion!<br /><br />All in all a very disappointing film , particularly given the positive reviews on this site .
0 Eric Rohmer 's ' The Lady and the Duke ' is based on the journals of an English aristocrat who lived through the French revolution . But it 's a stilted affair , with its strange , painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone . Most notably , this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action ; one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie , and little of the chaos , poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted , but spoilt , aristocratic classes . The result is frequently dull , and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction ; it 's a disappointing film from an acclaimed director .
0 If I only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor , enough film for only one take of each shot , and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes , and was forced to make an over-2-hour movie about the French Revolution , and also did n't have any sets and had to have my 4-year - old autistic son paint the backgrounds , and also the only actors I could find were the people who did n't make the auditions of that year 's soap opera , and I was also forced to not use any music in the entire film , and also the zoom function on the camera did n't work except for one time when it accidentally started zooming in and could n't stop , oh and if I hated my audience , then I might make something kind of like this awful , yet mistakenly hilarious , Hell - worthy waste of time . The almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of George Lucas ' latest creations , which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie , there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a lightsaber duel / space laser battle . I do n't mean to spoil the movie for those who have n't seen it , but that 's not how it ends . The only thing I can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review . Peace .
0 Every so often a movie comes along that knocks me down a notch and reminds me that my taste in films I seek out to watch is n't always impeccable . I normally would stay away from stuff like this , but I was duped by some glowing reviews and the Rohmer pedigree.<br /><br />There 's an initial and intriguing novelty to the production where Rohmer essentially superimposes the actors onto painted ( digital ) back - drops of revolution era France . This quickly wanes and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint by numbers scene . What we 're left with is a boring and stuffy film about aristocrats in 18th century France . None of the characters are appealing or sympathetic . The pace is so languid , the dialogue so arduous , and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to Rohmer , that I ended up not caring whose head rolled , who was harboring who , or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about . The movie would 've greatly benefited from some semblance of emotional build - up and a music score ( there 's some fine classical music used at the very end ) . Despite being so " talky " , the film plays much like a silent film , and the worst kind of film at that , a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects . Only the most astute French historians will find anything to take from this film , as it dose seem to paint well known events from a new angle ( the Lady is English and a royalist ) . Otherwise , avoid this yawner at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia ( I dozed off twice ) .
0 I can hardly believe that this inert , turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works I 've quite enjoyed . The experience of enduring THE LADY AND THE DUKE ( and no other word but " enduring " will do ) , left me in a vile mood , a condition relieved only by reading the IMDb user comment by ali-112 . For not only has Rohmer attempted ( with success ) to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century France but , as ali has pointed out , has shown ( at the cost of alienating his audience ) the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times . The director has accomplished something undeniably difficult , but I question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so -- or for us to watch the dull results of his labor .
0 As a fan of Eric Rohmer 's studies of the contemporary war between the sexes , I was very eager to see " The Lady and The Duke ( L'Anglaise et le duc ) " for how he would treat men and women during a real war , the French Revolution . < br /><br />The film looks beautiful , with each scene designed as a period painting , like a tableaux vivant . And I expected much talking , as that 's Rohmer 's style . But maybe Rohmer was restrained by basing the screenplay on a real woman 's writings is why this mostly felt like a docudrama version of " The Scarlet Pimpernel." < br /><br />As awful as the excesses of Robespierre et al , how about some recognition that the French aristocrats were spoiled brats ? I kept humming to myself : " Marat , we 're poor / and the poor stay poor ; " you could also pick a tune from " Les Miz." < br /><br />I was n't all that sympathetic as the central figure has to go back and forth between her city home and country manor to stay ahead of the Revolution . At one point her maid claims the pantry is bare but sure manages to lay out a fine repast . I simply did n't understand her , an English sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends her former lover and patron as he and the Revolution keep shifting political focus ; I think I was supposed to sympathize with her consistency more than their political machinations , like a character out of " The Scarlet Pimpernel . " Hey , the only reason she did n't go back home was her disgrace after an affair and child with the Prince of Wales or somebody . < br /><br />Usually in a revolutionary period there 's some groundswell of change going on in relations between men and women , but I saw none here . I once went to a Herbert Marcuse lecture that concluded with a lengthy Q & A ; the last question , from an audience member far older than the rest of us acolytes , heck she had gray hair , was " Why are revolutionaries so grim ? " She was hooted at and Marcuse did n't deign to respond to it seriously -- but it 's the only thing of substance I remember from the whole evening . Rohmer demonstrates that counter - revolutionaries are also grim and didactic.<br /><br />(originally written 8/11/2002 )
0 As interesting as a sheet of cardboard , this dispensable period piece has little going for it . It 's overly wordy and fails spectacularly to evoke the tension and fear that the real - life characters must have felt as they dodged the French Revolution 's fickle hand of justice . Eric Rohmer at 82 ? It shows .
0 I 've seen most of Ryuhei Kitamura 's work and I 've come to the conclusion that he has a knack for action . Scenes are kinetic and fast often combining elements of martial arts , gun fights and samurai fights with camera work that effectively captures the on screen carnage . With " Versus " and " Aragami " Kitamura demonstrated that creativity and showed that he his more than capable of working with a low budget . So what happened in " Alive " ? To be more blunt , the answer would be - nothing . Nothing happened in " Alive " it was a two hours plus movie with little to no action and little to no characters and plot.<br /><br />Adapted from a comic book by Tsutomu Takahashi " Alive " is an examination of the life of one Tenshu Yashiro ( played by Hideo Sasaki ) a death row convict who survives his execution . He is then given a choice of either to repeat the execution or to subject himself in a bizarre series of experiments . He chooses the latter and soon after that is placed in a room along with a rapist and later with a girl infected with a strange parasite that in exchange for it 's host 's humanity grants supernatural powers . Naturaly at some point that parasite moves into Yashiro , the bad thing is that does n't happen very soon . < br /><br />Similar to " Aragami " , " Alive " sets it 's first half in establishing the basic exposition . Characters are introduced , their motivations are set and their relations between each other are uncovered . The whole thing even takes place in just one set . The first major problem of that comparison is that while " Aragami " was just a 70 minute movie , " Alive " drags on for more than two hours thus making the first part over one hour long . That length could have been justified had the characters been made a bit more interesting but alas that is not the case . Dialogue is dry , monotonous , delivered without any sense of emotion or depth , characters themselves are n't much interesting . There were some small attempts at making " Alive " a bit more moral ambiguous but in the end it all came down to the classic : evil government people against , super - powered protagonist , whom yes you guessed it , saves the girl in the end . Like I previously said the entire film practically takes place at just one set , and after two hours that does get boring , even worse the set design itself was n't even interesting to begin with , and does n't do much to improve on other aspects of the film.<br /><br />Now , after that first part is over , one might think that Kitamura would at least make some entertaining action scenes to make up for the boring beginning . Sadly that is not the case . The two only fights are actually rehashes of similar fights from Hollywood movies , complete with bullet time effects and psychic powers . They 're just not interesting or fun , Kitamura 's creativity from " Versus " is gone , the small set even limits his often very impressive camera - work and it all boils down into generic and expectable fights , a shame really.<br /><br />Evidently " Aragami " was better on all accounts and " Kitamura " had learned something from " Alive " . So it was n't at least a total loss watching this movie . If only to understand the errors made , how to fix them and create a better more entertaining movie .
0 I really tried to like this movie but in the end it just did n't work for me . I have seen most of Kitamura 's output and have found it to be very variable . Alive , like all of his films has an interesting plot , some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity . However , these qualities are in painfully short supply in Alive . The plot is cool if not all that original and could have made for a pretty ace film . Unfortunately , the pacing is painfully slow and the film takes an age to get going , before reaching fairly predictable places . The action is just about passable , with the final fight pretty cool , and the earlier one about OK . The earlier one is also marred by overspeedy camera - work , making for less coherency . There are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue but the film still drags badly . The characters are neither well fleshed out nor well acted and the setting and general color scheme is drab and boring . The film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest , perhaps judicious use of the fast forward button could improve it . With about twenty minutes taken off the run time this could be a pretty decent sci fi thriller . But the full length film is dull . Only recommended to very patient and determined Kitumura fans .
0 Having seen Versus previously I had high hopes for Alive . The description of the movie on the back of the DVD jacket sounded promising . Alive did not deliver . VERY slow development . Loads of potential with the cast and the cool visuals . The premise was intriguing but the payoff did not offset the build up . Could have done so much more at the end . Most of the movie is just " sitting around " . To put it plainly , three of us were amped to sit down and watch this movie and by the 50 minute mark we were struggling to make it thru to the end . It really needed more shock elements . If you are looking for Ichi the Killer or Versus type fights then save yourself some $ and loads of disappointment .
0 I 'll keep this short , as I know I do n't need to say much.<br /><br />"Alive " is a strange little film that obviously appeals to some , but I found it to be shockingly bland from almost the very beginning . The film did very little to make any of the characters likable and the story at times became so convoluted that I completely lost interest . As I said , I know others enjoyed it , but I found Kitamura 's " Alive " to be anything but - a lame , extremely boring drama disguised as a thought - provoking action sci - fi flick . I felt like I was suckered into watching this film , based by its intriguing premise and uber - exciting cover art.<br /><br />My suggestion ? Pass it up for Kitamura 's far more enjoyable freshman effort " Versus " or his 2004 riot " Godzilla : Final Wars".<br /><br /> ... And do n't get me wrong , I 'm always up for a good thinking man 's film , but this certainly was n't it . There was nary a moment that I actually cared about a single event taking place in this overly - preachy , dialogue - heavy movie.<br /><br />If you wanna talk about something ... talk about boring .
0 I do n't know where to begin , so I 'll begin with a snippet from the back of the cover of this movie . " Alive combines the tension of Vincenzo Natali 's Cube with Kitamura 's own Versus . " I have not seen Versus , so I ca n't comment on that , but I think Cube was an excellent movie which I recommend to everyone . However , in this case someone has clearly confused " tension " with " boredom".<br /><br />I'll just go ahead and spoil the entire plot , because besides being one holy Swiss cheese of a plot , it 's also moldy cheese , and the movie is not worth spending any time on even if you do n't know the plot beforehand , so it does n't matter . If I have misunderstood the plot , do n't hit me - it 's probably because I had to struggle to keep my eyelids open.<br /><br />So the American military in Nevada once lost a UFO i the Nambi desert . This apparently makes sense because they 're both deserts so surely they 're practically the same place . Different continents or not . A monkey broke into the UFO and acquired an alien something which was passed on to a Japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert . What ever . The alien thing is now passed on to anyone who 's " bloodthirsty " enough to kill the current host . The Japanese military wants to use it for military stuff , so they decide to make it pass from the current host ( the researcher 's daughter ) to some other dude . But instead of just picking someone out of the military , which is full of people who are bloodthirsty AND already on the military 's side , they decide that it 's probably a good idea to pick some criminal out of death row instead . Oh , and the reason they pick this particular criminal from death row is because he was the first person in history to not die from the non - lethal electric shock which is the standard execution method , because everyone dies from the placebo effect when they get electrocuted . I do n't know if they do this so they can giggle in the staff room at how everyone dies even though it 's not deadly , or if they just want to cut down the electricity bill.<br /><br />Then the movie turns into what The Matrix would have been if it had been really lame , and superfluous fighting bores us to tears for what feels like an hour . And oh wait , now they remember that they already had a dude who was infected with the alien thing , so the entire movie up to this point was actually a totally waste of time and also human lives . Then everyone dies . The end.<br /><br />The only one moment in the movie where I did n't want to go away and sleep or eat a sandwich instead , was when a dude was pinned to a wall by a pipe through his chest , and he 's hanging around up there and another dude walks by . The dude hanging on the wall says " I 'm in pain , shoot me " . And the living dude looks at him , and it 's not like he 's a mean dude or anything , so he really looks sorrowful and does n't want the guy on the wall to suffer . So he shoots him.<br /><br />(Rhetorical pause.)<br /><br />In the stomach . " Gee THANKS A FREAKIN ' HEAP . "
0 Fashionably fragmented , yet infuriatingly half - realized character - study , an examination of the different personalities of two college roommates : a talented but undisciplined star basketball player , and a pot - smoking , womanizing rabble - rouser . We never learn why these young men are friends . They may share confusions about the world and their places in it , but they do n't seem to have anything else in common . Making his directorial debut , Jack Nicholson -- who also co - wrote the screenplay with Jeremy Larner , based upon Larner 's book -- doesn't introduce us to the characters with any clarity , nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen . There are some very decent performances here ( particularly from newcomer William Tepper in the central role ) , but most of the picture is unformed ( perhaps intentionally ) , sketchy or unsure . Bruce Dern plays the hard - driving basketball coach , Karen Black is the older , married lady Tepper is having an affair with , and Michael Margotta is Tepper 's wayward friend ( in an off - putting , over - the - top performance ) . Nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor , preferring ( I assume ) to let the character interaction dominate the film 's tone ; his script is no help either , and as a result it is unclear whom we 're supposed to sympathize with . Small , random moments do work ( a supermarket fight between Tepper and Black , Dern visiting Tepper in his dorm - room , all of the scenes set on the court ) , however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess . Hoping to juxtapose an all - important b - ball game with a sexual assault , Nicholson shows no style at his craft ( nor does he earn points for chutzpah , as his staging of these events is squashy and ugly ) . When a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors , one has to question his motives in doing so . Perhaps if " Drive , He Said " ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain , audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste . Unfortunately , the perplexing closer is as dumbfounding as much of the rest of the movie . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 I went to see this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot . To this day ( sorry Jack Nicholson ) , it is still the dullest movie I 've ever seen . It just went on and on with no discernible point and then - it just ended . The lights came up and I watched everyone looking around in confusion . Had the projectionist missed a reel ? I 've never had the urge to find out . All I remember about the movie is that it was a non - drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach . The most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the totally mystified audience afterwords . Fortunately , this was just an exception for Jack , Bruce , and Karen Black .
0 As a member of the cast , I was a member of the band at all the basketball games , I would like to let the world know after being in the movie , that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon . This was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot . Seems that the U of O sign was shown . While we were shooting , we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff . Mr Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill - mannered men I have ever met . Quite a time for a young 20 year old . BUt certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60 's and early 70 's despite what Hollywood may think . Trombone player from Oregon
0 This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen . It is ( I think ) a story of a rebellious college basketball player , his tough - but - fair coach , his girlfriend , and a fellow student ( played by Michael Margotta ) who has continual nervous breakdowns . The story goes nowhere , there is zero character development , there is nobody to care about , and the performances , with the exception of Bruce Dern as the coach , are terrible . It is hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson could direct such an awful movie . Make sure to avoid this turkey .
0 Some movies are repellent but still fascinating ( Pulp Fiction ) ; others are simply boring . This movie has an almost unique feature of being both utterly repellent and totally boring . By the end I did n't care about any of the characters , I just wanted all of them dead so I could get out of the theatre .
0 Tenants Two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty apartment house . They at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build.<br /><br />This is based upon a Bernard Malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel . Very little of the dialog is natural , its purple and brimming with shades of meaning . Its as if a college English major with a head full of pretensions wrote the script . It 's awful and I found myself instantly immune to anything the film had to say , which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom . Snoop Dog on down are fine form , unfortunately none of them can over come the falseness of the words and the premise.<br /><br />I ca n't really recommend this movie . While not really bad , its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away . I lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end . If you 're interested I 'd try it on cable , but I would n't lay out good money to see it .
0 I ended up watching The Tenants with my close friends who rented the movie solely based on Snoop Dogg 's appearance ( a passionate fetish of theirs ) on the cover . Understandably , I did not expect much . I thought the movie would include the typical array of Snoop Dogg related behavior and imagery often seen in cliché rap videos . However , my generalization was for the most part wrong . Unfortunately , this did n't make the movie any better.<br /><br />Most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama , whereas I would describe it as a dark seriously drawn out boring drama flick . The film tells a story of two struggling writers ( Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg ) who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces . Their polar opposite lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship . This friendship moves throughout the entire movie like a wild roller - coaster - most of which is contributed by Snoop 's character - reminiscent of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder . And although the movie is a drama , the acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - from Snoop and company was more comical than anything else.<br /><br />I would n't recommend this movie for those who are attention impaired because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that . There are some mediocre conflicts , but even they are mostly bogged down with more dialogue . The end , however , jumped at me with a sudden surprise . It was a little bit twisted , somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end . While watching the ending credits I could n't help but picture the director thinking , " Oh God , how the hell do I end this snoozer . " By the way , the director laid out carefully planted hints and subtleties leading to the climax - all of which are more visible than Waldo in a crowded street of midgets wearing nothing but black sweaters .
0 Watching The Tenants has been a interesting experience for me . It is the first film I have ever seen where I have shuttled at speed through parts of the ( non)action - and I can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to Serbo - Croat indie and find them fascinating.<br /><br />The Tenants is frustratingly sluggish and over - orchestrated . One of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue , apart from the set pieces where characters ' collide ' in a very structured setting ( to make this work , the film needed to feel more conceptual , which it did n't ) . This leads to a lack of realistic character development ; everyone seems two - dimensional.<br /><br />The worse for this is the character of Bill Spear , aka Snoop Dogg . I found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic . At one point , I even stopped the film because I got so annoyed by the character 's aggressive , violent and monotonal delivery , the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary " on " switch ( which gets really predictable after a while ) and I so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities . However , one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film ( supposedly 70s , it feels and looks more early noughties ) . If it had been more securely fixed in the 70s , his character might have seemed more understandable.<br /><br />The lighting of the film was also awkward . All the way through , the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty , jazz - infused atmosphere that just did not come off , largely because the set was too well - lit.<br /><br />The Tenants , to me , is an unbelievable film . It does n't depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race , identity or the life of a writer , be they white or black.<br /><br />Strangely , I came away with the feeling that this project needed David Lynch ; his eerie , clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable .
0 never before has a film driven me to write a review but this was just dire.i stuck with it trying to find what it was about this film that made snoop pick it as his first serious role but frankly it was a poor choice.maybe this made a good book but it certainly did not work for me as a film.i found it unbelievable , lacking atmosphere and i found many of the scenes hideously stilted.a musical maestro he may be but a serious actor snoop ain't.the acting by Dylan mcdermott and rose byrne was passable but not enough to carry a weak plot with feeble dialogue . perhaps i have just entirely missed the point but to me it did n't fit into any genre , it did n't elicit any empathy with the characters nor did it create any suspense , in fact i found myself praying for the end and quelling a deep desire to slap all three of the main characters !
0 May ( Anne Reid ) and Toots ( Peter Vaughan ) are paying an apparently infrequent visit to their son Bobby ( Steven Mackintosh ) and his family in London . Even as the visit begins , Toots suffers a fatal heart attack , leaving May adrift , unsure , and questioning her life and future . Finding herself attracted to her daughter 's boyfriend Darren ( Daniel Craig ) , her actions lead to inevitable consequences.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed , but for all its heralded realism and acclaim , The Mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant , even repellent characters , and asks the viewer to engage with them . Reid shines as May , and it is her skill and commitment as a wonderfully understated actor that salvages the film from a completely depressing mire , but Michell and Kureishi have allowed Craig , Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such utterly obnoxious characters , that it becomes increasingly difficult to care what happens to May. As written , the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are in fact so utterly selfish and cold - hearted that one begins to wonder what exactly was Kureishi trying to say . As directed , they are either unwilling or unable to lift Bobby and Paula above the two dimensional in their ghastly selfishness . < br /><br />Worth seeing for Reid 's performance , but little else . A crying shame ...
0 Disappointing and irritating . The screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clichés in a disjointed fashion . Character is not explored in depth . These are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element , the mother 's affair with her daughter 's lover . < br /><br />Anne Reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines , such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye . The script portrays Darren ( Daniel Craig ) as a Dr. Jekyll / Mr . Hyde without any hints about why , except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene . < br /><br />A mature writer could have done so much more with this topic .
0 I understand what this movie was trying to portray . How the old are often ignored and treated like a bother , which means they end up feeling unappreciated and like their lives are empty.<br /><br />I do not have a problem with this message , but I just feel that it could have been put across in a way that is not so painful to watch . I enjoy a good art movie but when a movie becomes too self - consciously arty ( as in this case ) the result is often frustrating . Including shots of a person packing a suitcase slowly that take 5 minutes try to make a point but just end up annoying the audience.<br /><br />The female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to just tell them to pull it together . This is a movie you feel you should enjoy or rate highly and certainly has its ' merits but I was just too frustrated watching it to ever recommend it to someone else . It might have a deeper message than other Roger Michell movies ( for example : ' Notting Hill ' ) but at least that was a movie you could enjoy watching .
0 After Life is a Miracle , I did not expect much . It 's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as Do You Remember Dolly Bell , for instance . Zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story . The wild and unbridled humor of Underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here . It appears that Kusturica has been going steadily downhill since he started making life - affirming comedies , beginning with Black Cat , White Cat , which I think was great , but already had some disturbing signs of dementia . I liked his early films so much , and this is why it 's especially disappointing to see something like this . Let 's hope his next one will be great .
0 This " movie " is more like a music video . Kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he is making movies , he feels like making music , and when he is making music , he feels like making movies . The best thing in " Promise me this " is the music , written by Stribor Kusturica.<br /><br />Kusturica said in the same interview , that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise . " Promise me this " has very little " noise".<br /><br />I liked " Life is a miracle " . It was also like music video for the first 30 minutes and at some points later , but it had a beautiful plot . " Promise me this " has no plot . I was awaiting this movie with big expectations , because I 've read , that the script has been written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favourite scriptwriters , who participated also in " Life is a miracle " . Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues , but for Kusturica they are " noise " , and much to my regret , I saw only two dialogues , which I could identify as written by Ranko Bozic . The other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor.<br /><br />Gordan Mihic ( the man who wrote the scripts for " Time of the gypsies " and " Black cat white cat " ) said in an interview , that Kusturica never follows the script . " Black cat white cat " was the only script , for which Kusturica said , that he will not touch it . According to Gordan Mihic , after all Kusturica comes back to the script , and if he does n't , he does n't make a good movie . And I think this is the case with " Promise me this " . He should have followed the script of Ranko Bozic.<br /><br />"Promise me this " is billed as a " comedy " , but there are very few moments , which made me laugh . The comedic moments are in the same style as " Black cat white cat " , but are not that funny at all . I think the difference comes from the fact , that " Black cat white cat " was written by Gordan Mihic.<br /><br />However , I know some people , who liked " Promise me this " , they find it very positive movie .
0 " A Damsel in Distress " is definitely not one of Fred Astaire 's better musicals . But even Astaire 's bad films always had some good moments.<br /><br />In " Damsel , " Astaire is Jerry Halliday , an American musical star who is in London on a personal appearance tour . He meets Lady Alice Marshmorton ( 19-year - old Joan Fontaine ) , a beautiful English heiress , who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.<br /><br />Jerry believes that Alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt . He tries to rescue her from her family 's country manor house , but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor Lady Alice will marry . Keggs ( Reginald Gardiner ) the conniving butler , and Albert ( Harry Watson ) , the bratty house boy , each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging Lady Alice 's romance with Jerry to make sure they win the bet.<br /><br />This musical has numerous problems . First , there is the plot , based on a novel by P.G. Wodehouse ( who co - wrote the screenplay ) . The story is slow , painful , and nerve - grating . When Fred is not dancing , we have to endure endless annoying scenes of ( a ) Fred romancing Joan Fontaine or ( b ) Keggs and Albert conniving against them and each other.<br /><br />The butler and the house boy are especially irritating . They are one - dimensional stock villain characters , the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth . You wish they would get off the screen and let Fred dance.<br /><br />Astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner , Ginger Rogers . Joan Fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film , and is miscast in a musical . She has little going for her , character - wise , other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.<br /><br />George Burns and Gracie Allen are along for the ride , as Jerry 's publicist and his ditzy secretary . The duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot , and Gracie has some funny lines , but she is also very annoying at times.<br /><br />The direction of the movie by George Stevens is not well done . At times , the cinematography is horrible and off - focus . There are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets , to try to convince the audience that we are in London , not Hollywood . ( They must have used tons of dry ice in this movie . ) On the plus side , the songs by George and Ira Gershwin are terrific , and have become classic song standards . And of course , the dancing in the movie is exceptional , thanks to Astaire and his choreographer , Hermes Pan.<br /><br />But the musical and dance numbers are ill - used and ill - staged . At times , the cast seems to start singing and dancing because , well , it 's time for them to start singing and dancing . The musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot . ( At one point , the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason . ) The numbers include :  " I 'm Dancing and I Ca n't Be Bothered Now " -- Fred dances well on a foggy traffic - filled London street . He does some great " cane - twirling " with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when Fred jumps on a passing double - decker bus . ( In the Broadway musical , " Crazy For You , " Harry Groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.)<br /><br /> " Put Me To The Test " -- Fred , George , and Gracie do a trio tap dance in an English cottage . George and Gracie match Fred step for step , but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason.<br /><br /> " Stiff Upper Lip " ( The Fun House Number ) -- At an amusement park fun house , Fred , George , and Gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor , rotating barrel , and with the fun house mirrors . It 's the best number of the movie , but it gets a little repetitious at times.<br /><br /> " Things Are Looking Up " -- Fred and Joan Fontaine do their one dance number together in the film , prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate . Fortunately , it 's a very simple dance number because Joan is not a great dancer.<br /><br /> " A Foggy Day in London Town " -- Fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night , crooning about the foggy day when he first met Joan in London . At times , he looks as if he 's not sure which way he 's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself.<br /><br /> " Nice Work If You Can Get It " -- A great song that is misused in the movie . During a social event at the manor house , Fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour - faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song . Each time Fred joins in , the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave . ( Again , Harry Groener did a better dance number with this song in " Crazy For You . " )  " Drum Dance Number " -- As Fred and Joan are eloping , Fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums . As usual , it 's a great dance number . But there 's absolutely no need for it , except to prolong the movie.<br /><br />The most contrived moment in the film comes when Fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for Joan Fontaine . As he leaps from the balcony , he finds a conveniently - placed trapeze -- that 's right , a * trapeze * -- hanging from a nearby tree . Fred ( or rather , a stuntman in Fred 's clothes ) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.<br /><br />The movie is worth owning on DVD for the dance numbers alone , but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the Fast Forward button on your remote . The > > FF button allows you to skip through the other , boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers .
0 Arthur Askey 's great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public . His juvenile jokes , silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world . A lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him , and he was never completely comfortable in films . He has his moments in The Ghost Train , and his character , Tommy Gander , has been tailored to make the most of his talents , but Askey the performer needed to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />Askey 's support in the film is not strong , it includes regular co - star Richard Murdoch ; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a dopey honeymoon couple ; Linden Travers going over the top as a ' mad woman ' . Also on board are Peter Murray - Hill , who off - screen married Phyllis Calvert , as the nominal leading man , giving a totally bland reading of the part , and leading lady Carol Lynne , who turns in an equally insipid performance . It is left to character actress Kathleen Harrison to effortlessly steal the film as a parrot loving single woman who gets smashed on Dr Morland Graham 's brandy .
0 An absolutely wretched waste of film ! ! Nothing ever happens . No ghosts , hardly any train , no mystery , no interest . The constant and BRUTAL attempts at comedy are painful . Everything else is pathetic . The premise is idiotic : a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no - place , because their train was held up for less than 3 minutes . What ? And the railroad leaves them no place to stay , in a heavy storm ? I think not . Oh , they can walk 4 miles across the dead - black fields . umm , yeah . Sure . Or , they can force themselves on the railroad 's hospitality , and stay at the ' haunted ' train station . A station which proved to be nothing but DEADLY BORING , utterly without ghosts , interest , or plot.<br /><br />So very terribly dull that this seems impossible.<br /><br />This ought to be added to the LOST FILMS list ! ! aargh ! !
0 Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii ... Full of clichés , highly predictable , unrealistic and sometimes even stupid . If you have nothing better to do however , it does provide 40 minutes of simple , unpretensive entertainment , endless looks at great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery . On the other hand , If you are looking for anything more than that , stay away ... <br /><br />Oh , and by the way , if you have ever worked in a Hotel or know anything about running one , you have two options : 1 . You will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents Hotel Business or , 2 . Look at it as science fiction comedy as I did , lie back , relax , and laugh about it !
0 Someone mentioned editing . This is edited badly and what started out as somewhat intriguing became an incomprehensible mess . For starters , let us know what it is you are trying to do with these experiments . Why are these people the best choices for the type of experimenting they are involved in ? And , what exactly are they testing ? Apparently there is some grand plan that some agency is going to exploit . The acting is pretty bad . Everyone is emoting . Everyone is keeping secrets . They frequently mention that if it were n't for the money , they 'd hang it up . There 's a deranged minister who spouts scripture . On and on . But , again , the biggest hang up is the lack of laying out a playing field for the actors . There are some really cheesy elements . Those little rooms and those chaise lounges . The awful wallpaper ( was it wallpaper ? ) . It was interesting , but did n't seem to go anywhere .
0 Oh , my gosh ... I thought CBS primetime television shows were the < br /><br />worst things Gerald McRaney appeared in ... <br /><br />Four people are experimented on by a crazed mind control < br /><br />computer . That 's it , do n't rent it.<br /><br />I saw this under one of its many titles- " Grey Matter , " and it is < br /><br />perhaps one of the worst films of recent memory . The other < br /><br />reviews are right , it is awful . Never have so many establishing < br /><br />shots appeared onscreen , NEVER . The cast is awful , the direction < br /><br />is awful , and the script is awful . I can not stress how awful this is . < br /><br />Avoid it like you would smallpox.<br /><br />This is rated ( PG ) for physical violence , some gun violence , mild < br /><br />gore , some profanity , and some adult situations
0 Ouch , what a painfully BORING Sci - Fi movie ! And that 's especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so action - packed and full of potential ! During the intro , we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of top - secret files . As he 's about to reveal the supposedly horrible & inhuman events that take place in the lab , he 's executed . Figures   From then on , the ' action ' swifts back and forth between two locations , the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator ( or something ) , and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing . More like dull , pointless and vague . Scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and it 's really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds , anyway . They all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed ; yet I fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanity - threatening device . Perhaps I missed something , but I doubt it . The interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow , as really none of them have personalities . So basically , " The Brain Machine " just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room . The film also could have been half an hour shorter if it were n't for a THOUSAND stagnant shots of buildings ! The relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated EVERY SINGLE TIME by a five - second shot of the places . Either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all Sci - Fi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves . Staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying , I assure you . James Best 's performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent , but one man definitely ca n't save this thing from being an absolute waste of time . Avoid !
0 I bought this ( it was only $ 3 , ok ? ) under the title " Grey Matter " . The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a non - DukesOfHazzard role intrigued me . As the other reviewers warned , it 's a pretty boring tale of a top secret government experiment gone awry.<br /><br />And yes , there are plenty of establishing shots , especially of a house with a pool in front of it . Some of the characters and interiors are so nondescript I guess the filmmakers worried we might forget who is who , so they keep tipping us off by first showing the outside of the buildings . It 's actually kinda funny . After awhile the pool shot feels like a tv channel 's station identification logo , reminding us that we are watching " Grey Matter".<br /><br />I also enjoyed two bouts of name - calling . At one point an angry test subject taunts somebody in charge by calling her a " Scientific b*tch ! " . It 's just a very inadequate insult . Several scenes later a different subject lets off steam by muttering about that " scientific b**tard ! " . It just sounded very awkward to me.<br /><br />Someday this movie will disappear forever . Another decade from now it will likely be impossible to find any copies of it . Almost like it never happened.<br /><br / >
0 Let 's see , here are the " highlights " of The Brain Machine : 15 establishing shots of a pool and a house ; 15 establishing shots of a nondescript office building ; 5 countdowns by a bland technician ; 7 close - ups of a menacing guard ; and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a high - tech experiment.<br /><br />Various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the release date given on the DVD box of 1977 . That 's an easy one to explain . This dog simply sat on the shelf unreleased for five years , until someone dusted it off , thinking it fit in perfectly with the post - Watergate mood of distrust in government . After seeing The Brain Machine now , my only wonder is that it ever got released at all !
0 This film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures had the potential for being a really interesting movie . But for me , it failed . I wo n't elaborate much on the rather confusing plot line , but if you are looking for a detailed explanation , the comment by user " reluctantpopstar " gives a good description of it.<br /><br />But it did n't work for me . I found it slow , which would be okay but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere . The viewer is left in the dark about too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie - in some films , one can argue that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason . I do n't think that this is the case here.<br /><br />As for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users ... I see that they do have a point - they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the " action " . And I suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several beverages on board to get through this one .
0 You know you 're in trouble when the film your watching has numerous alternate titles . Generally it means that they tried and retried to hide the turkey in various markets . Such a turkey is The Brain Machine which has seven different titles.<br /><br />Its about some super secret government project that is suppose to be able to use a computer to read people but instead it drives people to kill each other or themselves , or something like that . Its filled with B level TV actors sitting in paneled room with lawn chairs trying to act a script that makes almost no sense.<br /><br />Its a turkey of the untastey kind . Avoid it .
0 " The Brain Machine " will at least put your own brain into overdrive trying to figure out what it 's all about . Four subjects of varying backgrounds and intelligence level have been selected for an experiment described by one of the researchers as a scientific study of man and environment . Since the only common denominator among them is the fact that they each have no known family should have been a tip off - none of them will be missed.<br /><br />The whole affair is supervised by a mysterious creep known only as The General , but it seems he 's taking his direction from a Senator who wishes to remain anonymous . Good call there on the Senator 's part . There 's also a shadowy guard that the camera constantly zooms in on , who later claims he does n't take his direction from the General or ' The Project ' . Too bad he was n't more effective , he was overpowered rather easily before the whole thing went kablooey.<br /><br />If nothing else , the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970 's technology featuring repeated shots of dial phones , room size computers and a teletype machine that wo n't quit . Perhaps that was the basis of the film 's alternate title - " Time Warp " ; nothing else would make any sense . As for myself , I 'd like to consider a title suggested by the murdered Dr. Krisner 's experiment titled ' Group Stress Project ' . It applies to the film 's actors and viewers alike.<br /><br />Keep an eye out just above The General 's head at poolside when he asks an agent for his weapon , a boom mic is visible above his head for a number of seconds.<br /><br />You may want to catch this flick if you 're a die hard Gerald McRaney fan , could he have ever been that young ? James Best also appears in a somewhat uncharacteristic role as a cryptic reverend , but do n't call him Father . For something a little more up his alley , try to get your hands on 1959 's " The Killer Shrews " . That one at least does n't pretend to take itself so seriously .
0 I thought watching employment videos on corporate compliance was tedious . This movie went nowhere fast . What could have been a somewhat cheesy half hour twilight zone episode turned into a seemingly endless waste of film on people parking their cars , a picture of some dude 's swimming pool ( he really needs to answer his phone by the way ) a dot matrix printer doing its job , and Heuy and Louey sitting in a yellow lighted control room repeating " T minus 10 and counting " as if something exciting is going to happen . It does n't so do n't get your hopes up . The best thing about this movie is to see James Best and Gerald McC , in something other than there famous TV personalities , and that is stretching to find anything good . And do NOT get me started on the music which was totally composed of a Tympani , some large marine mammals , and microphone feedback . This movie is as close as I have given a one yet , but it gets the 2 because I actually was able to finish this insomnia cure , and did n't have to leave in the middle . AVOID AT ALL COSTS .
0 " Grey Matter " AKA " The Brain Machine " but the video people thought better of that ; the screen says 1972 but IMDb says 1977 ; it 's that kind of movie . The government has some kind of overriding interest in this ' brain machine ' project that has drafted four people - who turn out to be , roughly , a philosopher , a horny priest , a crackpot veteran and a patriot who got an abortion - to sit in a shrinking room with a computer that can read their horrendous secret thoughts . In the end the government takes over the lab by force and everybody dies . Here is a movie that is incompetent in every important way ; MY s * * * has better production values than this . It held my interest , though , just to see what exactly these exploitation filmmakers thought they were doing , dabbling in four - guys - in - a - room character drama . The answer : a tract about how science is inferior to God . Thanks a lot . It 's like opening a Kinder egg and getting your 30th goddam jigsaw puzzle . The priest is played by James " Roscoe P. Coltrane " Best , the philosopher by Gerald " the Republican Simon " McRaney . Also featuring very , very , very long establishing and transition shots in great quantity , this moves almost as slow as the Liberal convention .
0 Before this made for TV movie began , I had relatively low expectations . That 's because it was made after the final episode of the series had aired and many of the series originals were gone . There is no President Sheridan , Delenn , Lennier , Londo , Vir , G'kar or Lyta . If you remember , on the second to last episode of the series , all the regulars except Zack , Vir and Captain Lockley left B-5 permanently . Now for this film they did bring back Garibaldi ( who was not in the last B-5 movie ) to join Zack and the Captain and the Doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance . But because so much is gone of the old chemistry , this film already is severely handicapped.<br /><br />The movie is about a Soul Hunter ( Martin Sheen ) who is led to Babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist ( Ian McShane ) . A lot of spooky mumbo - jumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless . Yeah , yeah , the station nearly blew up but was saved and all , but frankly I felt like it was a case of " been there done that -- and done that a lot better in the past".<br /><br />The secondary plot , provided more for comic relief , was much more interesting , as an entrepreneur installed a holo - brothel and those in command were n't sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close , they were slapped with a lawsuit . This was fluff , but it did provide a few laughs -- something the other dreary plot was surely lacking.<br /><br />By the way , Sheen at first did a good job playing the Should Hunter -- with his wild eyes and bizarre delivery . However , repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character . This should have been spotted and corrected.<br /><br />So the final verdict is this is only for total die - hard B-5 nuts ( like myself ) . Others seeing it might assume the series sucked -- which is a great injustice . This is a great example of a show not knowing when to quit .
0 I 'm a big fan of B5 , having caught on only at the end of season three . I faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated , concluding that it was one of the most well - thought out story arcs to ever hit television . Even the filler episodes were interesting . The movies , also , were well produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters.<br /><br />Which brings us to ' River of Souls ' . Naturally , after seeing everything else , I had high expectations . Martin Sheen appears to be acting in an Ed Wood movie rather than a serious Sci - Fi story . The story itself , might have looked good in outline form , even made it to the story board . However , it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie . There are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story . There are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out . Had this made the regular season , it would have rated among the worst of the episodes .
0 I was very disappointed in this movie . Plotwise it was weak bordering on silly : Souls who can affect reality in the way they do ? A mission apparently critical to the Soul Hunters entrusted to one of their younger members ? And the whole B - story with the " holobrothel " and the lawsuit against the station was so awful that at one point I blurted out to the television , " Why are you wasting my time with this?" < br /><br />Thematically , " River of Souls " did n't really go into the question of the soul in any more depth than the original episode " Soul Hunter " did . We see that Soul Hunters can make mistakes , but we still do n't get a feeling for their culture . ( Are there any female Soul Hunters?)<br /><br />The acting was okay , given the material they had to work with , and the special effects - especially the planetscapes in the first act - were very impressive . But overall , I 'd say give this one a miss .
0 Went to see this movie hoping to see some flashes of the Jet Li we were amazed by in Lethal Weapon 4 . Unfortunately too many of his fight stunts are so clearly fake that it took even that enjoyment out of it . The flying kicks would be a lot more impressive if you could n't see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks.<br /><br />Too cartoonish and very disappointing .
0 It 's hard to believe an " action " packed Jet Li movie could be so boring , but this was transcendant trash . The plot is an amalgam of other Hong Kong chopsocky flicks . The martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent . < br /><br />It 's a comic book story about a group of super - human soldiers who are to be killed because they 're mentally unstable , one of their number ( Li ) who holds off an incompetent army to save them and rebuilds a life as a pacifist librarian . The saved killers resurface with an Austin Powers quality plot to take over the world , and Li sheds his new life to save the world.<br /><br />The version I saw was dubbed , and that may have accentuated the cheesiness of the wafer - thin plot and comic - book 25 cent special effects . But I suspect even Ninja - Turtle - watching 8-year olds would have found this juvenile and hollow .
0 I rated this a 3 . The dubbing was as bad as I have seen . The plot - yuck . I 'm not sure which ruined the movie more . Jet Li is definitely a great martial artist , but I 'll stick to Jackie Chan movies until somebody tells me Jet 's English is up to par .
0 " Hak Hap " , or " Black Mask " ( in english ) was a disappointment . I was told that it was a sort of " Japanese version of the Matrix " . Imagine my disappointment . The film was either badly dubbed or the soundtrack did n't time well with the film . Another thing is that the dialogue was pretty much bad . There was very little thought put into the English version of this film and it appeals only to the " senseless action " genre . Not a film I would want to see again .
0 Jet Li , is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world . He has been for over 20 years and he puts others in the genre to shame . While he is big in Asia , he is almost unknown here in the US.<br /><br />Black Mask is supposed to be a breakout movie for him , but it fails horribly . First of all , it is dubbed . While it may have camp value ( the dubbing is n't even close and it is flat in tone ) , it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer . Secondly , the director in this movie , Daniel Lee , does a horrible job . He cuts scenes so fast , at times , you do n't know what 's going on . Other times , the camera shakes and wobbles . Fans see Jet Li 's movies for the fantastic martial arts . However , the director edits the scenes so fast that you do n't even know who 's who half the time ! Other times , a scene is left hanging ( ie Li is beginning to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep , while the badguys arm their guns , two seconds later , both Li and the love interest are already under the car ! ) Other scenes are so improbable , that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous ( killer CD roms ? Just give him Throwing Stars ! ! ! ! ) . Li , needs a director who is less prone to machine gun cutting and more to creating a cinematic mise - a - scene . The added rap / techno music goes from being okay to intrusive . The plot has possibilities but are all squandered by cartoonish characters that take away from any credibility that this movie strives for . And are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize Simon , because he has a half mask on ? Would n't the hair , lower jaw , or voice give it away?<br /><br />If you want to see a Jet Li movie , try Iron Monkey or his classic Shaolin Temple . This disjointed mess is a complete waste of time ..... 2/10
0 Lame , cliched superhero action movie drivel . I had high hopes for this movie , and the genre of HK buddy cop actioneers is one that i do n't despise , but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was . This would have been forgivable , as it always is in these kinds of movies , when the action compensates , unfortunately , it did not . The action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of HK action , but it 's not very involving , obscenely gory , and in fact often completely incoherent ( perhaps this is due to re - editing for american release , it does show signs in many places of patchwork ) . I was very disappointed .
0 The movie was awful . The theater was dead with silence 'cause everyone was embarrassed to be in there watching such trash . I think someone gave Jet Li a lobotomy and made him perform a script with dialogue written by a five year old . The martial arts are ' ok ' , but when put next to the Jackie Chan movies and " The Matrix " you 're better off seeing one of those .
0 Mild SPOILERS contained herein . I 'm spoiling this film to save you the trouble of having to watch it . < br /><br />Jet Li 's movies fall into one of two categories : Shaolin period movies and movies set in modern - day Hong Kong revolving around Triads or Triad like organizations . Each genre has its best and worst films . ` Twin Warriors ' is Jet Li 's best Shaolin era flick while ` The Evil Cult ' is his worst . ` Fist of Legend ' while in the recent past is the best ` modern era ' Jet Li movie . ` Black Mask ' without a doubt is the worst.<br /><br />Jet Li plays a self - exiled mercenary who received an injection that gives him superhuman ability , but shortens his life span . In his ` new life ' in exile he plays a pacifist librarian . When his old mercenary squad goes on a rampage , Jet Li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them . He dons a very silly corrugated cardboard mask so as to conceal his identity from the police ( and public ) as a librarian , as well as to conceal his true identity to his ex - comrades in arms.<br /><br />The version I saw was dubbed , and horribly at that . Why does Jet Li capture and hold hostage his library co - worker if he 's a pacifist ? Is there a love story between them ? Why does the police chief not care when he learns of the Black Mask 's true identity ? The plot is just plain BAD . Bad by way of the superhero cheesiness , bad in the sense that characters are never properly developed , bad in its character interactions , all topped off by a half - explained story I quickly lost interest in . < br /><br />The action and martial arts sequences are way over the top . Lots of blood , gore ( severed body parts aplenty ) , explosions , and Matrix style superhuman martial arts fiascos are present in the film . Unfortunately this is the films best and only selling point . If you want to see Jet Li playing a vigilante superhero in a Mission Impossible style movie ` Black Mask ' delivers . For the rest of us Jet Li fans it is a true disappointment . This is one of those movies where Jet Li never gets to be Jet Li : he gets neither the chance to charm us with his charisma , nor a chance to impress us with his impressive yet realistic martial arts ability . < br /><br />Normally a Chinese knockoff of Ozzy Osbourne would be enough to engross me in a film , sadly ` Black Mask ' proved to be an exception to that rule . Indeed the antagonist of this movie , by the way he dresses , his long straight hair , and trademark round sunglasses looks like the modern and aged Ozzy Osbourne . However the villain is n't on - screen long enough to make the gimmick worthwhile . I am assuming the likeness to Ozzy was intentional ; in addition to the villain 's look , he also ran a satanic looking hideout . So much more could have been made from the Ozzy Osbourne villain gimmick ! If only the writer , director , or ANYONE had bothered to give a background to and develop the character of the film 's arch villain!<br /><br />`Black Mask ' was the first Jet Li film released on video in the USA after Lethal Weapon 4 , and I 'm glad I stayed away from it until now . It may well have ruined my whole perception of Jet Li as a martial artist and actor . If you want to see Jet Li at his worst , rent ` Black Mask ' and ` The Evil Cult ' and make it a double feature or horror , both intentional and unintentional . Otherwise stick to moves that utilize the talents of Jet Li , and have plots that are semi - well thought out and plausible . 3/9 stars .
0 This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards ! I can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film . It 's great to see J.Beals but she 's only in the movie for a few minutes . M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for . The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable . The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch . There is no real emotional depth to the story . A movie revolving about an actor who ca n't get work does n't feel very original to me . Nor does the development of the cop . It feels like one of many straight - to - video movies I saw back in the 90s ... And not even a good one in those standards.<br /><br / >
0 Monika Mitchell 's showbiz satire has some laughs and some premeditated violence . I would n't say blood - soaked ; but there is insult and injury . Max Matteo(John Cassini)is a character actor that has a quirky adaptable presence on screen , but he has a terrible track record of being chosen for the parts he goes after . There is always a producer 's nephew or seemingly trivial reason for his not being awarded the role he seeks . Well , the best thing to do is get rid of the competition ... Max becomes obsessed with such thoughts . The rewarding career is just a swing , push and shot away . Other cast members : Rene Rivera , Molly Parker , Jennifer Beals , Frank Cassini and cameos by Eric Roberts and Sandra Oh . Well , that 's show business ... or is it ?
0 It 's like a bad 80s TV show got loose and tried to become a soft - core porn movie . Oh my god was it bad . The plots of each character had little relevance . The plot itself was n't anything to speak of . Something about a stalker , I guess . In the end he shoots himself ? It 's not really clear , but somehow there 's a volleyball game involved . And the main character ( Randy ) sleeps around a lot . The only reason my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it , and they ended up wanting to fast forward to the scenes with him in it , which were barely watchable at that . Thank god I did n't spend any money on it , but I want that hour of my life back .
0 The volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters . Thankfully , highly acclaimed director Nelson McCormick has brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time ( rated lower than Side Out and higher than , well , umm ) . However , do n't let the cover of this movie decieve you . Kill Shot stars up and coming star Koji as a modern day Sherlock Holmes . Using such high - tech gadgets as a computer that is less powerful than my Gameboy , Koji is able to aid FBI agents in the tracking of a man who has not committed any obvious crime . While there are other actors in the movie , including brief cameos by Denise Richards , a gay negro , and a preposterously ugly and annoying girl , Koji carries this movie on his own . Any fan of movies such as The Matrix or Hackers will definitely love Kill Shot .
0 Of all movies ( and I 'm a film graduate , if that 's worth anything to you ) , this is THE WORST movie I have ever seen . I know there are probably some worse ones out there that I just have n't seen yet , but I have seen this , and this is the worst . A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover . Talk about being young and retarded . She 's uncredited ! Her role was unbelievably small ! How did she make it on the cover ! ? IMDb does n't even list it in her filmography . This movie was so bad , we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it , and slipped it inside the case . It read something like " please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally bad movie ! "
0 This movie will confuse you to death . Furthermore , if your a Denise Richards ' fan , do n't even think of renting this movie . Besides getting top billing by being on the cover and about 10 minutes of air time if that , she has nothing to do with the movie or the many messed up plots .
0 Man , this was hilarious . It should be under COMEDY . Or STUPID . It would have made realizing what a pile of stank this was much easier . Seriously ? I want anyone associated with this movie tased , effective immediately . For everyone who is thinking of watching this " movie " , let ' 's go over a few plot points . Oh , wait . There are n't any . There is literally no plot . I think Casper Van Dien was bored , and he decided to film something with some random someones , and miraculously , it somehow got on videotape . This movie is literally the worst movie of all time . Do n't believe me ? Go watch it . Do it , man . I dare you . But be prepared to gouge your eyes out . If you can sit through this without blowing a cow , you are very strong and courageous .
0 This was one of the worst films I have ever seen.<br /><br />I usually praise any film for some aspect of its production , but the intensely irritating behaviour of more than half the characters made it hard for me to appreciate any part of this film.<br /><br />Most common was the inference that the bloke who designed the building was at fault an avalanche collapsing it . Er ok.<br /><br />Also , trying to out ski an avalanche slalom style is not gon na work . Running 10 feet into some trees is not gon na work . Alas it does here . As mentioned before the innate dumbness and sheer stupidity of some characters is ridiculous . In an enclosed space , with limited oxygen a four year old could tell you starting a fire is not a good idea.<br /><br />Anyway , about 5 minutes of the movie redeems itself and acquires some appreciation . However , if you have a modicum of intelligence you too will find most of this film hard to tolerate.<br /><br />It pains me that so many quality stories go unproduced and yet someone will pay for things like this to be made.<br /><br />Oh , did I mention the last five minutes ? Well to give you a hook you have to keep watching in order to see the latest in combative avalanche techniques . Absolutely priceless .
0 Saw this on TV . I 'm glad I did n't go to the cinema to see this or spend the money on rental . The movie is totally predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner , to the snaking electric cables . The plot is really weak and unbelievable - the avalanche expert guy gets hit by a 20 foot wave of bone breaking avalanche ( using actual footage ) and all he has to do is get up and shake himself down . The avalanche thunders down at a million miles an hour and stops dead at the side of the road.<br /><br />Some of the actual avalanche material is impressive and shows its devastating power . But the contract between the real avalanche and the staged stuff makes this film look even flimsier.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour , do n't bother with this one not even on T.V.
0 I ca n't figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad . It 's like the TV station are desperate for anything , anything at all . They 're buried underneath a bunch of snow , the electricity constantly flashes on and off , yet magically there is a background light that stays constant . Where does all this ( fake ) light come from ? That , and all that stupid bickering between the characters . They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive . It tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping . But because it 's such bad directing and acting , you will not your Florence Nightingale fix with this flick , sorry . I 'm joining the negative feedback , and I concur that this is one of the worst movies ever .
0 * * * * WARNING : here be spoilers * * * * Why do I waste my hastily fleeing years watching garbage like this ? This film is an impressive collection of clichés , poor writing , worse directing , and then we have n't even got to the acting yet . < br /><br />And of course , you can predict the whole story from beginning to end.<br /><br />Hero expert fights against stupid , corrupt and incompetent henchmen . One avalanche goes off , burying all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive in spite of going through all sorts of cliffhanger perils . Corrupt partner who caused the whole thing gets fried alive together with his payoff money . Second avalanche heroically deflected by renegade expert 's adventurous experiment . Evil henchmen in the end turn out to have a heart as well . Troubled teenager falls into the arms of her crusty stepmother after being saved by her . Etc , etc , etc , etc , on and on it goes . < br /><br />In fact , there 's little reason to warn for spoilers . You could probably work the whole plot out if I gave you the basic ingredients . At least , I was n't too wide off the mark most of the time , anticipating what would happen next.<br /><br />And then we have n't discussed the factual errors.<br /><br />I agree with a previous commentator that even though there are usually SOME redeeming features even of a bad movie . you 'd be hard pressed to find any in this one . I suppose I gave it 2 out of 10 for some nice scenery shots , but that 's it.<br /><br />It 's been some time since a film made me groan , but this one certainly did .
0 Amy Heckerling 's second film Johnny Dangerously is a parody of 1930 's gangster films made in the Warner Brothers ' tradition . Michael Keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935 . Keaton 's mother ( Maureen Stapleton ) has continuing health problems , so Keaton falls into crime at an early age via Peter Boyle . Meanwhile , the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord to Boyle and Keaton eventually rises through the ranks . Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin , yeah that 's right , Vermin ! Griffin Dunne is Keaton 's younger brother turned district attorney , Glynnis O'Connor his wife , and Marilu Henner plays Keaton 's moll . The film looks notoriously cheap , making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film.<br /><br />The film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour . Due to the combination of dialog and gags , the film holds its own for the first half , but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half . Keaton chews the scenery doing his best James Cagney impression . Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious , not funny . Piscopo does the " once " bit one time too many . Several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like Danny DeVito , Dom DeLuise , Ray Walston as a street vendor , Alan Hale , Jr. as a desk sergeant , and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady . The second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers . The closing scene utilizing The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism as is The Call Of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film . I think Heckerling should have known better , since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of The Roaring Twenties ' actual 1939 release date . * 1/2 of 4 stars .
0 A one is the highest rating I could have given this movie , considering zero and negative numbers are not allowed . Pee yew , pointless mess of a movie with a lot of wasted b - list actors who have done better work , written and directed by some guy with the mentality of a twelve year old who smirks and giggles at stupid puns , and poop and fart jokes . For example , Gene Stapelton 's ( Ding - Bat from All in the Family ) character telling Marilu Henner 's character that she " swings both ways " sexually , was a cheap attempt at humor indicative of the general lameness of the movie ... You want good , cheeky humor ? Rent Animal House , American Pie ( part one only ) , Old School or Office Space .
0 Just as " ITS A MAD , MAD , MAD , MAD WORLD " is at the top of my list for all time greatest comedies ever made , this one is at the very bottom . ( Of course , I could be wrong - not having seen " SAVING SILVERMAN " ) In other words , it 's a lame , lame , lame , lame comedy.<br /><br />Rating : 1/2 * out of * * * * *
0 * * CONTAINS SPOILERS * * < br /><br />The truly exquisite Sean Young ( who in some scenes , with her hair poofed up , looks something like Elizabeth Taylor ) is striking in her opening moments in this film . Sitting in the back of a police car waiting to signal a bust , her face and body are tense and distracted . Unfortunately , once the bust is over Young 's strained demeanor never changes . This is one fatally inhibited actress.<br /><br />One has only to compare Young to the performer playing her coworker and best friend , Arnetia Walker , to grasp what is missing in Young . Walker is open , emotional , and at ease at all times ... in that there 's no apparent barrier between what she may be feeling and her expression of it . She is an open book . Young , on the other hand , acts in the skittish , self - conscious way you might expect your neighbor to act were they suddenly thrown into starring in a film . Basically , she does n't have a clue.<br /><br />With this major void looming at the center of the movie , we 're left to ponder the implausiblities of the story . For instance , after Miss Young is kidnapped by the criminal she 's trailing and locked in a closet , she breaks the door down when left alone . Granted , she 's dressed only in a bra and panties , but in a similar situation , with a psycho captor due to return any moment , would you head for the door ... or take the time to go through his dresser , take out some clothes and get dressed ? I would guess that this and other scenes are trying to suggest some sort of mixed emotions Miss Young 's character is experiencing , but Young can not convey this type of complexity.<br /><br />There are a few affecting moments in the film , such as the short police interviews with the criminal 's past victims , but overall this is an aimless endeavor . It 's too bad Miss Young was replaced while filming the pair of comic book style films that might have exploited her limitations with some humor ( BATMAN and DICK TRACY ) , because her floundering while attempting to play actual people is oddly touching . Watching Miss Young try to act , at least in this " thriller " , is a sad spectacle .
0 The concept of the legal gray area in Love Crimes contributes to about 10 % of the movie 's appeal ; the other 90 % can be attributed to it 's flagrant bad - ness . To say that Sean Young 's performance as a so - called district attorney is wooden is a gross understatement . With her bland suits and superfluous hair gel , Young does a decent job at convincing the audience of her devout hatred for men . Why else would she ask her only friend to pose as a prostitute just so she can arrest cops who try to pick up on them ? This hatred is also the only reason why she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this crappy movie . Watching Young go from frigid to full - frontal nudity does little to raise interest , but the temper tantrum she throws standing next to a fire by a lake does . Watching her rant and rave about her self - loathing and sexual frustration makes Love Crimes worth the rental fee , but it 's all downhill to and from there . Despite her urge to bring Patrick Bergin 's character to justice , her policing skills completely escape her in the throes of her own tired lust and passion . Patrick Bergin does a decent enough job as a slimy sociopath ; if it worked in Sleeping With the Enemy it sure as hell can work in this . But I ca n't help but wonder if the noticeable lack of energy Young brings to the film conflicts with his sliminess . I 'm guessing it does and the result is a " thriller " with thrills that are thoroughly bad and yet comedic .
0 the more i think about it , there was nothing redeeming about this < br /><br />movie . i saw it 9 months ago , so my memory might have made it < br /><br />worse than it was , but i do know it was at least as bad as a 4 out of < br /><br />10 . < br /><br />after seeing the movie , i met the director . he seemed so clueless < br /><br />as to what he was doing or what he had done , and as far as i < br /><br />could tell , he did n't care for the film either . even he agreed that he < br /><br />didn't really know what he was doing , and he was forced to do < br /><br />certain things because it was filmed digitally . < br /><br />i felt that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula that it < br /><br />built for itself : " 9 people all have to be connected in some way . how < br /><br />can we get from point ' A ' to point ' B ' " so in order get from the < br /><br />prostitute we see in the start and back to her at the end they 10<br /><br />minutes on each character 's relationship to another person . it < br /><br />makes one feel choked by the 2 demensional , badly drawn < br /><br />characters.<br /><br />I just remembered the one redeeming part of the movie ... Steve < br /><br />Bouchemi there is one scene where he is amazing . that 's it . as i < br /><br />say ... 4 out of 10 .
0 This movie starts slow , then tapers off . After watching for about an hour , and seeing absolutely nothing happen , I walked out . I mean , nothing happened . Zero . Zip . Nada . There is no story . The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know . The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a " motion " picture . There is no motion . I could have told the same " story " with a couple still pictures with captions . The script is a joke . It 's just awful . I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it . My biggest regret is not that I wasted 60 minutes of my life watching " Love In the Time of Money " , but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader . I could have been the first to walk out , but I waited a bit too long . Instead , I watched about 20 people walk out before me .
0 Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov as a very unlikely couple in a very not likable film at all.<br /><br />The film shows promise for Ustinov is released from prison for embezzling . He convinces Robert Morley to go away so that he can assume his identity and begin hacking away at computers at a very fancy firm run by Karl Malden and Bob Newhart , another unusual duo for films.<br /><br />Morley sounds just as he did in 1938 's " Marie Antoinette . " Perhaps , he needed to return to that genre.<br /><br />This film is ridiculous at best . Hard to believe that the following year , Maggie Smith totally changed her ways and gave a shattering Oscar performance in " The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." < br /><br />Ms . Smith is made out here to be an apparent dumb - red head , but by film 's end , she is the brains of the outfit . Too bad the writing did n't go the way with her .
0 I was excited to discover this late sixties comedy staring some of my favorite people - Maggie Smith , a very young Bob Newhart and , of course , Peter Ustinov . My disappointment was thus compounded to discover the film does n't work as either a comedy or a perfect heist film . Ustinov plays a small time crook just out of prison who sets his sites on a large American corporation based in London . Bluffing his way past dimwitted CEO Karl Malden and tech geek Newhart , Ustinov passes himself off as a computer expert and immediately plans the ' perfect heist ' part of the film . To do this he needs to get passed a tamper proof security system that guards the corporation mainframe . And here is problem one . His perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is remarkably trusting and stupid . His lame excuses are taken at face value and this must be the only computer center anywhere not to bother with video cameras . The second problem is the heist ( fraud really ) happens within the first 30 minutes of the film robbing the rest of the picture of much in way of dramatic tension . Maggie Smith is sadly miscast as Ustinov 's ditsy next door neighbor / secretary who just ca n't keep a job . I love Maggie Smith but she just seems too together here , too composed , the part called for more of a wacky , physical comedian . Furthermore , Ustinov and Smith have no chemistry together , maybe it 's the age difference , but the later romantic relationship , as devoid of actual romance as it is , still comes off a little creepy . Ustinov co - wrote the script , and it was thought well of at the time , but I found it unfunny , meandering and a sad waste of a great cast .
0 A reasonable effort is summary for this film . A good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement . Maggie Smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not as good as she could have given , other actors were just dreadful ! A terrible portrayal . It was n't very funny and so it did n't really achieve its genres as it was n't particularly funny and it was n't dramatic . The only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance . Target Audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages . A very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all well and people were left confused as to why the film was n't as good and who the target audiences were etc . However Maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of capability.<br /><br />4 .
0 A good cast is appallingly wasted in this slower than molasses and haphazardly connived comedy . Peter Ustinov tries hard here to bring something to life but the result is a dour bore that misses all the right beats that might have made it watchable . Regardless of the favorable comments here , this film is awful . Badly directed . Badly edited . Badly acted . Badly written . You need to sit through a hundred movies to come across one this bad.<br /><br />The muddled and excruciatingly laggard plot concerns Ustinov conning his way into an American insurance company in order to hack their computer and embezzle millions of pounds . How he does it is beyond lameness and credibility ( he just learns his computer skills seemingly overnight by reading some pamphlets , and hoodwinks computer expert Robert Morley into going to South America and stealing his identity).<br /><br />As a side plot , Ustinov romances fellow loner Maggie Smith , who just happens to become his secretary by chance after he gets a flat in her building . She ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with Bob Newhart that go nowhere , while Ustinov goes about grafting the money bit by bit and trying to keep one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden . Then he Marries Smith and they fly off to Brazil , which has become the staple finale of almost every British caper comedy since ( Nuns on the Run ? A Fish Called Wanda?)<br /><br />The surprise twist of an ending is more laughable than everything that came before . By the end I was thinking I must be truly off my rocker to stick out drivel like this . Even a cameo by Cesar Romero did n't help it . One of the most unfunny , poorly paced ' comedies ' I 've ever seen , and certainly the worst caper . Do n't waste your time . If you love this you need to see better films .
0 The words " Swedish " and " Action movie " do not mix . That becomes more and more obvious with every attempt made in the genre . This is yet another failed attempt.<br /><br />Lasse Brunell ( Shanti Roney ) works at a military air base with top secret computer systems . One day foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he does n't do what they tell him . They want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it.<br /><br />This movie has it 's ups and downs . And usually in Swedish action movies there are no " ups " , just " downs " . So i guess something in this movie showed some quality . To begin with the positive remarks i can mention that the movie is technically well made . The footage of planes and helicopters flying are well shot and look very nice . The acting is of very varying quality . Shanti Roney makes a decent performance while Maria Bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual ( i wonder how long Swedish directors are going to keep using her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden plank ? ) . Stefan Sauk is laughable as the " cool " special forces man who comes to the base to investigate.<br /><br />And what about the action scenes ? Well as i said above the scenes of planes and helicopters flying are nice . But aside from that there is not much action to talk about . And that is a common problem with Swedish action films . There is just not enough action going on . Maybe it 's a budget problem , maybe it 's film - making culture . I do n't know , but it negatively affects the experience . Because quite frankly , the story and acting is not good enough for this movie to rely just on that.<br /><br />I rate this 4/10 for effort .
0 * may contain a spoiler of sorts ? * The mere mention of Crispin Glover is enough to send some geek 's panties in a bunch . His landmark appearance in Back to the Future as George McFly has sealed him into the American conscience forever . More recently , he has been trying to get back into the culty subconscious with Bartleby and Willard.<br /><br />This time , however , Crispin has made a 76-minute , cheap dada film . At times it reminded me of genius , while overall it almost insulted me , but not because of its content . Content ? What Is It ? is a movie where , in one half of the movie , all of the actors have Down 's Syndrome , giving it a freakshow feel to it . The other half of the movie includes Crispin Glover , Adam Parfrey , and a guy with cerebral palsy . This all had the feel of what John Waters was attempting to do with Desperate Living , and simultaneously feeling more successful and failing miserably.<br /><br />The half with the Down 's Syndrome actors also features many many killed snails . It is about a guy who has snails , and ends up killing one . He is also tormented by a bunch of other people , and a grasshopper . He falls in love with 2 girls , one of which he has sex with in a graveyard . He also has a falling out with a friend who teases him.<br /><br />In a weird semi - interior set , Crispin Glover is the director of this show . He is something like the control of the guy 's mind , and the cerebral palsy guy is something like the sexuality . Well , he at least gets masturbated in explicit scenes . There is other " shocking " imagery made humorous , like Nazi Swaztikas crossed with Shirley Temple , and minstrels in black face saying they 're Michael Jackson.<br /><br />In the outside world , the tormentor is still dealing with his love of killing snails and being beaten by the other people . They beat him with rocks , and such . Later , they beat the minstrel after putting him on trial.<br /><br />Back to the interior , Crispin Glover is still the ruler of his set , and tries to control everybody , but fails miserably.<br /><br />What Is It ? makes less sense than Dr. Caligari , and has more than a passing style stolen from it . The claustrophobic mental space feels very much like the way the no - wall sets of Dr. Caligari felt claustrophobic . They also had some dialogue that was absolute nonsense . And , it was all wrapped up with absurdist imagery for humor.<br /><br />The problem is , about 20 minutes into the movie ... maybe a little more ... What Is It ? runs out of imagery . For the next 56 minutes , we keep running on the same sets of images , only introducing new imagery in the form of an absurdist puppet show . The movie seems little more than a movie which attempts to push the envelope in offensive and taboo imagery . It tries to mock and confuse the audience . But , the issue is that it only has enough different imagery for a 40 minute movie.<br /><br />Even worse than that , the cinematography , set design , and everything else felt very very cheap and almost unplanned . It felt like " OK , this is the way we can do it and get it out of the way . " It did n't feel interesting , and was quite ... boring . Dr. Caligari , on the other hand , had amazing cinematography and framing . The difference between the two is quite astounding.<br /><br />rating : C
0 I firstly and completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this a " spoof " . Crispin Glover is very serious about his film . He personally introduced the film at the screening I saw in Chicago . He had worked on the film for years and it is the first in an intended trilogy . " What is it ? " is Crispin Glover 's attempt at an art film in the vein of those he idolizes by Herzog , Lynch etc.<br /><br />I had heard rumor of this film years ago " epic porno movie with all down - syndrome cast directed by crispin glover " . When it finally came out i watched the trailer on - line and read the synopsis and i was foaming at the mouth with anticipation . ... I went to chicago to see it and it was a major disappointment . If he took out the goofy sh*t , such as the pot - smoking grandma , and the dancing dolls , he would be left with something much better , but only about 10 minutes long.<br /><br />In other words just watch the trailer , be entertained , and leave it at that . There are some striking images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases , but its lack of focus amounts to disappointment .
0 I saw Crispin Glover 's " What Is It ? " at the Ann Arbor film festival . Admittedly , the film was at least aptly named , because I got the distinct sense that even the writer / director could provide no answer . At the question and answer session after the screening , Mr. Glover said that the film was originally meant to be a short film to show the virtue of using actors with down - syndrome . However , this is in itself not enough of a reason to create a film . Actors are , in my opinion , building blocks for a larger vision - a larger vision that seemed muddled at best and absent at worst.<br /><br />Crispin Glover also said that he wanted to address taboo subjects . Well , he does do that . But why ? The film seems to have no stance , no reason for addressing anything . Does he feel these things should n't be taboo ? The film does n't even give me an indicator of that . Taboo for the sake of taboo is not interesting . It ca n't even afford to make the taboo disturbing or inciting on any level because he has n't made the audience care in any way . < br /><br />Ignoring problems with the concept for a moment , the thing that actually shocked me most was how poorly the film was put together . The editing , cinematography , and other technical aspects seemed frequently to be extremely amateur . Glover said 125 - 150 thousand dollars went into the movie , and I feel that the money should have been spent on different designers ( Glover actually did some design himself - I know I saw at least sound design in the credits ) . The painted sets are okay ( not great ) , but used poorly . Parts feel like a photographed stage play - which would be fine if that went to any sort of purpose , but in Glover 's hands it just feels sloppy . Other parts are filmed like a sort of Home Movie , of inferior quality to a lot of the stuff I see first - time filmmakers do on iMovie.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest problem with " What Is It ? " is I ca n't even understand how seriously the film is to be taken . There are some parts that feel like Glover is screaming at you to think seriously . At other points , he seems off on his own little joke . Perhaps he meant for this to be ironic , or meaningful in some way , but I just felt that Glover could n't even get himself to give his film any sort of serious attention.<br /><br />Glover said he originally wanted it to be a short film . If only it had been . At seventy - two minutes , the film runs out of imagery and ideas in the first twenty , and it is arguable if the ideas were formulated enough to claim that they were even there for that period of time .
0 I saw his film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival . I am a film student at the Univeristy of Michigan so I know a thing or two about film . And Crispin Glover 's film is outrageous . He basically exploits the mentally challenged . Not only is Shirly Temple the anti - Christ ( which I admit is a little funny ) telling the mentally challenged to kill each other , but there is an obsession with killing snails . Crispin also plays with the idea of being in love with one of his actors who is as they all are , mentally challenged . PETA and Human Rights should be all over this thing . It 's not ' counter - culture ' as Crispin stated at the Ann Arbor Film Festival , it 's exploitation .
0 What Is It ? is a mish - mash of bizarre recurring motifs ( snails , Shirley Temple , swastikas , and overtly racist music , among others ) unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development . The whole thing struck me as self - consciously " freak show , " and I do n't mean only the unusual casting decisions . It has the feel of a bad acid trip , far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to Hunter S. Thompson or William S. Burroughs . The only movie to which I can compare it is Eraserhead ( my second - least - favorite film of all time ) , which was by intent much more depressing , but I still found What Is It ? a total waste of my time . It 's one thing to give me a peek into the inner workings of someone else 's mind -- even someone else 's chemically altered consciousness -- but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness .
0 Eytan Fox , whilst generally leaning on the apologist side of Israeli politics , has made several quite interesting films in the past such as " Walk on Water " and the simply wonderful film , " Yossi & Jagger " . In " The Bubble " , however , he has taken this illogical and unfair approach to the extreme.<br /><br />Far from giving this film a standing ovation , the people at the screening I attended quietly got up and left . I also quietly left , fuming with anger at such a ridiculously one - sided film that translates self - preservation as racist bullying , and racist bullying ( and terrorism ) as outbursts of justified anger ; which implies that Arabs are so wronged by the evil Israelis that they react in anger to a constant stream of one - sided Israeli aggression against them , and that they , therefore , should not be held responsible for their actions.<br /><br />This film was n't worth the money I paid for the ticket ( indeed , I considered demanding my money back ) , and was basically an Israeli apeing of the Palestinian film " Paradise Now " . If you want to be an anti - Israeli , then by all means watch this film , as it really justifies just such a belief system . The fact that this film was made by an Israeli director and , even worse , such a talented Israeli director , is a crying shame . Indeed , just how Israel can be surprised to be regarded as a pariah State when Israelis themselves make such anti - Israel propaganda , beggars belief.<br /><br />What a shameful , horrid little film !
0 " The Bubble " is an effort to make a gay Romeo & Juliet type of story with an Israeli and a Palestinian , although it seems to come at it by way of " Friends " or " Beverly Hills 90210 . " The characters are shallow and trite as are the dialog and plot line . The movie seems torn between fluff and depth . On the one hand there is a pointed effort at being shallow as ( in one example of many ) some minor characters even ask questions that invite development of insight into the conflicts at hand , and get answers like , " Hey , we 're here to make a poster for a rave against the occupation . Do n't get political ! " Beyond the obvious absurdity of such a line , it 's just one of many ham - fisted signals that the movie is just as hollow and insubstantial as its title suggests . On the other hand , the movie 's main pretension to depth follows the lovers to a presentation of " Bent " a play about gays in a Nazi labor camp . The scene on stage is awkwardly rushed , undermining its erotic power ( understandable given the constraints of film - time , but still this could have been edited to much better effect . ) and comes off as flimsily as the rest of the film . Too bad . This play deserves much better.<br /><br />The characters are so one - dimensionally cartoony some even have names that telegraph their entire ( though the word seems inappropriate here ) substance . The aggressive soldier from the crack Golani brigade is named " Golan . " The militant Palestinian is named " Jihad . " The striving - for - chic faghag roommate is " Lulu . " Anyone familiar with the checkpoints and life in Palestine , whether from real life or documentaries will find the checkpoint scenes as absurdly unreal as   well , the rest of this fluffy fantasy . When a Palestinian woman goes into the fastest labor on record Israeli soldiers are solicitous and helpful , an ambulance shows up in minutes . ( The outcome of the birth serves to show the Palestinians as unappreciative of Israeli beneficence and even downright paranoiac . ) Altogether the checkpoint is shown as a mere nuisance , not the series of bone - numbing , soul - crushing , humiliating obstructions with no regard for medical care or necessity in cases of birth , death , or severe illness . Ashraf , the Palestinian lover , seems to get through from Nablus to Tel Aviv with no problems , no papers , no hassles . He just shows up whenever he likes . When the Israelis want to get through it is much more of a challenge involving a scheme worthy of Lucy Ricardo.<br /><br />Against the backdrop of nice , supportive Israelis and surly homophobic Palestinians we move to a resolution that is utterly lacking in motivation or purpose  except as a painfully obvious dramatic device to milk sympathy for the forbidden lovers.<br /><br />Gay Israeli - Palestinian romance has been handled on stage with much more skill and depth as in Saleem 's " Salaam / Shalom " so this film is hardly even as groundbreaking as some people would like to think.<br /><br />Gloriously bad films  like the works of Ed Wood -- at least have some striking idiosyncrasy to distinguish them . This one does n't even have that going for it . Most of the sound track sounds like Simon and Garfunkel on quaaludes , and even with the weird oedipal touches to the gay sex scenes , the general incompetence that pervades this movie plays out like a mediocre TV - movie - of - the - week .
0 This film essentially deals with Inspector Gadget 's arch - nemesis Doctor Claw who has returned after many years to the now - peaceful city of Metropolis . Claw 's plan is to foil Gadget once and for all by using a newer " cooler " crimefighter to help destroy Gadget 's popularity . Sadly the film fails miserably , the series was great , but it was revived nearly 20 years later with tragic results . Without the voice of Don Adams as Inspector Gadget it just does n't cut it anymore ; Dr. Claw is not only visually less frightening , but sounds more like a wrestler with a cold , than his original intimidating self . Granted this is a children 's movie , but the plot is so painfully weak ( heaven forbid I mention the animation ) that it pales in comparison to the original series . Someone has decided to updated Penny as well to bring her two decades up to speed , she now has some quasi - punk rebellious clothing style and does n't play half the role that she did in the TV series . The Gadgetmobile talks , as well as including a plot angle that focuses entire ON talking cars . Maybe I 'm just a kid who loved the show who 's grown up jaded , but I thought that the live - action version was more pain than I could bear , but now they go and spring this complete watering - down of the quality TV series on us . It 's more than I can take .
0 I got this DVD well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday . I do n't know why it took me so long as I do like the Inspector Gadget show and even the new Gadget and the Gadgetinis . While it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie , there are some old things missing that bog this Gadget right down the toilet.<br /><br />First of all the classic Inspector Gadget theme song and music is completely absent . The composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it 's still just no good enough . The Gadget - mobile is now a talking car , not a car that can turn into a van . Plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool . Penny no longer has her computer book and she and Brain hardly make an appearance at all.<br /><br />The plot is non - existent . There 's something about a transformation formula and Doctor Claw using for some never revealed evil but that 's all I got . What the deal was with the short / giant Italian guy I will never know . It had nothing to do with anything.<br /><br />And if the title is anything to go by , his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever . And he stays on the force so why it 's called ' last case ' is a mystery also.<br /><br />I was n't impressed at all . This is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on DVD , but do n't let that prompt you into buying whatever Inspector Gadget DVDs you can . I sold this mere seconds after finally watching it . No kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it .
0 this animated Inspector Gadget movie is pretty lame.the story is very weak , and there is little action.most of the characters are given little to nothing to do.the movie is mildly entertaining at best , but really does n't go any where and is pointless.it's watchable but only just and is nowhere near the calibre of the animated TV show from the 80's.it 's not a movie that bears repeat viewing , at least in my mind.it's only about 74 minutes long including credits , so i guess that 's a good thing.unlike in the TV show , the characters are not worth rooting for here.in the show , you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day , but there , who really cares?anyway , that 's just my opinion.for me Inspector Gadget 's Last Case is a disappointing 3/10
0 Inspector Gadget was probably my all - time favorite 80 's cartoon . I enjoyed both the first and second seasons of the series as well as 1992 's Christmas special " Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas " . Some Gadget fans are quick to criticize the second season ( 1985 ) of the show , but they need to compare it to DiC 's 2002 release of " Inspector Gadget 's Last Case : Claw 's Revenge " for then , they will find the second season to be absolute gold.<br /><br />Being a Gadget fan , I could n't resist the opportunity to see the animated Inspector Gadget in something that was n't Gadget Boy - related . I purchased the film , and I swore to myself that I 'd be objective ; I knew that sometimes artistic liberties would be taken from the original series . I was not even prepared for what I was about to watch.<br /><br />There was barely a shred of the original show still intact.<br /><br />Here is a short list of just some of the cons for this movie : * The humor is non - existent from the original series.<br /><br />*Penny and Brain ( originally having a nearly equal part in the series as Gadget ) are missing from the action for fifteen to twenty minute intervals.<br /><br />*The original music by Saban & Levy is not there , and the score that exists is sub - par . ( Understood that Saban has his own production company now , but at least " Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas " had good music , even without Saban . ) * Do n't expect to see any of Gadget 's gadgets which made the show so endearing , such as gadget - copter , gadget - brella , gadget - mallet , gadget - coat ( which actually was used but it was not even called the same thing ) , as well as his standard other hat and hand gadgets . In this movie , his gadget legs were telescopic instead of springs . That kind of stuff annoys true fans of the show , and simply are n't necessary to change.<br /><br />*The gadgetmobile from the original series is now a fast - talking , supposedly " hip " convertible . All the fans from the original series enjoyed the gadgetmobile transforming into the gadget van and vice versa.<br /><br />*Chief Quimby is now very short - tempered and even mean to Gadget . He was always grumpy in the original series , but this pushes the situation a bit much.<br /><br />*Penny no longer has a computer book.<br /><br />Are there any positives to this movie ? OK , here goes ... <br /><br />*Maurice LaMarche does a good job of taking over for the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget.<br /><br />*In one scene , Chief Quimby alludes to an actual villain from the cartoon series : the Great Wambini ( classic " Gadget " villain from the second season , voiced by Louis Nye).<br /><br />Looking for more redeeming factors for this movie ? Well , you 're out of luck . Life is about making choices and living by those choices . Most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson . The lesson learned here : keep to the original formula ! " If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . " True Gadget fans should steer clear from this movie ; you will surely be disappointed.<br /><br />Hopefully , DiC and Shout ! Factory will continue to release more of the original series after the 2006 release of " Inspector Gadget : The Original Series , Volume 1 , " containing the first 22 episodes of the series . As a true Gadget fan , lover of 80 's animation and many of DiC 's programs , I urge you the viewer to purchase " Inspector Gadget : The Original Series , Volume 1 " and " Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas " DVD 's which are excellent and sure to bring back good memories .
0 Dear Friends and Family,<br /><br />I guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen , then that 's their eternal damnation - just remember kids , " birth control " does n't mean " oral sex " , I do n't care what the honor student says . On the other hand , even if the senator 's aid quotes himself as a " bit of a romantic guy " , he 's still only hitting on a high school girl . If she was my sister , I 'd eat this guys kneecaps.<br /><br />Other than that I found out that Mongolians do n't kiss the same way the French do and that baseball players named Zoo like delicate undergarments.<br /><br />I think I 'd almost rather watch Richie Rich one more time than suffer the indignity of this slip , slap , slop . Thank you , and good night .
0 To be clear from the get go , ' The Bagman ' is very , very , very bad . It suffers terribly in almost every aspect except for one : the finished product is such an awful film that it 's actually hysterically funny to watch . This is a very low - grade film . Budget constraints for the film should be obvious to anyone who watches even just the opening title sequence . I 'm not sure if much of the humour in the film was intended or not . For example , the movie takes place in ' Doomsville . ' Note to all prospective home buyers : if the town you 're moving to is called ' Doomsville , ' keep moving . Stephanie Beaton is quick to pull off her top for a pretty enthusiastic sex scene in the kitchen . I could n't help but laugh because it has intentional humour ( she turns on the gas stove ... get it ? The sex is THAT hot ? get it ? ) and unintentional humour . The unintentional in this case is the music . It 's like the theme music for ' Chariots of Fire ' goes Electronica . Break out the computer and the synthesizers ! I realize that coming up with music for a small production like this is cost prohibitive . I really feel for them because the work here is so well - intentioned . The problem is that cheap music is n't necessarily good music . I have n't laughed so hard at sex on screen since ' Alone in the Dark ' with that ' Seven Seconds ' song ( I guess they were implying that poor old Mr. Slater was a bit ... quick on the draw ? ) . Even the end credits are hilarious . Intentional or not ? You be the judge : a pet dog and cat are part of the credited cast -- and an animal wrangler was on set for them ! -- The boom is credited to ' Mr B. Stick , ' and the 3rd Unit 's wardrobe ( Yep , they had a third unit ) is credited to K - mart . Maybe it 's just me , but I think the hilarity of this more than saves the film . The movie is very , very bad , but the goals of Stephanie Beaton , her friends and family are so well - intentioned in ' The Bagman ' that you ca n't help but like the movie they 've produced . ' The Bagman ' is bad but not dreadful . In its own sweet way , it even manages to be a bit endearing . It wears its flaws so honestly that you ca n't help but forgive them . " Better " films that try to hide the flaws are almost worse in a way . I guess this is just a film that knew who its audience was and was produced accordingly.<br /><br />Watch any number of movies and most of them will probably be a lot better than this . Some of them might look cheaper , or have worse acting , or sillier production value . They may not suffer terribly as ' The Bagman ' does from awful editing , sound , and foley effects . Mr B. Stick did n't do a very good job . The special effects look to be where most of the money went . They tend to be more funny than gruesome , although when the ' Bagman ' is finally unmasked at the end , the make - up job there is surprisingly well done.<br /><br />My 4 out of 10 is a little high but the humour helped a lot . This is an ideal movie to track down some night with a few friends and a few beers in hand . Great entertainment is to be had by anyone who seriously considers themselves B - movie or low budget film aficionados . All others should probably avoid with great prejudice .
0 Any film with a title as ridiculous as " The Bagman " should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie lover , but the plot is far different than what one may expect after viewing the DVD cover . The Bagman is by no means a good movie . It falls into the category of films that seem to have been ( and probably were ) filmed on a home video camera . The acting is awful . I have n't heard and seen such wooden acting since Troll 2 . There are plenty of scenes with nudity and sex , but they are clearly jumped into too fast . The characters are morons and entirely forgettable . The ending ( which I will not spoil ) can be easily anticipated after watching the very first scene . Due to the cheesy nature of the film , nothing aside from the awful production values is truly scary ( awful attempts at realistic gore , a driving scene where the car is clearly stationary , etc ) . Recommended for bad movie aficionados only .
0 We bought this film from a shop called Poundland . We were looking for more inspiration as we have previously bought the film No Big Deal an remade it.<br /><br />We expected this film to be badly inspirational so that we might remake it and put it on the tube . HOWEVER , this was shocking . BORING is the main word that comes to mind . The bad effects and script are n't enough to make you watch it . The main woman 's body seems to be whipped out at opportune moments in a pathetic attempt to keep the viewer interested . However , it just makes you wonder , did they blow the budget getting her to take her clothes off ? If so , I 'd have asked for a refund ! It looks like a homemade film , the shots do n't even correspond with each other and the camera work is so amateur it makes our remakes of bad movies look professional . I CANNOT believe that this is being sold as a marketable product.<br /><br />IT IS JUST BORING and UGLY to watch . The actors are bad and there is no degree of professionalism about it . There are no words to describe how terrible it is .
0 This film is the freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company . While it suffers from a few problems , as every low budget production does , it is a good start for Ms. Beaton and her company.<br /><br />The story is not terribly new having been done in films like The Burning and every Friday the 13th since part 2 . But , the performances are heartfelt . So many big budget movies just have the actors going through the motions , its always nice to see actors really trying to hone their craft.<br /><br />The story deals with the murder(and possible return ) of a disfigured classmate . The others are sworn to secrecy , but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lifes . Ten years later , the friends are murdered one by one by a gruesome stalker known as " The Bagman " . Who will survive ? You have to watch.<br /><br />If you are Roger Ebert or any number of arrogant critics , you probably should n't bother . But if your taste run more towards Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people honing their craft , then check out " The Bagman " .
0 Following the success of the ( awful ) Gilligan 's Island TV movie reruns , a number of TV movies were made in the 1980 's reuniting casts from classic shows . Most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humor that made the shows so special . THE MUNSTERS REVENGE is among the most disappointing because it goes for a Laurel and Hardy - type comedy style that really was n't in the original series . Yvonne De Carlo , a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series , is completely wasted - she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in any single 30 minute episode . And since the roles of " Eddie " and " Marilyn " in this movie are nothing more than cameos , what was the point of making them younger and recasting them ? With very little rewriting , they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest . Although seeing some of the Munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch , I did n't enjoy Sid Caesar as the hammy mad scientist mainly because there 's too much of him and not enough of the underused Munsters ( ironically that very year , 1981 , Caesar 's old partner in comedy , Imogene Coca , was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a TV movie reunion RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES ) . Another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the Munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum . Why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a " typical " ( if strange ) American family , not famous monsters ? This was the last Munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles , there was an awful revival of the series in the late 1980 's with a completely new cast and a 1990 's TV movie which featured DeCarlo , Lewis , Priest , and Patrick in cameo roles as a family dining .
0 96 minutes of this is cruel .. and I love the old Munster 's . Yes , the plot is thing ; yes the lines are trite ; but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan . There is so much ' intrigue ' ( and I use that word with great pause ) that I wonder if it 's an old Starsky & Hutch episode . I lost count of the number of times I noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar . Refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid-60 's ( ludicrous ) the producers simply replace Marilyn & Eddie with younger actors . Why not let them grow and age ? The addition of an Addam 's Family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the Halloween Party.<br /><br />Grandpa & Herman fly to Transylvania and back in a few hours ( preposterous . ) Sid Ceaser is the most , yes the most unbelievable character ( I am including the bad robots ) since he babbles an unwild combination of gibberish & yiddish but claims to be an ancient Arabic ruler . And yes , it looks like the laugh track is missing . In fact , there are several spots where there is dead air , as if the laugh track was to be inserted later . The actors seem to wait on the faux audience . It 's not laughable ; it 's sad . Oh , and the best part ! Yvonne DeCarlo has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were . Marilyn says something like : " Where could Uncle Herman and Grandpa be ? They could have been in an accident . They could have been hit by a car ... or a train ! " Lily says responds with something like : " You 're Uncle Herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track . " What 's amazing about this is : Yvonne DeCarlo 's husband was a stuntman in the early 60 's and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt . He never recovered and this financially devastated her family . ( check out Biography 's fantastic review of her life and career ) This line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to her.<br /><br />If you are a real fan of the Munster 's then you 'll have to RENT this mess . It illustrates how some things are better left alone . Even with the ( nearly ) original cast , this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago .
0 A sad , sad sight indeed is The Munster 's Revenge . The Munsters are brought back one last time(Fred Gywnne received a huge paycheck to come back to the role of Herman Munster)in this made - for - TV movie about a pair of wax replicas of Grandpa and Herman that are robots " terrorizing " the city as preparation for a robbery of a mummy 's stash at an exhibit . With the police on their heels , the two elderly television icons try to find out who is actually behind the crimes in order to clear their names . We get to see them dress in drag as waitresses(a minor highpoint in the film ) , grandpa turns into a bat with attached wire a couple times(one time even flying to Transylvania with Herman somehow invoking his frequent flyer miles I guess ) , and a most annoying relative " the Phantom " constantly sings and breaks glass ad nausium ! What is most sad is hard to pinpoint : is it that Gywnne(especially ) and Al Lewis look so haggard in every scene and so indifferent to the material . Is it the hokey costumes of the robots that have that school production values look about them . Maybe it is the ridiculous script . Sid Caesar 's crazy , mostly unfunny antics . Or perhaps it is seeing something which brought me joy and fond memories as a child being treated to a super K - Mart fashion makeover . At any even , the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even for Munster standards . As for the rest of the cast , Yvonne De Carlo is adequate in a most vacuous role(though showing more cleavage than usual for a woman of her years and experience ) . K. C. Martell makes an ever - so - not affable Eddie Munster . Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn . Bob Hastings as the aforementioned Phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd manner . The film has a real cheap feel about it even for a made - for - TV movie .
0 i saw switching goals .. twice .... and always the same feeling ... you see the Olsen twins make same movie .... they like play different sports and then fall in love to boys .. OK now about the movie .... first off all such little boys and girls do n't play on such big goals ... 2.football does not play on time outs ... 3.if the game is at its end the referee gives some overtime ( a minute or more) ... and the finish is so foreseen .... i think that this movie is bad because of the lack of football knowledgement .... if it were done by European producers it would be better .. and also the mane actors are n't the wright choice ... they suffer from lack of authentic .. OK they played some seasons in full house but that does n't make them big stars .... you have got to show your talent .... and that is what is missing in the Olsen twins
0 Yes , you guessed it . Another movie where identical twins switch places . I think now that the Olsen twins are getting older they should try and make the plot less predictable and less like re - runs of ' Full House ' . If you plan on seeing this film , do n't . Watch ' The Parent Trap ' instead . It 's more entertaining .
0 This movie was definitely not one of Mary - Kate and Ashley 's best movies . I really did n't like it , and I was kind of disappointed in that movie . For some reason , it seemed like it was a movie that they put together really fast . In some parts , it got so boring that I had to fast forward it . It did n't have any bloopers or any exciting parts like their other movies .
0 This movie was awesome ! ! ( Not quite as good as the Leif Garrett masterpiece Longshot ) but still awesome ! ! I thought Ashley looked freakin ' huge compared to Mary - Kate in this film . I wonder why . Who woulda thought they could swith places like that and almost get away with it . Dad was kinda a jerk though and Mom was a little too chummy with Helmit Head . I give it 4 . Any one who likes this movie shoudl check out Longshot .
0 So I finally saw the film " My Left Foot " last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is ... The central performance of Day - Lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing , but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less.<br /><br />The fatal misjudgement in my eyes was that in becoming obsessed with proving the normalcy of this man ; the movie chose to show him as a complete and utter jerk . On the one hand I can see that this is a logical correlation ; mankind always has the capacity to be objectionable , and disability should n't obscure that . I just wish that impartial onlookers would n't be so forgiving of aberrant behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable . They do n't . Acting out is normal , and so yes , disabled people act out - but they do n't do it because they 're disabled ; they do it because they 're being unreasonable . A physical impairment does n't afford you the right to throw a hissy fit in public , just because someone you love turns you down.<br /><br />There are certain things it is unwise to do whether you are disabled or able - bodied . Giving someone tacit permission to boot a football directly at your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them . ( Admittedly , I did once save a penalty from the school 's star striker with my face , but I already belonged by then . It was n't for acceptance . ) Engaging in a bar brawl is another . Revelling in the fact that your father only extends companionship to you after you 've proved yourself capable of metaphorically jumping through physical hoops takes masochism a step too far . All of these things are stupid , and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery does n't make them any less foolhardy.<br /><br />So yes ; just because you 've overcome obstacles to achieve great things does n't make you any less of a jerk ... Being a good person takes priority ; setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down the list .
0 I was utterly disappointed by this movie . I had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations . I expected a drama with more intense character development . But that never happens in the movie . Daniel - Day Lewis is a good actor , but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe . I tought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie . I would rate his performance 6 out of 10.<br /><br />Acting : 6 out of 10 Direction is 5 out of 10 . Script is the worst : 2 out of 10 . < br /><br />I deleted the movie from my DVR at 70 mins . into the movie . Much better movies out there than this ...
0 The novelty of hearing clean - cut Jay Leno spout four - letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formulaic mismatched - police - partners caper . In COLLISION COURSE , the pelican - faced comedian teams up with the late Pat Morita to track down a stolen prototype turbocharger ( think car lover Leno played a hand in the plot ? ) . The two leads try hard , they really do , but Leno is no actor and Morita 's fish - out - of - water routine gets old in a hurry . The film carries a bit of cheesy ' 80s appeal , but its worthy moments become increasingly scarce as it fills out its overlong 100-minute running time . Fans of Leno 's considerable comedic talents will feel let down ; everyone else will just be bored .
0 Collusion Course is even worse than the typical " evil white male corporate capitalist " movie of the week . This movie is less pleasant than a toothache . Jay Leno can act . He 's good in his underrated debut movie , The Silverbears , in which he gives a performance consist with the demands of his character . This movie is so bad Leno 's character , a sanctimonious buffoon , is less annoying than Morita 's character , a sanctimonious fool .
0 There is a reason why Jay Leno himself will not acknowledge this film . It consistently ranks as one of the worst films of all time . The acting is horrible , the script lacks direction and the director himself does n't seem sure on which way to take this film . " A buddy film , " " an action / comedy , " " mystery . " Seems half way through , he gives up , and is just along for the ride . Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated performers . It is a shame that they wasted their time and gifts making this mess of a movie . Jay Leno and Pat Morita prior to involving themselves with this , had spent years pounding out their crafts on the Hollywood circuit . Mr. Morita had already been a star in his own right , acting steadily since the mid 1960s as the star of such cult TV and movie classics as " Happy Days , " and the dismal but affable " Mr. T and Tina . " And won the hearts of America with his roles in the powerful film , " Midway , " " The Karate Kid , " and a host of others . Mr. Leno can been seen on TV shows dating back to the mid 70s . And was a top performer in the comedy clubs of America . He can be seen in countless TV spots and in major films . It is a shame , that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense .
0 This movie is AWFUL . I have n't laughed so hard at a movie that was unintentionally funny in a long time . Leno should 've stuck to stand up and late night tv . The cars in the movie were cool , but the movie by itself is the dumbest movie I 've ever seen . it 's pathetic , the acting is horrible , and the plot could 've been written by a 4 year old . do n't get me wrong , jay leno is hilarious , but not in this movie !
0 This is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre : action comedy . Conceptwise it resembles Rush Hour but completely lacks the action , the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie . Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand - up and as a talk show host , but he just can not act . He is awful when he tries to act tough - he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one - liners which , by the way , are n't very funny . And seeing him run ( even back then ) is not a pleasant sight . In addition , I have a feeling that Pat Morita - at least by today 's standards - does n't give a very politically correct impression of the Japanese . Do n't even get me started about the story . I give it a 2 out of 10 .
0 This dreadful film assembles every Asian stereotype you can imagine into one hideous package . Money grubbing , devious Japanese business men send goofy but loveable policeman Pat Morita to recover industrial secrets in Detroit . Here he encounters a down at heel Jay Leno , who promptly refers to a murder victim as a Jap and calls Morita Tojo . It 's all downhill from there .
0 Mindless dribble about the second coming of Christ in the form of a hippie and albino looking Sandra Locke . You have no idea what 's happening on the screen with the irritating theme song " Suzanne " being played over and over throughout the movie until when " The Second Coming of Suzanne " is over you already know it by hard no matter how hard you try to forget the whole thing.<br /><br />This off - the - wall armature movie maker Logan , Jared Martin , is out to make the movie of the century but is so rude and obnoxious that none in the banking world is willing to finance his project . Planning to go on his own Logan then spots this couple at a seaside café and is fascinated with the young woman Suzanne , Sandra Locke , who reminds him of someone he knew in another life : Jesus Christ.<br /><br />With Logan 's assistant and all around gofer Clavius , Richard Dreyfuss , somehow getting a $ 740,000.00 loan from the bank to finance Logan 's masterpiece he starts to work on Suzanne by flattering her about her talent as an actress in order to get her interested to be in his film . This leads to Suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist Simon , Paul Sand , but later Simon being so depressed and feeling all alone takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brains out.<br /><br />The movie also has two somewhat unrelated sub - plots in it that has to do with a young autistic girl Dorothy , Kari Avalos , who 's cured of her autism by Suzanne after everyone else , at the psychiatric hospital that she was committed to , failed . It 's not really known what exactly Suzanne was doing at the hospital but she seemed to be some kind of orderly or volunteer there ; was this supposed to show us in the audience that she , like Jesus , could miraculously heal the sick?<br /><br />There 's also this newspaper columnist and big time businessman tycoon Jackson Sinclair , Gene Barry , who seems to be either going through a very difficult mid - life crisis or has seen a biblical - like vision that changed his life forever . Sinclair had been searching for the meaning of life as well as what it 's all about all through the movie and wanted to know why there 's all this suffering in the world , like this movie that he 's in , and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid his eyes on Suzanne . Sinclair also got some sense knocked into his head when his private chauffeur David , Mark Rasmusser , who 's gotten sick and tired of his weird and crazy hallucinations almost running him off a cliff in a kamikaze like drive along the Pacific Coast.<br /><br />The movie " The Second Coming of Suzanne " goes on with a number of unrelated sequences , probably to fill or pad in some time by it 's director and film editor , and then goes to it 's final scene in a Christ - like crucification on a hill as Logan has all the cameras rolling . It turns out that the crazed Logan got so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to replicate , on the helpless and tied up Suzanne , the actual crucification of Jesus Christ some 2,000 years ago.<br /><br />Hard to sit through and almost impossible to follow " The Second Coming of Suzanne " puts you through the same kind torture that Suzanne is put through by Logan and the makers of the film . The movie tries to be arty but that 's just an excuse to cover up it 's brainless and non - existent storyline and even worse the terrible and amateurish acting by everyone in it .
0 Richard Dreyfuss is , indeed , in this flick , but in a rather small part . He is NOT the " obsessed " filmmaker - he 's the group 's business manager / accountant . Even the box describes the film inaccurately . There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke , as advertised , unless one uses the term " erotic " quite loosely . I would not have considered viewing the film without Richard Dreyfuss being in it as a major character . I might have , however , had I realized that the famous 60 's anthem , Leonard Cohen 's " Suzanne , " was an artistic influence . Other than the brief recitation of lines from the end of James Joyce 's " Ulysses " , and an interesting visual reference to the end of Ingmar Bergman 's " The Seventh Seal , " I found it a poor attempt to meld symbolic elements and moods immortalized in films like " Last Year at Marianbad " and " Un Chien Andalou . " If you like the idea of the eccentric artistic troupe , there are many superior films , ranging from " Bye , Bye , Brasil " to " Cecil B. Demented . "
0 " The Second Coming Of Suzanne " is yet another one of those surrealistic films that tries to come across as extremely sophisticated , yet all it does is put the viewer to sleep . Like other movies of this type , there is limited dialogue . Everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot . However , the cinematography stinks so there is nothing at all to keep your attention.<br /><br />The video box states that this film is " one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film . " Yeah ... sure . It 's right up there with watching such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking for a mile . 1/10
0 it was and a simpler time ( the seventies ) , a simpler place ( San Francisco ) , where a man could make a simple movie about a drug crazed psychotic re - Crucifixion of Christ as a woman on acid with never ending dream sequences and inter cut flashbacks while having a multi - racial inter gender orgies regardless of financial responsibilities or moral repercussion.<br /><br />this movie , tedious , slow , boring , is the worst example of the kind of pretentious heavy handed art school dreck that passed as art in the midst of the 70 's . and i love it ! once this train wreck of endless slow motion zoom ins and heavy reverbed echo chamber acid guitar licks starts you ca n't take your eyes off of it until the ridiculous and absurd end . its kind of a cross between Jesus Christ superstar , beyond the valley of the dolls , and a really crappy acid trip with your parents on a water bed . its simultaneously a train wreck , completely fascinating , and also a great snapshot of the worst ( or best ) elements of b - grade seventies phychadelic film genre.<br /><br />the plot.<br /><br />I'll just tell you the plot because you will hardly be able to tell what s happening due to the constant cross edited flashbacks to events that may or may not have happened to characters that may or may not be themselves , and the face painted hippy freak nicks endlessly cavorting about in banal sequences of performance art level mime like street theater.<br /><br />"Logan " is a really annoying iconoclast film maker who yells at people allot and is surrounded by a mostly silent film crew who are always dropping acid and having what seem like really bad orgies . Richard Dreyfus has an ancillary role as what seems like the accountant . the film crew seems to hate him for some reason and break out into maniacal laughter perhaps to torment him . " Suzanne " the titular character is a willowy blond who stairs vacuously into space and comforts the totally insane " artist " character . " the artist " is going completely mad , by the way . either from his hamfisted overacting or the incredible awfulness of his paintings . all of course terrible nudes of Susanne . there are some other characters that randomly show up , a cigar chomping " the man " character . who also is all hot for Suzanne i guess . he has a monologue . i could n't really ever figure out what he had to do with the story except everyone had to hate " the man " back then and you could n't make a movie without one . there is also a mute girl . the mute girl pays off in the end trust me , its incredibly stupid .
0 .... because if I was , I may have wished it was me being crucified on a wooden cross ! I 'm still trying to determine the plot of this movie - and I 'm being " generous " that there was even a plot to begin with . As previously mentioned , it 's a misnomer on the cover of the DVD that Richard Dreyfuss is actually the star . He was barely in the movie . And if he was indeed " frustrated " as the back cover indicated he was , well , that 's probably because he said YES to be in this disaster of a movie and could n't get out of it ! The movie really seemed to focus on Jared Martin , and what his role in the movie was supposed to be , other than the extreme close -ups , was not as big of a mystery as to what Gene Barry 's role actually was - or was n't . And speaking of " big" ... whomever had the bright idea to fit Gene Barry in the Humpty Dumpty attire , which showcased his trousers literally pulled up to his chin , should be sentenced to hard time by watching this movie stoned sober . I could go on and on about how horrendous this movie was , from the dialogue not matching the " actors ' " mouths ( think Clutch Cargo ) , to the erratic jumping from scene to scene ( again , being generous even calling the frames of pictures " scenes " ) , to the lack of a plot .... However , if you 're into bad early 70s genre and if you 're in a cottage in Michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of kid & cat pictures , I recommend having a good bottle of wine before you embark on this weird ride of a movie because you 'll be thankful that you may not remember it the next day !
0 Richard Dreyfus is not the star here . He has about three 20 second cameos and what is Gene Barry doing all over this movie ? No idea , the director was probably his brother ! This is a movie that makes no sense whatsoever . The inept writer / director ( same dude ) butchered up everyone 's talent with his horrendous uh ... work . I got the DVD for a penny so ca n't complain ! But it 's weird!And it makes you feel weirded out and in not a good way . This was the 70 's and looks like the director was on a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what it 's like to be inside his head . It has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept , but like a scratched record , it quickly plays foul . It has that " Manson family on acid " vibe to it.<br /><br />I have no idea how the other reviewer got all they did out of this movie ? Maybe they worked in it back when ? At any rate , be prepared to lose 80 + min of your life you 'll never get back . Yes , it 's that awful !
0 This movie was exactly what I expected it to be when i first read the casting . I probably could have written a more exciting plot , it 's a pity that they left it to a pack of Howler Monkeys . Alberto Tomba was surely a good skier but he has to thank God ( and we too ) that he does not have to rely on his actor skills to earn his living . He ca n't play , he ca n't talk , he ca n't even move very good on mainland without his skis ... Michelle Hunziker is a pretty blonde girl , and that 's all . She obviously was n't chosen for her astounding competence in dramatic roles but most probably for her nice legs . Nevertheless I must admit that she could be the Tomba 's acting teacher , because he 's even a worse actor than her , and that 's funny , especially considering that she is n't italian . I laughed all the time , watching this movie . I found it so ridiculous and meaningless that it actually made me laugh , loud , very loud .
0 Probably somebody heard of Alberto Tomba . A former policeman , a former sky champion , and , now , a TERRIBLE actor . " Alex L'Ariete " was planned to be a TV " mini serial " , but the Italian television itself refused to show the movie on its channels . Now it 's a , believe me , ridiculous movie . The script it 's simply hilarious ( it 's supposed to be a dramatic movie ) , something like a 5 years old kid work . But what really blows you away it 's the amateurish acting : Alberto Tomba , who actually was not believable as a policeman himself , plays terribly a totally silly character : a special operations italian policeman specialized in smashing doors open ! ( " ariete " is " ram " ) . This super - guy will try to save a young nice girl life ( an actual italian " little " TV showgirl , married to the singer Eros Ramazzotti ) : nice but absolutely inept in the acting . Lose this one and make yourself a favour . A movie that is a shame to Italian cinema industry : only John Travolta in Earth Attack got close ..
0 A sentimental school drama set in Denmark , 1969 , " We Shall Overcome " offers a pathetic Danish take on US culture . Frits ( Janus Dissing Rathke ) , a flower - power obsessed , naive 13-year - old , exits with half his ear hanging off from brutal master Lindum - Svendsen 's ( Bent Mejding ) office . Lindum - Svendsen , a school director , portrayed as a fascistoid tyrant , has the local community in control . Lindum - Svendsen 's gone too far this time , and with his father , recovering from a mental breakdown ( sure , there was n't enough drama already .. ) , and overly stereotyped hippie music teacher Mr Svale ( ' Hi , call me Freddie ' ) , Frits stands up for justice.<br /><br />Tell you what . It 's so unconvincing , over-(method-)acted , and so full of misery , that as a ' family ' picture this grotesque -filled with cliché's- excuse for a movie fails miserably to convince non - Scandinavian audiences . Sorry , kind danish readers , to crash like this into your sentimental journeys .. But it 's definitely NOT a tale about a ' boy becoming a man by fighting the system ' . The boy never becomes a man , but rather remains a naive , big eyed cry - face . If you call a church of small minded small town folk , led by a dictator like cartoonish character " the system " , I 'm sorry if I 'm missing something.<br /><br />If you 're into family pictures , go see Happy Feet instead ..
0 When the folks at Kino Video assembled their fine " Slapstick Encyclopedia " collection , a multi - cassette selection of silent comedies , someone decided to kick off the first installment with ONE TOO MANY ( 1916 ) , an obscure one - reel farce made in Florida starring the very young Oliver Hardy . As enjoyable as the set is over all , this decision was an unfortunate one , for ONE TOO MANY is a very poor film which almost discourages the viewer from watching further . Like any typical farce , this one involves deception inspired by greed , panic when plans go awry , and complications escalating to the point of absurdity , but unlike the good ones , ONE TOO MANY is incoherent , unfunny , and downright annoying . It 's hard to tell at this point whether the hopelessly confusing plot is the result of missing footage or inept film - making , but whatever the cause , by the halfway point even the most alert viewer has no idea what the character relationships are or what is happening , and by the end one no longer cares.<br /><br />The only point of interest here is seeing the 24 year - old " Babe " Hardy , who appears considerably heavier than he would a decade later when he teamed with Stan Laurel , but who is nonetheless full of youthful energy . In the opening scene , awakening with a hangover , Babe performs a highly athletic backward roll off a bed . Trust me , that 's as funny as this movie gets . If you read this before seeing the first cassette of Kino 's " Slapstick Encyclopedia " I suggest you fast - forward past this one and skip to the good stuff .
0 Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy had extensive ( separate ) film careers before they were eventually teamed . For many of Ollie 's pre - Stan films , he was billed on screen as Babe Hardy ... and throughout his adult life , Hardy was known to his friends as ' Babe ' . While touring postwar Britain with Laurel in a music - hall act for Bernard Delfont , Hardy gave an interview to journalist John McCabe in which he explained the origin of this nickname : early in his acting career , Hardy got a shave from a gay hairdresser who squeezed Hardy 's plump cheeks ( the ones on his face ) and said ' Nice baby ! ' Hardy 's workmates started crying him ' Babe ' , and the nickname stuck.<br /><br />Although much of Hardy 's pre - Laurel work is very interesting -- notably his comedy roles in support of Larry Semon and the Chaplin imitator Billy West -- his teamwork with Billy Ruge ( who ? ) in a series of low - budget shorts for the Vim Comedy Film Company is very dire indeed . Hardy and Ruge were given the screen names Plump and Runt : names which are unpleasant in their own right , but made worse because Ruge ( although shorter than Hardy ) is n't especially a runt . Seen here , Hardy looks much as he does in his early Hal Roach films with Laurel ... but without the spit curls and the fastidious little moustache.<br /><br />'One Too Many ' , an absolutely typical Plunt and Runt epic , is direly unfunny ... and its dreichness is made even more conspicuous by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as ' That 's My Wife ' , one of Laurel and Hardy 's most hilarious films . Plump ( Hardy ) is the star boarder in a rooming - house run by a tall gawky landlady . Runt ( Ruge ) is the porter . Plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle John , whose dosh he expects to inherit . His uncle is coming to see him and to meet Plump 's wife and baby . There 's only one problem : Plump has n't got a wife and baby . He 's been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man . Now , of course , Plump expects Runt to find him a wife and baby on short notice . Of course , the results are disastrous . It would be nice if those disastrous results were funny , but they are n't . Most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick , with characters settling their arguments by shoving each other into bathtubs.<br /><br />SPOILERS COMING . Vim director Will Louis ( who ? ) shows no instinct for camera framing : the actress who plays the landlady is significantly taller than Hardy , and Louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame . This could be funny if done on purpose , but it 's merely inept . At one point in this bad comedy , an extremely tasteless gag is looming on the horizon as Runt approaches a black laundress . ' Surely they would n't stoop THAT low for a laugh , ' I thought . But they do . Runt steals the woman 's black infant and tries to fob this off as Plump 's progeny.<br /><br />Somehow , Plump acquires an infant 's cot , but he still has n't got a baby . With Uncle John coming up the stairs , Plump conscripts Runt for babyhood . This gag might just possibly have worked with a midget , or even with a truly runt - sized actor such as Chester Conklin , but Billy Ruge is only slightly below average height . Ruge 's impersonation of a baby is neither believable nor funny , and Uncle John would have to be a complete moron to fall for it . Amazingly , he does!<br /><br />The most notable aspect of ' One Too Many ' is a brief appearance -- apparently her only - ever film appearance -- by Madelyn Saloshin , Oliver Hardy 's first wife . The marriage was not a happy one , although Hardy 's marital troubles never attained the epic proportions of Stan Laurel 's . < br /><br />Only one thing in this movie impressed me . There is a very brief flashback sequence , with Hardy reminiscing about his seaside romance with a bathing beauty . In 1916 , there was still not yet a standard film grammar for conveying flashbacks : the one shown here is done gracefully and simply . Too bad this movie has no other merits . ' One Too Many ' is definitely one film too many on Oliver Hardy 's CV , and I 'll rate this movie just one point out of 10 . Laurel and Hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them separately .
0 Oliver Hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see Ollie 's new wife and baby . The problem is , they do n't exist -- Ollie apparently made them up ! So , it 's up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family.<br /><br />This is n't a particularly unique story idea , as I 've seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot . The best of these was Bobby Vernon 's DON'T KID ME . It is much better than ONE TOO MANY -- probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later -- when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick . Now I am not against physical comedy , but in some slapstick films , people starting shooting guns wildly , kick and strangle each other , etc . with little provocation . Sadly , at the end of ONE TOO MANY , that 's exactly what they do . None of it makes sense and it was as if they 'd just run out of story ideas.<br /><br />Overall , not exactly a milestone in entertainment . There 's just not enough payoff to merit watching it unless you are an obsessive silent fan like myself .
0 This is the worst piece of crap I have seen recently . There is nothing good about this movie . The plot is plain stupid , dialogs do n't make any sense , humorous scenes never heard anything about the real humor . Actors just do n't play , the worse they do n't even try . The script itself is somewhat which is in the same league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll . There is only one good thing in this flick , the fights . They are well choreographed as one would expect of the Hong Kong guys , and are the only reason to watch Prince of the Sun . Although I believe the fights are just supposed to fill the empty space so that the screenwriter did n't have to bother thinking about the storyline . However , this weak and absurd plot may prevent you from watching it to the end . Avoid it unless you are fan of the dragon lady Cynthia Rothrock .
0 Do n't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series . It is a six hour bore , an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other . There is no heat in this story , no real passion , no real romance . It is a dry , boring , drawn out , and uninspired as they come . And it does n't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency . Take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile .
0 Tom is listening to one of those old - time radio broadcasts , something kids from the 1950s to today would watch on TV . However , they did n't television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio . < br /><br />Tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the " phantom . " He 's actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying , such as " hair standing on end , icy chills race down her spine , her heart beats in her throat , " etc . Jerry , meanwhile , is watching Tom and laughing his butt off at his scaredy- cat antics.<br /><br />We then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194- cartoon in which Jerry tortures Tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure . If the cat asks for trouble , that 's one thing , but when he 's minding own business and Jerry is physically ( and in this case , mentally ) abusing him , I have a hard time rooting for the " little guy." < br /><br />These early T&M efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed . Sometimes that one minute makes a difference . It did here as this actually dragged for awhile . It could have been cut to five minutes without missing anything because the sketches went on too long . That 's usual for Tom and Jerry 's . Usually , they are much faster - paced .
0 Jerry spies Tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis.<br /><br />I did n't find this particular episode that funny : the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame ( Jerry is essentially the ' bad guy ' in this one , tormenting poor Tom for no particular reason).<br /><br />There is the occasional flash of inspiration ( such as Tom 's literal ' heart in mouth ' experience , and the moment when his nines lives are sucked out of his body ) , but , on the whole , this effort lacks the frenetic pacing , excellent animation and sheer wit of most of T&J 's other cartoons .
0 The plot is straightforward an old man living off a main road in woodland one day witnesses a man murdering a child in the woods . Soft For Digging follows the old man 's attempts to try and convince the police that what he saw was not a figment of his imagination . However , there is a problem each time the old man guides the police to where the murder happen no corpse can be found . Soft For Digging has a diminutive dialogue which reflects the majority of the scenes of the film , an old man living by himself in a house . During the film I found that I was scared twice namely when the murdered child abruptly appears before the old man . The rest of the film I have to admit did not engage me ; I found the tempo of the film a little too slow . The limited dialogue was not a problem . However , the development of the story and its conclusions , after watching the film , took too long . I feel more could have been made of the relationship , ghostly encounters , with the child and the old man . Alone in the woods at night unsure of your own mind can lead to some eerie situations , children are always scary as ghosts , see Dark Water .
0 This movie was extremely boring . It should least not more than 15 minutes . The images of child and animal being killed were little bit disturbing.<br /><br />Usually I do n't write comments but this one was so bad having so many good and excellent comments . I think in this case we are one step closer to honest assessment of this title.<br /><br />What more can I say ? I fall asleep during this movie 3 times . It was about 4 hours after I had woken up from 8 hours long sleeping period . I think it is the point itself.<br /><br />There is no dialog between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the very end.<br /><br />When you fall asleep once watching it do not try to rewind and catch up because you will fall asleep again .
0 The thing that really gets me about this movie ( that is , the thing about this movie that makes me physically ill ) is that someone actually paid to have it made . There is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this movie . It is not frightening , it is not thought provoking , it is not entertaining , it is not good . It is a sleeping pill made of cyanide . The DVD case compares it to Blair Witch , Evil Dead , and a few other decent movies , making the filmmaker 's desperation glaringly obvious . It is nothing like any other movie ever made ; it is far , far worse . The claims of an " extremely shocking ending you will never forget " are the equivalent of one ton of stinking horse droppings . Please do not ever waste your time watching this piece of trash , because it may make you sterile . The man who wrote this movie should be wiped off the Writer 's Guild membership list , and never allowed to film anything again . Because if he thought THIS was a movie worth making , he probably does not have much of anything to offer in the future . Zero stars . May Grod have mercy on the soul of anyone unfortunate enough to see this . I am going to go vomit now .
0 This was really a very bad movie . I am a huge fan of Italian Horror , Argento , Mario Bava , Fulci and yes , even our good friend here Lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one . I found the first two ' Demons ' films to be highly entertaining - they were so bad they were great but this one is just so bad that it is really , really bad . It is intensely boring , the story never goes anywhere and I hated the characters - the wife slapping husband and whiny cry - baby pain in the * * * wife drove me mad , there was nowhere near enough of the story devoted to the Ogre who was probably the best actor in the whole film . I turned it off about three quarters of the way through because I was very , very BORED ! Do n't bother .
0 ( aka : DEMONS III)<br /><br />Made for Italian TV although shot in English and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier DEMONS films . It was supposed to be simply titled , THE OGRE , which is how director Lamberto Bava had released it.<br /><br />An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer . The woman ( Virginia Bryant ) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine - cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon - like structure hanging down from the ceiling . It glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it . It drips what looks like green paint.<br /><br />Of course the husband does n't believe any of this . The villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it.<br /><br />But then the OGRE itself appears in what looks like some kind of 16th Centaury costume with what looks like a wolf 's head attached to it and it 's attracted to the scent of orchids.<br /><br />The films is n't really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring . There 's no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool . The OGRE itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family 's Jeep Cherokee . < br /><br />The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was defective , with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film , a flaw I hope Shriek has since corrected . Extras include a short interview with Lamberto Bava where he explains how this was n't a sequel , etc .. etc ... along with some trailers to other Shriek DVD releases . This is pretty standard stuff.<br /><br />3 out of 10<br /><br / >
0 " Demons III : The Ogre " is not related pre - sequel are on " The Demons " and " The Demons 2 are cool hip horror 1980 classic."Demons III : The Ogre " is very stupid , bored , cheap monster . I am very confuse about the writer is " Demons III : The Ogre " ( Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writer and stupid who the bored William Shakespeare ghost or demon 's egg from Spider 's web or what Huhuhuhuhu make the girl dream ) . I am very sorry , very very very very boring movie . I Bought The special DVD box called " Demons " on the 3 different movies called " Demons III : The Ogre " , " The Other Hell " , and " Black Demons " do n't have closed captioned and Subtitles is cost $ 14.99 from Best Buy store in the City of Downey . Why the Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writer who make the stupid movie almost like " Halloween III " do n't have Michael Myer monster but the people wear Halloween . I am very confused . I really love " The Demons " and " The Demons 2 are better the boring stupid " Demons III : The Ogre " is not part for " The Demons " and " The Demons 2 " are same demons.<br /><br />Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre
0 Very low - budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in Central Park , and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm . Although released by RKO , this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution . The cast and crew , with a few exceptions -- among them a young and uncredited Jack Lord , director Edward Montagne and cameraman William Steiner -- are comprised of complete unknowns , and it shows . The performances are universally sub - par and would n't pass muster in a high school training film , the direction is stodgy and choppy and , as mentioned previously , there 's no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors . However , despite the film 's many shortcomings , it does have a few good points . The location shooting in New York City , and the film 's ultra - low budget , gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior " The Naked City " , a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled , and some of the investigating procedures are clever . Otherwise , it 's not much to write home about . It is worth a look , however , for a glimpse at the seamier sections of New York City in the early 1950s , and old - car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of ' 30s and ' 40s cars in the streets.<br /><br />.
0 Edward Montagne 's Tattooed Stranger is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed in for flavor . Instead , it 's a poorly acted , witless look into low budget and uninspired film making . The plot is absurd and the acting excruciatingly stiff and amateurish . John Miles , who had a rather thin resume in the industry , grins and guffaws throughout , and everyone else acts with the same verve as characters in a government - made filmstrip about driver safety . The movie anticipates shows like ' Leave it to Beaver ' and ' Father Knows Best ' in its unnaturally wholesome view of New York in 1950 . Why , the viewer does n't even get to see anyone light up a cig until some shapely woman is interviewed in a flophouse halfway through the movie . The only thing the movie has going for it ( besides its brevity ) is the excellent location shots coordinated by William Steiner . The low budget of the film works in the cinematographer 's favor , as the viewer is treated to well - framed shots of New York City 's interiors and expansive exteriors . Unless you wish to enjoy the film for the choice of settings and camera angles , I suggest watching practically any other movie .
0 This movie is just like every other dutch movie , so if you enjoy movies such as turks fruit and de kleine blonde dood . then you might be okay with this one ( even though those two have much better stories and actors ) Zomerhitte starts strong enough , but even that one good scene ends up having nothing to do with the storyline . There 's a lot of nudity ( but me and others just could not find that girl attractive ) , the dialog is laughable ( as we did a lot to the annoyance of other movie watchers ) , and some of the scenes are so completely random that this is more of an unintentional comedy than anything else ( like a random scene in which an owl rips somebody 's eye out ... it has nothing to do with anything and is only referenced once later in a sentence saying " did you hear what happened ... I was there " ) . the only reason I gave it a 2 is because some of the places they are at look nice ... that 's it . And the reason I saw it was because we went to the sneak preview ( here in Holland we have a strange system regarding sneak previews , you pay less money then for a regular movie and you do n't know what movie it is that you will be watching . All you know is that it 's a new movie that 's not yet in the theaters ) . My advice is to stay far away from this film , if you really want to see a good dutch movie watch temmink or zwartboek .
0 I recently saw this at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film . This is the feature length directorial debut of veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and based on my observation it should be her last . I hate movies that are so implausible that you are picking apart practically every scene . This film immediately leaves you scratching your head . as it begins a young photographer and his girlfriend who works for an international aid organization are having a leisurely drive through the Taliban - controlled mountains Afghanistan having a conversation about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them . They get out of their vehicle to watch as Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers , machine guns , rifles , handguns and grenades execute all five people in the truck . Bob ( Waldemar Torenstra ) starts taking pictures of all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who lobs a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend . since they are with hand throwing distance they ca n't be more than 50 yards away yet he somehow gets away . His girlfriend is blown up and he takes a picture of the moment of the grenade impact that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo . Every scene and situation in this film as as ridiculous as it 's opening . The following year Bob finds himself on assignment for National Geographic on a Dutch resort island where he meets Kathleen ( Sophie Hilbrand ) and inserts himself into her seedy underworld of international drug smugglers . Avoid this film . I would give it a 4.0 out of 10 .
0 This film should have never been made . Honestly , I must admit that before I saw it I had some serious doubts . The director is not a great actress , though she did a lot of movies in Holland , and the young woman who took the main part is a TV - personality with a constant smile on the face and not much self - criticism . The actor who played the other main part I recently saw in Bride Flight and although that film is better , he did not convince me than . To start with the the story , I have not read the novel it is based upon , but the script that underlays the film is something that might have been done with in mind kids having a birthday party on a rainy Sunday afternoon , not someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie . Something really disturbing were the overdubbed dialogues , it was most of the time spoken out loud . My regards go to the cameraman , at least he tried to make something out of it . It is a pity that the film is edited lousy , if not , some scenes were certainly more credible .
0 This production has absolutely no storyline . The acting is embarrassing . The promising Dutch television Sophie Hilbrand star should not add this movie to her CV . Her acting is far from flawless and personally I think she has crossed boundary of professional decency ; relating to the way she exposes herself in this movie . This movie contains too much unnecessary nudity , vulgar sexual scenes and rude language . It also shows a wrong image of the Netherlands ( as most movies do ) . Do not bother to watch this movie : a waste of time , a waste of money and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand , who has proved to be better with her close on on the screen .
0 Sogo Ishii can be a skilled filmmaker under the right conditions , but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival , a scion of the Genji clan . The film - making has the main hallmarks of a low - budget production , including blurry fight scenes and clumsy montages ( the kind you might find in an under - produced dorama ) . The monk Benkei informs his spiritual teacher that his destiny lies in defeating the mysterious spirit that guards Gojoe bridge at night , but he does n't realize that this decision will bring him squarely into conflict with nearly every element of society at that time - but which could earn him enlightenment . < br /><br />There 's no absence of ambitiousness , however , in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the worldly . Artsy flourishes in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose film - making style . < br /><br />A disappointment .
0 I basically picked up this movie because I had seen Kitano Takashi 's brilliant remake of Zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated samurai tale which also starred Asano Tadanobu . These two movies are worlds apart . Zatoichi added humor and depth to its characters and subverted traditional samurai movie clichés . Gojoe goes off the deep end in the other direction.<br /><br />First off , I hate movies that have other characters inform the audience what the main character is like instead of having the character develop over the course of the movie . " You can not decide whether you are a monk or a warrior " says almost every character in Benkei 's presence , yet this inner turmoil is barely conveyed within the character himself . Instead of character development , we get bloated , boring , gory battle scenes . Asano 's character is undeveloped and even he looks like he is bored and does n't know what he is doing there . I know that he usually looks distant and cool and that is part of Asano 's appeal , but this movie does n't serve him.<br /><br />A lot of the camera movement is nauseating . There is a scene that goes on forever in which the camera spins around the main characters until my wife and I felt like vomiting . The ending is ridiculous and rather anti - climatic . < br /><br />Its too bad that really good samurai movies are n't being made in Japan nowadays with this type of budget . The colors , scenery , and costumes were great , but the rest is just a loooong waste of time . I would rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth .
0 * * SPOILERS**This was an ugly movie , and I 'm sorry that I watched it . Like Jan Kounen 's Dobermann , it suffers mostly from poor editing -- or lack of it . It is as if the director was so in love with his work that instead of cutting the movie down to a pace that kept your attention , he added all of the footage he had shot together . There are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie . One of them is * SPOILER * when Benkei is petrified and the camera starts spinning around him . That was cool -- but okay , we got it ! Move on please ! The camera wo n't stop spinning around this guy ! There 's maybe one or two more cool scenes that I forgot about in this flood of mediocrity , but the last duel scene IS NOT ONE OF THEM ! It may be because unlike in the earlier sword - handling scenes , Shanao is n't masked -- but just because the director could n't find a stuntman who somewhat resembled Asano Tadanobu does n't give him the right to go ahead and make up 80 % of the sword fight with extreme close - ups of sword clashes ! And all from the same angle , may I add . The director should learn from the American produced 1995 bullet - train ninja movie The Hunted ! I personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social activists of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent demonstrations of their college years . The situation where innocence is oppressed by an authoritative and armed branch of the government unwilling to understand seems to be a message common in the Japanese media , due to the strong influence of socialists and communists who are a political minority . The movie versions of GTO and Salary Man Kintaro are two other recent examples * END SPOILER * I do n't understand . I just do n't understand why people who do n't speak the language of the movie find praise worthy material in this . Maybe the worst was lost in the translation.<br /><br />The ending of the movie -- on which marketing played a lot , is a different interpretation of the legendary encounter between Shanao and Benkei . But that legend is not the most popular in Japanese folklore , and it is so detached from contemporary themes , that after 138 minutes of over played visual techniques , who cares how the director wants to re - interpret the story ! ? Director Sasaki Hirohisa of Crazy Lips said that there was an unpleasant trend among new Japanese directors to ignore Japanese audiences , and target their movies for foreign film festivals -- in order to gain faster international fame . This works , although it does n't make sense , because the point of an international movie fest is to introduce to the world what kind of movies are being made in other countries - what kind of movies people WATCH in those countries . Certainly not Gojoe and the like .
0 this is seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen . i love Japanese movies , and i think another film by the same director , electric dragon 80,000 v , is a masterpiece . i really wanted to like this movie - asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing . but i could n't find anything entertaining about it.<br /><br />the movie takes forever for nothing to happen . and the effects the director used - like the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion - merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind - bogglingly slow and the actors were heinously overacting . a lot of the boredom was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary - like an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he does n't worship anything . this added nothing to the plot . a fellow Japanese film buff and i were both checking the time constantly . we could n't believe this film was as terrible as it was . and the finale was awful . i thought the director would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this , but sadly i was mistaken .
0 The central theme in this movie seems to be confusion , as the relationships , setting , acting and social context all lead to the same place : confusion . Even Harvey Keitel appears to be out of his element , and lacks his usual impeccable clarity , direction and intensity . To make matters worse , his character 's name is ' Che ' , and we are only told ( directly , by the narrator ) well into the film that he is not ' that ' Che , just a guy named Che . The family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film , and once defined , the family is divided - the younger generation off to America . So cliché . Other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boy 's family ; however the political stance of the director is murky at best , and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed . So they lost their property ( acquired by gambling profits ) - so what ? Refusing to take a political stand , when making a movie about the Cuban revolution , is an odd and cowardly choice . Not to mention the movie was in English ! Why are all these Cubans speaking English ? No wonder they did not get permission to film in Cuba . And if family life is most important to look at here , it would be great if we could figure out who is who - we are ' introduced ' to them all in the beginning - a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film ! The acting was mostly shallow , wooden , and unbelievable , timing was off all around . The ' special ' visual effects were confusing and distracting . References to American films - and the black character as Greek chorus - strictly gratuitous , intellectually ostentatious , and consistently out of place . I only watched the whole movie because I was waiting for clarity , or some point to it all . It never happened .
0 I am probably one of the few viewers who would not recommend this film . Thought visually stunning like all of Ang Lee 's work ( each still frame seems worthy of a print ) , I was really disappointed by the film 's disjointed pace . It really was too long.<br /><br />The story is set in Civil War era Missouri , and is about a young man ( Roedel ) who joins the feral forces of the Bushwackers , sort of renegade Confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the Jayhawkers , their Union counterparts . He and his close friend , Jack Bull Chiles played by Skeet Ulrich , join the group after Chile 's father is shot point - blank and his home is burned , presumably by Jayhawkers . The story follows Roedel 's and Chiles ' raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war , including former slave who fights for the Bushwhackers ( Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright ) , and a war widow played by Jewel.<br /><br />It seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point , it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped . For example , the agitation among Roedel 's group caused by former slave Holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol , and then dropped until later in the movie . A young villian / bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs much angst and violence against him , but , we never know why . Some of the characters never seem to surface ; I think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history.<br /><br />The historical detail was excellent . I loved looking at the housing , furniture , clothes , etc . , and I thought the lead actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters , though they stumbled a bit with the dialog . Unless you really enjoy history or are a huge Ang Lee fan , though , take a pass on this one .
0 Okay .. this was n't the worst movie I 've ever seen , but I had heard lots of good things about it and I was sorely disappointed . I could see where the film makers were coming from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle were n't a whole lot different from one another , that the individuals were getting lost in the fighting , etc , etc . ( well , that 's my presumption , anyway = ^_^=)<br /><br />At any rate .. the movie kind of bored me . I 've watched a lot of really long movies , but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on .. basically because I just could n't bring myself to care for any of the characters . I just kept thinking .. who cares ? ? ? I also found the acting to be rather dead pan and the dialogue strained . I understand that this was the 1800s and all , but most of the conversations just seemed rather unnatural . No one seemed to have any emotion throughout most of the film except during melodramatic events.<br /><br />The " romance " in the story did n't seem to be supported by anything other than " I 'm a guy and you 're a girl " , which I do n't consider much of a romance , and yet I felt I was being steered to the belief that these people were in love . Oh well .. I guess it 's the whole " all this horror around us , we have each other to cling to " type thing , or whatever . I was also hoping for some sort of dynamic between the two best friends ( who both initially seemed to have an interest in the girl ) but that was just sort of dropped . Maybe avoiding a cliche love triangle . I do n't know.<br /><br />Oh well .. Daniel Holt was about the only character I really truly liked . And Sue Lee was all right . I did n't exactly dislike Jake , but he seemed a bit too ... spineless , I guess . Jack Bull I did not care for at all . And I 'm pretty sure you 're * supposed * to hate just about everyone else , with the exception of the poor normal people who just get mowed down left and right . It was pretty graphic and had that whole " the horrors of war " thing down , but I 've seen plenty of other movies with the same theme , done better . ( I enjoyed The Patriot a lot , for instance , even if it was a bit emotionally manipulative ) But , as I 've already stated , I 'm a cynic . What can I say ? :)
0 I am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a ho - hum event . Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film , probably the most intriquing figure of the period . Frank James was never mentioned , Cole Younger , ditto , and Bloody Bill Anderson , who would weep for his murdered sister every time he went into battle was completely absent in the script . Instead we were forced to watch fictitious characters that never developed into anyone we cared about . how sad . The costumes were wonderful however , as was the location shooting in Missouri . I hope Ang Lee will make another film from the period and try again , or some other film maker will look into the tremendous wealth of material to write a screen play on .
0 This movie was two and a quarter excruciating hours . Someone please tell me what the point was?<br /><br />I mean , I understand the historical setting . It 's supposed to be about a ragtag group of Confederate bushwhackers ( terrorists ? ) on the Missouri - Kansas frontier , taking revenge against all northern sympathizers and abolitionists during the U.S. Civil War . But aside from gratuitous violence there was n't really much of a point to this movie . Perhaps it was a political statement ? That war is really nothing much more than gratuitous violence ? If that was the point it was done quite well , but I do n't think that was the point . I think the producers really thought they were making a worthwhile movie here , but as far as I was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot . It seemed like I was watching a paperback novel come to life , with the characters looking like what you would see on the covers of such novels.<br /><br />This movie should be burned along with some of the towns this gang torched !
0 This was a new alltime low among westerns . The writing is excruciatingly bad , characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland , the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed . And Tobey Maguire shows us the flip side of his talent , sleepwalking through his part with those expressionless eyes and that raspy voice of his that here betrays only mannerism . ' Ride With the Devil ' is among my five worst movie experiences ever , a western never to be surpassed in the negative respect .
0 Long on action and stunt work , but so short on character delineation and development that it failed to hold our interest . Not always easy to figure out which side a character is on and who 's doing what to whom .
0 I wish more movies were two hours long . On the other hand , I wish more American Civil War movies were MERELY two hours long . " Gone with the Wind " , " Gettysburg " - that 's about the length I 've come to expect ; although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted ; and even " Gettysburg " lasted as long as it did because things HAPPENED in the course of it.<br /><br />By contrast Ang Lee 's film is bloated and uneventful . It actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours . That was n't a compliment . It 's really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation : at the time it feels as though it will never end , afterwards it seems to have taken no time at all.<br /><br />The film gets off on the wrong foot , as Lee plays his interminable credits OVER the opening footage ( bad mistake ) in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe . The central two are Jake , the son of German immigrants who are staunch supporters of Lincoln , and Jack , an equally staunch Southerner whose values Jake shares . ( I had to re - read that sentence to make sure I had n't written " Jack " instead of " Jake " at some point or vice versa . ) The two go off to become " bushwhackers " - Southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they ca n't even be bothered to join the official Southern army , which I presume they think is for sissies . I 'm afraid Lee lost me right there . It 's easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes : if we have some independent reason to like them , or feel as if we know them in some way , then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more . Not so here . We are n't properly introduced to Jake for at least an hour ; when we are , it becomes clear he 's a gormless pimple of a man , who is n't a confederate by choice so much as by habit - the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does , whose psychology is purely immitative . The people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way . I found myself cheering whenever the Northern cavalry appeared on the screen . I thought : good - kill the rebels , end the damned war , let me go home.<br /><br />Aggravating this problem is the horrible , horrible dialogue . Everyone speaks in the same whining Southern accent . I 've heard accents from all over the English - speaking world and this is the worst of them all . I do n't care if Southerners really did talk like that , it 's simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours . And believe me , we do listen to it for the full two hours : Lee 's picture is a talky one , largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical , say - everything - three - times , folksy drawl . It would help if they talked faster , but not much . Ca n't these people find a more efficient language in which to communicate?<br /><br />In short : the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life , who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech , who do n't bathe often enough , to whom nothing of interest happens , despite their being involved in a war . Good points ? Jewel was nice to look at , and so was the scenery . But I have complaints even here . The cinematography , nicely framed , looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake ; and as for Jewel , we were teased with her body , but never actually allowed to gaze upon it , which I think is the least we were owed .
0 How does a Scotsman in a kilt make love in the bonny purple heather ? Very , very carefully . Now I have the distinct advantage over many other of the reviewers in that I was born in Scotland . Far too many Americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously . It 's a joke , people,"four legs good - two legs bad",as Orwell had it . Jessica Lange has an accent that the Wells - next - the - sea Amateur Dramatic Society 's production of " Brigadoon " would turn down . Liam Neeson - apparently popular with the ladies - wears his kilt with all the authority of a man whose Great Grandmama once stepped off the train at Edinburgh Waverley . And the Auld Enemy?Where would the Scots be without them to hate and blame for everything?Messrs Roth , Cox and Hurt should be ashamed for indulging in such racist stereotyping . " Robin Hood - Prince of thieves " seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy in comparison . And at least Alan Rickman was funny .
0 Born , raised , and educated in Scotland , I was appalled at this disgusting portrayal of a man who was no more nor less than a cattle rustler . Worse yet , the thread of the entire movie was sex in one form or another , by implication or verbally . To view it , one would think that 18th century Scotland was populated by a bunch of sex perverts and homosexuals . Lange was a joke acting as the " young " mother at age 49 but Liam Neeson was even worse ! Taking a " bath " in a Scottish loch is NOT commonplace as they portrayed him - but , it did give them yet another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually driven we were . Save your money and watch Pinnochio .
0 This movie was a long build - up with no climax . People whom refer to the swordfight in the end as great must either be out of their minds , or have none . Way too often this movie got soft . I am not saying that soft movies are bad . But no matter how fond you are of sugar it should have no space on a T - bone steak . This movie was supposed to be about vengeance for crimes committed against a culture , but it ended up being a petty bar - brawl . And there was only one of them who actually knew what a sword was ; Tim Roth 's character ( and yes , he plays him well ) . Rob Roy was a weak " hero " with no knowledge of how to use a sword , and the way he " won " was a disgrace . As a drama this movie had it 's periods , but the best performance in it has to go the nature of Scotland . This is one tad breath short of being termed as " soap " in my book .
0 I have to say the first I watched this film was about 6 years ago , and I actually enjoyed it then . I bought the DVD recently , and upon a second viewing I wondered why I liked it . The acting was awful , and as usual we have the stereo - typical clansmen in their fake costumes . The acting was awful at best . Tim Roth did an OK job as did Liam Neeson , but I 've no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking.<br /><br />The plot line was good , but the execution was just poor . I 'm tired of seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films . Braveheart was even worse though , which is this films only saving grace . But seriously , people did n't speak like that in those days , why do all the actors have to have Glaswegian accents ? Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes . I notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the Americans , and to be honest I can see why they 'd like it , I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts . However , if you are thinking of buying the DVD , I 'd say spend your money on something else , like a better film .
0 Here is one of those movies spoiled by the studio 's insistence on a happy ending . Conflicts which have stretched out for years are settled in a few minutes . It would have been far more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity . The talented Barbara Stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and assertive woman to a compliant female of the kind she has put down all her life . Brent , as usual , is well over his head and then there is the ludicrous situation of Gig Young playing a character named Gig Young . Someone mentions " Gig Young " and then who appears but Gig Young , the actor ! Worth seeing though far below what it could have been .
0 Spoiler alert  although I think this one was spoiled coming out of the can   It 's hard to even imagine that a film with these stars , from this studio , made at this time period , could be so awful , but it is . It is the film 's biggest flaw by far that it just does n't make any damn sense.<br /><br />Rich widower American aristocrat Penn Gaylord leaves his small daughter " in charge " and goes off to World War I where he is killed . Then we flash forward to present day ( 1942 ) and total confusion . The three sisters are in court where they are said to have spent the last twenty years , and some jerk named Barclay is trying to take their home away from them . This is just the beginning of an endless series of unanswered questions that comprises the script , more holes in it than The Warren Report . What happened to the Gaylord fortune ? If the will is worth half a billion , why has the family home gone from an opulent palace to the house on The Munsters ? Who the devil is this Barclay clown ? And why is he able to take someone 's home away from them ? The questions just pile on top of more questions.<br /><br />The usually affable and charming George Brent is playing Barclay , who is inexplicably a total sod tromping all over everyone , taking whatever the heck he wants no matter who it belongs to and without a twinge of guilt ; yet no one besides Fiona ( Barbara Stanwick ) seems to particularly dislike this cretin . Why ? None of these questions are ever answered . We instead just follow Fiona 's life from one train wreck to another , the evil Barclay takes away her home , her fortune , and even her child . What does she do ? Shoot him ? Set him on fire ? No , too logical . In a completely improbably wrap - up , this woman , who 's only prior romantic involvement with Barclay was , save for the technicality of marriage , rape , suddenly decides mid - sentence ( literally ) that she does not hate him , she loves him . And they 're going to live happily ever after . All of a sudden for no reason in the world , this early female role model of independence and authority is transformed into the usual helpless ankle - twisting twit more commonly found in films of this era . Yeah , sure , steal everything in the world that belongs to me and I 'll fall in love with you . On what planet does that happen ? I can only guess the reason I never heard of this film before I happened to catch it on Turner is that it was as lost on contemporary audiences as it is today .
0 When I 'd seen the name of this movie , I 'd always thought it was a musical . Like " The Harvey Girls . " It 's not . It 's a pudding that overcooked , hit the kitchen ceiling , and was pried off and cobbled together . No music and not a period piece but thoroughly improbable.<br /><br />It starts with patriarch James Woods telling the eldest of his three daughters , a small child who grows to be Barbara Stanwyck , that she must maintain the family name and home.<br /><br />We thus think it is going to be a historical intergenerational tale . And it is , for a brief time . Then it turns into the story of cold - hearted Stanwyck 's fight against lawyer George Brent . Why is she so dead set against him ? Well , why else ? As we learn in a strange flashback sequence narrated by Stanwyck , she had once thought she could inherit some money ( for her sisters as well as herself , of course ) by marrying . She hit on someone she took to be a country bumpkin , who was in fact budding lawyer Brent.<br /><br />Lest anyone think the child they had , a young man of eight or so at the time of the main plot , is -- well , you know ... They had a hasty marriage and during the very short time they were together , he was conceived.<br /><br />One of her sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Young , who is played by Gig Young . The other sister tries to take him away . Etc . , etc.<br /><br />It is a shrill , unengaging mess -- well enough acted but without a shred of logic or plausibility .
0 I do n't think you can get much worse then this . Put together bad actors , fake limbs , and three stupid stories and what do you get ? This B - rate pointless excuse for a movie.<br /><br />The first story immediately shows the bad video quality and the acting is just really pathetic , especially when you bring in the 25 year old posing as a grandma with the usually grandma bun over the ears bit . Plus , the man is OK , but the woman is rather ugly . " You look great ! " NOT ! The werewolf in this one was the best one out of all three I 'd say , but its still not impressive since it was all bad costume . The face on the woman later was decent enough for halloween but not for a werewolf movie.<br /><br />The more stories you go through the worse it gets . There are two lesbians in this next one who are completely retarded its ridiculous . The whole " I want to be a werewolf , too " " How could you do this to me ? ! " Was silly to say . You asked for it now get over it ! The werewolf will not even be spoken of ... its a rat!<br /><br />The third one has no point ... almost forty five minutes of running and boring narration make up this story and the whole switch thing still did n't make it interesting . Boring!<br /><br />Music , Yes , bad ... who could n't even hear some parts it was stupid . Animals effects were either rat or pig - like which was stupid . They could n't use lion sounds ? Guess not , GOOD movies use that . Well , i = f you enjoy B - rates this is good for you . I got this movie since I 'm a hardcore werewolf fan and i 'll buy ANY werewolf movie and watch it more then once , but that s just me . If you prefer Good ones , do n't waste your money . I beg YOU !
0 From the blocky digitised footage to the acting that makes Keanu " I 'm so wooden I could be a Plank me " Reeves look like an Oscar winner this film bites ( pun not intended ) . The best thing about it is the box of eRATicate in the 2nd segment ( which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and ' twist ' ) . Wish I 'd spent the £ 3.99 it cost me on something else , like erm .... Natural Born Killers : Directors Cut . If you do buy this , you 're really in for a disappointment , do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague . If you 're looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a 2x4 then go ahead . However if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere , like Dog Soldiers , Wolfen , Romasanta : The werewolf Hunt .
0 I wo n't spend a lot of time nor energy on this comment . I just want to add it because all the comments were so positive I felt like I just had to let people know that not everyone is so thrilled , let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt at creating a captivating philosophical cinematic enigma . Some scenes seemed promising , playing with visual dimensions , but could n't hold up the rest . I felt like I was stoned for the first time again , having semi - philosophical conversations with fellow adolescents.<br /><br />What a futile attempt to raise Dutch cinema to new heights . I 'd rather watch Jesus is een Palestijn , without all the pretentions and with straight forward humor , also raising questions about life and the realities we create for ourselves.<br /><br />Gert de Graff is not Jean - Luc Godard or Tarkovsky and appearantly never will be .
0 Although properly warned I actually sat down to watch this movie . In part because I usually give every movie an even break , and because I thought that a single movie could n't be that bad . I stand corrected . Not even George Kennedy , Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks . Only once during this humor forsaken travesty of a spoof did I laugh . Namely during the Simon says scene . The other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny . And some of them you actually see coming a mile away . This movie just has n't got what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane ! ( I+II ) , Naked Gun ( I+II+III ) , or Scary Movie . They all had A. funny gags , B. good dialog and most important of all C. unforgettable quotes . Men In White has got D. none of the above . To call this movie bad would be a gross understatement . AVOID THIS MOVIE ANYWAY YOU CAN ! CONSIDER YOURSELVES WARNED !
0 This film is so bad , it made me want to vomit . Poorly produced , a complete laugh free zone . Why in the name of god would you spoof a movie which to a degree is a spoof ( and a damn funny one at that ) as it stands ? The sets are laughable , the effects so bad that they are n't even laughable , and the acting farcical . It is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this lump of garbage . National Lampoon once made Animal House , which people still consider to be completely and utterly hilarious . Now they 've been relegated to making TV movies like this lump of * * * * . Name your expletive , and it could be accurately used to describe this film .
0 I wished I 'd taped MEN IN WHITE so I could watch it again < br /><br / > " What ? You mean you really enjoyed it Theo ? " < br /><br />No I mean I could watch it again to see if it was as retarded , stupid and as embarrassingly unfunny as I can remember it < br /><br />A lot of people have claimed it was made for children . May I suggest it was also made by children ? because the whole structure of the script lacks any type of discipline on the part of the producers and writers and much of set pieces seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time < br /><br />The cast do n't help but I genuinely started to feel sorry for them . Honestly you can believe that during filming the cast had to lie to their families that they were filming a hard core porn film such was their embarrassment at having to appear in something as dismal as this . To give you an idea of how bad the acting is every time BAYWATCH babe Donna D'Ericco disappeared from the narrative I waited patiently for her to reappear then seconds later I forgot she was in the movie . Got that ? A star from BAYWATCH appears and seconds later you forget they 're in the movie . This tells you all you need to know about the standard of MEN IN WHITE < br /><br />Fair enough it 's trying to be a live action cartoon similar to THE GOODIES ( Although THE DISMALS would be a better adjective for this movie ) , though perhaps the movie deserves some credit for never descending to toilet humour , but considering this is a kids movie ( This did n't stop ITV broadcasting it at 11 pm ) then there should be no near the knuckle humour in it anyway
0 If you see this turkey listed in your TV guide , AVOID IT LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />A steaming great pile of fetid dingoes kidneys does n't begin to describe how bad this movie is ! There is only one funny scene ( the memory eraser scene ) but even that rates only .001 on the laughometer ( out of 1000 ) . Whoever wrote this turkey should be banned from writing another movie for their entire lives .
0 Well , not yet , at least.<br /><br />It 's not listed in the worst 100 ... <br /><br />So let 's all team up , and put it in it 's rightful place.<br /><br />This is truly a bad movie . ( And I liked Ishtar ! ) ;)
0 If you really , truly want to waste two hours of your life , do the following : < br /><br />1 ) Look through the TV listings . 2 ) Find the movie ' Men in White ' . 3 ) When ' Men in White ' comes on , sit and watch.<br /><br />And that 's it . After sitting through two hours of bad puns , dreadful ( and not that funny ) movie references , and experiencing something with possibly the lowest production values ever made in recent history , you will have wasted two hours of your life , and wonder exactly why.<br /><br />Why did I do this ? I was stupid enough to think that this film might actually be some good . It wasn't.<br /><br />But , on the other hand , if you 're old enough to remember Power Rangers , you might spot some familiar faces during the film . Presumably to save on production costs , Saban ( who also make Power Rangers ) , decided to liberally sprinkle old monster costumes from everyone 's favourite tacky toy - spawning franchise throughout the film . I spotted quite a few old monsters from episodes I saw from when I was a kid , so I guess it could at least be said it has some nostalgia value.<br /><br />But , if you want to see actual Power Rangers monsters , go watch Power Rangers itself . It 's much better than this piece of garbage . ( And that 's saying something ! )
0 I may have seen worse films than this , but I if I have , I do n't remember . Or possibly blocked them out . Who knows , if I was to undergo hypnotherapy , I may remember them , along , maybe , with been abducted by aliens as a child , or other traumas . If so , I would happily exchange those memories for the ones I have of watching this film.<br /><br />I should give the film some credit : It did produce an emotional response . I actually started to become angry at scenes that spoofed other films and TV programs , that this travesty was dirtying them by association . I am terrified that I may be unable to watch films like Dr Strangelove again without this film flitting across my minds eye .
0 I watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else on , it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painful . I urge anyone to watch this just to see how turgidly awful a movie can be , surely it was deliberate . I cringed at every futile attempt at humour carried out in such a childish , unrehearsed , badly executed way that it was beyond belief . This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like Goodfellas , think I am exaggerating ? Well give it airtime and think again . Dreadful , utterly dreadful . If this was n't a prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and promptly shot after being forced to watch this film again .
0 Words fail me . This film was extremely difficult to watch and in hindsight I really wish I had n't done it . Although I attempted to sit through it until the end credits I have to admit I could n't last for more than hour , so my opinion could be unfair . However , this film would require the most impressive final third in the history of film - making in order for it to be given a review which is anything but vicious.<br /><br />Please do not watch any part of this film .
0 This ' Movie ' has to be the biggest pile of steaming C*^p I have ever < br /><br />seen , What more can I say than BAD , BAD , BAD , BAD , BAD , BAD . There is NOTHING to save this ' movie ' and I pray that they NEVER even talk about making a sequel . If you are thinking about watching this then you should know that the storyline is that two garbage men get dragged into saving the earth . Movies like Men in Black has been torn to shreds and put back together to make this ' Comedy ' but have TOTALLY failed . Please avoid this movie , ( save yourself ) .
0 You should know that I am the type of person that watches even the worst of movies to the finish , often out of sheer morbid curiosity . I even watched Leprechaun to the end before giving in to the temptation of tearing out my eyes and stamping on them . You should also know that this movie was in my VCR for less than half an hour before I made a frantic leap for the stop button and dashed back the rental store just to put as much distance between me and it as possible .
0 < br /><br />A friend of mine enjoys watching the worst films he can possibly find , and I have a good laugh watching them with him.<br /><br />I have told him if he puts this one on again I will be forced to give him a good kicking.<br /><br />He knows I am serious!<br /><br / >
0 Why did I waste my time with this movie ? There was not a single funny joke or line throughout . The slapstick was n't even mildly funny . I mean really , an out of control vacuum sucking pipe ? Why has the National Lampoon 's name been attached to this movie ? Even Christmas Vacation was better than this ( I actually thought that film was very funny).<br /><br />AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE !
0 I only lasted 15mins before self preservation jerked me out of the empty eyed drooling stupor that this film effortlessly induced and propelled me screaming back to the video shop armed for bear.<br /><br />To say the film was bad would be a missed opportunity to use words interspersed with characters from the top keys on my keyboard ( just to keep these comments clean).<br /><br />One to be avoided.<br /><br / >
0 it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing . The first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go . You should n't really decide to watch this based on my review or not . I saw so little of it I should n't even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was sniggering at us paying money to see it.<br /><br />Couldn't they have just made Earnest does Dallas ?
0 In the title I write that the story is ludicrous . below I 'll elaborate and tell you why it , in my humble opinion , ruins this movie.<br /><br />Gere and Danes are doing their jobs , and while it 's not their best work , it 's quite OK . The rest of the cast , though , is doing a really poor job . Mind you , this is not entirely the actors fault . The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room in the movie to really give any depth . All other characters have either too little room in the movie to create any depth , or the character is such a cliché that it does n't matter how hard the actors try.<br /><br />The director has a bit of a Se7en complex , but looking merely at the direction , I think he does an OK job.<br /><br />But the story . This is the kind of script that is bad in two ways . First of all it 's a bad movie script . The characters are shallow ( except for Gere 's and Danes ' characters ) , the villains are clichés and the actions of the characters is totally unbelievable . Besides this , the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years . It 's the kind of movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals , regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them . It 's also the kind of movie that says , albeit only between the lines , that every form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial , judge or jury . And of course , according to the movie , everything that is not sex in the missionary position by a married couple is a sexual deviance.<br /><br />So , if you 're going to film school and need an example of a bad script , or if you 're writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost . See it . For everyone else , I recommend another movie .
0 Although THE FLOCK has some pretty good acting by veteran Richard Gere , and some okay shots that might harken some back to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS days , the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere.<br /><br />The film is about Erroll Babbage ( Gere ) who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire . His office thrusts upon him his replacement , Allison Lowry ( Claire Danes , STARDUST ) , who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with his job . And that job ai n't very fun . He monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction . Allison goes with Erroll on many calls to check up on his " flock " of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement . But Erroll is good at his job even if his methods are n't . He taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them . Erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants ' pasts . It is this " good justification " that challenges the audience on some level , letting us see how brutal Erroll is and yet how out - of - touch he 's become ( by being too close to his job).<br /><br />When a teenage girl goes missing in Erroll 's " area " , he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock . But how could he know ? Is Erroll that good at his job ? Allison challenges him and Erroll pushes back . Their battles become as fierce as Erroll 's need to find this missing girl.<br /><br />Although the set - up for the story was okay , it did n't have any umpf ! I will give credit to Richard Gere , however , who plays the Erroll character very well . Battling retirement . Worried about everyone who 's near his flock . Disgusted with those he 's responsible for overseeing . Disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does . Quite a change in character portrayal for Gere . But beyond him there 's not much else . Some of the sets are okay ( dark and dangerous ) but there are so many other problems as to be laughable.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films . But that suspension has limits . The biggest push against those limits is the destruction of EXTREMELY vital crime scenes . Someone as meticulous as Erroll would KNOW that moving a body would be a huge no - no . Or trampling through a crime scene . Or moving evidence . It went beyond and hurt the film to no end.<br /><br />The other damaging part of this film is that we never get into Clair Danes ' character , Allison . She 's almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we 're never privy to what her intension might be : Will she stay or leave ? Will she end up like Erroll if she does stay ? This is n't a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground , but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up .
0 I watched the movie " The Flock " because of the casting of Gere and Danes and because the story synopsis sounded interesting . This was one of the WORST movies I 've seen in a long while ( and I 've seen some turkeys . ) I 've never posted online before but this movie was so awful I had to do so . I suppose the problems begin begin with the script which was so amateurish it 's unbelievable . The story makes zero sense and the dialogue is so trite it 's nauseating . Poor Gere , he deserves so much better . As for the Gere / Danes on screen matchup , because of the horrible writing , one does n't believe either character for a single minute . I 'll bet Gere wishes he could buy back the negative , were such a thing possible . It 's a shame to see talent wasted so badly , not to mention I wish I could get my 2 hours back . ( I know what you 're thinking . How do I really feel ? )
0 I just saw this film yesterday.<br /><br />My girlfriend wanted to see it only because of Richard Gere.<br /><br />I feel I wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend it 's the last time we go to see a film just because a certain actor / actress is in it . I hope she learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in her seat . As of me , since I paid already , I wanted to see the end at least , just in the hope something good would turn up , but I did n't hold my breath , and luckily so cause I would have been a victim of the film just the same.<br /><br />This is not a black and white film , it 's a black and black one . The main character ( Richard Gere ) is almost as bad as his registrants , and all sex offenders are portrayed as unredeemable hard core criminals and the bad ones among them were really very very bad . Speak of a cliché and the exploitation of a typical US phobia.<br /><br />Richard Gere 's acting was good as usual but the blond girl that 's supposed to replace him was wishy washy at best . Totally unconvincing for the job.<br /><br />The film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap , dramatic , and sensational turn that just is unreal . They just use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murders , vigilante beating , rape and torture - something that almost seems gratuitous . They even have a wolf attacking people in the film - how low can you get.<br /><br />I gather the film wo n't come out in the USA and will go straight to DVD . That 's were it should have stayed in other countries too , but because it 's Hollywood and Richard Gere they just had to show it . Believe me , without Gere , the film is not even worth a B - series movie .
0 The Flock is not really a movie . It 's a wannabe movie , with wannabe actors . Not including Richard Gere , he gave an excellent performance , but when only one of the actors truly gives himself to his character , and the rest of the cast is just acting ... the result is pathetic , just like this movie . You see , the idea of acting is to hide the fact that you 're acting . What the hell was Claire Dains doing in this one ? ! She 's the most inappropriate actress for this character . In 99.9 % of the movie she looked extremely out of place , out of everything ! ! The only thing she was doing was asking stupid questions , like " do you really think so ? ? " , and making silly faces . I was embarrassed by her acting , seriously , and I used to like her ... She 's the romantic movie type , I do n't know who picked her among all the actresses out there .... LOL , and seeing Avril Lavigne ? ! this really made me laugh .. Anyway .. If you want to get the feeling of throwing up , this movie will do the job for you ! ! ! I wish I could vote -5 ..
0 A bad rip - off attempt on " Seven " , complete with sub - second - grade acting , awful camera work , half - baked story and strong aftertaste of lame propaganda . Yeah , them " sex offenders " , they live next door and you 're gon na get raped , really.<br /><br />No surprises from the vice - terminatrix woman , she acts as always -- as convincingly as a piece of wood . Richard Gere keeps on sliding lower and lower -- and is about as low here as a late Steven Seagal.<br /><br />The singer woman with the crazy eyes is best when she 's dead in bed ; and even the wolf was sub - par ( although she was the best performer in the movie ) -- maybe they fed her before the shots , or something.<br /><br />Unlike " Seven " , which had a ( made up , but interesting ) story , to which one could relate more or less regardless of the country , this movie seems to focus on a US - only obsession . If one does n't care much about " sex offenders " -- and the statistics are that lack of exercise and bad diet cause more pain , suffering and death -- there is little reason to see it , or to be afraid.<br /><br />There are some body part fetishes and some snuff , but the gore is less then mediocre , and fails both as artistic device ( because it is pointless ) and as gore , because it is not gory enough.<br /><br />Don't waste time on this one .
0 first this deserves about 5 stars due to acting ( some which would give me a better subjective opinion and NOT an objective one as it should by giving this one , WELL DESERVED , star ) but then i know that those facts are used for the actor(S ) NAMES to increase the rating of something like this ... <br /><br />i do have a problem with such productions ; yet another attempt ( just like " untraceable " ) of a systematic propagandistic feature promoting government intrusion on your rights ( how interesting that it comes at a moment when IPS providers trying to " preferentiate " = CENSOR information , and the Americans and Canadians are fighting AGAINST that at this very moments ) . this time is not by labeling torrent file transfers as evil ( that one was intended to remind you of such feeling whenever you transfer data on the net ) , but by literally attempting in creating a sexual frustrated population as a whole . SEEMS LIKE FEAR PROMOTION IS HOLLYWOOD 'S NORM THIS DAYS , especially when coming to thrillers which is the most " on demand " motion picture genre for past 2 decades or so = most viewed , best way to try influence the society as a whole . such levels of violence are depicted in this 2 features of morally and " ethical " people , that it gives a new much needed meaning to " anti - heroes " figures . make no mistake , this is NOT " DEXTER " which was meant to be high - quality entertainment . STOP SELLING " FEAR " please , the world would be a better place without it and the dollars made of it.<br /><br />the opening scene and generally the first 10 minutes really give a frightful picture of an Erroll Babbage that is CLEARLLY suffering of sexual frustration . the way he handles the black male is very disturbing if not outright racist(for sure a " cliche " at least ) ( in real life someone would probably get a beating for it , you will see what i mean ) . the second scene ( with Claire Danes 's character present ) is even more extreme . at that point i realized , in my opinion that Erroll Babbage is a very dangerous individual to people around him.how many people , that have seen or will see this movie , have never been " hold down"(regarding BOTH sexes ) out of self , COMMON gratification!?.typically the movie gives an extreme CRIMINAL case(that unfortunately did , is and will likely happen again sometime , somewhere ) BUT fingers everyone else indirectly as well as " you could become that " , etc . anyone that is familiar with Sigmund Freud and Jung will know very well that sexuality is not something to be judged let alone " asses " , by such fanatical " hero " here . SAFE sex in its many forms IS healthy and not some evil that apparently Richard Gere character is obsessed with , on his way for some sexual " crusade " . have we not learned anything from the abundant recent scandals involving priests and young boys ! ? or for how long an American teenager can see extreme violence on " pg-13 " but he can not even see a woman breast until " R-18 " ! ? ! ? ( yet the industry targets them with this VERY SAME sexual perversions like " american pie " series for example).raise the kids tester - one levels but frustrate them and drive them underground in developing fetishes to UNhealthy EXTREMES ! ? all sexual activities(upon MUTUAL acceptance ) integrates individuals better then some " rightous " nut - case , THAT blames his misfortunes and shortcomings on " the lives of others " ( a new German movie that would work great in comparing this 2 distinct and world apart features on the very same subject).here , like in that movie , you will probably appreciate the actors for well portraying the opposite of what they should have been.<br /><br />i am very disappointed with Richard Gere especially after the recent " hunting party " , a feature where he really shines and about a more realistic " hero " ( after real facts as well).but then it just reminds me that all those people are only actors that get paid to play someone 's political and social agenda . " the flock " and " untraceable " 2 heads of the same hidden beast)))it just reminds you , if know anyone with similar views on the subject as a WHOLE , as Erroll Babbage has those here , to stay clear of them for THEIR own safety.they would kill my family faster then any 0.00001 chances of Paul Jerrod in anyone 's life would ... <br /><br />in the end i recommend this to anyone thinking negative here about MY " assesment " of this particular movie ( and " untraceable " actually ) , so you can likely have similar thoughts as i did . nothing sweeter then a propagandistic movie shooting itself in the " foot".))))for once i agree with the rating , this is not a feature for teenagers or kids ; simply because at best would confuse them even more then the " common " belief of " money+fame+fashion " and how that relates to sexuality . " scream " series and movies as such AT LEAST have a defined entertainment value(even if a dumb one in my opinion ) . but this one is just another " trust me i know what is good for you " deeply ( not so well done i might add ) subliminal messages .
0 The reasons to watch this knock off ... err ... tribute to a great movie called Se7en : - It 's on while your channel surfing and there 's nothing else on . - Someone pays you to watch it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and pop in the DVD for Se7en , rent it , download it on iTunes , or put it in your Netflix cue and skip The Flock entirely . The Flock the same story with with a few changes . Furthermore the editing just wreaks of Se7en and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times . The worst one is probably the fly over desert helicopter shots , with sounds of people people chattering over the radio , except there are no police helicopters flying overhead in this one.<br /><br />Bottom line : I call it a blatant knock off . If you wanna be nice you can call it a tribute film , go ahead , but either way go watch Se7en .
0 I really have problems rating this movie . It is directed brilliantly , there is obviously a lot of money in it . Gere and Danes are intense ( although her screen personality could use a bit more defining and spicing up ) , editing and cinematography are excellent . On the other hand , it is one of those really really sick movies where one can not help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes , and , yes , one can not help but wonder how many copycats will such a movie inspire.<br /><br />In purely artistic terms , it is a 9 , but I really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie ....
0 I saw this film last night ( about 102 minutes ) and do n't know what kept me in my seat . I guess I just expected a film with Gere would have some value in it eventually but nothing of value ever came on the screen . The story is a silly excuse to pile on shot after shot of bondage and torture . There is not a character in the film that does anything like real life . The cutting " style " relies on jump cuts , mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this vapid setup of a gang of sadists apparently running free for years and SURPRISE the leader is the " victim " of an executed killer . I do n't see how Gere , a Buddhist , got involved in this violent , sexist trash .
0 Although Twenty Minutes of Love is a harmless attempt at an early comedy , it was difficult to follow and the film quality was not very good . It does have a couple of moments that are funny , but I have seen better by Charlie Chaplin .
0 In 1914 , Charlie Chaplin began making pictures . These were made for Mack Sennett ( also known as " Keystone Studios " ) and were literally churned out in very rapid succession . The short comedies had very little structure and were completely ad libbed . As a result , the films , though popular in their day , were just awful by today 's standards . Many of them bear a strong similarity to home movies featuring obnoxious relatives mugging for the camera . Many others show the characters wander in front of the camera and do pretty much nothing . And , regardless of the outcome , Keystone sent them straight to theaters . My assumption is that all movies at this time must have been pretty bad , as the Keystone films with Chaplin were very successful.<br /><br />The Charlie Chaplin we know and love today only began to evolve later in Chaplin 's career with Keystone . By 1915 , he signed a new lucrative contract with Essenay Studios and the films improved dramatically with Chaplin as director . However , at times these films were still very rough and not especially memorable . No , Chaplin as the cute Little Tramp was still evolving . In 1916 , when he switched to Mutual Studios , his films once again improved and he became the more recognizable nice guy -- in many of the previous films he was just a jerk ( either getting drunk a lot , beating up women , provoking fights with innocent people , etc . ) . The final evolution of his Little Tramp to classic status occurred in the 1920s as a result of his full - length films.<br /><br />It 's interesting that this film is called TWENTY MINUTES OF LOVE since the film only lasts about 10 minutes ! Oh well . The plot , what little there is , involves the Little Tramp in the park . A couple wants to neck but inexplicably , Charlie insists on practically sitting on the couple 's lap and really annoying them . I ca n't understand why and the short consists of Charlie wandering about the park annoying these people and some others later in the film . Perhaps he was looking for a threesome , I do n't know . But the film lacks coherence and just is n't particularly funny -- even when people start slapping each other and pushing each other in the lake . A typical poor effort before Chaplin began to give his character a plot and personality .
0 A quite usual trashy Italo - Western , stupid storyline full of clichés and lack of logic , some mediocre actors , dirty settings , lots of punch - fights and people shoot dead on a massive scale.<br /><br />This has nothing to do with Django . - At least not in my German translated version , this German DVD - release is called " Adios Companeros " and has Macho Callaghan fighting against Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because their gang killed his one ( he 's the only survivor ) . Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fighting each other because they quarreled and the gang split . And you have Ironhead fighting against everyone because he 's just the biggest and most greedy asshole anyway . Yeah , that 's it , no more cleverness in the storyline , hehe.<br /><br />A small role by Klaus Kinski as Reverend Cotton is remarkable ( that 's why I bought this DVD ) . In one scene he attempts to separate two men fighting by hitting them and screaming " I said love ! " and in another scene he wins a competition in throwing horseshoes and goes nuts for a second - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC!!!<br /><br />It 's also remarkable that JOE d'AMATO aka Aristide Massaccesi did the cinematography - I love this master of incompetent exploitation - thrash , so it was an " aahhh " for me .
0 I am a big fan of the Spaghetti Western Genre , and I usually also like most of the cheaply made ones . Infamous Director Demofilo Fidani , however , is rightly known for some of the cheapest , trashiest , and , well , worst contributions to the genre . The plots of Fidani 's movies were usually very weak , and since his talent was quite limited , he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous Spaghetti Western names like " Django " of " Sartana " to the titles . I the particular case of " Giù La Testa ... Hombre " of 1971 he just took the title of Sergio Leone 's " Giù La Testa " ( aka . " Duck You Sucker " ) and added ' Hombre ' . The movie can be found under various titles ( " Fistful Of Death " , " Western Story " ... ) , I personally bought it under the name " Adios Companeros " , which this movie shares with another Fidani film with almost the same cast , " Per Una Bara Piena Di Dollari " , which is also entitled " Adios Companeros " in the German language version.<br /><br />The plot is rather weak , it basically follows a guy named Macho Callaghan ( Jeff Cameron ) and his involvement with two rivaling outlaw gangs lead by Butch Cassidy ( Jack Betts ) and Ironhead ( Gordon Mitchell).<br /><br />The leading performance by Jeff Cameron is , kindly stated , not very convincing . Neither did I find Jack Betts very good as ' Butch Cassidy ' . B - movie legend Gordon Mitchell , however , is always worth a try , and although he probably was n't a very good actor , I always found his performances in the Spaghetti Westerns quite funny and original , and he actually saved some of Fidani 's movies ( such as the rather crappy " Django And Sartana ... Showdown in the West").<br /><br />There is one very funny and original thing about " Giù La Testa ... Hombre " - the great Klaus Kinski is playing a priest ! I could have imagined Kinski in any role , but before seeing this movie I would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest . Kinski is , once again , great , although he has only little screen time , and one scene , where he breaks up a fight , is probably the only good scene in this . One more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze Joe D'Amato did the cinematography.<br /><br />"Giù La Testa ... Hombre " is a cheap , crappy film , but nevertheless , it has some funny moments . Being a Spaghetti Western enthusiast , I found it fun to watch , but if you 're not , never mind this movie , or watch it only for the purpose of seeing Kinski play a priest . 3/10
0 that 's incredible ! Fidani ( who he was also a spiritist ) was one of the cheapest director of all the world . This movie stole the original title of Leone 's " Duck you sucker ! " but tell the boring story of a Pinkerton agent against the killer " Testa di Ferro " ( the improbable Gordon Mitchell , a stuntman ) . All is poor and crazy in this pelicula filmed into the dear landscapes of Lazio . The story is bad and crazy at the same time . Fidani was not able and ingenuos at the same time . Into the story happened some kind of crazy illogical things ( like the discussion into the Sheriff 's house and the demential appearance of Butch Cassidy ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? yes , really Butch Cassidy , who is portrayed like an idiot ) . Terribles nuit americaine , absurd comportaments , illogic plot , bad acting and a fugace appearance by one of the most rewarded anchorman in the story of italian television , Renzo Arbore . Ah , of course : Klaus Kinski . Yes is great and terrible , but i 'm sure he was in it only for money an for playing with iron horses ) 2 of 10 but ... DON'T MISS IT ! ! ! ! !
0 The Ballad of Django is a meandering mess of a movie ! This spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes from other ( and much better ! ) films supposedly tied together by " Django " telling how he brought in different outlaws . Hunt Powers ( John Cameron ) brings nothing to the role of Django . Skip this one unless you just HAVE to have every Django movie made and even THAT may not be a good enough excuse to see this one ! !
0 The only remarkable fact is the participation of Klaus Kinski who plays a priest . Do n't ask me why he does it ! A bad , bad movie overall.<br /><br / >
0 Oh , this is so bad , it is funny . The only way one could explain something like this is a porn party with drugs that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun . I mean : you get to see porn actresses topless , having sex , then killed by human mutants . There is plenty of gore , including the classic " something is wrong with her , oh no , it 's half the person she used to be " and the accidental murder caused by panic . But you can also find funny stuff like intestines pulled through someone 's ass and a guy running in the woods then finding himself decapitated by a wire tied between two trees ( that makes a metallic doiiing sound afterward , like in cartoons ) . Somehow there is a market for people going beyond porn , they really need to know what 's inside an actress , mere genitals are not enough . Therefore you get to see plenty of summary autopsies on slain bimbos . There is NO dialog . Jenna and Chasey have really small parts and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted when accepting a role here . I think this is a film one must watch with the button on fast forward and watch only the juicy stuff , just to be reminded of the old school C class horror movies .
0 Tourists head to Ireland for a school trip to learn about Druids . What they encounter is a horrific tale of cannibalistic killers.<br /><br />If I had to sum up Evil Breed , it would be a low grade gore fest . The film mixes Dead Alive , Evil Dead , Wrong Turn all in one . It 's just too bad that the film has so many inconsistencies to keep track of that it loses any " fun " one would have watching it . The film has lots of random " horror " nudity ... although the film also stars four porn stars , yup four , so there could have been plenty more . Breed also showcases a good amount of gore . < br /><br />Evil Breed has a horrible start , with laughable dialogue and horrible acting . That 's a given in a straight to video horror film , but this takes the cake . I ca n't really figure out who the main character is , since the one female who " lives " at the end is not really in the movie all that much . Speaking of the ending , that has to be one of the most random and bogus ending in the history of film . It has no purpose with the rest of the film and totally changes one 's view of the film.<br /><br />You have to see this film to believe it , since there are some pretty great death scenes . There are two death scenes that come into my mind , one in which the inbred killer rips the intestines out of a naked woman through her chest .... yea her chest , do n't ask me . The other i d when the guy gets his intestines , yet again , ripped out through his asshole . Does that kill the guy ? No , the killer continues to strangle the guy with his own intestines . These scenes remind me so much of Dead - Alive , with the right amount of humour in each . I also got the sense of Evil Dead , with the pointless mentions of horror films and Sam Raimi . Along with Halloween , when the female character is in a closet screaming for her life with the killer trying desperately;y to get in.<br /><br />Although , the gore and nudity are not enough for the poor audio and visual quality of the film . When the teacher wakes up from her bed and walks down the stairs , her footsteps are so loud and hard that it seems like she was wearing boots . Distracting indeed . As well as the continuity in the film , with only one inbred killer ? As well as which character dies at which moment . I could n't tell if the breast implant chick was Jenny or Gary 's sister / cousin ... I ca n't remember . As well as the random naked chick with a dead baby hanging out of her body , still attached with the umbilical cord.<br /><br />The horrible editing is distracting as well , the opening credits are too fast and disorienting . It did have a bad start and got better , but the ending just brings the film back down to a horrible level . If maybe there were better production values and more faith put into this film , then it would n't have been horribly butchered to death . Stay away from this film , unless you are happy with the below budget horrible bad film with decent gore .
0 Justifications for what happened to his movie in terms of distributors and secondary directors , drunks and receptionists doing script rewrites aside , let 's just take this movie as it 's offered , without extraneous explanations.<br /><br />This movie is God awful . Straight up craptastic . Rather than rehash what may serve as a plot , I 'll run a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head.<br /><br />A class ( of 5 ) take a field trip for a history class to the middle of friggin ' nowhere Ireland . These students may be Canadian or American , it 's difficult to tell . That it was filmed in a Canadian forest rather than Ireland is rather obvious as well . One student seems to know nothing about history and is basically the " dumb jock " character from a number of kick ass 80 's movie , except when he channels Randy from Scream . One character may be Chris Klein 's stunt double . He has a girlfriend who probably gets killed , but it 's never really established if that is true . One character is sullen and removed from her peers ... just ... cuz ... and then there 's a blonde girl . Yay blonde girl.<br /><br />Ireland has a population of 2 . They 're cousins . Gary , who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast , is called " sir " more than once . He 's very ominous and wears a knit cap . His cousin is a roughed up porn star with the worst Irish accent to befoul film in my lifetime and most likely beyond.<br /><br />Picturesque Ireland features many Canadian forests and swampy areas and 2 ducks which appear more than once in cut scenes.<br /><br />The producers got a discount on volume fake entrails . Good for them.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to me , horribly inbred freaks have access to brand spanking new hunting knives . Perhaps there 's some kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf clerk working the register.<br /><br />Also unbeknownst to me , if you inbreed for roughly 600 years , as the story leads us to believe happened , you end up being somewhat lumpy , yet amazingly spry and fairly strong . Genetics are a wonderful game of craps.<br /><br />There may or may not be more than one freak in this film . Reference is made to " them " and we see shadows , yet only one odd looking dude is seen ever . And when one odd looking dude is finally killed , apparently all danger is passed . I 'm running with my initial assumption that no one thought to outfit a second man in full make up , thus they just used the one . That 's what it looks like on screen , anyway.<br /><br />Richard Grieco should be ashamed.<br /><br />Also of note , aside from those shiny new knives , the inbred freaks have access to some posh leather gear , as once Richard Grieco cuts his bonds , there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker who gets tied up ... who also then escapes , because the chains give you enough slack to just undo them , making one wonder why they even bother tying anyone up.<br /><br />A dead body in a shack will be maggot - ridden after what I would guess is about 2 hours has passed . Said dead body will also have glasses on , when no characters wore them . Curious.<br /><br />Jenna Jameson appears for no reason from stage left , chats for 2 minutes , vanishes stage left . In the middle of a giant forest . That 's not unusual , as Gary can also pop out of nowhere , which is also known as whatever exists in TV land off the screen.<br /><br />Ms . Jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie would n't suck wind.<br /><br />I offer a special nod to the " Breeder " character , the poor girl who has been used by the freaks for months ( or maybe years ) for breeding purposes . The poor girl who still has eye shadow on and emotes on camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua.<br /><br />The ending of this movie was clearly tacked on by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline drinking over the years.<br /><br />Apparently this was n't just random crap I found on the movie network late at night , apparently people have heard of and even followed this movie through it 's production . How sad for you all . I have nothing more to say . May God have mercy on us all .
0 Understand i 'm reviewing the film I have seen . I realize virtually all the nudity and gore was cut from this film , thus neutering it completely . When seeing names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson attached , I knew I was n't going to get a horror classic , but at the very least I expected gratuitous boobies and bloodshed . But no , this has got to be the most butchered modern horror film , I mean it 's easy to tell there is much more to certain scenes ' , but they suddenly cut away , or the scene just totally ends right as it begins . How does one screw up cannibals ' and porn stars ? I mean that s a winning formula , it makes me wonder if the director slept with some executive 's wife or something , because it is literally amazing how much got cut from this . Reading about it a few years back in Fangoria , I was excited , it looked like a fun film , but unfortunately the true film is locked in a vault somewhere , and we must endure this piece of excrement retitled Evil Breed . Hopefully an unrated cut will be released someday , as I think a good movie exists in this mess , but until then best grab a twelve pack of Bud , cause that s the only way you 'll make it through this movie .
0 Evil Breed is a very strange slasher flick that is unfortunately no good . The beginning of the film seems promising but overall it 's a disaster . The dialogue is pretty bad but not near as bad as the acting . The acting is brutal and unbearable . Most of the characters deliver there lines horribly and even if that is on purpose the method does n't work because the characters become annoying . Some of the kills are innovative but it took far too long to get to them . After about a half hour through the movie we get the first death ( other than in the beginning)and then almost every other character is smoked within the next five minutes . The movie then turned into sort of a spoof with ridiculous looking characters , unrealistic karate like fights , and a scene in which a man gets his intestines pulled out of his a*sscrack . None of it is funny it 's just plain ridiculous . The film then becomes ultra gory and ultra pointless . Most of the characters are clichéd even for slasher standards and are as solid as butter left on the counter for 5 days . Evil Breed is n't even laughably bad therefore it fails in it 's main task . Watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Just Before Dawn , or See No Evil for a real slasher .
0 I have been watching horror movies since I was 5 years old , beginning with Childs Play . Since then , I have seen good horror movies and bad , but this is without question , the DUMBEST movie I have ever seen ! The actors did all they could with the material . The plot was just idiotic . Plus , it was just all gore . I can stomach a lot of blood , but that was just ridiculous ! In one of the scenes , a character gets stabbed in the rear end and choked with his intestines ! Plain Stupid ! Another problem with this movie is that its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made . The end of it is just dumb . But then again , it goes with the rest of it ! At the end , when the girl gets away from the cannibal / ancestor , she receives help from a old lady . The old lady is making tea , but when she turns around to talk to the girl , the girl attacks her ! She turned into a cannibal ! Retarded movie .
0 Yes , definitely better than my viewing of Death Tunnel . Actually some of the deaths were pretty original and the gore was decent . It was kind of like Wrong Turn meets the Hills Have Eyes.<br /><br />BUT : 1 . ) When the " kids " ( high school or college ? ) are discussing horror movies in the kitchen , everything Shae says is almost an exact quote from Scream ( 1996 ) . The thing about the big - breasted girls etc.<br /><br />2 . ) Was Steve NOT a bootleg Randy from Scream ? 3 . ) Besides the fact that it took place in October , what the hell did the movie have to do with Samhain ? Pretty unnecessary if you ask me . I find it humorous when I see those horror movies from the 80 's that explain away loose ends by pointing the fingers at the druids or a pentagram.<br /><br />4 . ) Wow they made a Sam Raimi reference ! ! ! 5 . ) Why was Gary and his sister in the movie ? They 're characters had nothing to do with anything . And he s so psychic that he could n't even see his OWN death ? 6 . ) When Gary was being killed in the bathroom ( at that point , the deaths became simply Troma - licious ) how could she hear the screams when she was downstairs but not hear them when she was standing outside the door ? 7 . ) Gary 's sister commented on Haggis- that s primarily a Scottish dish , not Irish.<br /><br />8 . ) So the lesson is if you ARE like Shae and do n't have any fun or crack a smile through the whole film , you 'll be the one to live ? 9 . ) The mutants were pretty cool , but they looked like walking dishes of Chili con carne.<br /><br />10 . ) When they brought in Gary 's sister , did they forget that Steve HAD been strapped there and wonder where he went ? 11 . ) Was there not more than one killer ? Shae beat that one , but never encountered any more of them.<br /><br />12 . ) What was with the flashbacks to those other people ? Half of them Shae did n't know if they were dead or alive , so what was with that ? 13 . ) Why did n't they kill Gary and his sister before ? 14 . ) Why did no one ever call the police ? And apparently everybody KNEW those people lived in the woods , why did they never organize some kind of raid ? 15.)As far as I know , they were not zombies OR vampires- so how could she " turn into " one at the end ? I 'm with everyone else on the giant " huh ? " at the end.<br /><br />Way better than death tunnel , but still quite sloppy . I still do n't understand why they even placed it IN Ireland , considering Samhain had close to nothing to do with the plot .
0 I really do n't get how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it . Even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling cheated out of 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus . < br /><br />First of all , surely they could have 2 found real Irish people , and some good - looking women who could deliver their lines better than the washed up , haggard porn stars sprinkled throughout this film . Granted , the gore works- but strangely , it 's not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars ' hot ( formerly ) tight bodies left and right . Probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrific inhuman acting you just want them to die in pain.<br /><br />So , if you do n't care at all about the following : < br /><br />- acting ( seriously , everyone sucked . I 've never witnessed this before . EVERYONE sucked).<br /><br />-plot ( some crappy horror movies are remotely linear , or at the very least surprising . This movie does n't make sense unless you 're as trashed as the writers obviously were ) . < br /><br />- theme ( Nothing to learn from this film . Nothing to be scared about in bed at night , nothing to contemplate or grasp , or explain to others ) . < br /><br />- soundtrack ( Crap , crap , crap . Music as ordinary and dull as the script ) . < br /><br />- scenery ( Could have been this film 's saving grace , but no ... nothing pleasing here . Even the rocks are fake).<br /><br />So , yeah . If you do n't care about that , and you 're just a horny teen with bad taste in music and " women , " this movie is for you . Positive comments : interesting cinematography at times , wasted on the other elements . Very realistic gore ; again , wasted . But the intestines scene is classic . I agree with the mutant- disembowelment solves the fake accent problem .
0 Rented a batch of films from Blockbuster last night , and this was the first one I watched ( it was late on a Saturday night , wanted a " horror film fix") ... <br /><br />Wow , this was awful , almost embarrassingly so ... Stupid slasher - type story I really thought films like Scream had put an end to ; amateur actors delivering clichéd ' and insipid dialogue that is hard to believe was actually typed and read off a page ; and gore scenes that are nothing to get excited about ( especially when occurring in a film this poorly scripted).<br /><br />But I 've always believed no film is 100 % percent totally worthless . Here 's the few good things I can say about this mess : < br /><br />#1 Bobbie Phillips : love this actress . She 's the only member of the cast who displays any acting talent whatsoever . The only reason I took a chance on renting this is because her name was on the front cover . She acquits her presence in this dreck with professionalism , even though she looks bemused at times that she 's acting in such a moronic story.<br /><br />#2 Unintentional Hilarity : This is the kind of film I can remember seeing back when there were still grind house theaters around the country and they used to include crap like this as the third movie on a triple - bill with some prestige thriller movie that was finally making it 's way to the hinterlands . Unfortunately , in this direct - to - video age , most viewers have to endure these turkeys alone now without the communal experience of being part of an audience jeering and throwing stuff at the screen because the film is so terrible . Which leads to--<br /><br />#3 Porn Stars Trying To Act ! : Mostly on hand because the producers do n't need to cajole or plead with them to disrobe for extended sex scenes , but this trade - off usually means they actually get to speak some lines that are supposed to advance a story ( other than " ooh yeah baby " , or " harder ! " ) . And , proudly , they all deliver expertly at looking foolish when trying to act . I 'd almost exclude Ginger Lynn Allen from this group if her character was n't supposed to be an Irish mom and she 's actually attempting at times to do an accent , which just keeps the smiles coming.<br /><br />It 's nice to look for the positive in all experiences , and that 's what I took from this cesspool a.k.a " Evil Breed "
0 Karen(Bobbie Phillips)mentions , after one of her kids gets out of hand with his lame annoying jokes , that she 'll never survive this trip .. boy , is she ever on the money . Karen is a school teacher taking her group of kids from the Shepley College of Historical Studies to the butt ugly locale of a run - down manor in the major dung - heap of Ireland .. surely there are places in this country more appeasing to the senses than this ? ! The caretaker of the manor , Gary(Simon Peacock)warns Karen and her students to stay on the path and not to stray into the forest . There 's a myth regarding the Sawney Bean Clan , a ritualistic druid cannibalistic inbred family celebrate Samhain(the end of Summer , October 31st)"Feast of the Dead " where sacrifices are needed to appease the spirits . Gary is supposedly clairvoyant , his cousin Pandora(Ginger Lynn Allen)tells us , because he was born on Samhain . Funny , because he sure does n't see outcomes well or even give advice accurately . Nearly everyone dies( .. even those who never stray from the path)and he does n't even see his own gruesome fate . What this monster we hear breathing is a victim of way too much inbreeding .. it 's face resembles a malformed mushroom and it looks like a hideous reject from a Mad Max picture . It does n't take long before the " evil breeder " is killing everyone . Paul(Howard Rosenstein)is Karen 's love interest who made the wrong decision coming to Ireland without his girlfriend 's prior knowledge.<br /><br />Horrible formula slasher does n't stray from the norm . It 's minuscule budget shows loudly and the characters are assembly line clichés churned out yet again to be slaughtered in the usual gory ways . Most of the violence flashes across the screen quickly with not much dwelling on the breeder 's acts of death towards his victims . Lots of guts get pulled out during the fast edit cuts as one scene whisks to another . Seeing Gillian Leigh 's gorgeous naked body for a moment or two is n't incentive enough to recommend it . Phil Price has the really irritating trickster character , Steve , often shedding bad jokes .. how he is able to get Leigh 's Barbara naked in the shower for some action is anyone 's guess because I have no reason why he 'd stand a chance with such a hottie . Brandi - Ann Milbrant has the fortunate role of Shae , the quiet virgin smart girl(who is also quite hot)who we know will be the one chosen by the screenplay to survive . Jenna Jameson drops by long enough to get her heart cut out of her chest(at least we see her breasts momentarily before her chest is opened up)with a few minor lines about two missing friends she 's looking for . The film 's main problem is that the story and character development grinds to a halt because it 's realized that none of them are at all interesting so director Christian Viel just lets loose his monster to run rampant causing carnage , obliterating an entire cast almost in one fail swoop within ten minutes . Oh , and Richard Grieco has a minor opening cameo as a victim who strayed off the path to tent camp with his chick .
0 First of all , Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie , and she 's just awful . This movie has every horror move cliché in imagination , and all badly played . The over - sexed teen couple . The comical(not)horny jock . The snotty cool chick . The creepy local color guy . The parental - type couple . The virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films . The dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool . It 's almost like you 're wishing that they 'd all die sooner . I saw the rough cut of this film a while ago , but somehow , this just got worse . Sure , the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson 's implants , but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog . Avoid at all costs .
0 This started bad , got worse , and by the time the girl attacked the old lady at the end i literally wanted to take the DVD to the person we borrowed it off and choke the C**T to death with it . Avoid this film , a little bit of good cinematography and some naked shots , would be almost acceptable if i was 14 and had not seen Jenna Jameson naked a million times . If anyone feels the need to watch this film , i would strongly recommend you spend the time more appropriately , as an example i would say trying to cram a Lego house into your bum with no lube would be a good start . I hear that this film was not the original version , i would very much like to view the original , as it seems that this cut version is devoid of all plot , and apparently most of the nudity , can someone please tell me how i can get in touch with Christian Viel he owes me an hour of my life back !
0 I had to register for IMDb just to post a comment on just how awful this movie is ... my cats and a ball of string have a better storyline than this . Not the worst acting I 've ever seen , but when you wipe out almost the entire cast of the movie within 5 minutes , it leaves a bit to be desired . There was n't a single ' scare ' moment in the movie , with the exception of when they were watching the movie ' Halloween ' on the TV . All around , it seems like it could 've been a good story , rolling the credits and saying that Chasey Lain was in it was a bit of a loss as I did n't recognize her right away and her scene was already over before I could 've said ' oh yeah , there she is ' . I 'm so glad I saw this in a hotel and did n't pay for it as I 'd be real ticked if I had payed a cent to see this . I normally like or can at least find a redeeming factor in a movie , but this one is an exception . It 's so bad that it 's not even that amusing so - good - it's - bad .... it 's just plain bad .
0 Thanks to this film , I now can answer the question , " What is the worst movie you have ever seen?" < br /><br />I ca n't even think of a close second , and I 've seen some really bad movies.<br /><br />Absolutely nothing works in this film . Name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails . Honestly , I 've seen better on YouTube . Here 's some typical dialogue:<br /><br />"Steve ? " " Steve ? " " Steve , is that you ? " " Steve , I 'm not kidding " " Steve , this is n't funny ! " " Steve , are you there ? " " Steve ? " " Steve ? " " Steve?" < br /><br />"ARggh ! ! ! ! Ahhhhhh ! ! ! ! Nooooooo ! "
0 Four porn stars romping through the Irish woods sounds like a film to watch . We have Ginger Lynn Allen , Chasey Lain , Taylor Hayes , and Jenna Jameson all together in one film . Are you licking your lips ? Well the mutant creatures who resulted from centuries of inbreeding were certainly licking their lips as they feasted on the entrails of their victims.<br /><br />Yes , there was some flesh exposed - far too little considering the cast - but , it was soon ripped open to expose dinner for these creatures . There was definitely some action that probably has not been seen before , and more than one person lost their head in the situation.<br /><br />Unfortunately , director Christian Viel did not show much promise and I am not likely to watch his later efforts .
0 For your own good , it would be best to disregard any positive reviews concerning this movie . This flick STINKS . Now , I like ( at least in theory ) low budget horror movies , but this one makes the worst mistake a low budget flick can make : It takes itself WAY too seriously . And , unfortunately , that 's not it 's only problem.<br /><br />It 's the story of the murderous Beane clan of the British Ilses transposed to modern times . An interesting premise , but there are two things that are immediately perplexing about this film once you start watching it.<br /><br />#1- Why is the biggest name on the CD box Jenna Jameson ? She 's a below average looking woman who ca n't act , and she has a minor role . ANSWER : She 's apparently a well known porn star ( as you no doubt read in other reviews ) , so I guess this is a " cameo " appearance for her . She 's giving the film much needed " name recognition " , it seems . Her top billing is n't any indication of her talent , though , it 's an indication of how UNtalented the rest of the cast is.<br /><br />#2- How can film makers be so stupid to think Canada can be passed off as Ireland ? It does n't even remotely look like Ireland . And the house that the guests / victims stay in is this great big North American wood frame Edwardian thing . They should have skipped the whole Beane theme and developed a story that took place in N.A. Also , if you 're going to make a movie that takes place in Ireland , it 's probably best to have more than one character with an Irish accent ( and that was a REALLY REALLY REALLY BAD Irish accent . ) Now , this would n't have been so bad if the director was n't trying to make the next " Night of the Living Dead " , but it seems he was . Too bad . He could have had some fun with it . In fact , some of the scenes were n't far from being unintentionally comedic as they were.<br /><br />Like the infamous gutting scene , were the woman is chained to the table , stripped naked , and then sliced open and eviscerated . That 's funny , you ask ? Well , in the deleted scene version , the mutant killer pulls out mile after mile after mile of intestines . It 's actually funny after awhile . And what self respecting cannibal eats intestines , anyway ? Do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens ? Heck no , we eat hams and ribs and drumsticks . Oh well.<br /><br />Some of the other cast who were annoying : the whiny , creepy Howard Rosenstein . I 'm not sure , but I THINK he was supposed to be cast as a STUD . In fact , he 's as big a loser and goof ball as his name would imply . Which would explain why the character played by the equally annoying Gillian Leigh fell for him.<br /><br />I checked Gillian Leigh on her link on IMDb , and apparently it 's important to know that she graduated high school with honors . I ca n't decide if it 's more amusing or pathetic to know that only a couple years after graduation , the honor student is doing nude soft - core porn scenes in a shower with a guy named Howard Rosenstein . Wonder if her former classmates have seen this movie ? If they have , hopefully they 'll get the message : AVOID THIS FATE ! GO TO COLLEGE ! ! ! I could go on and on , but why . If you like gore , you 'll find something redeeming in this flick , but not much more .
0 please do n't rent or even think about buying this movie.they do n't even have it available at the red box to rent which would cost a $ 1 & i think its worth less than that.the main reason why i rented this d movie was because Jenna Jameson is in the movie lol between 2 - 5 min.i will give credit that the movie had hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity but other than that you might as well buy another d horror movie that has the same thing with nobody you know . Ginger Lynn has more acting time in this movie than Jenna & she 's not even on the front cover of the movie nor her name.i recommend people to watch zombie strippers because you see Jenna almost throughout the whole movie & nude most of the time.this movie is a big disappointment & such a huge waste of time .
0 I only gave this ridiculously titled comedy horror flick a 2 because several famous porn stars of the past appear in it . A group of tourists , supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada , run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other , and the plot is more or less right out of THE HILL HAVE EYES ands WRONG TURN . Only problem is , unless I miscounted , there 's only one mutant on display , and he is n't all that impressive . Sort of like the potbellied mummy in that homemade film from about five years ago . Some gory but silly deaths help , but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief . The ending is predictable and has been done to death . No pun intended .
0 MAKE A 0 YOU SACKS OF German STAPLES ! well , when i started to watch this sack of crud , it was a Sunday afternoon , and i was just looking for stuff on show time . I was introduced to a hot naked babe , and like any guy ( i m a guy , the e - mail is my sisters ... ) i was happy . But then they threw it all to the dogs , spit on it , lit it on fire , and peed it out . You wanna know how ? THE DUMB CHICK TALKED ! The dialog throughout the film was just horrible . sounded like something my 2nd grade bro could wright . The violence was nice for some scenes , but some was just totally moronic . The scene in the pit were he gives the guy the knife ... dumb moron ! To sum it up , this is pure cinema barf drenched in the chocolate syrup known as nudity , and topped with the cherry of horrible acting as only a porn star could deliver .
0 Did they use their entire budget paying the porno stars or what?!?<br /><br />Sound effects , background music and the editing in general was so bad you 'd think some 12-year - old wanna - be made the film.<br /><br />Most of the acting was good considering the script ... the " innocent virgin " played her part really well.<br /><br />The mutants look really cool and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel ... but , unfortunately for all involved , that 's not the case.<br /><br />Turn Left was made better than this movie and those guys did n't even have any money ! ! ! Good thing I did n't rent the movie myself !
0 He pulled the guys guts out his butt ! That 's a spoof right ? ! No one really writes that it just happens like improv gone horribly wrong . I think any way . This movie must be a spoof because who would say they wrote that script otherwise . Can anyone imagine the entire cast sitting around as the director and writers go over the storyboard.<br /><br />Director says , " next our inbreed villain uses his 24 inch machete to disembowel our token creepy neighbor . Get this , he is going to pull the guts out his bunghole" < br /><br />"Brilliant ! " the entire cast proclaims.<br /><br />No way can that happen , nobody writes that stupid ! Got ta be a spoof.<br /><br />I loved the part where the skinny introspective gal beats the inbreed freak to death with the cast iron skillet she finds on the floor of the cave . I was n't sure the inbreed cannibal types bothered to cook much . Maybe that explains why the skillet was lying on the floor in the dark at just the right time to kill the malformed hulk . Seems ironic that after the freaky guy had bested martial arts expert porn queens and a couple out doors type jocks he falls so easily to the frying pan of a skinny defenseless girl next door . < br /><br />What the heck is that Richard Greco guy doing in this ? Did he fire his agent or something ? < br /><br />Can anyone explain the ending to me please because I did n't get it either ? I ca n't quite figure why the nice hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady who was making her some tea . Never mind I do n't want to know .
0 it was the worst ending i have ever seen if some one can please tell me how and why the last chick goes crazy and eats the old women in the end . why dose the movie have all those cheap crappy scares in it in the beginning but yet when the first person dies they kill them all off in 5 minutes ! most of the people could act but i do give so credit to the porn stars they did their best . also it had a couple funny parts and kills like when the care taker gets his organs riped out of his ass and then gets choked with it . if this movie had an ending that could make any since i would have given it a 8 out of 10 but the ending made no since . the ending sucked but the rest was great
0 this film has its good points : hot chicks people die < br /><br />the problem ... the hot Chicks barley get nude and you do n't get to see many of the people dieing , mostly just lots of fast movements and screaming though there were two good kill scenes.<br /><br />also for those of you watching this for JENNA JAMESON she is just a side chearator with a very small role and Minor nude scenes.<br /><br />What this film needed .. script and story would be nice but I will not complain about that .. simply put it needs more nudity and better kill scenes cuz lets face it that is why we watch these flicks ... <br /><br />I would n't waste my money on it ... and if you must , wait until it 's on the OLD shelves at your local video store
0 I have seen Dolemite and also ( Avenging ) Disco Godfather , two other fine works of the blaxploitation canon from our friend Rudy Ray Moore . But this film , The Human Tornado ( aka Dolemite 2 ) will always hold a special place in my heart . For sheer goofiness , lack of skill in film production , and absolute enthusiasm ( frankly a little too much ) , The Human Tornado can not be topped.<br /><br />The opening scene sets the tone . Our old pal Dolemite is shacking up with a white woman , when some racist local cops raid the house for no good reason , and would n't you know it ! The woman in bed with ol' Dole is none other than the sheriff 's wife . Her cry when she sees him : " He made me do it ! " Dolemite 's cry : " & $ * @$ are you for real ? ? ? " Subtlety was never his strong point.<br /><br />Highlights ? The cameo by a very young Ernie Hudson ( of Ghostbusters fame ) , the continuity errors ( characters looking one way in one shot , and another in the next , Dolemite 's suit changing colors in every single shot of his nightclub act ) , and Queen Bee 's demonic eyes in her first scene.<br /><br />But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore himself . Did the man really think he looked cool in this movie ? I certainly do n't know why , but you have to admire the sheer enthusiasm he has . Whether it be jumping totally naked off a cliff , or barking orders to his gang in rhyme ( e.g : Quick ! Into the cave ! I have a plan to let that mother $ * @(% & dig his own grave ! ) the man commits totally . Certainly he goes overboard , nevermore so than any time he 's doing kung fu . The climactic battle is filmed at high speed , but occassionaly slows down to let Rudy pose and grits his teeth . I 'm not sure if they wanted it too look like they sped up the film as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe he was that fast . In any event , " The Matrix " it is not.<br /><br />Human Tornado , much like the original Dolemite , is an incompetent film of enormous proportions . But at least it 's fun , and certainly you have to give credit to these people for the effort . Just not that much . Enjoy with my hearty recommendations .
0 This rather formulaic swords and flying fists movie is a decent early display of John Woo 's talents . The cinematography is excellent and some of the sword work is truly remarkable . Unfortunately the film labours under the burden of a dull story and a glaringly low budget ( check some of the setbound fight scenes if you doubt me ) . Nonetheless , it 's worth seeing , especially if you can catch in letterboxed .
0 Most of the episodes on Season 1 are awful .. There is no comparison to Twilight Zone or Outer Limits , as they programs actually had decent story lines . Most of Amazing Stories are well dull .. not amazing in the least .. go rent or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I have heard Season 2 of this series is much better .. also for some reason on the DVD 's they cut out the Ray Walston parts which further diminishes this compilation . The one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... Most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering ...

Davis ' arrest by the police happens just as he and Isabelle took the vows of matrimony in a local church!<br /><br />Isabelle manipulates everyone , exclusively men that fall head over heels for her , to her advantage by getting them to do her dirty work . Always playing the part of the naive housewife or widow or lover or even client Isabelle seems to live a charmed life always one step ahead of the law and police . No matter what she does Isabelle covers her pretty behind so well that it 's almost impossible to pin her down on any , in having others do them , of the many crimes that she commits , through a second party , in the film.<br /><br />After screwing , figuratively as well as literally , her first husband Steven her second husband , for less then ten seconds , Richard and finally her , or Richard 's , attorney Gavin Kendrick , Kamar De Los Rey , Isabelle knows that it 's only a matter of time before the police get wise to her . With the D.A getting both Richard and Kendrick to turn evidence against her Isabelle now knowing that everything is fast closing in on her makes her final move . Getting everything in order , by transferring all her cash overseas , Isabelle and her 10 year - old daughter Ruby , Lauren Collins , shoot down to the passport office in order to get clearance , passports , to get out of the country.<br /><br />It 's then when the cagey and clever Isabelle makes her first and possibly last and fatal mistake in the movie . Isabelle is told by the passport clerk , Don Carrier , she 'll have to wait a full 48 hours for her , and Ruby 's , passport to clear ! Just enough time for the police to find and arrest her ! Outlandish ending that goes against almost everything and every ethic that 's in a film noir or crime movie . An ending that will not only blow your mind but your concept of what 's right and wrong in the world !
0 A thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims , along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine , and here Susan Lucci performs as a siren , although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one . Isabelle ( Lucci ) , inconstant wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins ( John O'Hurley ) , begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davis ( Philip Casnoff ) , simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for Richard , apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent . When Davis becomes convinced that guileful Isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband , he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may we d her himself , coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent Stewart . In the wake of the hit - man 's assault upon Collins , a pair of police detectives , performed by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott , become increasingly curious concerning Isabelle 's possible involvement in the crime , while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured Richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata 's maneuvering . Lucci and Kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators , each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds , but O'Hurley and McDermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements . Released upon a Fremantle DVD , this largely lustreless affair depicting a man ' neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top - flight visual and sound quality , and although no extra features are provided , the above - average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer Robert Primes and composer Stephen Edwards .
0 I am completely appalled to see that the average rating for this movie is 5.2/10 For what affects me , it is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I still keep wondering why I watched it until the end . First of all , the plot is totally hopeless , and the acting truly awful . I think that any totally unknown actress would have been better for the role than Susan Lucci ; concerning Mr. Kamar Del 's Reyes , I think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his " Valley of the Dolls " . To sum up , it is total waste of time(and i 'm trying to stay polite ... ) to avoid at any cost . My rating is 1 and I still think it is well paid , but since we can not give a O ....
0 This kind of film has become old hat by now , has n't it ? The whole thing is syrupy nostalgia turned in upon itself in some kind of feedback loop.<br /><br />It sure sounds like a good idea : a great ensemble cast , some good gags , and some human drama about what could have / might have been . Unfortunately , there is no central event that binds them all together , like there was in " The Big Chill " , one of those seminal movies that spawned copycat films like this one . You end up wanting to see more of one or two particular people instead of getting short takes on everyone . The superficiality this creates is not just annoying , it 's maddening . The below - average script does n't help .
0 I was looking over our DVD tower last night for something to watch . We were between NetFlix mailings and it was a quiet Saturday night . I pulled one out that I never heard of before and realized it was borrowed from a friend . From the jacket , it sounded like a rip - off of " The Big Chill " but , with the all - star cast , felt it might be worth watching . Boy was I wrong ! ! ! Not only was it like " The Big Chill , " it was a rip - off almost character by character . The Bill Paxton character was a copy of William Hurt ( " where have you been all this time " role ) -spoiler warning- and , lo and behold , he remains behind to take care of the old place(cabin / camp ) . Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly ; jerk womanizer Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum etc . , etc . I found myself wondering why I 'm even watching these people . There was insufficient character development for me to find any interest in them . How did " Unca Lou " even find these characters after 20 years ? Plus it was n't even funny , except when Perkins fell , err ' flopped ' out of bed the first morning , it was a sign and I missed it . After it was over , I asked my wife , " Were there any endearing characters in this film ? ... Are you sleeping over there ? " She replied , " No , I 'm still thinking ... No , none I can think of . "
0 Like watching a neighbor 's summer camp home movies , " Indian Summer " is a sleep inducing bore . Eight alumni campers are barely introduced , when unbelievably boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about . Fine actors , Alan Arkin , and Bill Paxton are totally wasted in this film . One camper 's observation that " everything seems so much smaller than I remember it " is repeated at least ten times , enough to make you squirm . The anticipated pranks are neither funny or original , unless you think that short sheeting is a real " howler " . This movie was a great disappointment considering the ample talent involved . " Indian Summer " did not make me homesick , just sick . - MERK
0 Wonderful cast wasted on worthless script . Ten or so adults reunite at the summer camp they attended as juveniles . Could this ever happen in a million years ? It 's simply a fantasy , and a boring one at that . Do they become teenagers again ? Do they reenact their pranks , games , good times ? They may try but ultimately the answer is : No . Is there any intrigue ? Any suspense ? Horror ? Comedy ? None of the above . How anyone can be entertained by this drivel is beyond me . I wanted to like this movie ; I tried to like this movie , but my brain refused .
0 No wonder that the historian Ian Kershaw , author of the groundbreaking Hitler biography , who originally was the scientific consultant for this TV film , dissociated himself from it . The film is historically just too incorrect . The mistakes start right away when Hitler`s father Alois dies at home , while in reality he died in a pub . In the film , Hitler moves from Vienna to Munich in 1914 , while in reality he actually moved to Munich in 1913 . I could go on endlessly . Hitler`s childhood and youth are portrayed way too short , which makes it quite difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man . Important persons of the early time of the party , like Hitler`s fatherly friend Dietrich Eckart or the party " philosopher " Alfred Rosenberg are totally missing . The characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengl is very problematic . In the film he is portrayed as a noble character who almost despises Hitler . The script obviously follows Hanfstaengl`s own gloss over view of himself which he gave in his biography after the war . In fact , Hanfstaengl was an anti - semite and was crazy about his " Fuehrer " . But the biggest problem of the film is the portrayal of Hitler himself . He is characterized as someone who is constantly unfriendly , has neither charisma nor charm and constantly orders everybody around . After watching the film , one wonders , how such a disgusting person ever was able to get any followers . Since we all know , what an evil criminal Hitler was , naturally every scriptwriter is tempted to portray Hitler as totally disgusting and uncharismatic . But facts is , that in private he could be quite charming and entertaining . His comrades didn`t follow him because he constantly yelled at them , but because they liked this strange man . Beyond all those historical mistakes , the film is well made , the actors are first class , the location shots and the production design give a believable impression of the era .
0 < br /><br />As usual , I was really looking forward to a new TV / film on a favourite subject of mine - makes a nice change from a * strangely familiar * documentary about Kursk or Stalingrad on the History Channel.<br /><br />I avidly looked forward to Pearl Harbour and Enemy at the Gates - but was rudely brought down to earth with the realisation of the malevolent , stupid - ifying power of Hollywood - and its ability to spend an absolute fortune on tripe.<br /><br />So yet again I got excited about ' The Rise of Evil ' , especially as I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved , as I 've enjoyed his books . I can see why he quit.<br /><br />To quote some guy responsible for this rubbish:<br /><br />"The Kershaw book was an academic piece , " he said . " It was < br /><br />quite dry . We needed more incidents . " < br /><br />Incidents ? Are they totally nuts ? Hitler 's life can not be said to be without ' incident ' - yes Kershaw 's two volume Hitler biographies were long and detailed , but they were supposed to be.<br /><br />The thesis behind ' Rise of Evil ' seems to be:<br /><br />Hitler was a very bad man - no he was a VERY bad man , who HATED jews , and just in case you miss this , we 're going to emphasise the fact in EVERY scene in the film.<br /><br />There was no effort whatsoever to try and explain the mood of the time , and why Hitler may have adopted the views and strategy he did . Needless to say - unlike the generally excellent ' Nazis - A Warning from History ' - this film neglected to point out the fact that nearly all of the leaders of the Munich communist rising were Jewish , and that this may have coloured his views on the subject - and his axiomatic linking of the jews with Bolshevism - an absolutely crucial aspect to understanding much of the Nazi era.<br /><br />But there was not much understanding to be done - the film - makers were n't going to go there , so we just got all the stuff we knew about anyway . We certainly do n't get the fascinating fact that Kershaw alludes to , which has Hitler briefly being a socialist / communist immediately after WW1 . That would of course be far too complex for the film to handle , and might even detract from the relentless ' he was very bad ' mantra which bangs away incessantly.<br /><br />We know he was a bad man . However , we also know that he was a mesmerising figure both as a public speaker and in more private situations . He could be polite and even sympathetic , and of course espoused some views like vegetarianism , anti - alcohol and anti - smoking that many Guardian readers could agree with . He was also famously fond of animals , hence why that wholly invented dog - flogging scene was so absurd.<br /><br />He was also , from all the accounts I 've seen , a brave soldier in WW1 . Whilst we saw him with his Iron Cross , we never get to see how he won it ( acts of bravery were not in the script , needless to say ) . We also get no insight whatsoever into why he was so fired up by his war experiences , whilst Sassoon , Owen , Brook , Remarque and so many others found it so repellent an experience . And again , like the point above re the jewish / bolshevik link , this is vital to anyone 's understanding about the subject . Why did he love war so much ? Why did he think it was always a good idea , despite massive evidence to the contrary ? Why did n't he care about his colleagues who died ? Or maybe he did - but still drew the wrong conclusions.<br /><br />This film certainly did n't have anything of any interest to say on this either.<br /><br />As all too often these days , the film is a classic example of ' making history relevant to the present ' and inventing stuff or leaving awkward facts out to fit in with ' the present ' - which all too often is to cater to the lowest common denominator , where you do n't trust your audience an inch , so you just ram stuff down their throats , knowing ( sadly correctly ) that you 'll always get away with it because there are so many dumb fools in the world.<br /><br />History is really about making us relevant to the past and seeing how it colours our present , for better and for worse . This rubbish was a great opportunity , lost again . They spent millions on it , and the locations and large scenes were impressive , but told us nothing at all we did n't know already , and promoted no understanding of this dark period in human history.<br /><br />WT
0 Well first off I 'd like to add that I myself is somewhat of a historian so what I look for in a film that is based upon historical events is that it is actually based upon historical facts . But this is however not the case here . Sure the movie is entertaining and all but the fact that it is n't entirely based upon true facts is more than annoying . Hitler was n't anti - semitic in his youth , he even worked for Jews before world war one . It was however during world war one and after that he formed his views about the Jews . His upbringing in this movie is also inaccurate , Hitler as a child was n't a disturbed little brat . He had a more or less normal upbringing . Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that adds to the puzzle that is Hitler.<br /><br />Robert Carlyle is a great actor but he does n't really fit in the role as Hitler . Hitler was n't as impossible and unstable as he is portrait - ed here . Under his younger years he was a charismatic person whom " manipulated " people through his charms . His unstable behavior and rage outbursts started in the turning point of the war.<br /><br />I'd like to see a film about Hitler 's life that is based upon real historical facts and not accusations . I really hate when people point a blaming finger at for example Hitler and others and tell inaccurate stories just to paint a picture of them as pure evil . It is much better to actually tell the story EXACTLY as it was so that everyone can learn what it was like ! The ones behind this movie should have made some research before making this . Because it seems as if they did n't even know what really happened . Hitler was n't even shot in the revolutionary march in Munch , his shoulder was ripped out of its socket.<br /><br />It gives you more to see a good documentary than seeing this .
0 I watched this hoping to find out something I didn`t know about modern history`s most infamous man and couldn`t help thinking that history has been rewritten in HITLER : THE RISE OF EVIL . Hitler was so obsessed with his niece that he threatened to have one of her admirer`s shot . Hitler turned up with a gun in his hand to arrest Ernst Rohm . Forgive me for asking but haven`t the writers confused Adolph Hitler with Tony Montana from SCARFACE ? That`s bad enough but what really offended me was that there`s entire chunks of historical context missing in this mini series . Germany lost the first world war and the allied powers made Germany pay a heavy price for doing so . It was this economic environment that led the German people to have someone - anyone - to restore their pride and that`s why they turned to Nazism . The German humiliation of the 1920s caused by the allied powers seems to be entirely missing therefore there is no way that HITLER : THE RISE OF EVIL can be taken seriously as a historical document , and I haven`t even mentioned that Himmler and Goering are conspicous by their absence < br /><br />There is one positive point about the mini series and that`s Robert Carlyle in the title role . Okay some of his mannerisms are wrong and his voice is a little too loud ( Archive recordings show that Hitler had a soft seductive voice ) but Carlyle is a charismatic actor and he does manage to communicate Hitler`s own charisma on screen . Comments in the British press that Carlyle resembles the synth player from Sparks more than Adolph Hitler are unfounded and he gives one of the better interpretations of Hitler.<br /><br />I liked the performance by Robert Carlyle but I hated everything else about this mini series and wondered why on earth it was made in the first place . There`s nothing to recommend it to serious history fans
0 Just imagine the real Hitler , who was a master of propaganda and speech , would have been such a mumbling moron as Carlyle portrayed him in this film.<br /><br />Nobody would have followed him , not even a desperate , unemployed guy in the 1920s.<br /><br />This is just a Hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself , disguised as " true history".<br /><br />I pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show . Carlyle and the producers did n't get anything right with this.<br /><br />Why was Hitler able to win so many people , a whole county for his ideas if we was such a sausage ? Why did people follow him to death ? By portraying him as such a loser they make their own film totally unbelievable . This film is a mixture of old WW2 propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important persons of the last century . Imagine a film about Churchill where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 mins . < br /><br />This film is a disgrace and I wonder how they could talk an actor like Carlyle into this dreck .
0 This could well be the worst film I 've ever seen . Despite what Mikshelt claims , this movie is n't even close to being historically accurate . It starts badly and then it 's all downhill from there . We have Hitler 's father cursing his own bad luck on the " fact " that he 'd married his niece ! They were in fact , second cousins . Hitler 's mother , Klara , called his father , Alois , " uncle " because Alois had been adopted and raised by Klara 's grandfather and brought up as his son , when he was really his nephew . Alois was much older than Klara and so as a child she 'd got into the habit of calling Alois , " uncle." < br /><br />The scene in the trenches where Hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers . We see Hitler chase the dog through the trench , when he catches up with the poor thing he proceeds to thrash it for disobeying him . In the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and chastise the cowardly little man , but then a shell lands directly on his persecutors , and every last one , we are told , is killed outright . How then , if Hitler was the only person to survive the scene , did this tale of brutality and cowardice come to be told ? Did Hitler himself go around " boasting " about it ? - I do n't think so.<br /><br />Next up , Hitler bullies and intimidates a poor , stressed out and war weary Jewish officer into giving him an Iron Cross ! I can only assume that this Jewish officer had been a pawnbroker before fighting for the Fatherland , and had thoughtfully brought along some pledged medals from his shop , because I 'm certain that Iron Crosses were not being handed out as shown in this comic farce.<br /><br />All the grotesque clichés are here , not least the calming and hypnotic effect of Wagner 's music upon the little man . If only the producers had kept Ian Kershaw on side . Then they might have discovered that Franz Lehar 's " Merry Widow " was more likely to float the Fuhrer 's boat than any " Flying Dutchman " from the cannon of Richard Wagner!<br /><br />Hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people but how can he ever be forgiven for his appalling taste in music?<br /><br />I could go on but I 'd be at it for hours.<br /><br />Give it a miss .
0 I saw that movie , and i was shocked ! Robert Carlyle is n't Hitler he is a man who sadly tries to be Hitler . The Movie lies , it does n't reflect the truth . In the scene were Hitler hit the guy with his gun . Hitler never had hit anybody , he would n't hit people with his fist , but with the fists of soldiers . Understand ? ? Another thing is : It is too obvious , that Hitler is that evil , he was more clever , than shown in this movie . No German would have accepted him as the leader , because the can see that he is evil . So the real Hitler have n't shown his evil side to the people.<br /><br />Have any of you Yankees watched the movie " Der Untergang " or " The Dawnfall " ? this is a great movie , with amazing actors . And its a German movie . I think , this Theme of Nazi - Germany , should not be realized as a movie by people who do n't know anything of Germany . People ! Watch " Der Untergang " : < br /><br />http://www.imdb.com / title / tt0363163/<br /><br />Its a great movie about a very sad period of time for human beings around the world .
0 If another Hitler ever arises , it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film , which propagates the absurd notion that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start . Far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land , sane people would cross the street to avoid him , and he would have died in a ditch , nameless and unknown.<br /><br />Anyone who reads the accounts of Hitler 's close companions - the autobiography of his secretary Traudl Junge for instance - will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly , intelligent , generous man . He was also a brilliant orator , and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and ranting to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made , when strutting pomposity was common in political speeches . Ditto the overstated anti - Semitism , which was neither a central plank of the early Nazis - who were primarily anti - communist - nor uncommon or unusual for the times . The film makes it look as though Hitler 's sole ambition from the start was the Holocaust.<br /><br />If you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of tens of millions , you can ignore fleck - lipped ravers life the one portrayed here . Look instead for a charming , charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation , and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country . I 'm afraid his personality will be much more like Barack Obama 's than Fred Phelps'.<br /><br />I hoped for much here , and got nothing but caricature . The fools who made this thing perpetrated a crime against reality . This is the historical equivalent of ' Reefer Madness ' .
0 This is by far one of the most boring and horribly acted accounts of the early days of Adolf Hitler that I have ever watched . Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor , but to cast him as Hitler is just plain wrong . To cast Liev Schrieber as Hitler 's longtime friend and aid , Haefengstal must have emitted cries of despair and anguish from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre . A J - W playing a Nazi supporter , bad bad bad casting . This was not an enjoyable family film with a good historical background . This was Hollywood rubbish at its finest , cashing in on the strength of a strong ( but sorely under utilized ) supporting cast of actors whom seemed to have all but disappeared from the acting radar in the past 5 years.<br /><br />The fake German accents ( vee vill vin zis var ) is insulting to German people everywhere . My mother is German and she sat fuming at the sound of the voices which kept switching from American / English / German all in the same sentence . The supporting cast make better cardboard cutouts at the local video store than they do on screen . Jenna Malone as the fated Geli Raubal , was splendid though , she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who ultimately ended her own life to escape what her future would have been like in Hitler 's shadow.<br /><br />If you would like a tremendously fantastic and historically accurate account of Hitler 's early years leading up to and including the war / holocaust , rent " Inside the Third Reich " 1983 starring Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi as Hitler . It was good and made more sense then this baloney.<br /><br />As a historical researcher of the Third Reich I can honestly tell you , this had me reaching for my books to confirm its myriad of inaccuracies .
0 The back cover of the DVD ( missed this one when it came out ) hails Hitler -the Rise Of Evil as " A Triumph " ( The New York Post ) and " Mesmerizing " ( Newsweek).<br /><br />Well , never mind the Post but really , who ever wrote that word in Newsweek in the same context with this peace of , ahem , art should be sacked.<br /><br />I do n't no where to start with . Why try to paint the picture of Hitler 's evil with colors that did not exist ? He was evil alright , but now his character is portrayed in way that is often historically inaccurate ( compared to his love of animals , the gentle and subdued way he treated women ) and so on.<br /><br />The actors are good , so you must feel sorry for them as they are imprisoned inside their one - dimensional characters . Some kind of curse here with Peter O ' Toole : This is the second time in his honorable career when he has ended up playing an old and failed leader in a failed movie ( or in this case TV - production , to be accurate ) . The first one was of course the legendary Galigula.<br /><br />The list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill the 1000 words allowed by IMDb , so I think I 'll leave it here.<br /><br />This one is OK if it 's on telly and you do n't have anything else to do , but believe me - it 's best left on the shelf in your local Virgin store .
0 I watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts . Actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities . Anyone who watched this film now probably think of Hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some Chicago gangster . I can only to say that there is much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that Rise of evil is very much under average . I can recommend German film Downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of Switzerland actor Bruno Ganz in a roll of Adolf Hitler .
0 Simply put , this is a simplistic and one dimensional film . The title , The Rise to Evil , should tell you that this is n't going to attempt to be anything deep or do much with Hitler 's character . Rather , from the first minutes of the movie where we see baby Hitler looking evil with evil music playing the background , we are given a view of Hitler that presents his as a cartoony supervillian , seemingly ripped right out of a Saturday morning TV show . The film REALLY wants to make its case that Hitler was evil but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler was evil ? Ultimately , making him such a one - dimensionally evil character is both boring and confusing ( one must ask how the inept , phsycotic character in the film cold ever persuade a nation to follow him or be named Time 's man of the year ) . This film had a great opportunity to take a figure who has committed some of the most horrible acts in the 20th century , and try to delve into his mind . Instead , it basically just says , " Hey ! Hitler was evil ! Just thought you might like to know ... " over and over again . The great irony is that the film still was attacked for presenting too sympathetic a view of the character . Give me a break .
0 I have rarely been subjected to such outright nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure . A horrible joke of a film , I cringed throughout . Terrible , trite , distorted and riddled with outright lies and half truths.<br /><br />The famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was to originally be a consultant for this film . However , he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused , and also demanded they stop using his name as a source ( it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved).<br /><br />One scene shows Hitler beating his dog . There is not one source for this . Hitler loved animals above people . He brought in the strictest animal welfare laws in Europe , banned vivisection and animal experimentation . He was also a vegetarian.<br /><br />The film turns his gaining of the Iron Cross into a farce , involving bribery . Utter lies . He was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time.<br /><br />There are no historical documents showing that Hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece . Not one.<br /><br />Apart from these , Hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage flick.<br /><br />If he was even half as ignorant , demented and thick as he is in this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he had ever existed . Never mind become the leader of Germany.<br /><br />Honestly , this film was utterly terrible.<br /><br />Go watch Downfall and give this a very wide berth .
0 I have recently watched this movie twice , and I ca n't seem to understand why the h*ll the makers made this pile of crap . I mean , yes , It gives a great impression of Hitler 's environment , and I mean the way they reproduced Austria in the late 1890 's , WWI and the Inter - war period . What I ca n't understand is why they pictured Hitler as a 100 % pure evil , mad , unreliable , mentally unstable freak . He was after all a very thoughtful , loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides , no doubt about that . But why in heaven 's name portray him in this way ? All of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario , leaving nothing but a very propaganda - like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever . Yes , he threw Germany into the devastating 2nd World War . Yes , he was racist , and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war . All true . But again ; why the hell did they plain LIE to the public ? To warn us?<br /><br />I absolutely do n't think this movie was a warning . The true danger of Hitler and the Nazi 's was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness . The fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every German alive ( not to mention Austrians and a LOT of other people ) makes it a warning to modern civilization , NOT the fact Hitler was such a ' weirdo ' . If it would have been like the makers make us believe - I would have been convinced that the German people were retarded . A man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler . < br /><br />4/10
0 I 'm not sure it was the language or the poor acting , but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake.<br /><br />After seeing Der Untergang this is a huge disappointment . There 's no connection between different scenes , and the acting is so incredibly poor I could n't even believe people could make such a mess of something that had great potential.<br /><br />And above all , everyone in Germany speaks English . Big mistake . The German language has a certain sound to it , and especially Hitler himself only sounds like Hitler when he 's speaking / yelling German.<br /><br />The way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot , the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened.<br /><br />Whether it 's the English or the fact that I 've already seen Der Untergang , everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous .
0 This 1919 to 1933 Germany looks hardly like a post WWII Czech capitol . Oh sorry , it is the Czech capitol and it is 2003 , how funny.<br /><br />This is one of the most awful history movies in the nearest past . Röhm is a head higher than Adolf and looks so damned good , Göring looks like 40 when he just is 23 and the " Führer " always seems to look like 56 . And the buildings , folks , even buildings have been young , sometimes . Especially 1919 were a lot of houses in Germany nearly new ( the WWI does not reach German cities ! ) . No crumbling plaster ! Then the Reichstagsbuilding . There have never been urban canyons around this building , never . And this may sound to you all like a miracle : in the year 1933 the Greater Berlin fire brigade owns a lot of vehicles with engines , some even with turntable ladders , but none with a hand pump.<br /><br />One last thing : What kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this at the final sequence ? For me this was a kind of " Adolf 's Adventures in Wonderland "
0 Advertised by channel seven in Australia as the " untold story " , this miniseries undoes itself in the first five minutes by washing over the titular character 's childhood and adolescence in less time than a good director will use to set up a single event . This cowardice and self - censorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series , and is ultimately responsible for its failure.<br /><br />Robert Carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of the twentieth century , but he is hamstrung by two things . The lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves his Northern - UK heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance , and the dialogue is at times truly abysmal . Apparently , acknowledging the fact that Hitler was raised in a Catholic family is off limits , but insulting millions of Vikings and their descendants by having Carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about Valhalla is quite okay . Well , here 's a clue for the writers - any person familiar with Viking mythology will tell you that Valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might in battle , two things that the Nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing . Until we can wake up to ourselves and realise that the reason Hitler has never been excommunicated from the Catholic church is because it would require the embarassing acknowledgement that he was once a member , we will never learn what this awful period of the world 's history has to teach us.<br /><br />So now that we 've managed to insult Vikings and the citizens of Scandinavian countries in this sham , you 'd think the series would stop there , but it does n't . Stockard Channing 's listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrow - raising , given that her voice is heard , and her face seen , for about thirty seconds at the most during the opening credits , making it patently transparent that more footage of Hitler 's early days were shot , but not included because of a typical nanny - state fear of offending someone . It is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into Hilter 's character do not feature him at all.<br /><br />Until we learn to stop sugar - coating the truth and realise that the citizenry of Germany was mostly unopposed to Hitler 's views , and not necessarily through ignorance , we will never learn to deal with the fact that subversions of democracy ( yes , Germany was a democracy pre - Hitler ) can occur anywhere , we are doomed . That 's the one thing this mini - series got right in portraying . Unfortunately , that element is lost in attempts to make Hitler 's religious beliefs appear those of a much more valiant people , and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter . David Letterman 's show had it pegged when they ran short satirical segments about the series . They really might as well have made a family sitcom with him as the star , that 's how badly it was written.<br /><br />All in all , this politically correct farce of a bio - pic is worth no points , but I gave it two because Robert Carlyle definitely deserves better material than this , and he is about the only thing in it that works .
0 If anybody really wants to understand Hitler , read WWI history not WWII history . Find out what happened during that war , how soldiers had to live around dead corpses all the time . How so many soldiers went insane , from what they saw during WWI , at the time they called it " shellshocked " now the call it post - traumatic stress disorder . If you learn the true horrors of WWI , you will begin to understand Hitler . You will understand how a human being can become desensitized to death , not because their evil but simply because it was the only way for them too cope with the horrors around them.<br /><br />This movie unfortunately misses that , as so many others do . Read some books on the subject and you should watch the movie " paths of glory " , the only good WWI movie ever made . You will see the frustration of the soldiers in that movie , the sense of helplessness , and a utter devaluation of human life , as nothing more than bullet catchers.<br /><br />Thats what this movie misses , its really the key point to understanding Germany . A lost war , where millions and millions of Germans lost their lives , for no real reason . Then comes an utter economic collapse , following the war . Those are the factors that create extremism.<br /><br />The loss of family members and massive poverty will create always lead to extremism . Unfortunately this movie ignored these factors , and has just become another throw away piece of crap to throw on the pile . With really no real value , there are fictional movie 's based upon fictional characters that could give you a better idea of Hitler than this does . They just threw Hitlers name on this so it would sell more .
0 First , before reading further , you must understand that I 'm not neo - nazi , I 'm just trying to understand correctly Hitler to be sure nobody like him take power again.<br /><br />I've seen this series and found it awful . I mean , OK , it 's interesting to look , but is it real ? I searched for answers and found one : absolutely not . First , Hitler was n't angry all his life , the series shows an angry Hitler , even when he is a child . Second , Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter , in fact , it is highly probable that Hitler , in reality , was gay and fought all his life to choke this secret . Third , people will hate me but it 's true : Hitler was charming . How do you think he managed to get to power if he was so hateful and ugly ? Because he was charming . That 's a common point I found in the interviews of people who live near or far of him ( of course , not Jews).<br /><br />This series was awful because if you think that Hitler was just an angry bastard , ugly , and of course , not charming at all , you 're wrong . If you think that , you will let people like him take power in countries and you do n't want that . If you really understand how Hitler managed to get into power , and stop thinking he was just awful , you 'll be able to find dangerous politicians like him ( of course , remember he was elected ) and stop theme before it 's too late.<br /><br />Life is important to protect , this series is just awful to show us the truth , if we continue to see Hitler like that , another one will take place exactly as the first did .
0 Having grown up in Texas , and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley 's , I can tell you that this movie is nauseating . The majority of Texans do not live like this movie indicates . The plot is weak , and the fake accents are amusing , and it reinforces the stereotypical image that all Texans are beer drinking , honky - tonkin ' , rednecks . The horribly fake Texas accents is what kills it for me . True , there is a certain Texas twang to most Texans ' accents , but these people overdo it . You ca n't get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Texas accents . It just does n't work . John Travolta should have stuck to disco - dancing or the 50s . Debra Winger was more convincing as Wonder Girl than she is as a Texan .
0 The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three major movies and really began to make a name for herself . Unfortunately , the studios had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here . Two of those things were singing and dancing . Another was a short , interesting film that kept people 's attention and got their minds off The Depression . You know the other keys to Shirley 's successful films.<br /><br />This film achieved none of the above , despite the star presences of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard and despite a very good director in Henry Hathaway . In addition , there are too many talky parts in here which become simply boring , and too many arguments between a sullen Lombard and Cooper . To top it off , you did n't get the normal feel - good ending which is what the public wants . I guess they learned after this movie .
0 The movie is an extra - long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventure 's spirit . The quite horribly American Patrick Swayze is cast as the British hero Allan Quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationality.<br /><br />The movie continues throughout to " Hollywood - ise " the story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold . The movie manages to be predictable throughout , even to those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequences.<br /><br />All in all , a terrible addition to the already quite bad collection of movies based on the legend of King Soloman 's Mines and Allan Quatermain .
0 OK . Not bad movie making if it were from an original script . BUT IT IS NOT!<br /><br />Which part of " in this story there are no women , except for Foulata and Gagoola " introduction by Haggard did the producers , directors and writers not understand ? I mean , it is pretty plain English . I understood it at age 10!. The beauty of KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds , the colonial Africa , the unforgiving desert and Kukuanaland , a hidden and isolated kingdom . That should be more than enough for even the most mediocre of producers to work with . But , nooo , they have to throw " romance " into it . Pathetic . Suggestion to all you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book . Give it up . Until a Peter Jackson wannabe comes along and " does it right " you may as well keep re - reading the tome . BTW , there is a sequel book ( actually a pre - quel ) called Allan 's wife . It gives background to the story of Quatermain . It is a bit creepy but good .
0 The movie is very lengthy and unfortunately pretty different from the Novel . If you want to see the movie then do n't read the novel first as it will shock you . However , cinematography was OK and if you are a person who loves adventure genres which explores Africa then go for it . Acting performances are adequate , however , many important events that were present in the novel are omitted . In the novel , Sir Henry Curtis was in search of his missing brother rather than a lady in search of her father . Gagool was cunning and was killed in the cave whereas here she was shown to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king .
