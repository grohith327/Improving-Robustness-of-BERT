1 Why ca n't this type of compact , entertaining mystery be filmed in the new century ? It keeps the viewer thinking and guessing all the way . The cast is a great ensemble . William Powell exhibits true star quality . Who knows -- perhaps he was rehearsing for his future as Nick Charles . He is a joy to watch . One also can see why Eugene Pallette made more than 200 films . He is a great supporting character actor and his excellent chemistry with Powell is fun to watch . Mary Astor does above average work in a not very meaty role . All other hands chip in to make this a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend 73 minutes . I suspect Michael Curtiz had a ball directing his one . Bravo !
1 This fantastic whodunit is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre . I was happy to see William Powell handling a detective story with charisma and charm , and without the silly attitude of his Nick Charles character ( from the " Thin Man " series ) . While the story is good on its own , I think what really makes this movie fun to watch is Michael Curtiz ' fantastically imaginative direction . From a visual point of view , this is a richly textured movie , with Curtiz showing an incredible command of the medium ; from split screen images , to weird camera angles and imaginative flashbacks , Curtiz demonstrates that he was one of the best Hollywood directors . Highly recommended if you are fan of this type of movie .
1 Talented detective Mr. Philo Vance ( William Powell ) cancels his overseas trip to investigate an apparently cut and dried case of suicide he has good reason to suspect is really something much more , a rather deliciously complex murder ! < br /><br />As far as murder mystery films go , it just does n't get any better than this one . Populated with suspicious characters , all connected to a dog show and all having very good reason to murder the apparent suicide victim Archer Coe , it 's truly tough to figure this one out or wrap one 's head around it but boy , does it proves fascinating to watch unfold before us . Even the cops , the coroner and the district attorney prove colorful , fleshed out characters adding a level of unexpected gritty realism to this one 's proceedings and amping up its overall " fun " factor . I particularly enjoyed the comic scenes involving the coroner ( played by Etienne Girardot ) , who is always it seems to him being rudely and untimely interrupted by the discovery of corpses or injured men during this one 's running time . Also Eugene Palette 's Detective Sgt . Heath provides welcome , often later delightfully humorous at his expense , critical commentary during Vance 's investigation . I can not think of any valid criticism to give this movie in fact except perhaps that it has n't dated particularly well . Does n't stop the movie from being just plain good fun viewing though . Watch and see if you can wrap your head around this one 's mystery . Highly recommended you try !
1 This is one of those movies that you wish you had n't seen before - so you could see it again " for the first time " . Van Dine 's books still bring pleasure - but are termed excessively flowery by many . This movie is by far the best film adaptation of his works . William Powell is William Powell - say no more . The plot is intricate . The story moves all too quickly , because you want it to last . Enjoy .
1 One of the better Vance films succeeds more on interesting plot and artful direction by none other than Michael Curtiz . This time around a generally hated financier is found dead - shot in the head - in his locked and bolted bedroom on the upper floor . Philo Vance , hearing of the situation while about to set off for Italy , decides to end his vacation and try to solve what he thinks is a murder and what everyone else is considering a suicide . William Powell is as affable a Philo Vance as you will find . He never seems to press and is always very smooth in what he says and does . Powell is aided by a host of very talented actors - some first - rate character actors and actresses like Mary Astor as a niece that hated her uncle , Ralph Morgan as the dead man 's secretary , Paul Cavanaugh as a rival dog fancier , Arthur Hohl as a mysterious butler , Helen Vinson as the next door kept blonde , and two really good performances by James Lee as the Chinese cook and portly Eugene Palette as a wise - cracking police detective . Add into the mix a wonderfully comedic turn by Etienne Girardot as a public coroner always missing his meal . It is this depth of suspects and a story that has many plots twists and turns that make The Kennel Murder Case a fast - moving , fun mystery .
1 William Powell 's final outing as Philo Vance occurs in The Kennel Murder Case where the murder of a championship show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human kind . It 's all in the figuring out of how that leads to the who and why.<br /><br />The Philo Vance murders by S.S. Van Dine were most popular at the time and the clever Mr. Van Dine figured out a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest studio bidder . This is why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studios putting them out . Had Bill Powell not gone on to greater fame with MGM as Nick Charles of the Thin Man series , he would have been known as the greatest of Philo Vances . < br /><br />It turns out that Powell had entered his little terrier Captain in the same contest where the murdered dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim . As usual Powell shows up Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was using his bulk to break down the locked from the inside door where the first murder victim was found.<br /><br />I did say locked from the inside and it was an upper story so it was in figuring out the how . Powell has a lovely group of suspects , as extensive as what normally is in a Thin Man mystery . People like Paul Cavanaugh , Helen Vinson , Ralph Morgan , Mary Astor , fill their cast roles well.<br /><br />Warner Brothers liked this version so much that in fact they remade it again in the Thirties with James Stephenson in his one and only outing as Philo Vance . It does n't hold a candle to this one.<br /><br />As this is the only Powell Philo Vance that is out on VHS or DVD by all means see this one or acquire it if you can .
1 A film that is so much a 30 's Warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output , unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object.<br /><br />Curitz was one of the quintessential Warners house directors working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality , working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at Warners , a studio that was one of the " big five " majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatres.<br /><br />Even though we have a setting of the upper classes on Long Island there is the generic Warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been " torn from the headlines " . Another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that " They 're not the trophies " gives the film a more working mans , down to earth feel , for these were the audiences that Warners were targeting in the great depression . ( ironically Columbia and Universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50 's when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent ) Curtiz has created from an excellent script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angles and swift editing.<br /><br />Thank heavens there is no soppy love interest sub - plot so the fun can just keep rolling along .
1 The unflappable William Powell . He is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without a care in the world . He always seems on top of his game and shows little care for anyone who doubts him . The murders are projects , barely human beings . I have noticed this is a staple of the whodunnit . Other than an occasional weeping widow , the victims fulfill the function of being the reason the movie exists . Nothing more . There are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way and Powell is a master at this . There is a lot of political incorrectness , especially as it relates to the Asian performers . This is a little hard to take . The cast is great , and Curtiz 's direction is also a consistent asset .
1 " Markham , " says urbane gentleman crime - solver Philo Vance ( William Powell ) to the district attorney , " I 'm coming more and more to the belief that Archer Coe was killed in this room . That poker , this dagger sheath , now these fragments ... it 's all here . " " But Vance , " Markham says , " do you mean to tell me a dead man walked upstairs ? " " I 'm not trying to tell you anything but the facts , " Vance says . " This is the most remarkable case in my experience . " < br /><br />We're sympathetic . Wealthy , arrogant Archer Coe , disliked it seems by all who knew him , had been found slumped in a chair in his bedroom , pistol in his hand and a gunshot wound to his head . But wait . Further examination shows Coe had been hit hard by a blunt instrument that fractured his skull . Then there 's the dagger wound in his back . Complicating matters is that Coe 's bedroom door and windows all had been locked from the inside . Coe was no suicide ; this was murder . But how could the killer have escaped ? What was the specific motivation since there are so many suspects ? And why was Coe 's brother , Brisbane Coe , found dead in the main - floor closet ? < br /><br />The Kennel Murder Case , now 73 years old , still provides a stylish look at the old locked- room classic whodunit . What makes it work as well as it does is , first , the mystery is complicated and clever , but still is logical . Second , is the amusing , assured performance of William Powell . Consider his work as Philo Vance as something as a rehearsal for his great performances as Nick Charles . Few things escape Vance . He uses his wits to piece things together . He 's also good company . Powell was a star in the Twenties and moved steadily upward in status and popularity when the talkies took over . His intelligence , style and effortless sophistication have made him one of the most contemporary - seeming of actors from the past . < br /><br />Also pleasant is seeing a few other great faces . There 's Mary Astor as Hilda Lake , the young , resentful and potentially rich ward of Coe ; Paul Cavanaugh as a titled Brit hovering around Hilda ; Helen Vinson with her notably sultry and selfish manner ( watch her really do her stuff in Vogues of 1938 ) ; Etienne Giraudot , a small elderly man as the fussy Dr. Doremus , whose job as coroner and medical examiner keeps taking him away from his meals ; and Ralph Morgan as Archer Coe 's private secretary . This movie has a high percentage of middle - aged men without an ounce of fat who can wear snug , English - cut tailored suits with ease . Most of all is Eugene Palette , with his noble belly and gravel voice , as Detective Sergeant Heath . Sergeant Heath and Vance are long - time acquaintances who actually seem to like each other .
1 While a 9 might seem like an unusually high score for such a slight film , however , compared to the hundreds and hundreds of series detective films from the 1930s and 40s , this is among the very best and also compares very favorably to Powell 's later " Thin Man " films . Now this does NOT mean that the film is that similar to the Thin Man movies , as THE KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy but more a traditional mystery - detective film . Now you 'd think that not having Nora Charles or Asta or a traditional comic sidekick ( something found in practically all series detective films ) along for fun would be a detriment , but I did n't miss them at all because this was such an exceptionally well - written film -- having a genuinely interesting case as well as uniformly excellent performances by all.<br /><br />The film begins at the dog show and is called The KENNEL Murder Case , though this Philo Vance film actually spends little of the time at the dog show and dogs are not a super - important part of the film . Instead , a thoroughly hated man is killed and left in a completely sealed room -- an idea repeated in quite a few other detective films ( such as CRIME DOCTOR 'S STRANGEST CASE ) . However , how all this is explained seems pretty credible and fit together very well -- keeping my interest throughout . I sure wish other detective films of the day had as intelligently written plots and exceptional acting as this one . This one is definitely a keeper .
1 This is still the benchmark to judge all Golden Age whodunnits by , and taking into account the limited technology and dubious ethical standards of the authorities ( on screen ) bears up well against all generations of similar attempts since on film and TV . Fast and furious with plenty of Warner Bros wipes , and thankfully no time for a love interest it gallops along , taking the splendid cast with it to the violent end . I never understood why the DA had to trail Vance around everywhere , I always thought they were deskbound . Palette as the detective but especially Girardot as the doctor are delightfully eccentric and un - PC - when glancing over the second murder victim he sniffs that there were too many people in the world anyway . Of course it is William Powell as Philo Vance ( and Michael Curtiz as director ) that makes the film what it is - when did Powell ever make a dud?<br /><br />The army of cops at the crime scene did n't really do a very good job in finding the second dead body and unconscious dog did they ! The best bit is where Vance narrates to us all the sequence of events surrounding the murders - dodgy model sets combine with fantastic roving camera angles to produce a very modern feel , and startling with what has gone before . The only problem is as usual the conclusion ca n't match the overall deductive processes displayed throughout and a somewhat contrived ending is invoked ; some Chan 's , Moto 's and many others of course could only be concluded this way too . But because it happens so fast and is ... slightly dubious morally it does n't lessen my opinion of KMC 's status as a classic!<br /><br />All the prints I 've ever seen of KMC are ( at worst ) like looking into a goldfish bowl , so if you 're interested in seeing it bear with it until you 're sucked in .
1 Philo Vance ( William Powell ) helps solve multiple murders among the wealthy after a dog show.<br /><br />Usually I hate overly convoluted mysteries ( like this ) but I LOVE this movie . It moves very quickly ( only 72 minutes ) , is beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz ( he uses tons of camera tricks that just speed the narrative along ) , has a very ingenious story line ( including a solution to a locked room murder that was just incredible ) and has a very good cast . < br /><br />Powell is very suave and great as Vance -- he does n't seem to be acting -- he IS Vance ! Mary Astor is n't given much to do but she adds class and beauty to the production . Everybody else is very good too , but best of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath . He 's a very good actor with a VERY distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilarious.<br /><br />Basically , an excellent 1930s Hollywood murder mystery . Well worth seeing.<br /><br / >
1 Before he became defined as Nick Charles in the Thin Man Series , William Powell played another urbane detective named Philo Vance . The supporting cast is strong in this early talkie , and Powell 's star quality is evident . Mary Astor , who eight years later would be defined by her portrayal of Brigid O'Shaughnessy , does a good job here as the featured woman who finds herself in the middle of it all .
1 " The Kennel Murder Case " starts off at a run and does n't stop until the very end . Everybody had reason to kill the victim , and several people tried . William Powell is terrific as Philo Vance , gentleman detective . Mary Astor is refreshing as the put - upon niece who only wants to marry her Scottish gentleman and enjoy her inheritance . This movie comes paired with " Nancy Drew , Reporter " on DVD , which is also fun . If you have to rent the disc ( or check it out from your local library ) , do it . It 's pure entertainment !
1 Cracking good yarn with all the actors giving great value . Michael Curtiz at his best . Lots of nice twists and turns and probably the best of the Philo Vance series . William Powell looks wonderfully relaxed and at his debonair best . A forerunner to the Thin Man series . Recommend to everyone . Did you figure it all out ?
1 Michael Curtiz directed this 1930 very - stylish whodunit from a script by Robert Presnell Sr . , Robert N. Lee and Peter Mine . The original novel they adapted was " The Kennel Murder Case " , perhaps from a writer 's standpoint the best of the Philo Vance mysteries by the strange S.S. Van Dine . Vance was a long - worded and superior detective genius , and his character being assigned to William Powell probably meant the executives at Warner Brothers were aware of the possibility that in less - engaging hands this detective might alienate viewers . Fortunately they assigned suave William Powell first to the character . ; later he was played by Basil Rathbone , Warren William , and Paul Lukas before being consigned to " B " picture status . The other question as always with Warner Brothers executives is why they chose Vance as a character ; their penchant was to choose men who operated outside the law , with no apparent discrimination between a vicious murderer and a champion of individual rights against all comers . This film has a despicable villain who gets murdered , and a claustrophobically challenging locale inside an apartment complex . The characters are unarguably unusually well - realized , the direction rather good and unusually swift - paced ; and except for a darkish B / W look , the film avoids the comedic asides , superfluous characters and irrelevant dialogue characteristic of many early detective entries . Jack Okey did the good art direction . The music by Berhard Kaun is serviceable ; Orry - Kelly did the costumes . William Reese provided the mostly - indoor cinematography . In the interesting cast , Powell is THE Philo Vance of his time , mostly sober - minded with just a hint of sardonic humor here and there . Eugene Palette is better than usual playing very straight as an admiring police partner to Vance , with his very professional timing . The other actor who comes off best is handsome Paul Cavangh , very effective as always in what was written as a red herring part . Mary Astor is attractive but at this point in her career she talked a bit too fast to be as effective as she later proved . Also in the cast were Helen Vinson as the villain 's woman , Jack La Rue , Ralph Morgan ( best known as Frank Morgan 's brother ) , Robert Barrat as the villain everyone has cause to kill , Archer Coe , and Frank Conroy as his likable brother with Robert McWade as the D.A. ; quirky and funny Etiienne Girardot has a delightfully witty part as the funny little forensics doctor who comes onto the crime scene . James lee as the abused Chinese servant is excellent and intelligent . The story breaks into four parts . First there is shad doings at a dog show , where Vance , Coe and Cavanagh are all showing West Highland terriers . Cavanagh 's dog is killed , by Coe , to prevent him winning the title over his own entry . The second portion of the scene involves a leave - taking ; someone is confused enough by who has gone where , after Coe parts from his girl friend , Vinson , to murder his nice brother by mistake . Enter Vance , to find out who did in Archer Coe in a locked room and how , with the help of Palette ; the romantic difficulties are straightened out , the Chinese servant is exonerated , we find out who broke the expensive vase , who will marry whom , how Archer Coe was done in and why the butler did not do it -- but someone else with a good excuse did . This is a more - than - good little mystery , which skilled Hungarian - born director Curtiz took quite seriously . He used wipes , swift cuts , changes of camera angle and alternations between straightforward and daring camera - work to achieve variety , interest and a sustained pace . Many writers , critics and experts , myself included , consider this to be the best of the Vance projects , although others are estimable as well .
1 There were times when this movie seemed to get a whole lot more complicated than it needed to be , but I guess that 's part of it 's charm . Detective Philo Vance 's powers of observation seem greater than all the Oriental sleuths of the era combined when it comes down to that final evaluation of how the murders were committed . The dropping of the dagger into the Chinese vase was the kicker for me ; I mean , could n't somebody have just dropped it ? < br /><br />Vance ( William Powell ) had a line early in the film about Archer Coe 's ' psychological impossibility ' to kill himself - I had to think about that for a while . I was left wondering if there 's some scientific basis in fact for that concept to be true , not having studied psychology myself . Seems logical , but then there 's always the case that does n't fit the rules.<br /><br />You know , I got a kick out of the agitated coroner ( Etienne Girardot ) , who reminded me of Star Trek 's Dr. McCoy the couple of times he stated " I 'm a doctor , not a magician " and " I 'm a doctor , not a detective " . I can picture DeForrest Kelley watching the film and saying to himself - ' I 'll have to use that sometime'.<br /><br />Once the killer 's identity is revealed , it does n't seem like such a big surprise , but up till then it 's really anybody 's guess . But Archer and Brisbane Coe aside , the film did n't answer the central question posed by the title , and the murder I was really interested in - who killed Sir Thomas MacDonald 's dog Ghillie ?
1 Enjoyed viewing this film on TCM and watching a very young William Powell , ( Philo Vance ) playing detective just like he did with Myrna Loy in the " Thin Man Series " . Back in the 1930 's William Powell played in the Philo Vance Series and in this picture , the famous veteran actress Mary Astor , ( Hilda Lake ) becomes one of the suspects in a murder / suicide case where a man named , Archer Coe , ( Robert Barrot ) is found dead and Archer was in a room that was bolted from the inside . Ralph Morgan , ( Raymond Wrede / Archer 's Secretary ) gave a great supporting role and was the brother to Frank Morgan who appeared " In the Wizard of Oz " 1939 . Eugene Palette , ( Detective Sgt . Heath ) appeared in quite a few of these Philo Vance films and also gave a great performance in " Robin Hood " with Errol Flynn . Always remember , the least likely actor could very well be the killer . Enjoy a great Classic from the past .
1 William Powell is Philo Vance in " The Kennel Murder Case , " a 1933 film also starring Mary Astor , Paul Cavanagh , Eugene Palette , Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan . A dog show in which Philo has entered his Scottish terrier Captain serves as the background for a locked room mystery with too many suspects . The mystery is very clever and the denouement both complicated and interesting . Since the talkies are still quite young , the camera work is a little static , but Michael Curtiz does a good job directing the action.<br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent ; the entire cast brings the film up a notch . Lots of actors have played Philo Vance , including Paul Lukas , Basil Rathbone , Wilford Hyde - White , Edmund Lowe , James Stephenson , Alan Curtis , Warren William and others . Powell played it the most ( five times ) and is the best fit for the role - very relaxed but serious at the same time . This was made before " The Thin Man " catapulted him to big stardom - he had spent about 12 years in film by then , beginning his career on stage in 1912 at the age of 20 . A remarkable man , a remarkable screen presence and a remarkable actor who lived to be nearly 92 . We 're so lucky to have his films available on DVD and on TCM today . " The Kennel Murder Case " is a great story and a fun film - do n't miss it .
1 The film starts in the Long Island Kennel Club where is murdered a dog , later is appeared dead as a case of committing suicide a collector millionaire called Arched , but sleuth debonair Philo Vance(William Powell)to be aware of actually killing . There are many suspects : the secretary(Ralph Morgan),the butler , the Chinese cooker , the contender(Paul Cavanagh ) in kennel championship for revenge killing dog , the nephew(Mary Astor ) facing off her tyrant uncle , the Italian man(Jack La Rue),the brother , the attractive neighbour .. Stylish Vance tries to find out who murdered tycoon , appearing many clues , as a book titled : Unsolved murders . The police Inspector(Eugene Palette)and a coroner are helped by Vance to investigate the mysterious death . The sympathetic forensic medic examines boring the continuous body - count .Who 's the killer?.The public enjoys immensely about guess the murder . < br /><br />The picture is an interesting and deliberate whodunit , it 's a laborious and intriguing suspense tale . The personages are similar to Agatha Christie stories , all they are various suspects . They are developed on a whole gallery of familiar actors well characterized from the period represented by a glittering casting to choose from their acting range from great to worst . Powell is in his habitual elegant and smart form as Philo . He 's protagonist of two famed detectives cinema , this one , and elegant Nick Charles along with Nora(Mirna Loy)make the greatest marriage detectives . Special mention to Mary Astor as the niece enamored of suspect Sir Thomas , she was a noted actress of noir cinema(Maltese falcon ) . The movie is magnificently directed by Hollywood classic director Michael Curtiz . He directs utilizing modern techniques as the image of dead through a lock - door , a split image while are speaking for phone and curtain - image . The tale is remade as ¨Calling Philo Vance¨(1940).The film is a good production Warner Bros , by Vitagraph Corp.
1 If you love The Thin Man series , you will love this movie . Powell 's character of Vance is very similar to his character of Nick Charles . There are even dogs . . .<br /><br />The chemistry between Powell and Astor may not be as fabulous as Powell and Loy , but it is n't half bad .
1 whereas the hard - boiled detective stories of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler have fitted to cinema like a fox in a chicken coop - indeed creating the definitively modern American genre and style in the process - those of what might be called Golden Age fiction have made barely any impression whatsoever . The problem with books like those of Agatha Christie , Dorothy L. Sayers or S.S. Van Dine ( on whose work this film is based ) , is that they are low on action or variety - whereas Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe traverse the mean streets of LA , working class tenements , bars , offices , wealthy mansions , and meet all sorts of exciting dangers and violence , Golden Age fiction is generally fixed in location , the scene of the murder , usually a lavish country house , and the action is limited to investigating clues and interviewing suspects . This is a very static procedure , plot reduced to puzzle.<br /><br />This , of course , is as much ideological as anything else , the Golden Age stories dealing with a society hostile to change and movement ; the hard - boiled novels recording an urban reality increasingly moving away from a centre ( both of authority , and of a city ) , dividing itself up into hostile , ever uncontrollable and lawless camps . Another major problem with Golden age fiction is character - because we can not know the answer to the crime until the end , we can not gain access to characters ' motivations or emotions , being defined solely by their potential need to murder . The detective , unlike the anxious , prejudice - ridden private eyes , are simply there to be brilliant , and maybe a little eccentric.<br /><br />The problem with most films from Golden Age books is that they try to be period recreations of the Merchant Ivory / Jane Austen school , and end up looking silly . There have been successes , for example the radical reworkings of Ellery Queen and others by Claude Chabrol . In the English - speaking world , there have really only been two . The Alistair Sim classic , ' Green For Danger ' , works because it pushes the form almost into parody , while never betraying the integrity or interest of the mystery.<br /><br />Before that came Michael Curtiz 's brilliant ' The Kennel Murder Case ' . The narrative is pure Golden Age . A repulsive character is introduced who gives a number of potential suspects reason to kill him . He is duly murdered in a seemingly foolproof manner , indicating suicide , slumped in a locked room . The caricatured policemen fall hopelessly for the bait . It is up to Philo Vance , gentleman and amateur detective , neither old nor fat , to read the clues more insightfully , open the case out of the confines of the room , and eventually solve the case , the corpse being little more than the pretext for intellectual stimulation.<br /><br />What is interesting is not this detective plot - which can only ever be unsatisfying as all solutions are - although it is rarely less than entertaining , and full of comical bits of business . There is n't even really an attempt to ' subvert ' the image of the perfect detective - there is one alarming scene where a brutal sergeant threatens to rough up a suspect , with no protest from Vance , but that 's about it.<br /><br />What marks ' Kennel ' as a classic is its modernity . Curtiz is not generally considered a great auteur , because he has no consistent themes or evidence of artistic development . But he was Hollywood 's greatest craftsman , and he is on sensational form here . if the Golden Age detective story is mere puzzle , Curtiz takes this idea to is logical extreme , creating an abstract variation on his source , reducing narrative , character and location to geometry , a series of lines , from the beautiful art - deco sets to the glorious camera movements which suddenly break from a static composition , and , as they glide furiously at an angle , jolt the dead decor to life.<br /><br />This treatment is appropriate to a story that resolutely refuses realism , it is a pattern that turns the detective plot into a hall of mirrors , like the two central brothers , or the original crime itself , borrowed from an ' Unsolved Mysteries ' book . This fantasy world of nasty rich men who collect Oriental relics ( shades of ' The Moonstone ' ? ) , inscrutable Chinese servants , ex - cons turned butlers , dog - loving fops , Runyonesque cops , is the perfect habitat for Vance , a man who will drop a cruise to Europe on a fanciful hunch , who knows the social world of these people , and yet is tainted by his interest in crime and association with the police , or would be if he was n't anything more than a thinking machine , William Powell , the greatest American comedian of the decade , bravely subsuming his idiosyncratic humanity.<br /><br />But if the treatment is rarefied , the climax is spectacularly brutal , involving vicious dogs and attempted murder . The police and the detective , supposed to be preventing crime , are guilty of inciting one .
1 Apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties , Eugene Pallette as the gruff police detective , Jack La Rue as the " swarthy " Italian and of course , James Lee as " The Chinese Cook " , this film is THE great mystery of a murder in a locked room . For an early 1930 's film , this step by step " peeling of the veneer of the mystery " is similar to the COLUMBO series , except in this film , you do n't have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance .
1 It appears even the director does n't like this film , but for me I think he 's being a bit harsh on himself.<br /><br />Sure it 's not perfect , but there are some atmospheric shots , and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout.<br /><br />It 's shot in what appears to be quite a pretty village which adds to the atmosphere as well.<br /><br />If you like horror films shot in England , give it a go.<br /><br />I have just seen a trailer for this directors latest film ' The Devil 's Chair ' which looks quite amazing.<br /><br />There are n't enough English horror films for me , so any that come along deserve our attention , and this one is n't as bad as you may think
1 I bought this while I was playing chess in Hastings . I am from Denmark though . It is very good . Definitely with an understanding of the horror genre . The monster towards the end is very scary . People who criticise this on IMDB should recall that it was a huge succes among serious horror critics.<br /><br / >
1 I think it was Ebert who gave Stella four out of four stars but , other than his , I have never read a positive review of this sadly misunderstood drama about class divisions , love , and sacrifice ( three themes most great romantic stories or films have in common).<br /><br />Here the major theme is class division . Stella is a story from depression era America . That said , it was translated to the screen then in such a memorable fashion that this remake ( if you ask a Stanwyck fan or two ) was not exactly appreciated . Fans of the original never gave it a chance . Furthermore , this version of Stella was made in the 1990s , not exactly a time of great financial trouble in America ( as the depression was).<br /><br />Now is the time to remove the rosy - coloured glasses , in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in America , and see that this powerful story still rings true , is as timely and relevant as ever , in its updated format.<br /><br />Yes , class divide is the major theme here . Stella is among the working poor , single , with big dreams but little hope of realizing those dreams . She works in a bar , does n't have much money , lives in a crummy apartment . You get the drift . In the morning , she does n't really want to get out of bed . On her wall , pictures of movie stars she idolizes.<br /><br />A man sees her dance at the bar . He 's wealthy , educated , from one of those upper class families that has nothing in common with Stella 's . His major concern is what ivy league college to attend , her 's is how to pay the rent , how to be ' happy . ' They have an affair . They like each other . Stella ends up pregnant . Stella tells the guy the news . His response ? " How about an abortion ? " She replies , " I just wanted a room full of balloons . " He supplies the balloons , and the proposal , but she sees his heart is not in it , and has too much pride to accept . She sends him packing.<br /><br />Her daughter is eventually torn between the two lifestyles -- the love she has for her mom and the advantages and happiness and love held out to her by her wealthy father . Stella , alone and unloved , and not wanting her daughter to become as unhappy as her someday , makes the ultimate sacrifice . She gives up the only love and happiness she has ever known to ensure the happiness of her daughter , and perhaps live vicariously , and with hope , knowing that at least her daughter found something to live for.<br /><br />Now , for the movie . Everything is right about it . Beautiful score , artful cinematography , great set design ( contrast between the two lifestyles ; the messy apt . and the decorated mansions ) , wonderful and heartfelt performances by the whole cast , with Bette Midler , in particular , Oscar - worthy.<br /><br />This is a film which is much more significant and well - made than you 've been led to believe .
1 First off , I would just like to say what a big fan of Bette Midler 's I am . Stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast ( Bette Midler , John Goodman , Trini Alvarado , Stephen Collins , Marsha Mason ) This is one of my favorite films of all time . It deals with a mother raising a child on her own , she goes through a lot of things that are out of her way to bring up her daughter Jenny played wonderfully by Trini Alvarado . This movie is very good and I suggest that you pick up a copy to watch it . Roger Ebert gave is 3 1/2 stars ! And it deserved 4 ! WONDERFUL ! I give it 4 out of 4 !
1 The original with Barbara Stanwyk is saved only by Stanwyk 's performance . The story and the other performances are too sickeningly sweet and the film itself is too dated to be really enjoyed today . Bette Midler 's version is much more interesting . She is Stella Claire , an independent , free - spirited single woman who gets pregnant and refuses help from her boyfriend ( Stephen Collins ) or her friend ( John Goodman in an underrated performance ) . She raises her daughter Jenny played so sweetly by Trini Alvarado and then comes to the conclusion that Jenny 's father can do better for her and ultimately makes a life - altering decision . Through out the film , there are plenty of laughs , tears and memorable moments mostly between Midler and Alvarado . Marsha Mason co - stars as Jenny 's would - be stepmother , who though wealthy turns out to be a very good influence on her . If you like Midler , Goodman or just good films with plenty of emotion you 'll enjoy Bette Midler 's version of STELLA .
1 This is the weepy that Beaches never was . As much as I wanted to love Beaches , it always seemed too hurried for me to " feel " for it ( its soundtrack is one of my favorite albums though ) . Stella , on the other hand , moves at a slower ( and occasionally too slow ) pace and though it 's somewhat manipulative in its tears - inducing tale about a self - sacrificial mother , it works because Bette and the rest of the cast turn in great performances . 10/10
1 I 'm amazed we see even one nay - sayer criticizing this old film . We do n't ordinarily get good opera films , and here is a true grand opera rendition . Understandably , the visuals are not great . It 's dated . But as opera it ca n't be faulted ; and I 'm an opera buff . I ca n't even detect one lip - sync ; if we did n't know that was Tebaldi in the audio nothing would convince me it is n't Sophia Loren . She does EVERYTHING with flair ! Her dark makeup is fine ; and she brought the role to gorgeous life ! The rest of the cast is wonderful , as is that stunning ballet troupe . Most of the actors are excellent ; Loren truly marvelous . Her rival Amneris is also terrific . Whoever did n't care for this 1953 job is shamefully remiss . Verdi would have enjoyed it ! Naturally , Renata Tebaldi as Aida is the engine behind the scenes . I love this old movie !
1 The whole point of making this film , one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera , was to make it more accessible to the masses . And it succeeded admirably in doing so . The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly . Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals ( a young Loren , handsome Della Marra , and a slinky Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much more believable , giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be . Altogether , an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi 's great works . I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera , a form with which I was then not well acquainted . I still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals . Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames , and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films .
1 David Zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce . Yes , it 's a matter of acquired taste and depends upon a wealth of sophomoric gags , but it is consistently funny throughout unlike some recent comedic efforts . The film is loaded with all kinds of jokes ranging from the blatantly obvious to the more subtler kind that you must pay attention to everything in the frame or you 'll likely miss them . Like his previous efforts which include " Airplane ! " , " Top Secret ! " , and " Naked Gun , " the humor flies out almost every second . There are so many moments that work , it 's easy to overlook the few that fall flat . What sets this movie apart from other pale imitations in the spoof genre is that it has an actual story line . While others have depended upon making fun of too many famous scenes in almost random movies ( take " Mafia ! " , please ) , this film tells a new story with likable characters . It touches upon sports films in general as well as satirizing the real sports industry instead of lampooning any specific movies . Even for people who do n't care for " South Park , " its creators , Matt Stone and Trey Parker , make a good pair of leading actors with natural chemistry . The film also makes extremely effective use of cameos of athletes , sports announcers , and other celebrities , especially a hilarious bit with Robert Stack of " Unsolved Mysteries . " By the way , stay through the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels . All in all , Zucker has achieved , in words perhaps applying to the movie 's mix of sports , a home dunk .
1 BASEketball is indeed a really funny movie . David Zucker manages to make us all laugh our heads off again , in a really silly , but many times smart , comedy.<br /><br />The 2 creators of South Park , the main actors in this film , play very good , surprisingly good actually , but this is the first time i see them as actors . The movie oftenly reminded me of South Park - one of my fav shows.<br /><br />It 's a really good and funny film , so do n't miss it.<br /><br />Vote : 7.5 out of 10 .
1 I thoroughly enjoyed this flick . I am of the firm belief that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comic geniuses of our time . They have the uncanny ability to add this level of absurdity to pop culture and make it rediculous but in a realistic way ... if that makes any sense . This is mainly what makes South Park soooo funny . Once you get past the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and indiscreet cartoon ever , you see in every episode the message that is being conveyed . That is apparent in BASEketball . Although it is directed by David Zucker and is utterly rediculous , it has a sincere message about corporate America and the disgrace that is major league sports . I am also a fan of sports so I find this movie hilarious at times because it is so true in that bizarre way that people hate to love . The opening prologue is brilliant ... tears from laughter form everytime I see those football players begin Riverdance ! Some may not like this movie because it 's just not everyone 's cup of tea ... but , just like South Park , once you look past the absurdity ... it has a really genuine message that is conveyed through literal comic genius . I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars .
1 Why the crap is this movie rated so low ? ! I 've seen this movie over 25 times , I know EVERY line to this movie . It 's obvious that I love this movie . Trey Parker and Matt Stone ( creators of South Park and the new puppet masterpiece Team America ) star as the main characters Joe Cooper , or Coop " Airman " Cooper , and Doug Remer , or " Sir Swish . " Mainly they 're just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie . Right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts , they even go as far as to make one up called " Townsell . " I must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts : " And after playing for New England , San Diego , Huston , Saint Louis , a year for the Toronto Arganauts , plus one season as a greater at the Desert Inn I 'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami . " His agent leans over : " Minnesota . " Let us not forget this important piece of the movie . So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates . Outside they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes . After shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year . During this time they manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak , which is actually a day after they invent the game . As the movie follows we find out that Coop , Remer , and Squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left . The story follows with zany blackmail , the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders , and humor so absurd it 'll leave you crying for more . Watch it dude , it 's hilarious .
1 This movie is just funny . mindless , but funny . to enjoy this movie completely you ca n't have a perception of how a film like this goes and just enjoy all the side jokes and puns which are involved with the film . I still find the bit at the start funny when he says " want a beer ........ cock " . funny stuff . but what makes the film decent is the fact that it does n't try to hard to create a serious spin on the film , too many comedies try to have serious aspects which you just do n't believe . But this is different and just focuses on being funny . I must say though , Yasmin bleeth is terrible in the film and adds nothing but the 3 main guys , coop , remer and squeak are very funny to watch and make the film great to watch
1 There really is n't much to say about this movie .... it 's crude , but fun.<br /><br />Plot outline ( From IMDB)<br /><br />_____________________________________<br /><br />Two losers from Milwaukee , Coop & Remer ( Parker & Stone ) , invent a new game playing basketball , using baseball rules . When the game becomes a huge success , they , along with a billionaire 's help , form the Professional Baseketball League where everyone gets the same pay and no team can change cities . Coop & Remer 's team , the Milwaukee Beers is the only team standing in the way of major rule changes that the owner of the Dallas Felons ( Vaughn ) wants to institute.<br /><br />_____________________________________<br /><br />The Acting is pretty good , since there arn't many big stars in this movie . Although I am not a big fan of ' Southpark ' , Parker and Stone do a pretty good job in their first real movie . < br /><br />There are so many funny moments in this movie I ca n't come close to naming them all . It never really lets up , and they do n't try to put some cruddy drama in to make it more serious . < br /><br />And my favorite aspect of this movie : The Soundtrack . It 's GREAT . I especially like " Take me on " and " Beer " by Reel Big Fish . Very underrated.<br /><br />Overall , a crude , but extremely funny , movie . 10/10<br /><br />James " Black Wolf " Johnston
1 BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen . It is an off - the - wall movie starring South park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker . They play two slacker friends who create a sport in their driveway which goes on to become a national sensation . Most of the gags are indeed hilarious but the funniest parts of the movie is when players attempt to " psyche - out " other members of the opposing team . There is no rule about what is not allowed , so naturally they do the craziest things possible . One flaw of this movie is that the pace is way too fast , and after watching for about half an hour I found myself asking " Wow this this over already ? " Another hilarious part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continuously harass Squeak , who is a hyped - up little guy . BASEketball is a comedic classic with some very quotable lines , and it is very fun to watch !
1 There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie , but ca n't really do that can I ? This movie is a movie to watch if you just want to sit , laugh , cry and then pee . I 'm serious . Do n't watch this movie if you 're easily offended by profanity , sex , nudity , homosexuality ... and everything else associated with nature . Being a woman , and that might not even be a factor , I can watch this movie over and over again . Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant . Along with all their other debuts , I think Baseketball is the prize winner . I 'm laughing now just thinking about some of the stupid things they do in the movie . Watch the movie ! ! That 's all I 'm going to say . It 's sort of hard for me to leave this comment because I 'm one of those people , like Ozzy Osbourne , who has a curse word in almost every line that blurts out of their mouth when they speak . So I 'm keeping it professional . Best movie . Heck yeah ! !
1 For a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and Trey Parker and Matt Stone 's comic timing is perfect . There are dozens of funny moments to this fantastic movie . I especially like the multitude of colors and the way the clash in the sports arena scenes . Robert Stacks Unsolved Mysteries spoof is also very amusing .
1 Trey Parker and Matt Stone , the creators of the show ' South Park ' , return with something entirely different . They create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball . This sport is known as baseketball . It 's like basketball except that the rules of baseball are involved and there 's another letter e in the title . Here 's how you play : you just shoot the ball while these two guys try to distract you from making the shot . Sounds simple . In fact , I might try it one day . After the game hits the streets , it soon becomes a huge success . Who would 've known that 2 immature friends could invent a sport that became so successful?<br /><br />My opinion < br /><br />'Baseketball ' is a very crude and silly spoof filled with lots of slapstick violence , yet it actually delivers some laughs and plenty of entertainment . A definite recommendation for those of you who like slapstick and rude humor .
1 This film is excellently paced , you never have to wait for a belly laugh to come up for more than about a minute and there 's much more going on than the initial premise of the film . Throughout it there are mockeries of the traditional schmaltzy local - boys - done - good - overcoming - adversity genre of which this parodies . Do n't let anyone tell you that they 're trying to get cheap laughs just by using obscenities;- sure , there 's plenty of that but it 's all contextual , not gratuitous . I loved this film and it only cost me £ 2.99 on DVD , so in terms of entertainment value for money , it has been the best film I 've seen this year .
1 Here is one movie that is genuinely funny at every single moment that it covers . How can it not be given that this movie stars the creators of South Park and is directed by David Zucker ? When I first saw this movie , I did'nt immediately realise that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey but their talent in acting and writing came out as quite impressive . I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were really Matt and Trey , later on . The humor is sometimes crude , sometimes foul , sometimes brilliant , sometimes subtle , sometimes loud and sometimes stupid but overall , this is one hell of a movie that is without doubt , under rated . Well actually , its insane . Totally insane .
1 I must admit I am a big fan of South Park and was expecting Basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be ! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker , Matt Stone , and Trey Parker together . This movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously . The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly . The kind of humor present in Basketball was not popular upon the time of it 's release and had it come out today it would be a hit . Do n't bother trying to be critical , just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come . Recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor .
1 I found this movie to be very funny , I loved how it made of the politics of modern day sports . This movie is not as funny as South Park but it is pretty funny . And since I am a sports fan I loved how they made fun some of the more ridiculous things in sports . This movie is great for non sports lovers too , probably better for them actually since they have to go through life wondering why people follow sports so closing when there are so many insane rules and intricacies to sports and the fact that it means absolutely nothing . I also found the actual game they came up with to be interesting , it is sort of like horse with bases and psyche outs ( for the person shooting ) . Overall I highly recommend you see this movie , and believe that you will end up loving this movie . However if this style of comedy is not your favorite you probably wo n't like it . ( but that is with any comedy movie )
1 I thought that Baseketball was one of the most funniest films i have ever seen ! It 's witty humour made me giggle all the way through , and the fact that Trey and Matt are so over the top , boosts the film 's comedy . < br /><br />I have just bought Baseketball on DVD and its just one of those movies where you would never get tired of watching it . I have a very short attention span and i think this film has so any funny bits that it keeps me entertained throughout . The humorous quotes are memorable , and can make me laugh for hours if i remember them later .. <br /><br />So overall i think that Baseketball is brilliant movie which everyone should go see , especially if you 're younger like me as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards . < br /><br />P.s Does anybody think its weird for me to like them both ? hehe
1 This movie is about two guys who made up a sport on the spot trying to get 2 get the hot chick . BASEketball becomes a nationwide sport . Joe Cooper ( Trey Parker ) is the beloved captain , but is hated when he loses the NBA to some other rival team . He meets the girl of his dreams Yasmine Bleeth , and in the end they kiss . the first time i saw this movie i wet my pants it was so funny . a definite must see for all comedy fans . If you love south park you 'll love this ! Maybe do n't watch with kids it is bit inappropriate for little dudes . some duds give it 6 1/2 out of ten , i give it 11 out of ten . i like coop he rocks i got ta go bye bye thanks for reading this
1 Sometimes I just want to laugh . Do n't you ? No analyzing , no critiquing and no looking for deeper meaning . Rent this movie , watch it all and laugh your ass off . Do n't want to admit you liked it ? Fine . But do n't trash it here when you and I both know you liked it . It 's Damn funny !
1 Ernest Borgnine was so wasted in this movie . There was no point in putting this great actor in this movie . One of the greatest actors in the world wasted , and for what reason , none what so ever , so america if you want to put classic actors in movies DON'T WASTE THEM
1 BASEketball is awesome ! It 's hilarious and so damned funny that you will wet your pants laughing . I have seen it so many times I have stopped counting . But everytime it gets funnier.<br /><br />Trust me on this one ... BASEketball is a surefire hit and I loved it and will continue to love it . I hope one day there will be a special edition DVD brought out!!!<br /><br />Ten Thumbs Up ! ! !
1 Very possibly one of the funniest movies in the world . Oscar material . Trey Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before you see this I suggest you see " South Park " one of the funniest cartoons created . Buy it , you will laugh every time you see it . Pure stroke of genius . If you do n't think its funny then you have no soul or sense of humor . 10 out of 10 .
1 BASEketball is an extremely funny movie that delivers acting that generally makes the movie alot funnier , comedy material that is more than crap in your pants funny , and a pretty good plot despite the fact that its the classic slackers v.s the evil rich guy . The one and only thing I did nt like about BASEketball , was that that kid was nt really needed in the movie , but , if the kid was nt in the movie , some of the funny scenes would nt have existed . If you have read any pro reviews about this movie , exclude them all because basically all the reviewers did nt like this film . BASEketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want.8 out of 10 .
1 The creators of south park in their own film here , this is a brilliant film with a huge entertainment factor . If you like Naked Gun films and are not young and not too mature or serious on your humor , you 'll love this .
1 Parker and Stone transplant their pacy expletive - ridden humour from their animated masterpiece to a feature length live action film with generally good results . Much of the film is Trey and Matt running amok with their new toy box . The plot is simplicity itself : two average guys invent a new sport , a blend of driveway basketball with baseball scoring which becomes a national craze . Along the way they encounter numerous sporting movie cliches and send them up , along with any other bit of popular culture that comes into their sights . It runs like a stretched South Park episode , with the usual machine - gun dialogue , toilet humour and homilies from the heart.<br /><br />If this film has a weakness it is the association with the team that gave us " Airplane " and the " Naked Gun " series . This influence is clearly seen with the heavy use of lame sight gags and the presence of a glossy and rather two - dimensional Yasmine Bleeth in the role usually given to Priscilla Presley . Robert Vaughn does a little better playing the corporate b**tard that has been his party piece ever since " Bullitt " and Ernest Borgnine overacts as only he can , but one must admit he 's perfect for the role of the lunatic team owner.<br /><br />For those who have n't noticed yet , Parker and Stone seem to be more comfortable as rock star wannabes than comics . This manifests in the prominence given to the soundtrack in just about everything they create . As usual , they give a good selection here including the obligatory track by their own ultra - non - PC vehicle DVDA.<br /><br />A special mention must go to Dian Bachar , who deserves some sort of award for enduring the difficult job of playing Stan to Parker and Stone 's rampaging pair of Cartmans.<br /><br />In summary , this is an entertaining comedy which is held back from its full potential by too much reliance on the " Naked Gun / Airplane " formula . Parker and Stone could do something truly brilliant ( or absolutely awful ) if given full control over a future film . America , either lock these guys up or put them in charge .
1 This is the only David Zucker movie that does not spoof anything the first of its kind . The funniest movie of 98 with Night at the Roxbury right behind But I did not think There s something about mary was funny so that does nt count except for the frank and beans thing he he . Do nt listen to the critics especially Roger Ebert he does not know solid entertainment just look at his reviews . Anyway see it you wo nt be dissapionted
1 Well the main reason I tuned in to watch this film is because it was done by Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park fame . However as soon as the film started the laughs started erupting from my belly . From the subtle gestures towards a joke , to the blatant toilet humour throughout , along with a constant reliance on some very witty innuendo . This film could ruin event he sternest mans poker face , let alone his poker underwear . Some of the funniest blink and you 'll miss it jokes ever portrayed in Hollywood , along with constant critique of themselves thrown into the bargain.<br /><br />I just goes to show that not only is Trey Parker adept at writing he 's not too shabby at the old acting game either . I was surprised with the amount that I was absorbed in this film . However I 'm quite worried that it is not available to buy over the internet , here in the UK . Sort it out boys!<br /><br />I am , and will continue to show it to all my friends annoyingly pointing out the funny bits , and occasionally snorting into my lager . All in all an excellent film if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy . However if you have no sense of humour about silly or rude things steer well clear ! However I 'm sure the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could have you gurgling past those prejudices .
1 It was a saturday night and a movie called BASEketball was on TV . I had always wanted to watch it but never got around to it when it was in the cinema . Boy was i mistaken . Words can not describe how funny this film is , starring the creators of South Park , who share a natural on screen chemistry when being funny . I taped the replay the next day and exactly one week after watching it for the first time , i have seen it 7 times!!. I m obsessed with it , and i know anyone who appreciates trey and matts work will appreciate this movie . A MUST SEE , THIS IS MY # 1 COMEDY OF ALL TIME
1 A comedy of epically funny proportions from the guys that brought you South Park , and most of the guys from Orgazmo . This vulgur , obscence movie has utterly disgusting , eggotistical , and satirical content . It portrays incredibly cruel treatment of humans and animals . I LOVE IT ! ! ! ! ! This is some funny stuff . Really funny . Two loser friends create a game in thier driveway , which explodes into a national sensation . Corruption and greed and blackmail turn the sport sour , and its up ta Coop ta fix it . And along the way , you will laugh . Alot . That 's all there is . Enjoy ! ! ! !
1 Witty and disgusting . Brash and intelligent . BASEketball redefines comedy / sports with a pot spoof of an easy target . Makes other so called comedies like dead boring . One of the best of all time ! Trey Parker and Matt Stone play their roles as losers with apt perfection .
1 There are very few performers today who can keep me captivated throughout an entire film just by their presence . One of those few is Judy Davis , who has built a successful career out of creating characters that are headstrong in attitude but very vulnerable at heart . She takes roles that most other performers would treat melodramatically and adds a fiery , deeply emotional intensity that pulls attention away from everything else on the screen.<br /><br />Her skills are well displayed in " High Tide , " a film that matches her up a second time with director Gillian Armstrong , who gave Davis her first major success with " My Brilliant Career . " In that film , Davis played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world , despite the suffocation she felt from her community and upbringing . In " High Tide , " however , Davis ' character , Lillie , is roughly the opposite : she gave up on any hope for her future when she was young , and , after giving birth to a child , runs from her responsibilities and takes up a life without direction or meaning . When she finally meets up with her daughter years later , the thought of taking care of her child is petrifying ; she knows this is her chance to atone for her failures , but how can she be honest with her daughter and still gain her respect?<br /><br />Gillian Armstrong 's films usually relate stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other , but face obstacles set up by their own personal habits and addictions . " Oscar and Lucinda , " for instance , was about a man and a woman who desperately needed each other 's love but were always blindsided by their craving for chance , represented by their gambling addictions . Here , we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the mother 's inability to commit to a settled life and her struggles to redeem herself despite being fully convinced that it 's too late to change for the better . This is not simply a film with a great performance at its center , but also a rare achievement : a fully convincing story of redemption .
1 There 's a certain allure I 've always found in discovering the great ( semi- ) unknown film . These discoveries have nearly always been dramatic films - in my experience , unknown sci - fi , action and horror are unknown for very , very good reasons . I found " High Tide " on video at a junk store , mixed in amongst countless dozens of tapes of varying quality . Of course , that 's the only place I would find it , as it is still not on DVD.<br /><br />While I was watching Judy Davis ( as Lillie ) throughout the course of this film , I was somehow certain I was watching a great undiscovered performance . Yes , I had previously seen Davis in several small parts - and one starring role in " A Passage to India " . But , although she was superb in the aforementioned film , " High Tide " is a different animal entirely . Since recently watching Gillian Armstrong 's later film , " Charlotte Gray " , I was acutely aware of the sort of actress which impresses her . Davis draws much more than a passing resemblance to Cate Blanchett - in both manner and sensibility.<br /><br />Judy Davis ' performance is stunning , I can not say enough good things about it . She shares an amazing on - screen relationship with young Claudia Karvan ( as Ally ) , this film 's other great actress . There 's a lot of drama and quiet humanity they share together , the details of which I wo n't presume to reveal here ( see it for yourself ! ) . There 's too much good in " High Tide " to cover in one review . Indeed , I would hardly care to - the film speaks well enough for itself . In conclusion , I would like to praise screenwriter Laura Jones for her stunning dialogue , director Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of actors , and the great Russell Boyd for his brilliant , understated cinematography ( please see his work in " Tender Mercies " ) .
1 This film , though , critically acclaimed , has of course not yet been released in the U.S. on DVD , like another great - Christine Lahti 's " Housekeeping " , out the same year . But if you can support Region 4 ( Australian ) DVD 's , this little masterpiece should be in your collection . There are still some VHS copies available on the internet as well . Davis is complemented by a great story , as well as memorable performances from her supporting cast , especially Claudia Carvan and the late , great Jan Adele . Amazingly , or maybe not , this film and its stars went unacknowledged at Academy Awards time , as did " Housekeeping " , but treat yourself to both of them - you will be glad you did !
1 This is not the stuff of soap - operas but the sort of conundrums that real people face in real life . A testament to the ensemble and director for the powerful story - telling of fallible characters trying to cope but not quite succeeding .
1 Judy Davis shows us here why she is one of Australia 's most respected and loved actors - her portrayal of a lonely , directionless nomad is first - rate . A teenaged Claudia Karvan also gives us a glimpse of what would make her one of this country 's most popular actors in years to come , with future roles in THE BIG STEAL , THE HEARTBREAK KID , DATING THE ENEMY , RISK and the acclaimed TV series THE SECRET LIFE OF US . ( Incidentally , Karvan , as a child , was a young girl whose toy Panda was stolen outside a chemist 's shop in the 1983 drama GOING DOWN with Tracey Mann . ) If this films comes your way , make sure you see it ! ! Rating : 79/100 . See also : HOTEL SORRENTO , RADIANCE , VACANT POSSESSION , LANTANA .
1 Yeah , it 's a chick flick and it moves kinda slow , but it 's actually pretty good - and I consider myself a manly man . You got ta love Judy Davis , no matter what she 's in , and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural , convincing performance.<br /><br />The scenery of the small , coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie . The unknown ( at least unknown to me ) actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention . Overall , I give it an 8/10 . Go see it .
1 If you were ever sad for not being able to get a movie on DVD , it was probably ' Delirious ' you were looking for . How often do you laugh when watching stand up comedy routines ? I was too young to see Richard Pryor during his greatest time , and when I was old enough to see Eddie Murphy 's ' Delirious ' and ' Raw ' ( not as funny ) I never knew where Eddie got a big part of his inspiration . Now that I 'm older , and have seen both Pryor and many of the comedians after Murphy , I realize two things : Everybody STEALS from Eddie , while Eddie LOVINGLY BORROWED from Richard . That 's the huge difference : Eddie was original , funny , provocative , thoughtful  and more . He was something never before seen . He was all we ever needed . These days Eddie Murphy is boring and old  but once upon a time he was The King , and ' Delirious ' was the greatest castle ever built . Truly one of the funniest routines of all time .
1 This is the funniest stand up I have ever seen and I think it is the funniest I will ever see . If you do n't choke with laughter at the absolute hilarity , then this is just not your cup of tea . But I honestly do n't know anyone who has seen this that has n't liked it . It is now 17 years later and my friends and I still quote everything from Goonie Goo Goo to the fart game , Aunt Bunnie to the ice cream man , Ralph and Ed to GET OUT ! ! There are just so many individual and collective skits of hilarity in here that if you honestly have n't seen this film then you are missing out on one of the best stand - ups ever . Take any of Robin Williams , Damon Wayans , The Dice , George Carlin or even the greats like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx and this will surpass it . I do n't know how or where Murphy got some of his material but it works . That is what it comes down to . It is funny as hell.<br /><br />Could you imagine how this show must have shocked people that were used to Eddie doing Buckwheat and Mr. Rogers and such on SNL ? If you listen to the audience when he cracks his first joke or when he says the F - word for the first time , they are in complete shock.<br /><br />His first time he says the F - word is when he does the skit about Mr. T being a homosexual.<br /><br / > " Hey boy , hey boy . You look mighty cute in them jeans . Now come on over here , and f@ * * me up the ass!" < br /><br />The crowd erupts in gales of laughter . No one was expecting the filthy mouth that he unleashed on them . But the results were just awesome . I have never been barraged with relentless comedy the way I was in this stand - up . In fact , the next time my stomach hurt so much from laughing was n't until 1999 when I saw SOUTH PARK : BIGGER LONGER AND UNCUT . That comedy was raw and unapologetic and it went for the jugular , as did DELIRIOUS . I do n't think it is possible to watch this piece of comic history and not laugh . It is almost twenty years later and it is still the funniest damn thing on video.<br /><br / > " I took your kids fishing last week . And I put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing pole back in the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes Gus . Normal kids do n't do shit like that Gus . Then they started movin their heads around like this and the m****f * * * * * come up with fish . Then they looked at each other and said Goonie Goo Goo ! I said can you believe this f****n shit?!" < br /><br />See it again and be prepared to laugh your freakin ass off!<br /><br />10 out of 10
1 It should be against the law not to experience this extremely funny stand up show with Eddie Murphy . I have never seen anything like it.<br /><br />Murphy goes on for almost 70 minutes about dicks , pussy , tits and insaults so many famous people including his own " family " . Among the people who gets it by murphy are : Elvis , Mr . T , Michael Jackson , Stevie Wonder , Mick Jagger , Luther Vandross and James Brown . I have seriously never laughed so hard of anything my entire life . I mean , when a person does n't know who Mr. T is , but still laughs so hard of Murphy as Mr. T , there 's something about it . At the time I saw the show I could n't remember who Mr T. was but still laughed . Now I know who he is and that just makes it so much more funny . Because that 's what Eddie do - he can make those impressions so good that it do n't matter who the hell he 's trying to do , it 's still hilarious . And on top of that , we learn that Murphy actually is a very good singer . Please watch it ..
1 If you have n't seen this , you do not know what you are missing . The first time you do , you will litteraly be in pain lying on floor throwing up from laughing so hard , and having probably wet yourself as well.<br /><br />It is THAT funny . There has n't been a single comedic performance to this date that I have seen that tops this or even comes close . So many classic one liners , stories , and segways .. <br /><br />The drunken uncle at the BBQ , Gi Joe , Mr T , goony goo goo , ice cream man , you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and I 'll bet you dollars to doughnuts they will not be able to keep a straight face and will burst out in laughter , or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act.<br /><br />Pure classic ! ! Shame you ca n't get it on DVD .. <br /><br />Rating 10 + out of 10
1 I 've never laughed and giggled so much in my life ! The first half kept me in stitches ; the last half made me come completely unglued ! I think I giggled for 15 minutes after the tape was over.<br /><br />His timing and delivery for his stories is almost unequaled . And though he talks fast , you catch every joke . Which is probably why my " laugh center " was so overwhelmed ; it took an extra 15 minutes to laugh at everything.<br /><br / >
1 I watched this film a few times in the 90 's and nearly split my sides laughing each time . I love Eddie Murphy as an actor , but this stand up is some thing else . He is SO funny . Even the P.C. brigade would find this hilarious . It 's a must watch , and even better if you 've got the guys or girls in for a drink . The take off of Michael Jackson is so like him , if you close your eyes you believe it 's him singing . The things he describes are true to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was not funny . My local video stores do not stock this video any more but I would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate the humour . Anyway , highly recommended , hope you enjoy .
1 This is hands down the greatest stand up show ever . I 've seen a lot of stand up shows , been to a lot of stand up shows , and watch Bet 's Comic View , but I have never seen anyone who could match the skills of Murphy on this show . The impressions are excellent , the skits are great , and the timing is perfect . You can even tell the crowd gets really into . When he did Raw a few years later it was also really good , but this is # 1 in my book . Also shows that at one time , particularly the early - to mid eighties , that Murphy was funny . My favorite parts of the show is when he is retelling the family barbecue and " Ice cream ! ! ! Mooommmm ! ! The ice cream man is coming ! ! ! ! " Another great part is where his mom is like Clint Eastwood .
1 OK , I do n't really think that Trailer Park Boys has bad story lines , because they kick ass . They just ... conflict with each other.<br /><br />For Example : Near the end of the movie , it shows Ricky and Julian telling " Patrick Lewis " to put the dog down and walk away . Then at the end , it shows Ricky and Julian saying that they 've been in jail for 2 years . In the TV series pilot , the first clip they show is the same clip of Ricky and Julian yelling at " Patrick Lewis " . But in the TV series , they 've supposedly only been in jail for 18 months.<br /><br />Also , they give us the impression that the movie 's story line and the TV series ' story line are connected ( because of the yelling scene between the guys ) . But some actors portray totally different characters . Of course , Patrick Roach plays " Patrick Lewis " in the movie , but in the series he plays Randy . Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys who pays Ricky for an extermination , and then he plays Sam Losco in the series.<br /><br />Also ( again ... I know , I have a lot to say ) , in the movie , the guys snort coke instead of smoking hash . The thing is , they never actually confirm that the two story lines are connected in anyway , other than the yelling scene.<br /><br />Sorry to keep on blabbing .
1 This is how i felt while watching this film . I loved it . It was hilarious . But i did feel a like i was getting sneaky view into somebody 's psyche and then laughing as it got twisted around to make an interesting point . A friend put it this way:<br /><br />"I feel like we broke into somebody 's house and are now watching their awful home videos without their knowledge".<br /><br />Another one of those fact is stranger than fiction pieces of film . " Groovin ' Gary " , the original " Beaver Kid " , is a small town guy who turns up at a nearby TV station in the hope of getting on film - and he certainly does , though not , perhaps , as he initially expected . With high hopes of fame and significance he invites Harris to come and film a truly awful talent quest that he has organised in his home town - headlined by his own drag act " Olivia Newton - Don " . < br /><br />Director , Trent Harris , does a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story . Some footage of an awkward kid who wants to be someone morphs , over two subsequent reinterpretations , into the story of freedom from repressed sexual identity in small town America . Harris simultaneously critiques the attitudes of small town America , the cult of celebrity , and the exploitative practices of the film and television industry.<br /><br />Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover pull out stunner performances . a young Sean Penn is the most evocative - so closely does he follow the actual ' Gary footage ' , but with strong nuances given to push the sense of the interaction the way Harris wants it to go.<br /><br />In the end the wide - eyed naivety the original Gary is what moved me - when contrasted against these possible interpretations of his situation.<br /><br />A film not to miss . I have not seen anything else like it.<br /><br />Jacob .
1 If you are a Crispin Glover fan , you must see this . If you are a Sean Penn fan , you must see this . If you are a movie fan in general , you must see this . If you have no idea who Crispin Glover is and you have no idea who Sean Penn is , this film will probably still have a lot of value , but the more work you 've previously seen by Crispin or Sean , the better.<br /><br />This movie is so funny , but it is also pure genius . There is nothing that I know of that resembles this film . It is its own genre . I doubt that anything like it will ever be made again . I can not say anything more about exactly why without partially spoiling it , and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job at doing that . < br /><br />In response to any of the reviewers here that gave it a bad review , I ask that you view the film again . In reality , there is no point at which this film could fairly be called " boring . " This is possibly the funniest , most entertaining , and least boring film ever made . And it only gets better with age and repeated viewings . A timeless classic that , unfortunately , very few will be able to claim to have seen.<br /><br />Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris , also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed , which Crispin Glover also stars in.<br /><br />Unfortunately , copies of this film are rare and hard to find . I managed to find a VHS version after some diligent searching though , and there are a couple of ways to find it that I know of . But I really wish someone would put this onto a DVD .
1 This movie is amazing for several reasons . Harris takes an extremely awkward documentary and turns it into a relevant social commentary . Groovin ' Gary is a small - town kid who is ( assumed ) well - liked for his many impersonations . When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a local talent show ( for whom he is very passionate ) , Gary 's actions show that he is at odds with the conservative social environment in which he lives . This results in him making various justifications for his actions so that people will not think that he is in fact a transvestite or other such social outcast . In the second installment , Harris exploites the struggle between Gary and Beaver in a novice attempt to make a narrative out of the original documentary . The third and final installment to the trilogy is truly amazing for Harris ' extreme sensitivity with the subject . Unlike the second installment , " The Orkly Kid " shows Gary as a truly troubled character . He struggles to gain acceptance within his own community to no avail . His secret passion for dressing like Olivia Newton John distances him even further from the people that already consider him a social outcast . The movie is depicted so realistically that , like reality , it lends itself to many reactions . Surely , one can see Gary as a ridiculously pathetic character , but may also identify with him as an outcast .
1 THE BEAVER TRILOGY is , without a doubt , one of the most brilliant films ever made . I was lucky enough to catch it , along with a Q&A session with director Trent Harris , at the NY Video Festival a few years back and then bought a copy off of Trent 's website . This movie HAS to be seen to be believed ! I sincerely recommend searching for Trent 's name on the web and then buying the film from his site . He 's an incredibly nice guy to boot . Do n't get confused : The cameraman in the fictional sections of THE BEAVER TRILOGY is NOT Trent!<br /><br />After having seen the TRILOGY a few times , I do have to admit that I could probably do without the Sean Penn version . It 's like a try - out version for the Crispin Glover " Orkly Kid " section and is interesting more as a curiosity item if you 're a Penn fan than it being a good video . Penn is pretty funny , though , and you can see the makings of a big star in this gritty B&W video.<br /><br />This is probably also one of Crispin Glover 's best roles and I would just love to see an updated documentary about the original Groovin ' Gary . Once you see this film , you 'll never get Gary 's nervous laughter out of your head ever again .
1 There has never been anything like it , that 's for sure . This episodic , seemingly redundant trilogy only really makes sense taken as a whole , and as such it is not a movie about Groovin ' Gary , Utah cross - dressing sensation . It is very self - consciously a film about how the filmmaker REACTS to Groovin ' Gary . For Harris the entire project is clearly an extended and spectacular contortion of guilt and repentance . He 's trying to atone for his sins - yes , Gary did attempt suicide after the initial doc was aired - through correction , commentary , and convention , reclaiming such Hollywood - narrative standbys as the best friend and the defiant happy ending ( two different ones , with a telling adjustment in the Glover version ) and turning them to his own very personal uses . So while thematically it remains a movie about gender and difference , the structure ensures that it is also a movie about MOVIES - but on an almost unprecedented level of complexity . There is just so much going on ; in telling and re - telling this story Harris is in the right place at the right time three times in a row , and he does n't miss the opportunity to make something of it . Immensely moving , and as profound as camp ever gets .
1 The short that starts this film is the true footage of a guy named Gary , apparently it was taken randomly in the parking lot of a television station where Gary works in the town of Beaver . Gary is a little " different " ; he is an impersonator and drives an old Chevy named Farrah ( after Fawcett ) . Lo and behold the filmmaker gets a letter from Gary some time later inviting him to return to Beaver to get some footage of the local talent contest he has put together , including Gary 's staggering performace as Olivia Newton Dawn . Oh , my . The two shorts that follow are Gary 's story , the same one you just witnessed only the first is portrayed by Sean Penn and the second by Crispin Glover titled " The Orkly Kid . " If you are in the mood for making fun of someone this is definitely the film to watch . I was doubled over with laughter through most of it , especially Crispins performance which could definitely stand on it 's own . When it was over , I had to rewind the film to once again watch the real Gary and all his shining idiocy . Although Olivia was the focus , I would have liked to have seen one of the " fictitious " shorts take a jab at Gary 's Barry Manilow impersonation , whic h was equally ridiculous .
1 Yes , this gets the full ten stars . It 's plain as day that this fill is genius . The universe sent Trent Harris a young , wonderfully strange man one day and Harris caught him on tape , in all that true misfit glory that you just ca n't fake . Too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man , if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellow 's story . The other two steps in the trilogy do retell the story , with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the roles of the young men , respectively . The world is expanded upon and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling , giving us a broader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla America . Recommended for anyone and everyone !
1 Director Edward Sedgwick , an old hand at visual comedy , successfully leads this Hal Roach road show which tenders a fast - moving and adroit scenario and excellent casting , employing a large number of Roach 's reliable performers . Although the film was originally plotted as a vehicle for Patsy Kelly , sunny Jack Haley stars as Joe Jenkins , a young Kansan who sells his auto repair business and journeys to Hollywood , where he attempts to wangle a screen role for the girl he loves , star - struck Cecilia ( Rosina Lawrence ) . Sedgwick , who prefers using the entire M - G - M studio as his set , does so here as Cecilia , always ready for an audition , is treated by a would - be paramour , cinema star Rinaldo Lopez ( Mischa Auer ) , to behind - the - scenes action of , naturally , a musical comedy , featuring Broadway headliner Lyda Roberti . Laurel and Hardy provide several enjoyable interludes , including their well - known skit involving a tiny harmonica , and we watch fine turns by such as Joyce Compton , Russell Hicks and Walter Long . On balance , one must hand the bays to Mischa Auer , who clearly steals the picture as an emotional movie star , a role which he largely creates , and to the director for his clever closing homage to Busby Berkeley 's filmic spectacles .
1 This is your standard musical comedy from the ' 30 's , with a big plus that it features some well known ' 30 's actors in small fun cameo's.<br /><br />There is not much to the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and ' no - worries ' overall kind of atmosphere , with a typical Hal Roach comedy touch to it . Appereantly it 's a ' Cinderella story ' but I most certainly did n't thought of it that way while watching the movie . The story gets very muddled in into the storytelling , that features many different characters and also many small cameo appearance , when the main characters hit the Hollywood studios.<br /><br />Of course the highlight of the movie is when Laurel & Hardy make their appearance and show some of their routines . It 's like watching a movie and getting a Laurel & Hardy short with it for free . Also Laurel & Hardy regular Walter Long makes an appearance in the routine and James Finlayson ( without a mustache this time ) as the director of the short.<br /><br />It 's certainly true that all of the cameo 's and subplots distract from the main plot line and character but in this case that is no problem , since its all way more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the shallow typical main character.<br /><br />The movie is most certainly not any worse than any of its other genre movies from the same time period , though the rating on here would suggest otherwise.<br /><br />7/10
1 This is one of the best ensemble comedy / musical " B " film 's that I have seen ( and since I 'm in my 40 's now and only seeing this now , I am not an expert but I have seen all the well known films out there ) . When there are a ton of actors getting their lead for minutes at a time , usually the comedy interferes with the musical bits , and very often the musical pieces interrupt the comedic flow . Call me in a crazy kind of mood but when I saw this on TCM Europe , I was laughing out loud with pleasure ! So who delivered the laughs for me ? Without a doubt Mischa Auer delivered me some terrific gut busting laughs , he even steals the ending , it was great ! Speaking of which , I think why this movie works is because although L & H are a selling point ( and why I got hooked to watch this one ( them and Hal Roach ) , I love them in their early Hal Roach stuff ) , this keeps them at a minimum and stays squarely on ADULT fare ( by 1930 's standards , and not that far from today 's standards if you read between the lines ) . Jack Haley is also great to watch , I admit that I only know him from W O OZ and I loved him there , and I also laughed out loud here at his waiter bit in the show . Patsy Kelly is the only " ugly " femme in the 30 's movies that actually turns me on ( something tells me she was a spitfire in real life ) ; and the musical numbers have a real professional production ( Busby Berkley'ish ) quality , that blew me away from what I am used to in this genre . I could go on and on , but rest assured I really enjoyed this movie . 8 of 10 I saw it on TCM Europe and will record it to watch again with my wife on TCM USA . Good Stuff !
1 I was having just about the worst day of my life . Then I stumbled on this cute film , watched it , and now I 'm ready to go out & kiss a streetlamp.<br /><br />I have to admit , I only watched it for 2 reasons : VERA - ELLEN 'S LEGS . But it 's really so much more . The plot is actually quite clever and creatively woven . It 's almost like a Shakespearean comedy with all of its delightful misunderstandings . And of course there 's also ... VERA - ELLEN 'S LEGS.<br /><br />The only unfortunate aspect of this film is that the version I purchased ( the " 100 Family Classics " collection by Mill Creek Entertainment ) does n't have the best video quality , and I 've heard the same about the Alpha release . The brightness and contrast are a bit too high , so a lot of the scenes seem bleached out especially when Vera is dancing in a white dress . But I suppose you can fiddle with the controls of your TV set to compensate . I can only imagine how it looked on the big screen back in ' 51 . The stage sets , costumes & colours are otherwise dazzling & delightfully creepy -- sort of in a " Cabinet of Dr. Caligari " vein.<br /><br />As far as the romance goes , this is just perfect . Not sappy , not contrived , not melodramatic . Just 100 % ahhhhhh . Too bad , you poor schmucks , your miserable lives will never be as charming as this . Har har har . Wait , what am I laughing at ? My life sucks just as bad as yours . Oh hell . Time to watch this movie again .
1 A few years ago , I bought several $ 1 DVD 's that contained two movies each . One of them had Three Broadway Girls ( an alternate title for The Greeks Had a Word for Them ) and this one , Happy Go Lovely . It 's basically a backstage musical comedy that takes place in Scotland and concerns mistaken identity involving one of the dancers hitching a ride from a millionaire 's limousine . Vera - Ellen is that dancer and - wow , what legs ! Ceasar Romero is her producer who takes a chance on her after the original leading lady leaves because he thinks she 's dating the millionaire whose car I just mentioned . And David Niven is that rich guy who , when looking for Vera - Ellen , is mistaken for a reporter who 's supposed to interview her but gets stalled by Romero . What I 've just mentioned may be confusing but ( mostly ) makes sense if you 're willing to check your brain while watching this charmingly screwball comedy with wonderful musical numbers as performed by the exquisite Ms. Vera - Ellen . Romero can be a bit frantic here but Niven becomes hilariously bemused throughout . The print I saw was actually pretty good considering its age and the fact that it 's in public domain . And Vera - Ellen does pretty well with her lines since she 's not really an actress . So on that note , I highly recommend Happy Go Lovely for movie buffs who love old - fashioned musical comedies .
1 I find this movie very enjoyable . The plot is simple and easily digestible , the humour is light and clean , and because the storyline involving mistaken identity is quite common , I find myself looking forward to how this movie flesh this story out . Turns out to be very nice . The performance of the female lead is admirable ; her portrayal of an innocent , naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to David 's sophisticated role was very charming . I also find Vera 's dancing very , very well done . I find myself drawn to her toes as she pranced about the stage effortlessly and flawlessly.<br /><br />For those who have had enough of profanity - filled movies of today , you will enjoy this movie thoroughly .
1 endearing tale ........ voted ten against all averages for my age and sex ... not all that much comedy ( compared to a i almost wet myself movie ) although funny enough . not a fan of musicals at all so probably a little too much for me , but they do give you time to grab a drink or soda without missing anything important . maybe a fifties version of when harry met sally ? Ahab no not really but if that is in your top ten like it is mine you will like this movie . really it just leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling , reminding you of what romance could and should be like , something to shoot for . my summary describes it best in very few words ..... quite charming
1 This Hong Kong filmed potboiler packs in more melodrama than week 's worth of ' The Young & The Restless ' . This one is more of a throwback to the original ' Emmanuelle ' trilogy(especially ' Goodbye Emmanuelle ' ) than a D'Amato sleazefest . Chai Lee(Emy Wong)undergoes a stunning transformation from dour nurse to hot - to - trot streetwalker . Future Italian porn star / politician , Illona Staller , who would later go by the name Ciccolina(and have sex with an HIV positive John Holmes ) plays Emy 's competition . Exotic locales and some decent soft - core scenes round this one out . Recommended for fans of the original ' Emmanuelle ' , of which I am one !
1 Before seeing this , I was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated " Emmanuelle " series starring Sylvia Kristel . It was really surprising how good this one turned out to be . It actually has a story , and it is very romantic indeed . What makes ' Yellow Emanuelle ' so good is it 's leading heroine , the beautiful and exotic Chai Lee . She plays her character , Emy Wong so sweetly , that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her . Emy Wong is a much - respected doctor , statuesque , with a regal quality . She comes from an important old family , where ancient customs are still practiced . Emy will remain a virgin until she is married , to a man she has never met . The beautiful doctor seems OK with this arranged marriage . It is simply how it is done in her world . However she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the British pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works . Emy decides to do away with custom , and she gives herself to her Western man . But only after a very long courtship , as Doctor Wong is anything but an easy woman . Her pilot , George , is a good guy , and promises to marry Emy , so that she does n't lose her respectability and place in her rigid society . Neither one counts on a third party , one Ilona Staller , who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games . Emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man , that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her . Her place in society is gone , she has been debased . The film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud , elegant woman gives up her career , as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father , and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution . I was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale . I was on the edge of my seat when George blows back into town , and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful Emy is working as a prostitute ! Classic drama . I imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama . One would expect lots of sex and nudity here , but there is not much . And when there is , it is totally non - exploitative , and very artsy and soft - core . If you are a fan of the first Emmanuelle , with Sylvia Kristel , than you most likely will appreciate this , lesser known classic . I was especially impressed by the extra attention to details . The whole segment where Emy takes George to her fathers house on the island is really nice . Her father shows George , and the viewer his impressive collection of Bonzai trees . He has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees . Totally unexpected . After catching it on late night cable TV years ago , I spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film . When i finally got it i found that the video version was longer . More sex ? No , more melodrama . For the DVD release there is a subplot about George suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease ! I actually preferred the cable version better . I am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on DVD . I must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70 's soundtrack . While watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare , and quite special . I recommend it to thoughtful viewers who do n't need sex and violence to maintain their interest .
1 Handsome and dashing British airline pilot George Taylor ( a solid portrayal by Guiseppe Pambieri ) gets beat up by thugs after a wild night in Hong Kong . George meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal Dr. Emy Wong ( a fine and charming performance by the lovely Chai Lee ) . George regains his health and goes back to work . When Emy fails to hear from George for a lengthy amount of time , she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute . While director / co - writer Bitto Albertini does indeed deliver a satisfying amount of the expected tasty nudity and steamy soft - core sex , this film is anything but your routine wallow in leering sleaze . Instead it 's a surprisingly thoughtful , touching and tragic love story between two well drawn and highly appealing characters ( Chai as Emy Wong is especially radiant and endearing ) . The picture starts out bubbly and cheerful , but the tone radically shifts into a more grim and harsh mood about two thirds of the way through . Emy 's descent into vice after she falsely assumes that George has abandoned her is bleak and upsetting ; ditto the remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprise bummer ending . Granted , the narrative is certainly melodramatic , but never too silly or trashy . Moreover , the sex scenes are quite tasteful and even genuinely erotic . Notorious Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a nice sizable supporting part as George 's jealous and uninhibited secretary Helen Miller . Guido Mancori 's polished cinematography offers many strikingly gorgeous shots of the exotic locations . Nico Fidenco 's funky , throbbing score hits the groovy spot . Worth a look for those seeking something different .
1 I had the opportunity to see this film debut at the Appalachian Film Festival , in which it won an award for Best Picture . This film is brilliantly done , with an excellent cast that works well as an ensemble . My favorite performances were from Youssef Kerkour , Justin Lane , and Adam Jones . Also , there are some great effects with dragonflies and cockroaches , that I was surprised to find out that this film was done on a small budget . The writer - director Adam Jones , who I believe also won an award for his writing , does an excellent job with direction . The audience loved this movie . Cross Eyed will keep you laughing throughout the movie . Definitely a must see .
1 A friend lent me this DVD , which he got from the director at a festival , I think . I went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great . So maybe that colored my judgment but I have to admit that I liked this movie.<br /><br />The standouts where the actors . Youssef Kerkor was really good as Ernie , the main character , kind of pathetic in a likable way . Adam Jones ( who also directed ) and Justin Lane were excellent as the roommates who drive Ernie mad . The Bill character ( Justin Lane ) , who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda , was by far my favorite ; he seemed the least one - dimensional , and reminded me of an old college roommate so much I called the guy after watching the DVD . Really kind of lovable , and very funny . Some of the other acting was good , some was so - so , but none of it was bad . I also really liked the vigilante duo . Ridiculous and funny.<br /><br />I'm giving this one high marks , even though it has some issues , because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared , and decided to make their movie their way . Well done to Adam Jones and crew .
1 Who made this film ? I love this film ? Somebody has a wacky sense of humor ... <br /><br />This Zany , Surreal style of film making is appealing , but it is hard to create - or easy to forget - that substance , and characters who actually have souls , are what give such a film depth . Without that a comedy is just a bunch of ideas . Who cares . It may get laughs , but it goes through you like a half - good hamburger ... next ... <br /><br />Crosseyed may not intend to change anybody 's life , but I appreciate the depth and substance . They sneak up on you . I started this film thinking " Oh , I get it - indie comedy - off the wall - gonzo ... yup . " And it is that - but if you pay attention there is sub text and character moments filling it out . In this sense the film breathes . It makes propositions that give pause - if you 're available to see them - and then , of course , it goes on its insanely merry way.<br /><br />You will miss the point if you do n't sign the contract to suspend belief at moments in the film . Stepping between reality and surreality IS one of the points of this movie.<br /><br />Crosseyed is n't perfect , but smart people made it . I want more.<br /><br />The dining room scenes are an absolute HOOT.<br /><br />Put on your seat belt .
1 The film " Cross Eyed " by Adam Jones propels the viewer on a ride of redemption as the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order . Adam Jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to empower his character and actualize what matters most . These truths become apparent to both the characters and viewers as you laugh and gag to the credits with them . The simple yet attractive settings\costumes keep you guessing about what you will see next . You ca n't help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this movie . I ca n't wait for his sophomore effort . It is only a matter of time before Jones strikes again . Bravo !
1 Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor . There is nothing i did n't like about this film . Cross Eyed was beautifully shot . Adam does a great job of , not only developing the main characters , but also the minor characters . < br /><br />Cross Eyed gives hope to every low budget film out there . That you do n't have to spend a lot to create something worth watching . There is something to like for everyone . If you 've had a terrible roommate . if you 've ever picked on a dork in high school . if you 've ever parked anywhere in the city . if you have any type of sense of humor at all you will love this film . This is the type of film that will be around for a long time and ends up resurfacing again once Adam makes a bigger name for himself . I look forward to Adam 's future projects .
1 I happened to catch this film at a screening in Brooklyn - it 's difficult to describe the plot ; it has a lot of wacky characters , but let 's just say I 'd have a hard time choosing which one made me laugh the hardest , I would n't know where to begin . Even the peripheral roles are well written and well acted.<br /><br />There are numerous small touches that make it unique and very enjoyable , it has a few " devices " that pop up and add another hilarious layer . It is refreshing to watch ; not some recycled stuff I 'd seen many times before . If this film could reach a wider audience , I 'm certain it would be a real crowd - pleaser , the story is so original and heartfelt.<br /><br />There 's a lot here to like , funny back - stories , mishaps and misunderstandings which set up the final act and dramatic conclusion . Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a ton of heart ; it 's a touching story with fast paced comedy woven throughout . Definitely worth seeing !
1 It 's great how this movie pulls you along . I had honest laughs . Do n't care that it 's low budget cause the thing works for me . To be honest my wife did n't really go for it in the same way but she prefers a different type of film . She did admit though that it was very creative and well put together and probably all on a shoe string . These characters who 's lives are strange and troubled give me something to relate to in my own world . Just keep going and be who you are . Dreams are what you make of them . In watching this movie a second and third time I realized that there are some hidden moments that passed by me on the first time through . What can I say , I like my fun with some complexity . Anyway liked it . Hope to see more .
1 Very rarely does one come across an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression . Cross Eyed is a rare gem . The writer director not only tackled the challenge of directing his own work , but gives a hilarious performance as an evil roommate . The script takes an interesting look at not only the plight of the struggling writer , but mixes so much comedy into the desolate world of the writer that you ca n't help but commit to Ernie as a character . Very funny stuff . Despite the tiny budget Adam Jones manages to give the film a serious look . He 's not messing around when it comes to making a good movie . I ca n't wait to see what he comes up with next . This guy can make people laugh and think ; that 's special .
1 An imagination is a terrible thing to waste ... especially when you have talented actors . Writer / Director Jones wastes no time in siding the viewer with his protagonist . < br /><br />Anyone who has shared an apartment with a slob will be crying with laughter . Anyone who has arrived while a meter maid places a ticket on your windshield will just plain cry . We 've all wanted to rip a terrible toupee off a man 's head . These are only snippets of what 's in store when watching " Cross Eyed " , a heartfelt film that should be a stepping stone for Jones and his wry sense of humor both in front and behind the camera .
1 Debut ? Wow -- Cross - Eyed is easily one of the most enjoyable indie films that I 've watched in the past year , making it hard to believe that Cross Eyed is the writer 's debut film . I mean -- I logged onto IMDb to find more films by this writer ... because Cross Eyed has that unique signature --you want to see what else this writer might have to say . These days , its rare to see a movie that is well - written , well - directed , well - edited and well - acted . For me -- Cross Eyed encapsulates what movie making should be about -- combining the best of all film elements to create a clever , artistic and poignant tale . More , please .
1 Cross - eyed is a very original and funny movie . I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and really reinvents it in a good way . This film is smart , concise , and consistently entertaining and funny . As a writer / director , Jones exhibits complete control over his characters who are both absurd and lovable . The story is definitely something you have n't seen before which is good . It 's unique and fun , and manages to work in visually fantastic elements as well as the long lost slapstick genre together to form a hearty comedy.<br /><br />A very promising first film .
1 Writer / Director / Co - Star Adam Jones is headed for great things . That is the thought I had after seeing his feature film " Cross Eyed " . Rarely does an independent film leave me feeling as good as his did . Cleverly written and masterfully directed , " Cross Eyed " keeps you involved from beginning to end . Adam Jones may not be a well known name yet , but he will be . If this movie had one or two " Named Actors " it would be a Box Office sensation . I think it still has a chance to get seen by a main stream audience if just one film distributor takes the time to work this movie . Regardless of where it ends up , if you get a chance to see it you wo n't be disappointed .
1 I rented this some years ago , the video store had only VHS at the time . Straight to video was hitting it 's strides ( you know , where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films).I did n't know what to expect other than what was printed . First thing I thought while watching was " what the hells ' wrong with the sound ?"- Obviously there was no dialogue dubbing . Words echoed , so I stopped munching on whatever I had to pay closer attention - mind you there 's no Shakespeare here!,just simple talk . The story is simple enough , boy meets girl etc .. What struck me as humorous and heartfelt was , the people in the movie did n't seem like caricatures written into the story , but rather non - actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs(uniforms included ) . All the while , you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after , then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor(people hurting their privates , using vulgarities this could n't have hurt the marketing . There was something honest about it . I thought if they 'd have a bigger budget then it would have been better , which i 'm sure they considered daily , but , they went ahead and made it . This , I felt , was what independent film - making is all about . The word " Indy " , is thrown around as if it 's a Genre .. Ha! .. that 's funny !
1 This is a cute and sad little story of cultural difference . Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who has run to California to escape from a failed relationship in Japan . Ken is a Japanese American manual laborer with aspirations of rock and roll stardom but little concrete to offer a potential partner . Kyoko " marries " Ken in order to be able to stay permanently in the U.S. , with the understanding that although they will live together until she gets a " green card " the marriage will be in name only . It soon develops that the parties are not on the same wavelength - or perhaps in the same " time zone " , hence the title of the movie . As an immigration attorney I have seen such " arrangements " take on a life of their own , so I was pleased to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation .
1 This is one of those films that explore the culture clash of Eastern born people in Westernized cultures . < br /><br />Loving on Tokyo Time is a sad film about the inability of opposites to attract due to major cultural differences . Ken , rock n'roll fanatic , marries Kyoto , a Japanese girl , so that she can stay in the United States when her visa expires . The marriage is only expected to be temporary , that is , until Kyoto gains legal status again . But , Ken , who seems to be lost in every relationship , takes a liking to Kyoto and tries very hard to make things work out . This , despite his friend 's urging that dumping Kyoto and getting rid of all commitments to girls is bad for rock n ' roll except to inspire some song writing about broken hearts and all of that.<br /><br />But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese upbringing , and does n't expect to be married to Ken all that long . Not only that , she is homesick and wants to return to Japan . It 's sad in that this is finally someone Ken thinks he can love and be with and all that , except the one time he thinks he 's found someone to feel that way about , the girl is n't expecting to stay that long . It 's not that she does n't like Ken , it 's just that she 's used to a whole ' nother way of life . She says , " I ca n't tell him the way I feel in English , and Ken ca n't tell me the way he feels in Japanese . " It 's a rather sad love story with a killer 80s techno - nintendo soundtrack.<br /><br />I picked up Loving on Tokyo Time because it reminded me of one of my favorite 80s films , Tokyo Pop . And , for those of you who enjoyed Loving on Tokyo Time , check out Tokyo Pop ( a New York singer goes to Japan and joins a Japanese American cover band ) , except it 's a movie with a happy ending.<br /><br / >
1 This show has come so far . At first EVERYONE in the cast from Eric to Fez , they were all new actors and actresses , fresh faces , and just look what they accomplished . They stuck with the show and it was a success . Its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom I 've ever seen in my life . It will be sad to see it end but if they end this show , I hope to God that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had . I do n't care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode . Go down swinging , get one last punch in . The show deserves it , the fans deserve it , if they go , let everyone know its going to end , like on Friends , and let the finale be huge . I say get Donna and Eric married , I say have Hyde and Kelso fight and become friends again , I say have something interesting happen between Fez and Jackie because Fez has been trying for so long , but of course it wo nt work out for him . JUST CLOSE OUT THE SERIES BIG TIME GUYS!<br /><br />That 70s Show will always be the best in my eyes . Eric , Kelso , Donna , Jackie , Fez , Hyde , I wish I had you guys as friends . You are the best!<br /><br />10/10 ...
1 This was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit national television . Its unfortunate that the show is not placed amongst great sitcoms where it truly belongs . The actors did a superb job and seasons one thru six were the show at its peak point . Although season seven was not as great when compared to the previous six , it was still funny . Season 8 was the real problem kicked in . Without Topher grace or Ashton Kutcher the show simply fell apart . Not too say , the other actors were n't great if any of 2 main characters had left such as Danny Masterson , Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith , Debra Jo Rupp , Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon ( Don Starks and tommy Chong are great too ) left the show it would have the same affect . And the inclusion of Randy ( Josh Meyers ) did n't help either because he was not well received by the shows fans . I believe if the show ended a year ago it would have certainly gone down in history as one of the sitcom greats . Season 8 was a little dull but the finale was excellent . I am going to miss the show , i just hope i wake up one day to find out the show is back as That 80 's show with the same cast because i am going to miss the hell out of it .
1 I ca n't believe we do n't have that 70 's show anymore . I have all 8 seasons of that 70 's show ! ! I absolutely Love It ! ! I lay in the bed every night and watch several episodes before I go to sleep . At the end of a long busy day it 's nice to kick back and have a great laugh before you go to sleep . I was so sad they took the show off air ... at least we still have the re - runs ! ! I am hoping and praying they will come back with at least a reunion ... Like maybe when Donna finishes college and we finally get to see her and Eric get married ! ! ! ! Would n't that be awesome ! ! ! It would be even better if they would continue it for several years ! !
1 How does an usual day start in Point Place , Wisconsin ... <br /><br />First of all , Red , the tyrannical father of the Forman family and a WWII veteran , sits at the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his overjoyed wife Kitty serves breakfast . Then comes their skinny son , Eric , he sits at the table as well , and his father starts his daily yelling , usually involving placing his foot in Eric 's behind if ( insert reason here ) . If his promiscuous angel - faced sister Laurie is at home , she comes along , then Red stops yelling and kindly talks to her , making Eric feel left out of the family.<br /><br />Once this daily ( painful ) ritual is over , Eric rushes down to his basement , where all his friends are already hanging out . And when we get to see them , it becomes obvious Eric and his redhead tomboy girlfriend , next - door neighbor and childhood friend Donna Pinciotti are the sanest people around . Meet Steven Hyde , the conspiracy theorist who hates disco and does n't really care about what 's around as long as it 's not funny to watch ; Michael Kelso , the kind of guy who thinks that he will get through his life only by his looks and that carrots grow in trees ; Jackie Burkhardt , the one who thinks of herself as the prettiest girl around , spoiled kid of a rich father , and , of course , cheerleader ; and Fez , a naive but oversexed foreigner who loves candy and ca n't keep a secret . At first they simply hang out , gossiping and making fun of Kelso , but then they all sit in a circle and let the real fun begin ... before going out doing something they 'll regret later.<br /><br />Meanwhile Red goes out and meets Donna 's weirdo parents , Bob and Midge . He 's rude , but they do n't mind , as they think he 's joking . Somewhere around is Leo , an aging hippie , who 's constantly confused and makes word plays without even noticing.<br /><br />Did you imagine that seemingly peaceful neighborhood with all these awesome characters ? Of course , most seem " clichéd " , but the show takes the cliché to a new level . Now throw in some of the most wicked story lines a sitcom can offer , sit down and enjoy one of the best TV shows ever . The one that never does two times the same thing and which is , compared to most sitcoms that are " cute funny " , purely hysterical . If you get hooked , do n't let this show let you go . Bite on the hook over and over and , man , you will see the sitcom genre from a whole new prospective .
1 Over the years , we 've seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what , keeping " 8 Simple Rules " going after John Ritter died comes to mind , but this is probably the first time I cared . The idea of having " That 70 's Show " without Eric or to a lesser extent Kelso is ridiculous . They tried to cover it up with a comeback of Leo and increasingly outrageous story lines , but it always felt like why bother when you do n't have a main character anymore . It just did n't really connect , it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time was n't even funny . The last season felt like the season too much for every single character , simply because Eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we 'd be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were . Focusing on the gimmick that is Fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working , because the whole deal was that he 'd say something weird from out of nowhere , and you ca n't say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours . They also brought in the standard cousin Oliver , only this time it just was n't a kid . Whenever you heard somebody knock on the door , you started praying it was n't Randy , please let it not be Randy . The deal with Randy was that he 'd do really awful jokes , usually as Red would say , smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and Donna would be in stitches . I think more than half of the last season was Donna pretending to be amused . The problems had started earlier though : what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once was n't about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera . Everybody started being in love with everybody , emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea , with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching " As The World Turns " . I 'm guessing this was character development , but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from " Family Matters " . To be fair , the last episode , also because it had a cameo by Topher Grace ( a cameo in his own show ) , was really good , even if not that funny either.<br /><br />By the way , yet more criticism on Season 8 : what the hell was with the opening theme ? Not only did they use the same joke twice ( a character not singing ) , Fez scared the hell out of me . Dude , do n't open your eyes that far . But the first five seasons or so , among the best comedy ever broadcast .
1 I actually did n't start watching the show until it came on FX . I was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show 's reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it . I was so upset that I had not watched the show when it first aired on t.v . I loved the show so much!Finally a show for everyone to enjoy . I remember Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough . They would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid , but not That 70s Show . That 70s Show was hilarious , smart and so real . I think it was the best show ever made and I 'm very sorry that it ended . Although I love this show , I do think it should have ended on the seventh season when Eric and Kelso leave . The last season was just not right , Eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves . I still love this show and I hope TV starts making more shows like this one .
1 This show has all the typical characters in a comedy : the good guy , the idiot , the pervert , the rich girl ... but it 's set on the 70 's . That 's the only difference that it has with other TV comedies . I do n't know how you can like this show . Its humor is pathetic ! I mean , the jokes are so direct ... A typical dialog is this : " Fez : Oh , Jackie I want to have sex with you . ( audience laughs ) Jackie : Fez you 're a pervert . ( audience laughs ) Fez : Oh yes I am . ( audience cheers and applauds ) " This is n't funny . I think that if it did n't have those laughs ( I do n't know how you call that in English , sorry ) you would n't laugh at all . This is n't intelligent comedy , this is an insult to the public . I like most of the American comedies , but this is n't good at all . I would give it 4 out of 10 . ( Sorry for my poor English again . )
1 ... and the series lets you forget all that . I am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series . Born in 1958 , I learned to drive during the first gas shortage , and got my first post - college graduation job during the second gas shortage in 1979 . The 70 's were a truly dreadful time to be young - inflation , competing for after - school minimum - wage jobs with laid - off thirty - somethings , dreadful music , worse clothes.<br /><br />The funny thing is , this series does n't ignore any of that and still manages to make the 70 's look fun , even for those of us old enough to know better . It manages to look the 70 's directly in the face - complete with time - authentic clothing - and yet fill the show with the hopefulness of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times . Then there are the parents . The two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions . Eric 's parents , Red and Kitty , are not exactly June and Ward although they are conventional for the decade . They represent what happened when the 60 's finally reached the suburbs during the 1970 's . Donna 's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960 's to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy . Eric 's friends Fez , Kelso , and Jackie round out the group representing nerdiness , well - meaning incompetence , and snobbishness respectively . Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs , but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents . I highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of Eric .
1 There are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set . That 70 's Show is a great example . When the show came on the air , nobody really heard of Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton ( both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests ) I wish Topher would stay around because the show began about his character , Eric , and his close circle of friends . Ashton is already the John Travolta of our time . Remember when John was in love with Diana Hyland from Eight Is Enough , think of Ashton with Demi Moore . The cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it . I miss Mo Gaffney who played Don 's girlfriend Joanne . I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie , the replacement could not match her and I am sorry about that . I liked the casting of Tommy Chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to Steven Hyde . I loved watching Tanya Roberts besides Charlie 's Angels . I loved Brooke Shields playing Jackie 's mom . She really showed her acting talent before heading to Broadway . This show has been a delight with many surprises . I hope this show lasts longer even though 2 of their cast members are leaving but I hope they do n't stay too far away too long . I wish the show 's creators , Bonnie and Terry Turner , who also created my other favorite show , Third Rock from The Sun , is more successful on Fox than they were on NBC which sabotaged their show . The Turners are not dummies and I hope they create more shows like this in the future .
1 " That ' 70s Show " is definitely the funniest show currently on TV . I started watching it about two and a half years ago , and as soon as I saw it I could tell it was a great show . I like all the characters , but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso . Leo was also an awesome character while he was there , I really hope he comes back because he 's hilarious . It 's classic when Fez goes " you son of a bitch ! " , and when Kelso yells " burn ! " , that always makes me laugh . They are both great characters and always have something funny to say . Jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show ; she started out being really good looking but damn , somewhere around season 5 - 6 she just got Really hot . I 've seen most of the episodes more than once , some like 10 times , and there still hilarious . This is one of the few shows that I can watch over and over and still laugh at just as much as I did the first time I saw it . The cast is classic ; almost everyone is funny , where with many shows there are only a few funny characters . I will be sad to see this show end next year , but it will be going off the air as one of the best shows ever .
1 Like the characters in this show , I too was a teen during the 70s . The producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist , of being a suburban teenager in the 70s . The 70s fashions , cars , home furnishings , foods , and fads , are all very authentic in this show.<br /><br />The show boasts a very talented ensemble cast , who all mesh together very well on camera . I really like the unique , psychedelic - style film sequences . No other show does camera tricks like this . These cutting - edge film sequences , really help to convey the campy hipness , that characterized the 70s era.<br /><br />Overall this is a very funny sitcom . The one thing that bothers me about this show , is it 's over - reliance on cruel humor , to generate laughs . In this way , I think that this show tries to be too much like Married With Children . While Married with Children is a great sitcom in its own right , it 's tacky that the creators of That 70s show , keep trying to imitate it . < br /><br />I do recommend That 70s Show , mainly due to it 's nostalgia factor . It could be an even better show though , if the writers relied more on witty dialog , rather than bawdy , tasteless jokes and pranks .
1 I wish " that ' 70s show " would come back on television . It was the greatest show ever ! ! ! They should make episodes between the other episodes but of course that would be confusing . But I wish it would come back and make more episodes . Please come back ... The show was absolutely hilarious . You could n't laugh without seeing an episode . There is a really funny part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when Hyde and Jackie were going out with each other . Those were the best episodes . " That ' 70s show is the best " .... It will be and always will be the best show ever . It was really sad when the show ended . They should make new episodes .
1 This show is freaking hilarious ! the jokes are original , god and i Love Eric and Kelso ! yeah i know what they say , after the 8th season it 's not funny anymore because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show , and Randy is a real dumbass . Randy is , comparing to Eric and Kelso . < br /><br />you ca nt take the funniest characters and switch em with " I 'm a cool guy " kind of guy ( Randy ) . it is n't his fault anyway , but the writers are trying to keep the 8th season funny , it 's still is , not as much as the earlier seasons , but its alright.<br /><br />the 360 's are awesome , the circle , Red is a real kind of mental - abusing dad :) and kitty is always half - high half - pie . Hyde tries to be cool all the time , he has his moments too . the least favrioutes characters are Jackie and Donna . they 're cool , but not without Kelso and Eric.<br /><br />great show . Dumbass !
1 I m gon na make this short and sweet because i do n't think there is much you can really tell someone about this show who has never seen it other than its hilariously funny and unique , for me its possibly the funniest show ever.<br /><br />You have to really watch it to understand its humour and it took me a few episodes to really get into it but once your in there is no getting back out . For example the way Hydes character always wants to see his friends get in some sort of trouble the more it happens the funnier it becomes.<br /><br />Its all round classic I mean the cast , the writers , the director , its just a recipe for success . One actor i think who always gets a hard time is Ashton Kutcher but i mean he 's great in this show i do n't think its possible for the the character Kelso to have been played by anyone else , it takes someone very smart to play someone that stupid . All the main characters are great and it would n't be a worth while review if i did n't mention the stone cold fox Mila Kunis , now that s a spicy meet a ball ha ha all joking aside amazing show .
1 This show was absolutely great , and I always look forward to watching it . All the characters were funny and awesome in their own way , each and every episode provided non - stop laughter , and it was completely entertaining and different from a lot of other shows . Everybody was just absolutely insane and breathtakingly funny , that you could n't help but love this show . There were a few dead weight episodes , but That ' 70s Show always managed to create some kind of likable atmosphere , to where it just really did n't matter . This was one of the best shows to ever be aired , and I will watch this show anytime I can , for it never gets old , never gets unfunny , and never gets uninteresting .
1 I saw this show about 3 - 4 years ago . It was dam Funny ! When i first time i saw it was playing on ETV(Estonian Television ) And i started to like it . Too bad that that show is on bad time for me . Hyde is like a cool guy who likes to sing Frank Sinatra ! And he comes on stupid ideas . He got these glasses which h are brown . I like it . And there 's FeZ. The group Pervert . We all know what he does when his alone ..... He wants to get laid badly . He even had it with his boss in one episode . His from India . And there is Michael , The stupidest guy on whole group , probably stupidest in town and his a cop ! He is so stupid that i remember follows : Hyde says : Did u called cops ? - No Michael comes in and says . Does anyone know how to turn off siren ? He is a town playboy . Then comes Jackie , who is former girlfriend of Michael and then she 's Hyde 's girlfriend . Then is Eric Who 's son of grumpy war veteran and son of Kitty the housewife . His one big pussy . But he loves Donna , his girlfriend with who they plan for they 're marriage . Donna is one hot girl . Hmm what i forget ? ah Hyde lives in a basement .
1 I have n't liked many TV shows post 1990 , but THAT 70S SHOW is great . Never seeing it during it 's first run , thinking a gimmicky period piece , I was wrong ! I started watching in reruns and the more I watched , the more I liked ! Now , it is the only show premiering post-1990 that I watch regularly.<br /><br />Although THAT 70S SHOW mimics some of the styles , attitudes , music , and tastes of the 70s , it does not mire itself in that decade by going overboard with the references and look of the 70s . It contains so much funny , witty , biting dialogue that is delivered with confidence and certainty by its main cast that it overcomes any 70s clichés by just being humorous . The humor is what keeps the show eternally watchable.<br /><br />Although a hilarious sitcom , no matter what time period , the uniqueness of mocking the 70s does work in its favor as it gives the show a signature identity . But its the focus on universal issues ( family problems , teen angst , marital issues , peer pressure ) , dealing with all of them with comic aplomb , that gives the show a mass appeal.<br /><br />The show 's center is one Eric Forman ( played to absolute comic perfection by future superstar Topher Grace ) . Eric is a super - skinny , geeky - looking , non - athletic teen and still comes off as super - cool due to Grace 's brilliant self - deprecation of the character . Eric has 5 friends Donna , Hyde , Kelso , Jackie , and Fez ( played respectively in hilarious fashion by Laura Prepon , Danny Masterson , Ashton Kutcher , Mila Kunis , and Wilmer Valderama ) . We get to see life in Point Place , Wisconsin through the eyes of these 6 teens and boy do we get a lot to see ! Donna , a forward - thinking feminist , is the object of Eric 's affection and these 2 have the core relationship of the show . They become a couple pretty soon after the show starts and they are NEVER a boring couple . Most of the shows eps end with them having a meaningful conversation about them and their future and it works as a great insightful bookend , which works as a perfect counter to the prior hilarity . Hyde is Eric 's best friend and soon moves in with the Formans when his mother abandons him ; Hyde is the mellow , zen , cool one of the group and just sits back , observes , and makes fun of his fellow friends with easygoing aplomb . Kelso is the dumb one of the group and Kutcher plays it the absolute hilt , displaying amazing physical comedy as well as telling some of the most absurdly hilarious ideas and stories ever ! Jackie , who starts out as Kelso 's girlfriend , is a verbose , self - absorbed debutante cheerleader and is at first only accepted as part of the group b / c of Kelso , but she manages to ingratiate herself to the point where they all HAVE to accept her ! And finally , Fez ! Fez is the foreign exchange student from some unknown country ( we never know exactly where ) and he is a scene - stealer ! " I said good day ! " " You son of a b*tch ! " Valderama is only sporting a foreign accent here as he has n't one in reality and he is always in character and creates one of the most unique characters I have ever seen . His scene - stealing moments often help make the show for me.<br /><br />The show constantly takes us into the minds and thoughts of these characters through engaging fantasy scenes of how they would like or imagine things to be . The gang repeatedly gets into trouble ( most of it on purpose ) . They constantly play gags on the Point Place residents as well as each other . They hang out most of the time in Eric 's basement plotting , pontificating , or just plain playing around.<br /><br />Also figuring prominently in the show are Eric 's parents , the menacing , commie - hating Red and the lovable , happy - go - lucky Kitty ( played memorably by Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp ) . These 2 adults give the show a much - needed mature point - of - view and constantly berate and advise the 6 ne'er do - wells . Red and Kitty are ably supported by Donna 's parents , the buffoonish Bob ( played wonderfully for the full run by Don Stark ) and blonde bimbo daft Midge ( the super - sexy Tanya Roberts , who was on the show for about half it 's run ) . Additionally , for 3 full seasons , Eric 's sister from hell Laurie ( played brilliantly by the wickedly sexy Farrah - Fawcett lookalike Lisa Robin Kelly ) was a major refreshing relief to counter the shenanigans of the main 6 and to be the thorn in Eric and her parents ' sides ! Kelly came back as a guest character for a few Season 5 eps . But , unfortunately , Kelly 's personal problems led to her being replaced by a terrible new actress in Season 6 . The newbie did n't last , thankfully , and was gone after a few Season 6 eps!<br /><br />Sadly , at the end of Season 7 , Topher Grace ( Eric ) and early in Season 8 , Ashton Kutcher ( Kelso ) left the show and it never recovered as Season 8 turned out to be it 's last . Grace and Kutcher returned for the series finale , though , giving the show a satisfying end . < br /><br />A lot of great supporting and cameo characters would help keep the show fresh through added nostalgia and humor . Top notch supporting players were eternally high Leo ( played to the hilt by Tommy Chong ) , Pastor Dave , Roy ( the terrific comic Jim Gaffigan ) , Big Rhonda , Mitch , Earl , etc . They also got legends Marion Ross ( HAPPY DAYS ) and Betty White ( THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW ) to play Red and Kitty 's mothers , respectively . Many celebrity cameos from the 70s made appearances as well , from Shirley Jones ( PARTRIDGE FAMILY ) to Pamela Sue Martin ( NANCY DREW ) to Charo to Ted Nugent to K.I.S.S ! It goes on and on!<br /><br />With great nostalgic 70s homages and references , hilarious dialogue and delivery and a nonsensical , take - no - prisoners style of comedic storytelling , THAT 70S SHOW is a television classic !
1 Not since The Simpsons made it 's debut has there been a sitcom that I did n't want to turn of in a matter of 2 minutes . It has of course been said that The Simpsons killed the sitcom . Not this one though.<br /><br />The first season was so so as the teenage characters were not quite as outrageous as they later became . They even went to school sometimes . The following seasons the character where fledged out . Eric , the sarcastic twit , Donna , his levelheaded girlfriend , Kelso , the dim bulb , Hyde , the conspiracy theorist and anti - establishment punk , Fez , the pervert exchange student and finally Jackie , the spoiled rich floozy . As for the adult characters there was Eric 's mom , the " can you believe she is so ditzy " suburban mom , Eric 's dad , the straight arrow who of course was n't such a hard ass as he seemed , Donna 's goofy dad and her dumb blonde mom . Everybody are true to their characters but special kudos to Kurtwood Smith who finds the perfect balance between toughness and still makes his Red Forman quite sympathetic without making us throw up with unexpected cuteness.<br /><br />Topher Grace is of course the main reason why this show is so good . It 's a tough character to play because it does n't allow the actor to indulge in wild overacting like the Kelso character , played competently by Ashton Kutcher . I enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most different.<br /><br />Hyde 's character is a bit harder to enjoy because he is more realistic and do we really need to see the orphan story for the umpteenth time , although I will say that the writers came up with a brilliant story arc for him in the last seasons.<br /><br />Jackie , played by Family Guy voice artist Mila Kunis is hilarious and she has a nails on a chalkboard type voice , which actually fits her character . The only sad part is that we did n't see more scenes with her and Eric because they were f ...... hilarious together . Too much story was wasted on her relationship problems since we already got that in spades with Eric and Donna.<br /><br />Last I will say that the casting of guest actors were always great . A few favorites : Fez ' humongous girlfriend in the mid - seasons , Pastor Dan , the totally awesome Leo played by the equally awesome Thomas Chong , another one of Fez ' girlfriends who is totally certifiable and a special appearance by the teenage witch Sabrina as a slutty catholic girl.<br /><br />Coming up next on Fox , whatever .
1 I love this show . Period . I have n't been watching very long , probably only about six months or so , actually , but it is now my favorite show and probably will be for quite a while . I love all of the characters , except I do n't really care for Donna . I 'm not completely sure why . I just .. don't find her funny , and I do n't think Laura Prepon is a very good actress . Other than her , I find the rest of the cast pretty good . Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp , who played Erics parents , were extremely funny . Topher Grace is also a great actor . Unlike a lot of fans , I did not completely hate the 8th season . I still watch it , and it does make me laugh . But , if you compare it to the shows earlier seasons , its .. not good . Randy is horrible . The finale was decent , nothing amazing , but good . = ] I do think it would have been better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave , but oh well . I have the fourth season on DVD , and someday I hope to have all eight seasons on DVD . Some of its most hilarious episodes , in my opinion , were ' Dine&Dash ' , ' Grandmas Dead ' , ' Red&Stacey ' , and ' Streaking ' , but I love every episode I 've seen so far , which is most of them , I think . = ] 9/10 stars , I would definitely recommend it . = ]
1 This show is wonderful . It has some of the best writing I ever seen . It has brilliant directing by Dvid Trainer who also directed another smart television series called BOY MEETS WORLD.<br /><br />This show is with out a dought one of the greatest . Like THREE 'S COMPANY , ROSEANNE , and the famous COSBY SHOW this will be on television for a long time to come.<br /><br />From it 's perfectly crafted jokes to the great performances you would only dream of this is a wonderful show for people who lived in the seventies and the people who did n't . This show appeals to the young and the young at heart . A perfect show .
1 If TV was a baseball league , this show would have a perfect record ! With an excellent cast , and a perfect plot , this show gave 8 amazing seasons and a great joy to TV after dinner . With the constant changing of relationships and finding out who Hyde 's real dad is , this show was a hit when it started in August of 98 , though it was set in 1976 . And hanging out in Foremans basement was always the thing to do back then , and it still is today , along with circles . This show gave great laughs in premieres , and it still does during re - runs . If you watch a few episodes of this show , you will get everything and want to get more . Now only is this show one of the best ever created , it is clever and funny .
1 That 70s Show is the best TV show ever , period . It 's up there with the Andy Griffen Show , Saturday Night Live , and The Simpsons in my book . That 70s Show continued on for 8 seasons , all of which focus around a group of teenagers / young adults dealing with relationships , separating from their parents , and their overall futures.<br /><br />The two main characters , Eric and Donna , are two teenagers living next door to each other . They have been living next door to each other for most of their lives , and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season . A large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working.<br /><br />Two other characters , Red and Kitty , are Eric 's parents . Red was in the service , so he really pushes Eric around . Kitty is just the opposite . Even though she drinks heavily , she treats Eric and his friends with a lot of care . Bob , their neighbor , is obviously Donna 's Dad . Bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show 's story . Bob also annoys Red to his full extent.<br /><br />The remaining character , Hyde , Kelso , Fez , and Jackie , are Eric 's friends . They also play a major role in the show 's story.<br /><br />Well , the First Season is great . This is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other . The First Season is original , funny , and enjoyable.<br /><br />The Second Season is good , although it is n't as good as the first . It is a basic continuation of the First . Eric and Donna are together , and everything is working out great.<br /><br />The Third Season is my favorite . It went back and captured the First Season feel and humor . I also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch , making the show all that more fun to watch.<br /><br />The Fourth Season is n't near as good . Eric and Donna Arne't together in this one , making the show slightly less pleasurable . It is still funny , although I did n't enjoy it as much as the previous seasons.<br /><br />The Fifth Season is the last season I enjoyed all the way through . It is the gang 's Senior Year , so that really helps with the story . The Fifth Season also had the best ending out of all the seasons.<br /><br />The Sixth Season is good for the most part . It is extremely funny , although it does n't capture the feel that the other seasons did . The gang is out of High School , so I believe that it did n't hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did . I also did n't like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to them.<br /><br />The Seventh Season captures the same feel that the 5th season had in a way , although it did n't do it all the way . I enjoyed the Seventh Season as I did all the others , and the ending is great.<br /><br />The Last Season flat out sucked . Eric was n't in it , which ruined it . Kelso was n't in it for the most part either , which did n't help . I hated the Eighth Season up until the last episode . I thought that the last episode was really good , and a fitting ending to the series.<br /><br />So overall , if you enjoy comedy , give That 70s Show a try . They stopped making new episodes , but it is still on TV a bunch . I also recommend buying Seasons 1 - 7 . It is up to you if you want to buy Season 8 .
1 This is one of the better comedies that has ever been on television . Season one was hilarious as were most of the following seasons . The only reason that I give this show a 9/10 is because of the unfortunate final season . The only good part of the final season was the finale . My favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut to people 's imaginations , often depicting the characters in famous TV shows or movies from the 70 's . It is a rare show in that i liked every character ( with the exception of the final season ... too late to try to develop a new character and fez was n't nearly as funny ) . Red 's foot in your ass comments never got old , nor did Kelso 's stupidity . Bravo to fox for keeping such a good show so long , too long even .
1 If any show in the last ten years deserves a 10 , it is this rare gem . It allows us to escape back to a time when things were simpler and more fun . Filled with heart and laughs , this show keeps you laughing through the three decades of difference . The furniture was ugly , the clothes were colorful , and the even the drugs were tolerable . The hair was feathered , the music was accompanied by roller - skates , and in the words of Merle Haggard , " a joint was a bad place to be " . Take a trip back to the greatest time in American history . Fall in love with characters and the feel good essence of the small town where people were nicer to each other . This classic is on television as much as " Full House " . Do n't miss it , and always remember to " Shake your groove thing ! ! ! "
1 In what is a truly diverse cast , this show hits it 's stride on FOX . It is the kind of sitcom that grows on you . If you just watch 1 show you might not like it much , but once you watch two or three- you get hooked.<br /><br />This is because some of the jokes hit & some miss depending upon how you view them . As is usual today , the themes are very mature . The humor is usually very mature too . Often the most funny parts are the parts where the mature themes collide with the innocent ones.<br /><br />Red ( Kurtwood Smith ) a veteran actor does some very good deadpan type of humor on this show . Debra Jo Rupp plays well in this ensemble cast too . Danny Masterson , the oldest actor of the " kids " is very good too . Laura Prepon ( Donna ) looks better in the earlier shows as a natural redhead ( who got the idea of making her a blonde ? ) . She shows very good talent & comedic timing often . She looks good without make up too.<br /><br />This is one of the better entries on FOX in the sitcom department & it 's most successful live action one since Married With Children
1 Let 's face it : the final season ( # 8 ) was one of the worst seasons in any show I 've ever enjoyed ( mostly , I 've never found dry spells to last a whole season ) . But if you judge this show by the last season , of course it 's going to come across as inferior . That is an entirely unfair assessment-- because " That ' 70s Show " was , in its day , a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about a bygone era and how the people who lived there were n't so different than we are here in modern times.<br /><br />All right ... ignoring Season 8.<br /><br />Topher Grace stars as Eric Forman , a horny geek of a teenager with a perpetual love of Donna ( Laura Prepon ) , the feminist girl next door . Playing their friends , Danny Masterson ( Hyde ) , Mila Kunis ( Jackie ) , Wilmer Valderrama ( Fez ) and even Ashton Kutcher ( Kelso ) give fantastic performances in ( almost ) every episode . The best one is probably Fez , a foreign exchange student who is as mentally promiscuous as they get . What country is he from ? Try to figure it out ! For another dimension of entertainment , Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal as Eric 's parents . Rupp , as Kitty , is both formidable and sweet , sort of like Mrs. Brady meets Marie Barone , while Smith 's Red exists mainly to scare the pogees out of everyone . Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well opposite each other as Donna 's parents , the chauvinistic but likable Bob and the airheaded Midge . Tommy Chong has occasional appearances as Leo , a stoner who acts as a father figure to Hyde.<br /><br />Apart from the anachronistic errors that pop up quite frequently and the over - the - top lessons that sometimes come ( and that deplorable final season ) , " ' 70s " is a terrific show with amazing writing , spot - on direction , and a feel - good vibe pulsing through every episode . They 're all alright .
1 This is a bad movie in the traditional sense , but taken for what it is meant to be it is quite good . Very funny and well made , although there are a few death scenes that are in bad taste , what with jiggling breasts as a girl suffocates and so on .
1 There are many kinds of reunion shows . One kind is where old actors are taken out of mothballs and set to recreate characters they have n't played for twenty or thirty years . These have mixed results . ` Return to Mayberry ' , despite some silliness , was okay ; ` Return to Green Acres ' as execrable ( Eddie Albert used a word for the script I wo n't repeat here , but both it and the movie stink ) ; ` Rescue from Gilligan 's Island ' filled in a necessary gap in the story of the castaways , though the show itself was silly even from a ` Gilligan 's Island ' viewpoint . In most cases , the scripts are weak ; sometimes a silliness appears in the scripts that is too knowing  and in comedy it 's nearly always fatal for the characters to know they 're being funny . New characters are introduced who do n't fit the mix . In the main , these reunion shows are pretty weak . A second sort of ` reunion ' show is the kind where the cast lays its past aside but sits around , telling stories , reminiscing , interspersed with flashbacks from the shows . Then there are movies based on the shows , which are rarely good ; and movies based on the history of the show ( ` The Brady Bunch ' has had both of these happen to it , with various results).<br /><br />`Return to the Batcave ' uses nearly all the above , with a wonderfully twisted viewpoint , which makes it the best of the reunion shows , and has raised the bar for the others.<br /><br />Adam West and Burt Ward and summoned to a showing of the original Batmobile . While they are there , the car is stolen . < br /><br />The Adam West of the movie is a man demented . He called Jerry , his butler , ` Alfred ' . He opens a bust of Shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to slide down to the parking garage . He 's obsessed with being a crime fighter , when in fact he 's merely a washed up actor . When the Batmobile is stolen he not only believes it 's his duty as a crime fighter to recover it , he drags and unwilling Burt Ward in as his assistant.<br /><br />The pursuit is largely loquacious , with West and Ward reminiscing about the old days . It is broken by ` flashbacks ' with actors playing West and Ward in the old days . The modern scenes and the ` flashbacks ' both have the wacky lack of reality the show maintained . There are also running gags that show West is able to make fun of himself : in Ward 's book about his time on the show , he spoke frankly about West 's libido and also his being a skinflint ( West makes Ward pay for everything in their pursuit , down to tips and bus fare ) . The clues they follow , the characters they meet ( even in flashback ) all fit the mentality of the old series , and there are several homages , including a fist fight with written sound effects.<br /><br />The whole thing is extremely funny and done with great panache . There are also cameos by Julie Newmar ( looking like she 's had one facelift too many ) and Frank Gorshin , reminding us why he has such a cult following . Gorshin will be the Riddler when Jim Carey , his obvious successor , is long forgotten . The movie builds to a fairly obvious but funny climax.<br /><br />This show is a model for reunion shows  unfortunately , there are few that can fit the pattern . This show had actors replaying their old characters ; young actors playing a movie about the making of the show ; the actors West and Ward reminiscing ; and a modern - day movie with the real Adam West playing the demented Adam West . It has everything . If you loved the old show , this is the stopper on the bottle .
1 Yes , I did , as I sit here red - faced , remembering having felt almost guilty as I watched it a couple of weeks back while my wife chose to watch something as inconsequential ( in comparison ) as " Mommie Dearest." < br /><br />How does one explain the appeal of " Batman and Robin " - I mean the only ones who ever really counted , Adam West and Burt Ward . It was a terrible show , with terrible plots and terrible acting - and , oh yes , it was terribly funny ! And the same applies to this " reunion " and " flashback " movie . Adam and Burt are invited to an auction where the old Batmobile is going to be sold off for charity . But it gets stolen , and our pals ( as themselves ) jump into their old characters ' personas ( if not their costumes ) and head off to find out what 's happened . Along the way they reminisce about the series , and we see how it all came together in flashbacks , with Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden playing the young Adam and Burt of the TV series . It really was quite interesting to get some behind the scenes looks at the old series , and Adam and Burt just stepped perfectly back into character ( even though they were n't really in character - well , you 'd have to watch it to see what I mean . ) It was also great to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin.<br /><br />If you 're not a fan of the old series , you 'll hate this . If - heaven forbid - you actually thought Michael Keaton and George Clooney made acceptable " Batmans " then you 'll hate this even more . But if you grew up with Adam and Burt and are still willing to admit that you never missed an episode - well , this one 's for you.<br /><br />Yes , it 's true - 9/10
1 This was basically an attempt to do the same thing with " Batman " that was done with " Gilligan 's Island " in " Surviving Gilligan 's Island . " For those of you who missed it ( and shame ! ) " Surviving Gilligan 's Island " ( full title : " Surviving Gilligan 's Island : The Incredibly True Story of the Longest Three Hour Tour in History " ) was a special from a few years back , where Bob Denver ( " Gilligan " ) , Dawn Wells ( " Mary Ann " ) and Russell Johnson ( " The Professor " ) related the story of the show 's creation , cancellation , rediscovery & rebirth . Along the way , stories were dramatized with actors portraying the original cast and crew . It was very well done . It was funny , well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show.<br /><br />"Return to the Batcave : The Misadventures of Adam and Burt " is in a similar style . The re - telling of the history of the show , the re - enactments , the general feel are all the same . What 's missing is the straightforward approach that " Surviving " took.<br /><br />In " Return " , Adam West and Burt Ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited . After being allowed to stay , Adam and Burt witness the theft of the centerpiece of the show : the legendary Batmobile ! Adam and Burt decide to chase after it themselves , leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show . This eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the Batmobile and why.<br /><br />Choosing to use this conceit ( actually having a plot ) is the biggest letdown of this show . Unlike " Surviving " , " Return " forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline ( the theft of the Batmobile ) instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in ( the history of the show . ) It is the historical sections that work the best . The casting ( as in " Surviving " ) is excellent . Jack Brewer ( " Adam West " ) and Jason Marsden ( " Burt Ward " ) capture the feel of the actors without looking * too * much like them . Brett Rickaby ( " Frank Gorshin " ) bears a stronger resemblance to his subject , but captures none of the late Gorshin 's charm , only his characterizations . Other actors ' portrayals are short and functional , with none standing out as especially good or bad . Many of the stories have been told before , but they mostly play out amusingly , with only the occasional clunky presentation . Another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of Lyle Waggoner 's tryout for the part of Batman . The only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story . This downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly.<br /><br />The " main plot " ( if that is what we must call it ) is , of course , ludicrous . This is not really a fault in and of itself , but it 's just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall . Strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot ( especially in these kinds of things ) but we really get neither , here . The performances by West and Ward seem somewhat flat ( even for them ) ; the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural . Again , I think the comparison to " Surviving Gilligan 's Island " can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback . In " Surviving " , that 's all it intends to be . In " Return " it tries to do double duty and , unfortunately , often fails . Gorshin and Newmar do well ( although I agree with others that Gorshin had not aged well and that Newmar had - and what 's Waggoner taking to look that good ? ) but are n't given enough to do . Again , I think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen here.<br /><br />Another odd point about " Return " . This special is about the " Batman " TV series and its history , yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie . Even the Waggoner footage is technically movie footage . If you know you 're " Bat - history " , then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first , only to be delayed in favor of the TV show when CBS needed to fill time fast . So when Waggoner and West were testing for the role , it was for the movie , not the TV show . Why " Return " only uses movie footage is unclear . It most probably has to do with rights issues , but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know : seeing Julie Newmar in the present , but only footage of Lee Meriwether as Catwoman in the past.<br /><br />Overall , I liked the show , mainly for the flashbacks . I would have preferred the style used in " Surviving Gilligan 's Island " , but I can understand why they 'd want a more story - oriented piece given the subject matter . Besides , I like these people . It 's nice to see them out and about , still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history . I just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there .
1 A strangely enjoyable effort , combining an appropriately far - fetched plot involving Adam and Burt and flashbacks to the original TV series . Most of the flashback scenes were lifted directly from Burt Ward 's book " Boy Wonder : My Life in Tights " and I imagine his book was the inspiration for making this movie . Like the book , it left fans of the original series hungering for more.<br /><br / > If you missed this broadcast , it is definitely worth the effort to borrow a tape from a friend who may have recorded it . I 'm making a copy for my kids right now .
1 I loved this movie . I knew it would be chocked full of camp and silliness like the original series . I found it very heart warming to see Adam West , Burt Ward , Frank Gorshin , and Julie Newmar all back together once again . Anyone who loved the Batman series from the 60 's should have enjoyed Return to the Batcave . You could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this film , especially Adam West . And I 'll bet he would have gladly jumped back into his Batman costume had the script required him to do so . I told a number of friends about this movie who chose not to view it ... now they wished they had . I have all of the original 120 episodes on VHS . Now this movie will join my collection . Thank You for the reunion Adam and Burt .
1 This was a well written tale of the Making of the Batman Sitcom and actually reunites our heroes on a great quest as well as offers their TV shows history . Unlike the Brady 's and Partridge family documentary movies we not only get a look into the past and present lives of Adam and Burt , but also get to see them back in action . Filled with Kapow 's and catwomen and the Riddler(s ) , Batman is back ina well told , tale that not only gives us a satisfactory closing to the Batman series , but fills the modern fan in on all the hollywood tales that about them that have n't been heard in 35 years.<br /><br />Kudos ! ! !
1 Extremely well - conceived - part whatever happened to , part behind the scenes revisitation , part reunion film - all done in the same campy style that made the original series so much fun . I only wish this had been done 10 years ago to include more guest villains who have passed on .
1 I watched this last night with low expectations . The reasons being , I do n't usually like " made for TV " movies and rarely have I liked " cast reunion " movies . But , the critic in the Los Angeles Times seemed to like this , so I gave it a chance . I 'm glad I did . It was pretty good . Adam West and Burt Ward reunite as themselves . But , in a way , they were acting as their " Batman and Robin " selves . They were being campy and not taking themselves , or this movie too seriously . The movie starts out with them searching for the " George Barris " designed Batmobile , that someone stole before it was to be auctioned off for an orphan 's home . While , they are searching for the car , they are also reminiscing about the series that they did together . This is told in flashback . It was well done . The actors that they got , for the younger Burt Ward and Adam West were dead on . And , for a TV movie , it got down to the nitty - gritty about their real behavior on and off the screen . I give this one a 9/10 , I liked it that much .
1 I really enjoyed this . I got it thinking it was going to be a documentary , but it revealed itself as a good piece of tongue in cheek fun.<br /><br />I think this has been well done , pretty much an extended TV show into a film , but due to the characters or rather original actors willingness to have fun and be made fun off helps this work in a great old style Innocent way.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the original TV series then i am sure you will enjoy this.<br /><br />Q
1 I 'm a Belgian and grew up in the sixties . Most of the US series were shown over here ( original language with subtitles ) and Batman was one of the first I was keen on . Unfortunately over here it caused a " panic hysteria " amongst the mothers because Batman was considered as too violent . Geez , compare the innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays . So because of my the over - protective mothers from the 60s I only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes ! I got so frustrated I started to collect the comics and bubblegum cards ( still got them ! ) to compensate . I even got the View Master slides ... I had an urge to see the caped crusader . All kids need some kind of hero.<br /><br />Years later I finally got the chance to see the re - runs as an adolescent and I enjoyed it tremendously . The tongue - in - cheek acting would have escaped me when I would 've watched it as a kid , but I understood it at the age of 17 . Yeah , I 've watched them all now and the occasional kind soul on the internet posts episodes because they have n't released the series on DVD ( to my knowledge)<br /><br />This evening I enjoyed " Return to the bat cave " ... it was a delight to watch because it was full of trivia and inside - jokes . To see Adam and Burt was a delight and this TV movie is simply fantastic in every aspect . They play themselves as they played their parts in the series.<br /><br />Congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic " feast " ... I 'm gon na watch it again . My advice to all Batman fans is : SEE IT ! ! ! Rent it ! ! ! Lend it from a friend ! ! ! Buy it ! ! ! I 'd never expect myself to rate this as 9/10 ... Very well done !
1 This is one of the best reunion specials ever , with Adam West and Burt Ward parodying themselves and having fun while doing it . It 's amazing the amount of effort that went into the detail , particularly recapturing the feel of the 1960 's era , the Batcave set , Wayne Manor , the costumes , and the actors selected to play the younger versions of West , Ward , Burgess Meredith , Cesar Romero , and Frank Gorshin ! This 90 minutes is well worth your time , and is a delight to all fans of the classic 1960 's " Batman " television series . I note that clips from " Batman " were from the movie , and not the series itself , probably because of legal restrictions . Let 's hope the three seasons of the show are forthcoming on DVD .
1 Corny ! I love it ! Corny - just as the TV show was about 40 years ago ! Adam and Burt rekindle the same on - screen chemistry that never seems to have left ! They re - live old memories , plus the actors that play them from the 1960s show some behind - the - scenes things which are quite interesting to know . 1960s TV was corny escapism for so many of us back then , and this DVD is no exception , if you are familiar with the original TV show . The fight scene with the written Boofs and Bams or whatever is fantastic ! ! The movie theater scene shows clips of the villains who passed away . At the end Frank Gorshin makes an appearance . He passed away not too long after this DVD was made , I believe , so it is to his great credit that he came back to again play a villain to Adam and Burt , just as he did to Batman & Robin so many years ago . He did n't lose his touch ! Thanks to Julie Newmar to re - living a villain role , also . In conclusion I think that this DVD is for great memories , and I wish to thank both Adam and Burt for coming back and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original- ! ! ! Thanks , Guys ! ! !

1 I do n't hand out ten star ratings easily . A movie really has to impress me , and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that . Furthermore , this trilogy has come together so nicely , that I believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time . Though all three films could not be any more different from the Ludlum novels , they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement . The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete , yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours.<br /><br />From the moment that the opening title appeared , I knew we were in for a ride . Paul Greengrass has done it again . Everything we love from the previous Bourne films is here once again : the action , the dialogue , and of course the shaky camera . However for me , that last one was never a problem . I think it adds to the suspense.<br /><br />I will be back to see this film several times before it is released on DVD , simply because it is genius . It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion , and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie , and altogether , an unforgettable trilogy .
1 The Bourne Ultimatum ( 2007 ) Review : After a thrilling set of two , we get the final installment . Here 's my take:<br /><br />The Bourne Ultimatum has it all . We have Jason Bourne(Matt Damon ) on the coattails of the ones who know everything . He has been running for too long . This time , it ends.<br /><br />The Bourne Ultimatum has a great plot , awesome writing , fantastic direction , suspense , and some of the best action of the summer . Matt Damon delivers possibly his best performance to date . He has the conviction and swelling desire of the troubled assassin.<br /><br />There are some intelligent humor here and some fine suspense . The reactions to certain events will have you either laughing(in a good way ) or cheering on . ( or both ) I heard a lot of intelligent laughter in the theater and lots of clapping . The audience was loving it.<br /><br />The Bourne Ultimatum delivers all in a nicely gift - wrapped package . All of the goods and then some . This is , in my opinion the best movie this summer.<br /><br />The Last Word : Excellent conclusion . The best of the trilogy . This is how summer movie thrillers should be done . I love the Bourne trilogy .
1 Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands , trying to make sense of what he 's just done . Meanwhile , a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agency 's response to what 's just happened on screen . An American flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot , but as he speaks , it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory , as if it does n't want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national security.<br /><br />This shot effectively captures the mood of the film . As well as portraying Bourne 's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne , Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security.<br /><br />It is also probably the best film you 'll see in the cinema this year . < br /><br />It 's just so intense . Bourne says to Simon Ross ( Considine ) " This is n't some newspaper story , this is real " and in the audience you almost believe him . The camera shakes , but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like you 're there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers , and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters they 're portraying , instead of just being actors performing well - written roles . The action scenes are so brutally fast - paced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement ; the stunt - work is nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />The pacing is just incredible . It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion , but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot ; the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action set - piece . While they 're often simple ( the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone ) they 're charged with such dramatic intensity that you ca n't take your eyes off them . The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you ca n't help being swept along by it.<br /><br />With its intense action set - pieces , brilliantly paced storyline , and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security , the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age . Ultimatum is its peak .
1 This is the first 10 out of 10 that I 've given any movie . What made this movie so good for me ? Constant action - there is n't any slow parts , great acting , smart writing . I also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene . Finally , I get to see an action movie that does n't try to please all sectors of the public ( i.e. there 's no forced romance).<br /><br />I liked the first two Bourne movies , but I loved this one.<br /><br />Warning - after watching this movie , you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car !
1 I have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me . Most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up , show off sexy models , and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window . With that said , the Bourne series has been fantastic . Doug Liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style , showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly . This is not the sci - fi absurdity that was Bond ( before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less ) . There was a lot to worry for when the Bourne Supremacy came out . With director Paul Greengrass taking over , what could have been a second - hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair . The stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it . Greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment , The Bourne Ultimatum . In what is an amazing conclusion to a top - notch trilogy , the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised.<br /><br />Once again , Bourne is brought into the minds of the CIA by false pretenses . Someone has leaked information about the Treadstone upgrade called Blackbriar and once Bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story , he is assumed to be the mole . Only Pamela Landy , she who was on the case to find him in Supremacy , knows that he ca n't be the one . Bourne 's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace . It has been the CIA who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them . What ends up transpiring is that Bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer . The film , then , becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends , or if Bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him.<br /><br />In what is probably the simplest storyline of the series , with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story , it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression . This is not a detriment at all , however , as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot . Admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight , between Bourne and the CIA 's second asset , alone . The chase jumping through windows in Madrid is cool on its own , but when they finally meet up , we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you 'll see . Also , rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films , we instead get around three small scale road races , just as intense , but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony.<br /><br />After five years of waiting , we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling . By the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him . No one could have done it better than Matt Damon . He has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences , but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him . Joan Allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job , but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how Brian Cox 's character , from the first two films , took matters into his own hands . Needing a role in that mold , we are given a nice turn from David Strathairn . Like Cox , he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision . With as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the Blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country , you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing . Even the little guys do a wonderful job , like Paddy Considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything , Albert Finney as a man from Bourne 's past and possibly key to his origin , and Edgar Ramirez as one of the CIA 's operatives sent to take Bourne out . Ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by Clive Owen ( Identity ) , Karl Urban , and Martin Csokas ( Supremacy ) . He does n't talk much , if at all , but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in Domino.<br /><br />In the end , one has to applaud Paul Greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them . His skill at the close - up hand - held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as Tony Scott , but without quite the seizure - inducing cuts . Rather than feel like over- production , his use of hand - held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action . Let 's also credit cinematographer Oliver Wood , who shot all three Bourne films . He was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them .
1 When the Bourne Identity arrived five years ago I have to confess that I did n't think much of it . At the time I was eleven years old , so perhaps I was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario . Two years ago when the Bourne Supremacy arrived I thought it was a better movie than Identity but still did n't think it was as good as I expected it to be judging by the trailers . Over the past two years I had been told numerous times that the Bourne movies were amazing , many a time I had to bite my tongue and not say what I really thought about the movies . Until two months ago I could n't have given a damn about the Bourne Ultimatum , I really had no intentions of watching it . But then I decided to go back and re - watch the first two before I came to any abrupt decisions . So I went out and bought both the original movies . And what a surprise it was to me when I was gripped by them . Identity I found the superior of the two , but Supremacy is n't far behind . They 're both slick , action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that I have watched numerous times since I bought them . Because of this I was first in line today to see the Bourne Ultimatum . And boy did Bourne Ultimatum not disappoint ! < br /><br />Matt Damon was never one of my favourite actors until he appeared in the Bourne movies , I 'd seen him in the Talented Mr Ripley , but I never thought much of him in general . However , it appears he was born to play Bourne ( pardon the pun ) . Throughout this series we have seen the character change before our very eyes , in this movie we see Matt Damon at his very best , even better than he was in The Departed and I thought he was one of the best things in The Departed . You really do find yourself caring for the character and hoping that he finds out everything . Matt Damon plays the role with a quiet intensity and you always find his character extremely believable . The supporting cast of the movie were also absolutely outstanding . Joan Allen was one of my favourite things in Bourne Supremacy , here she excels herself . Her character is also very believable and she has some superbly acted moments towards the end of the movie . Julia Stiles turns up again as Nicky and finally we learn a bit about her character . Julia Stiles is a very underrated actress and I think she deserves a lot more roles , well decent roles , than she gets . David Strathairn is a newcomer to this series as Noah Vosen , he 's definitely the bad guy of the movie and he really excels . He 's definitely the nastiest character we 've met , and some of the decisions he makes are truly nasty . Strathairn relishes the role and he too gets some superb scenes in the movie . Special mention must also go to Albert Finney who makes the most of his all too brief screen time , I will not say anything about the character , that 's best left as a surprise , but trust me his scenes are some of the highlights of the movie.<br /><br />The Bourne movies have always had a strict focus on the storyline more than the action sequences , this is n't to say the trilogy lacks action sequences , good god no there 's loads of them dotted all throughout the movies . But running throughout the movie is a very well written and well acted storyline . This storyline concludes in the best way imaginable in this movie . As I watched Supremacy the night before I saw Ultimatum it was nice because I could notice certain little parts . That very final scene in Supremacy , in New York , a lot more important that I ever imagined at the time . Wo n't spoil it for people but I recommend checking up on Supremacy before you see Ultimatum . Unfortunately though for a lot of people they will go to see Ultimatum purely because of the action sequences . This is the part where I should condemn such people and say they should see it for the storyline , but I 'd be lying if I did n't say that my favourite parts of the Bourne series as a whole are the car chases . The mini car chase in Identity is one of my favourite car chases of all time . Well the action in Ultimatum has to be the best of the Bourne series . In fact the movie kicks off with an action sequence in Moscow . So in the duration of the movie we get numerous punch ups , all very violent and shockingly brutal . A bike chase that is absolutely amazing , many foot chases which are even more amazing , a thrilling car chase that is unforgettable , and oh so much more ! But the highlight for me has to be the scene in Waterloo station , wo n't ruin it but for some reason had me gripped.<br /><br />So any flaws for the movie ? In my eyes no , but if you are not a fan of the Bourne series or have not seen the previous two then I would n't recommend Ultimatum for you . The movie does n't try to win over any new fans as it sticks to what the franchise does best and just adds a nice bit more storyline and action sequences on top . The Bourne Ultimatum is undoubtedly the best of the series and the best blockbuster of 2007 . As a James Bond fanatic it is a great honour for me to say that Ultimatum is a lot better than a majority of the Bond movies , and trust me it takes a lot for me to say that . While Bourne as a whole might not be a better franchise than the Bond series , it is definitely nearly its equal .
1 Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne for last ! I 've heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie , and some have even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project . All I have to say to that is ... are you kidding me ? Come on it was not that bad at all . I think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic , which I would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography . As for the rest of the movie I really did n't even notice it.<br /><br />You can tell that Damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of Jason Bourne . Sometimes that can be a bad thing , but in this case its a really good thing . He really becomes Jason Bourne in this installment . Damon also has a great supporting cast in Joan Allen , Ezra Kramer , and Julia Stiles . David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast , as he added more depth to the secret CIA organization.<br /><br />Even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action , they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on . This film stands far above the other two Bourne movies , and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season !
1 " The Bourne Ultimatum " begins recklessly mid - chase and in pulse - pounding fashion explodes from there as Jason Bourne ( Matt Damon , absolutely superb ) tracks down the masterminds behind the CIA black - ops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity . A devastatingly icy David Strathairn as the " man behind the curtain " is added to the returning cast of regulars including Joan Allen ( excellent ) and Julia Stiles ( non - existent).<br /><br />Like the second entry in the series , I wished Paul Greengrass ' shaky hand - held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime . However , that being said , it 's a perfect way to capture the tense , claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand - to - hand - combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pile - up . Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant globe - hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities . The Bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper - reality that is full of technological - based magic . It makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time , but I 'll be damned if it is n't a blast to watch them get there.<br /><br />With the absence of the emotive and involving Franka Potente , the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between Damon and Stiles , but she is so blank - faced an actress it never really leads to anything . Still , this can be forgiven , for unlike the " Identity " and the " Supremacy " , this " Ultimatum " reveals all and we finally learn the truth about Bourne 's past . It 's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series , and if they have any good sense , and Damon gets his wish , this will be the perfect end to it .
1 Having not seen the previous two in the trilogy of Bourne movies , I was a little reluctant to watch The Bourne Ultimatum.<br /><br />However it was a very thrilling experience and I did n't have the problem of not understanding what was happening due to not seeing the first two films . Each part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before it had reached the interval ! I do n't think I have ever watched such an exquisitely made , and gripping film , especially an action film . Since I usually shy away from action and thriller type movies , this was such great news to me . Ultimatum is one of the most enthralling films , it grabs your attention from the first second till the last minute before the credits roll.<br /><br />Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne . I 've heard a lot about his great performances in the Bourne 1 + 2 , and now , this fabulous actor has one more to add to his list . I look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future.<br /><br />The stunts were handled with style - each one was done brilliantly and I was just shocked by the impressiveness of this movie . Well done .
1 I will begin by saying I am very pleased with this climax of the Bourne trilogy . Please , oh please do n't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel . Just leave it alone . Right .. moving on . As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is ... it seems as though he was just meant to play Jason Bourne.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the first two Bourne movies , you will not be disappointed by the third installment . It sticks to what works and adds a little more . I was very pleased to see how well all the information we obtain in ' Identity ' and ' Supremacy ' all mesh in ' Ultimatum ' to finally paint the full picture of Jason Bourne 's troubled past . The action sequences are fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat . The fights between Bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch . I have always been a fan of movies surrounding CIA agents and how the CIA gather their Intel and this movie is right up that street , making it even more exciting for me.<br /><br />If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments .. you will still thoroughly enjoy the movie but I would still recommend you watch them first . This would allow you to fully understand the character Jason Bourne and become attached and be a part of his world . This allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more . I 'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but I personally think ' Ultimatum ' might , just MIGHT , have the edge when comparing the trilogy .
1 The final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films . It goes further to play the anti - Bond theme . Bourne does n't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past . Everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography / stunt work to the script to acting.<br /><br />The film starts out in a flurry as Bourne is running from the Moscow police . The story seems to pick up right where the first film left off . Or does it ? The time is a little muddled here , but we get the fact that Bourne is remembering things . A sudden flashback while trying to clean himself up nearly gets him caught , but he makes it and does n't kill anyone . They are n't his target . From there we get more of the intrigue of his past with a new player , Noah Vosen , who seems to know everything about Bourne and will protect it at all costs . Pamela Landy is back as well as Nicky Parsons who seems to have a past with Bourne as well.<br /><br />The cinematography is in your face following tight on practically everything . The car chase is even more intense if that seems possible than the ones from the first two . And the veteran cast chasing Bourne is superb with a nice part by Albert Finney . It also has slight political overtones in relationship to rendition and other government policies , but that is minor and integrated very well within the plot . All in all this is the best of the trilogy conclusions this year , if not the best action trilogy ever .
1 First and foremost , speaking as no fan of the genre , " The Bourne Ultimatum " is a breathtaking , virtuoso , superb action movie.<br /><br />Secondly , it is a silly malarky of cartoonish super - hero stuff.<br /><br />Thirdly , the film carries a complex , important point , about crime - fighters turning into criminals themselves . No reference is made to Abu Ghraib or the Executive Branch 's outrageous domestic assaults on constitutional rights , none is necessary.<br /><br />So , the latest in the " Bourne " series , in the hands of Paul Greengrass ( of the 2004 " Bourne Supremacy " and last year 's " United 93 " ) , is a significant achievement , perhaps held back but not actually diminished by the unavoidable excesses of the genre.<br /><br />"Breathtaking " above is meant both as a complimentary adjective and a description of the physical sensation : for more than an hour from the first frame , the viewer seemingly holds his breath , pushed back against the chair by the force of relentless , globe - trotting , utterly suspenseful action . There is no letup , no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film , and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some kindred music videos do after just a couple of minutes.<br /><br />Oliver Wood 's in - your - face cinematography is making the best of Tony Gilroy 's screenplay from Robert Ludlum 's 1990 novel ( which does n't stack up well against the " Bourne Identity , " written a decade earlier).<br /><br />Matt Damon is once again the inevitable , irreplaceable Bourne , the deadliest of fantasy CIA agents , this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity , his past , and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine . Nothing like his quietly heroic Edward R. Murrow , the always - marvelous David Strathairn is the nasty top agency official , pitched against Bourne in trying to hide some illegal " take - no - prisoners " policies and brutal procedures.<br /><br />Joan Allen plays what appears to be the Good Cop against Strathairn 's Bad One . And , there is Julia Stiles as the agent once again coming to Bourne 's aid ; a combination of Greengrass ' direction and Stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character , her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue.<br /><br />So good is " The Bourne Ultimatum " that it gets away with the old one - man - against - the - world bit , this time stretched to ridiculous excesses , as Bourne defies constraints of geography , time , gravity ... and physics in general . ( Can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building ? Why not - it looks great . ) < br /><br />All this " real - world " magic - leaping from country to country in seconds , to arrive at some unknown location exactly as , when , and how needed - outdoes special - effect and superhero cartoon improbabilities . And yet , only a clueless pedant would allow " facts " interfere with the entertainment - based ecstasy of the Bourne fantasy .
1 I m going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you . This movie is awesome . From beginning to end , it is filled with genuine thrills . The fight scenes are fantastic , the chase scenes are enthralling , and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained , but that is only because everything that preceded it . Damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor , daring you not to believe him in this role . He is this role . A welcome addition to the series in David Straithrain ( hope i spelled that close to right ) as a seedy CIA agent out to kill Bourne . This is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way . Some things toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous , thus negating a 10 rating . The ending is left open for sequels and I sure hope that they consider doing more of these , for none have been bad . Excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy.<br /><br />P.S. The shaky cam did not hurt any of the action , but I still think we could do without it . The good news is , you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action .
1 The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne ( Matt Damon in his best role ever ) , the newest spy kid on the block , brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the CIA 's latest program " Blackbriar " to make super assassins like himself.<br /><br />I was so psyched for this one that I watched it 's predecessors yesterday and today . Identity was as brilliant as I recall and Supremacy remains the weak ( but still enjoyable ) link in the chain for the weakest plot and , aside from a car chase which this film 's chase easily tops , slight lacking in action and suspense.<br /><br />Hoo boy , does Ultimatum have suspense ! Even when you know Bourne will escape the authorities ( and boy do these films spotlight the police as inept ) , it 's still brilliant watching him do it . It 's mind - boggling to think that two guys with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more suspense than anything those $ 150 million giant robots did in Transformers.<br /><br />Chalk it up to Paul Greengrass , who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting stedicam a la documentary , even though he 's filming characters that are far from ordinary , in places like CIA headquarters where no one within 10 miles would be allowed with a camcorder . He seemed to listen to my various complaints with Supremacy , as the action in Ultimatum is nothing less than awe - inspiring , with various implements used as weapons being a candlestick , a hardcover book ( I 'll never look at those the same way again ) and an electric fan ( Do n't ask ) . The music also helped generate much suspense , and there was hardly ever a moment to not nail - bite over.<br /><br />The acting is good , and the evolution of Julia Stiles ' character " Nicky " put her situation into a new highly sympathetic light . Damon plays his signature role with reserve but competency ( which sounds minor but that it genuinely looks like Matt Damon could evade the CIA and Interpol is something ) , but noticeable moments of poignancy as he still struggles to find his humanity . This longing of his for a real life could get boring , and almost did in Supremacy , but just works better in Ultimatum ( better script ) . < br /><br />I am reminded of a scene in " Goldeneye " ( the only good Pierce Brosnan Bond film ) in which Sean Bean 's character asks James if the martinis ever silence the screams of all the men he 's killed . Bourne regrets all the people he killed , and he considers ( or at least made me consider ) the meaning of action without purpose , life without meaning , and how the government has transformed men into resources . Albeit , resources that know Krav Maga and can make weapons out of anything.<br /><br />Sidenote : it 's always bothered me that , despite being a superspy and hunted by the CIA , Interpol , and the police nearly ANYWHERE he goes , that Bourne never thought to make even the smallest attempts to disguise his features or forge some new passports . Sunglasses maybe ? < br /><br />If you have a pulse and love action movies , than Bourne Ultimatum is for you . Hell , it 's probably the best action film to come out this year . Of course , you 'd be a fool to see it without watching the others first . It kind of drags a touch near the end , but I almost feel tempted to overlook that . This is the first " 3 " movie this summer to at least match , if not exceed , the original and that is saying something.<br /><br />A-
1 I watched both Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before seeing this in the theater . I 'd been waiting for this since before they started filming . I was n't disappointed.<br /><br />Minor spoilers below- < br /><br />Overall it was good , but it also lacked the continuity of the first two . Identity and Supremacy both flowed gracefully between adrenaline rush action to introspective drama . This movie felt choppy at times . The plot - building down - times were slightly too drawn out . That caused the following action to feel too frenetic.<br /><br />Camera : Speaking of frenetic , the trademark Greengrass shaky cam was present and very annoying to me . I know its has been talked / whined about to nausea on the message board , but it does n't mean it 's not relevant . All the martial arts training the actors went through was totally wasted . The ridiculous camera cuts and wiggling camera ruined most of the fighting in the movie . It is a cheap , student director trick to make the film feel unsettled . I 'd expect those techniques to be used in some horror flick made for high school kids , but not in this classy , adult , action series . Too much extreme close - up also . Do some framing . Get some interesting shots . Constant close - up feels like lazy directing to me.<br /><br />Story : The story was VERY confusing at first . They thrust new names and faces upon you from the get go . Gave me the feeling that you get when you come into a movie late and know you 've missed some crucial information . Felt rushed or compressed for time reasons . After you catch up however the story is quite good . It 's enjoyable following leads along with Bourne . HOWEVER , I did NOT care for the whole last scene of Supremacy ( Landy / Bourne on the phone ) being in the middle of Ultimatum thing . It basically makes the movie a half - prequel . I thought that was awkward.<br /><br />Cast / Characters : The star of the movie is the action . Obviously there are only two originals left . Bourne and Nicky Parsons . Them teaming up was kind of odd to me . I think they just wanted to give Bourne someone to protect to and confide in . Unless I completely missed something , they never even tell you why they teamed up . The other assassins in the movie were pretty quiet . This felt like Gilroy / Greengrass / whoever wanting to not leave open ends . Understandable but disappointing . Seriously , Damon with Clive Owen in Identity and Marton Csokas in Supremacy .. Those scenes were phenomenal . These assassins are as uninteresting as Castel ( the first fella Bourne fights in Identity ) . The cast in general has degraded as the the series went on . Clive Owen was practically an afterthought . That 's a measure of strength for that first cast . The second , they basically trade Chris Cooper for Joan Allen .... Not exactly equal . This one trades Brian Cox and Franka Potente for 3 actors to be named later . Nothing against David Strathairn , Scott Glenn , or Albert Finney , but they 're not the first names that come to mind for this kind of series . Aside from a couple pauses that seemed to long , the acting was right on.<br /><br />As a whole , it was successful . Felt like they wanted to get the series over with though . If they would have trimmed or rearranged the slower parts , eliminated Scott Glenn 's part entirely , zoomed out , and taken the camera away from the seizure victim , it would have been perfect.<br /><br />ENDING SPOILER < br /><br />I do n't see why they leave Bourne alive at the end . It was my understanding this was the conclusion . They clearly made reference to the very beginning of the series with his silhouette floating motionless . I thought that was going to be it . A full circle type of ending . I did like Nicky reacting to the news report though.<br /><br />SPOILER SPECIFICS WARNING - QUOTE FROM MOVIE BELOW -<br /><br />Bourne 's last line at the end " Look at this .. Look at what they make you give . " quoting the first assassin he killed , I loved that . The final scene was great . ( Except that it was Vosen { Strathairn } that shot at Bourne . Why would he do that ? Just out for vengeance ? If he was angry enough to murder , why not shoot Pamela Landy after she faxes his top secret file ? That did n't make sense . )
1 He now has a name , an identity , some memories and a a lost girlfriend . All he wanted was to disappear , but still , they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built . Now he wants some explanation , and to get ride of the people how made him what he is . Yeah , Jason Bourne is back , and this time , he 's here with a vengeance.<br /><br />OK , this movie does n't have the most elaborated script in the world , but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society . Of course , like every Hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90 's , " The Bourne Suprematy " is a super - heroes story . Jason Bourne is a Captain - America project - like , who 's gone completely wrong . In the first movie , the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one . He now fights against what he considers like evil , after a person close to him has been killed ( his girlfriend in " Suprematy " ) by them . That 's all a part of the super - hero story , including a character with ( realistic but still impressive : he almost invincible ) super powers.<br /><br />And the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world ( there 's no frontiers in the Bourne 's movies , characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye ) , is , as in the best seasons of " 24 " , an American enemy , who 's beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him . Funny how " mad patriots " are now the N.1 enemies of paranoiac Hollywood 's stories.<br /><br />Beside all those interesting thematics , the movie is n't flawless : the feminine character of Nickie Parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes . But all that does n't really matter , for " The Bourne Ultimatum " is an action movie . And the action scenes are rather impressive.<br /><br />Everyone here is talking about the " Waterloo scene " and the " Tanger pursuit " and everyone 's right . I particularly enjoyed the fight in Tanger , that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of Tsui Hark . Visually inventive scenes , lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on American 's contemporary thematics : " The Bourne Ultimatum " is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick .
1 The third and last part of the Bourne trilogy ( duh ) , is lacking a bit in the story department , but covers it with extensive action scenes ! Twi in particular take up quite some of the running time and make this movie better.<br /><br />The director and star ( Damon ) themselves agreed that it was difficult to find a story for the last part , because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced story - wise . How they got around that ? The action scenes , for once , but they did another thing too , which I ca n't reveal , because that would be a spoiler . But if you watch the movie , than you 'll notice it ! Funnily enough I read , that this adaptation of the Bourne books is the least accurate of all three films .. if that means anything to you :o)
1 The third and last film of this trilogy is finally crystal clear . It is a political film more than a plain entertainment . Jason Bourne will finally know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he was submitted to in order to kill his old identity : he really killed some one who became his corpse . But the film is finally revealing that all this had been organized and planned by the CIA within a Blackfriars program that is also clearly revealed in this film as aiming at eliminating all American citizens who tried to prevent the control of the whole society by an established and limited group of people . Who was one essential officer of the CIA up to 1980 , when he became vice president ? That goes along with what is being said on the Internet . Then the truth will come thanks to Jason Bourne himself but the main person who will be able to bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can take a decision concerning the CIA is a woman and that woman gets the Senate involved in a general investigation . A woman and the Senate ; read my lips . In the USA politics are fought in the media and two media are essential for any presidential campaign : it is music and the cinema . Right now Hollywood and beyond the intelligentsia , academia and intellectuals are using the cinema in general , and this film in particular , to build up the idea in the public that salvation will come from a woman and from the Senate . So go and watch the film . It is pretty entertaining and it has the sweet fragrance of the end of a period and of the great change some are expecting and others are waiting for , but no one is able to pretend it wo n't come : the only point is to know how deep and serious it will be.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University Paris Dauphine , University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
1 This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization . In reality , perhaps they are . After all , the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne.<br /><br />Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film . He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is . He gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film , somebody is trying to kill him.<br /><br />There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real . There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less Hollywood than many pictures . These sequences add realism to the film in feeling.<br /><br />The suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off . This is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & I am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series .
1 Picking up right after the Moscow - showdown of Supremacy , this is Bourne 's greatest adventure and his final climax . Throughout the tight , 115-min - runtime the movie takes Bourne from Russia to Madrid , Paris , Marocco and ultimately New York . Damon is every inch of the hard - trained killer Robert Ludlum imagined , he is the most deadly spy in the movies right now , and it 's the underpinned emotions to his character that makes him so believable , and it 's exactly the fine way Damon manages to combine these two polar - opposites of himself that 's so breathtaking . In this third , Bourne is on a mission to save his soul and while watching it , Ultimatum delivers such an high - octane performance that you 'll find yourself sweating and gasping over its truly powerful branch of ideas and pull - offs ; just look out for two great car - chases and a fight - scene as realistic as Bond vs. Shaw back in ' 63 . Director Greengrass has surpassed himself with this compelling thriller and this is probably as exciting as cinema thrillers get ; a true pay - off to Bourne fans and a new breed of spy - thriller standard .
1 Having not seen the films before ( and not being able to stand Matt Damon ) , I was reluctant to go see The Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to see it for AS Film Studies . < br /><br />However , I was pleasantly surprised that even a film with Damon in it could be enjoyable . < br /><br />Fast fight scenes , crazy motorbike chases and BIG explosions were what threw you out of your seat in TBU . The near - misses between the CIA and Bourne kept you on your toes and throughly entertained.<br /><br />Nevertheless , several things really grated my cheese.<br /><br />Firstly , the fact that the film was just a series of Bourne , CIA , Bourne , CIA , Bourne , CIA . This sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull . Although Damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the CIA , I was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of Bourne . He crashed a car and got out as if he had tapped it or something ! Very unrealistic.<br /><br />And secondly ( inevitably ) - the SHAKY CAMERA . It was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class ( even the tutors ) seasick . We were told by the tutors that if we ever used that in a film we made in class , it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod . Fair enough if Greengrass wanted it to look like we were there watching Damon and Stiles holding a conversation , but surely we would n't be shaking our heads that violently!<br /><br />But all in all TBU is an enjoyable film and worth a watch . But I did n't think it was the best film of the year , despite being an entertaining piece of cinema.<br /><br />8/10 .
1 The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final outing for super - spy Jason Bourne , a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer . The Bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics ( Ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com , meaning it 's status is " universal acclaim ) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing.<br /><br />First , I highly advise you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy , the two fancy - titled prequels to Ultimatum . There may be three different movies , but in reality they are all a continuance of one another : missing one leaves you stranded and confused , just like I was . You will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of Ultimatum if you missed the first two , but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion.<br /><br />If you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie , you probably had a treat watching Bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from Supremacy . Jason Bourne is played very well by Matt  Damon . Damon does nothing to deserve an Oscar nod , but his work here is good enough to hold it 's own . Bourne 's adventures take place in many different cities ; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times . The agency tracking Bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down.<br /><br />I wo n't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies . However , it would n't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die - hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development . Ultimatum would n't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front.<br /><br />It seems most people agree that Ultimatum was a success of a film : the movie opened to $ 69 million , and -box office total now is up to $ 216 mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since August 3 . It 's the best action movie I 've seen since Live Free or Die Hard.<br /><br />Good ) Damon is solid but not spectacular , very smart movie Bad ) Story is like many others
1 This movie was excellent . I was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did . Like all the Bourne movies the action is fast paced , realistic and intense . If you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one also . The movie 's plot is straightforward and there are no plot twists that are too unrealistic . OK , Julia Stiles character showing up in the Italian safe house was kind of far - fetched especially after what happened in Supremacy but it makes sense that she is the only character in " Treadstone " that Bourne knows , that does not want him dead and he could possibly trust and the only person to lead him in the right direction . The action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening all around them . The thing that I always loved about the Bourne movies is that Bourne can kick butt but when matched with people as good as he is the fights are struggles and he takes a lot of damage in them . They never treat the audience like idiots.<br /><br />All the actors were solid in their performances . I believe that Damon could play Bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from Joan Allen reprising her role from Supremacy , David Strathairn and Scott Glenn . I recommend this film and the trilogy . I do miss Franka Potente though .
1 " Perhaps we can arrange a meet . " " Where are you now ? " " I 'm sitting in my office . " " I doubt that . " " Why would you doubt that ? " " If you were in your office right now we 'd be having this conversation face - to - face . " < br /><br />Bourne remains street tough , and elusive . Only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy . Conversation is macho , to the point with only shards of Bond type gallows humour . Its all about the action.<br /><br />The feeling that there is something going on at another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy coveys so well . A scene set in Waterloo with a Guardian journalist does this to great effect . There is no meeting of worlds - you are in it or just a superfluous body.<br /><br />If the shaky cam does n't annoy you too much , enjoy this film and hope they somehow keep the franchise going .
1 I saw the The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with a friend , and , wow ! I had already seen the first two films and I liked them , but Ultimatum , I loved.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne , a amnesia suffering CIA agent on the run , trying to discover who he is.<br /><br />Like I already said , I loved this movie from start to finish , no plot holes , slow scenes , everything was paced just right and it fit in well with the other films , but in all senses it was much better.<br /><br />Best stunts , car chases , actors , and effects I 've seen in an action movie all summer , ( surprisingly due to Spider - Man 3 , Pirates , etc . ) But I it was n't just action in this film , Jason does n't just kill and run . He has a soul and the audience feels for him , so drama is included . But that does n't slow it down.<br /><br />Of all the " threequels " that came out last summer , this was the best .
1 Last Christmas , I was lucky enough to receive one of the 1200 Ultimate Bourne boxed sets from my Better Half but put off watching the final part of the trilogy until yesterday . Given how many recent trilogies have stumbled over the finishing line instead of striding triumphantly through it , I was somewhat wary of approaching " The Bourne Ultimatum " but I really should n't have been worried . The electric actions sequences and bruising fight scenes mix effortlessly alongside the intelligent story - lines to make this one of the very best action thrillers I can recall seeing and a sublime end to an excellent series.<br /><br />Jason Bourne ( Matt Damon ) returns after an apparent leak about Operation Blackbriar - a new program based on the old Treadstone project - to the journalist Simon Ross ( Paddy Considine ) at the Guardian . Determined to uncover more about his half - remembered past , Bourne picks up the trail once again but others at the CIA including Deputy Director Noah Vosen ( David Strathairn ) believe that Bourne himself is the leak and start to pursue the rogue agent with renewed vigour . Can Bourne finally find the answers he has been looking for or will his old employers silence him for good ? < br /><br />Personally , I felt slightly disappointed with " The Bourne Supremacy " as it ditched the trademark realism of its action scenes and focused on being a proper spy film . Not to say it lost it altogether but compared to the fantastic " Bourne Identity " , it seemed more like a slow - burning spy novel rather than an action - thriller . No such worries here - every car crash , punch , kick and gun shot is heard and felt with visceral delight but thankfully , it still retains a wonderfully intelligent and gripping spy story at its heart to base the action around . It also brilliantly ties together the two earlier films , providing a suitable bookend to the trilogy as things are explained and expanded until the full picture is exposed . Performances throughout are nearly faultless - even Julia Styles begins to offer something more than book - wormy eye - candy . The only real downer is that this , like the other Bourne films , has little to do with the original novel but unless you 're a die - hard Ludlum fan , this is n't really any real reason to dislike a movie like this of the very highest calibre.<br /><br />Nothing pleases me more than a movie that takes me pleasantly by surprise and despite my fears , " The Bourne Ultimtum " is a cracking movie filled with enough bone - crunching action to satisfy the meat - heads as well as a plot that never threatens to let go of your attention for a single minute . Even at the final reel , you 're never entirely sure whether a happy ending is assured but whether you are a fan of the series or not ( and if not , what more do you want ? ) , this is one film you really should track down as soon as you possibly can . No wonder this series forced the producers of the Bond movies to throw out forty - odd years of movie history in order to start again . Bourne is a modern spy hero and made recent Bond films look more like Austin Powers in comparison until " Casino Royale " gave the Bond series the reboot it desperately needed . Missing out of the Jason Bourne movies is a crime worthy of rendition - go and get yourself a copy of the DVD . Not the Ultimate Bourne collection though - limited edition , I 'm afraid !
1 By the end of the first hour my jaw was nestled comfortably between my feet . The movie never , and I do mean never , lets up in action . It may be mild action but it 's action . Once again every member of the cast fits perfectly . The explosions were realistic , the chase scenes were feasible , and the fighting was incredible . Matt Damon will forever be Jason Bourne.<br /><br />All I really have to say is that every Bourne movie gets better and this is no exception . The action , the stakes , the plot . How they do it I will never know . I applaud the man who wrote the screen plays to every one of these movies . Because if he had n't done such a great job with the first movie , we would n't have this one to talk about.<br /><br />So do n't go see it in theaters , go experience it in theaters if it 's still out where you live , but if not December 11th Bourne comes home to you !
1 Along with " Brothers & Sisters " , " Six Degrees " was one of my favorite new dramas of fall 2006 . < br /><br />Great cast all around , but really enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott ( the come - back photog ) and Hope Davis ( recent widow of journalist killed in Iraq).<br /><br />Aside from the acting , the writing was fresh and the acting superb . The show was also shot in NYC , the real city , not the Warner Bros. or some other studio 's backlot , adding a secondary layer or realism . < br /><br />I guess people are more interested in the latest " Survivor " and other reality garbage . Too bad it did n't last .
1 I loved this show so much and I 'm so incredibly sad its canceled i thought it came back too , but just two stupid weeks . That s terrible . i hate how we never find out how everyone ends up . it sucks . Bring it back ! ABC has stupid shows like Supernanny and whatnot but does n't give time to good ones like Six Degrees . If they 're complaining about ratings it was probably because they had a bad slot because this was truly a good show , something I could relate to and anticipated . JJ Abrams delivered , he 's awesome , I wish ABC could just trust him enough to complete the story . I loved the entire cast too . I could n't wait to see how everyone would someday meet each other at once . Everyone 's story is now left incomplete , now I 'll never know if Steven and Whitney would get together or Carlos and Mae . I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and everyone else . This is really such a downer .
1 This show was Fabulous . It was intricate and well written and all the characters where likable with out being horribly sweet . Even Jonathan Cake the philandering boyfriend was likable . Since our airwaves are filled with crap like American Idol and Dancing with the Stars , it was nice to see a drama that was not too soap opera like . It was always intriguing to see how each character would be connected to the next circumstance . It really is annoying that we finally get a show that makes you think a little bit and have it thrown out because of some mysterious number that most of us do n't even pay attention to . Some of us are not sheep . This show will be missed maybe not by a lot of people but by some pretty loyal fans .
1 Six degrees had me hooked . I looked forward to it coming on and was totally disappointed when Men in Trees replaced it 's time spot . I thought it was just on hiatus and would be back early in 2007 . What happened ? All my friends were really surprised it ended . We could relate to the characters who had real problems . We talked about each episode and had our favorite characters . There was n't anybody on the show I did n't like and felt the acting was superb . I alway like seeing programs being taped in cities where you can identify the local areas . I for one would like to protest the canceling of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another chance . Give it a good time slot , do n't keep moving it from this day to that day and advertise it so people will know it is on .
1 So , what 's the reason ? Is there some sort of vendetta against this AWESOME show or somebody involved therein ? Why would the best show I 've seen in years be canceled ? I 'm addicted . I saw this show on randomly last fall , and immediately loved it , and watched it every week . Then it went away , and I tried to Tivo it , but it was n't being aired . So I forgot about it for awhile , until I found the episodes on ABC 's website . Now I want MORE . I agree with everybody else - with the rest of the junk on TV today , it was refreshing to see something as well - rounded and developed as this . I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric - comedic fix , and House for my intellectual - mystery - jackass fix . My wife loves Grey 's Anatomy for its " realism " , and I do love / hate the show , but it could not be farther from real for me . WAY too much drama . Everything that can go wrong , does . But for once , there 's a drama that 's REALLY real . Real people , real problems . Sure , there are some extremes like a former gangster turned good , girl running from the mob , etc . , but these people ( especially in NYC ) are really out there , and I relate to each and every one of them . I ca n't seem to get enough . I just hope that ABC will get their heads out of their bean - counting butts and continue this show . Get some respect for having a QUALITY drama out there . This could be one of the best shows of all time . If somebody will just let it .
1 This is the best and most original show seen in years . The more I watch it the more I fall in love with it . The cast is excellent , the writing is great . I personally like every character . However , there is a favorite character for everyone as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds just like in real life . I believe ABC has done a disservice to the writers , actors and to the potential audience of this show , to cancel so quickly and not advertise it enough nor give it a real chance to gain a following . There are so few shows I watch anymore as most TV is awful . This show in my opinion was right up there with my favorites Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters . In fact I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters would love this show if they even knew about it . Why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away . I am so sick of reality shows I do not watch any of them . It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then to hire excellent actors , this show had so much promise . The recent episode was the best one yet as everyone has started to really get into their parts and make the show so real . Please watch this show on ABC 's video and let ABC know you wish to have this show back . PLEASE SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC : http://www . PetitionOnline.com / gh1215/petition.html
1 Why did n't the producers give that show a chance Of all the junk on TV , why did n't the producers give Six Degrees a chance ? Will the series go on video ? I would love to see how it ends . Put season one on video and sell it . I was a loyal fan of Six Degrees and waited for it 's return . I set my recorder to tape all of the shows . Thank God for that . I just found out that the show was canceled and I 'm heart broken . I wish I knew it was going to be canceled , why did n't they tell us ? I thought the show was just developing some depth in the characters . The writing was pretty good also . Steven ( Campbell Scott ) is my all time favorite . I am SO sorry to see it go !
1 You probably all already know this by now , but 5 additional episodes never aired can be viewed on ABC.com I 've watched a lot of television over the years and this is possibly my favorite show , ever . It 's a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled . The actors that played Laura , Whit , Carlos , Mae , Damian , Anya and omg , Steven Caseman - are all incredible and so natural in those roles . Even the kids are great . Wonderful show . So sad that it 's gone . Of course I wonder about the reasons it was canceled . There is no way I 'll let myself believe that Ms. Moynahan 's pregnancy had anything to do with it . It was in the perfect time slot in this market . I 've watched all the episodes again on ABC.com - I hope they all come out on DVD some day . Thanks for reading .
1 This show is totally worth watching . It has the best cast of talent I have seen in a very long time . The premise of the show is unique and fresh ( I guess the executives at ABC are not used too that , as it was not another reality show ) . However this show was believable with likable characters and marvelous story lines . I am probably not in the age group they expect to like the show , as I am in my forty 's , but a lot of my friends also loved it ( Late 30 's - mid 40 's ) and are dying for quality shows with talented cast members . I do not think this show was given enough time to gain an audience . I believe that given more time this show would have done very well . Once again ABC is not giving a show with real potential a real chance . With so many shows given chance after chance and not nearly worth it ! They need to give quality shows a real chance and the time to really click and gain an audience . I really loved the characters and looked forward to watching each episode . I have been watching the episodes on ABC videos and the show keeps getting better and better . Although I think they owe us one more episode ( Number 13 ? ) . We want to watch what we can ! Bombard ABC with emails and letters and see if its possible to save this show from extinction . It certainly worked for Jerico . Some things are just worth saving and this show is definitely one of them . SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC AT : http://www . PetitionOnline.com / gh1215/petition.html
1 I am so upset that ABC is giving up on yet another show that has the chance to be a real winner . This show is so good , the writing and storyline were great , an actual original idea for a show instead of another boring reality show . The casting was spectacular ! Not only were the characters and actors right on , but these are a very talented set of actors . The concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a TV show , many of us share this whole idea of " connections " . I really love the characters of Steven , Laura , Whitney and Damien . But to be honest there is not one person connected to this show that I did not like , even those that only were in for a few episodes ( Sheri Appleby for example ) . The acting and characters are so easy to like and so talented!!. I wish ABC had given this show more of a chance , and not interrupted the show midway , Also it was not advertised enough . Truly unfair ! ! to everyone!!. This show showed great promise . I for one will let ABC know how I feel and will keep sending emails to keep this show alive . Please join me , I know we can do it . It worked for Jerico . ( By the way where is episode 13 ? I want that last show ! ) . Please support this show and send emails to ABC , we can do it ! ! ! This show is well worth it ! ! !

1 I got hooked on this as apparently ABC has licensed this show to Pearl TV in Hong Kong . It caught be my surprise , as it was a break from listening to anything Chinese . But i started getting reeled in , as the cast and the story lines are just NYC enough and thoughtful . Nothing too unbelievable , though I think it 's very very stereotypical of them to write Damien as a potential black man with a sheet ! ! ! ! That has been the most disappointing aspect . The rest is great and I 'm sad to learn on IMDb that i ca n't look forward to watching season 2 when i get back to the US . I 'm am just as disappointed as the other commentators that this showed much promise and quality and taste . But just as shows that show characters getting closer , it 's probably harder for people to watch if the start watching several episodes in . Which is apparently a bit too late for the eager networks .
1 Unfortunately for myself - I stumbled onto this show late in it 's lifetime . I only caught a few episodes ( about three ) before it was cancelled by ABC . I loved the characters , and storyline - but most of all the GREAT actors ! I was a fan of Sex and the City , so I saw two characters I recognized ( Bridget Moynahan was & The Character " Todd " was " Smith Jared " ) , as well as Jay Hernandez ( From Carlito 's Way : Rise To Power ) and Erika Christensen ( Swimfan ) . I enjoy watching young actors get their due , and felt like this show would propel their career further along . I hope this at least gets put back out on DVD , and maybe WB will pick it up for a second season sometime ? In the meantime , I 'm viewing it on ABC 's website from the beginning .
1 Six Degrees is a wonderful show ! I watched the entire season online since I just found it and was terribly disappointed that there will not be a season 2 :'( and to top it all off , ABC has now taken it off - line , so it is unable to be viewed online anymore . Why would ABC create such a wonderful show , with a great story line and with great characters just to pull it off the air without ever completing the tale . It seems it is left to our imagination to figure out what happens to all of our connected characters . Honestly though I feel that ABC could at least place the show online for viewers who enjoied it while they continue to air overrated reality TV shows . Six Degrees we will miss you .
1 Here Italy ( I write from Venice ) . Why cancelated ? The ABC should have given it a chance to build an audience . The cast ( w / Hope Davis , Campbell Scott , Erika Christensen , Zoe Saldana , Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan ) is one of the best I 've seen in recent . We need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless drones . I hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up .

1 I watched the un - aired episodes online and I was so sad that the show wo n't be back . It had the best cast of mature , talented actors and an amazing chemistry . It seemed like all the actors are personal friends in real life . Towards the end the show became engaging , sexy and highly watchable . Of course , some of the story lines are not realistic , so what ... The characters are all likable and you root for them . The show reminded me a cross between 2 other favorites : " Sex and the City " and " Felicity " . Big kudos to all the cast . Note to ABC execs : Nielsen ratings reports do not show you true results . The show audience will mostly record it . I 've been very disappointed with major networks for flooding us with reality - TV or teenage oriented shows . Why to get a mature , thoughtful , well - acted material we have to switch to HBO or FX ? I can only thank the network for putting the rest of the episodes online . The new stream media will gain more and more popularity among viewers .
1 Oh man , why ? " Six Degrees " is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone . If focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions.<br /><br />When I first heard of this show , it did n't caught my attention at all . It seemed too ordinary , actually . Then , i saw some episodes ... and loved it ! First of all , the characters . They are all well - written and different from each other . There 's a alcohol addicted , a woman whose fiancée cheats on her , a woman who just lost her husband , a driver who has a troubled brother and so on ... Unlike what we 're used to , most of the characters interact with each other in casualties , like in our daily routines . Great ! My favourite ones are Mae , Carlos and Whitney.<br /><br />Then , the cast . They are all great . Jay Hernandez , from " Hostel " , shows here his acting habilities in a more 3d character than his previous work as Paxton . The other ones give great performances too , specially Campbell Scott , who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan , who plays Whitney.<br /><br />Well when i came to IMDb , after watching some episodes , i could n't believe that it got cancelled . Seriously , i ca n't understand the low ratings.<br /><br />It 's too bad it did n't have more than one season . It would really be a good show to follow !
1 This deserves a 12 out of 10 . An absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories . This show needs to come back , I 've seen every episode and this is real quality.<br /><br />The show centers around a couple of New Yorkers , plays around with the concept of the six degrees of separation and cleverly intertwines their lives . Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are stunning and so is the adorable Caseman . The scenery is amazing and wardrobes are exquisite.<br /><br />We need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless drones.<br /><br />If it never comes back , six degrees will be sorely missed .
1 What is really sad , shows like Six Degree 's and Brothers & Sisters are the true reality TV , not that garbage that are nothing more than glorified game shows . I think the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years with very premature cancellation 's of numerous shows with a cult following . But with the more vocal backlash the fans of Jericho ( which I also enjoy ) and other shows , networks may start to reverse this trend . I am like others , I will not support ANY new shows until they have been given a second season . I 'll then possibly make a decision to watch and catch up via DVD 's and online viewing . Until then ABC , you have lost me as a viewer to ANY new show .
1 I borrowed ( slightly modified ) title from some other comment . I have to say , that as i usually do n't like relationship series , I really did liked this one . Great characters , interesting and not cliché story , good acting , good and again not cliché ( which in case of dialogs is rather rare ) dialogs ... It is really interesting , how the characters cross paths with each other , and sometimes knowingly , sometimes more or less at random influence each others lives . But unfortunately , as we say in our country - do you know how do you recognize a good US series ? It is the one that got canceled before the end of the first season . Sure , it is n't always true , but ...
1 I have complained to ABC about the cancellation of six degrees . If enough people do the same then it could be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life ! ! Just go onto the official site and the rest is simple enough . I do not understand why this show has been cancelled . What a fantastic show , cast and characters . The whole concept is gripping viewing ! I am astounded that my favourite show is over after just one series . Why is this ? Six degrees is phenomenal , it 's better than so many other TV programmes out there ! Until I heard they were stopping it from a friend it had n't even occurred to me that this might happen .
1 While listening to an audio book , Cambpell Scott is the reader . I was so excited to hear his voice and that brought back my disappointment that " Six Degrees " was canceled . They never seem to keep the good shows on air long enough to capture an audience that can connect with the shows story . What a shame , and shame on th network for not giving this show a full seasons chance . This was an excellent show to watch with a great cast . The network gave " Men in Trees " a second chance witch is also a great show , but they took " Invasion " off and that also was something totally different to watch , not the same old - same old themes . Why ca n't the networks get it right .
1 Loved this show ... smart acting , smart dialog , great storyline with real people .... please bring it back or make it available online ... really miss it .. Hope Davis really shines in this show . I like the idea of SIX DEGREES ... It really makes sense in this insane world . Rid yourself of those stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance Please bring it back Not to grovel .. but please ! When it went off the air , I watched in online and liked how I could watch it with minimal interruptions , in fact , online ABC makes it easy to enjoy shows when you miss them on prime time ... gone are the days of endless taping . Anytime you want to bring it back , I am ready .
1 I missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on ABC website during the summer of 2007 . I am absolutely crazy about the show . I think the entire cast is excellent . It 's one of my favorite show ever . I just checked the ABC program lineup for this Fall and did not see it on the schedule . That is really sad . I hope they will bring it back ... maybe they are waiting until Bridget Moynahan has her baby ? Or is it only my wishful thinking ? < br /><br />I read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks , similar to mine . I certainly hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up .
1 Why Panic never got a good theatrical release is easily seen : it 's much too smart , and audiences would have probably had a difficult time with it , comparing it to American Beauty in its probing of a midlife crisis , and Sopranos and Analyze This in it 's study of illegal goings - on amidst family life . Though Panic may seem to derive from unoriginal material , Brommel 's lifelike characters coupled with deft dialogue and observant direction make the film a realistic look at the undoing of a middle aged man.<br /><br />William H. Macy stars as Alex , a hitman who works for his father 's ( Sutherland ) contract - killing business . He leads a double life , with his wife ( Ullman ) and son unaware of his real trade . In his middle - age , he becomes increasingly disgusted with what he has done all his life . Under his calm , collected facade stirs repressed resentment for his father 's controlling grasp on his life . When he meets a young woman(Campbell ) he feels invigored and decides it 's time to quit the family business.<br /><br />The fact that writer / director Henry Brommel decided to make the profession his main character was trying to break away from contract - killing is disposable . He could have easily substituted it with any undesirable profession ; his characters are so well - developed and believable , scenes handled so smoothly and realisticly and dialogue written so insightfully and naturally that the focus falls on Macy 's conflicted character rather than his job as a hitman . Brommel 's script feels like a Shakespearean tragedy , with a definite theme of destiny running throughout.<br /><br />In Alex , Macy creates a tragic , easily sympathetic character , and turns in yet another brooding , great performance , as can always be expected . Donald Sutherland is also effectively abrasive and abusive as his overbearing father , and Ullman 's dramatic turn as Macy 's wife is a welcome change for the comedian . Consider a scene in a bicycle shop , where her mood subtly darkens and peaks in an affecting scene of emotional confusion.<br /><br />Henry Brommel 's first feature , Panic is a film that is well - crafted in its sincerity . With a first - rate cast , a plausible script , terse dialogue , and nice direction , this character - study is hopefully just a taste of Brommel 's aptness for creating characters that seem real . < br /><br />8 out of 10
1 A brilliant movie about family , guilt , sacrifice , betrayal , and love . Macy is such a great actor . It was almost a shame to see him in the same scenes with Campbell , who looks the part of a neurotic sex object but does n't have the chops to work with him on the level the script called for . But he 's such a good actor that he played down to her level to make the scenes work . I highly applaud the casting of Tracey Ullman as the neglected wife . Who knew ? Sutherland is also very good . The way he moves makes his character look taller ( and even younger in some scenes ) . Almost everyone knew what they were doing.<br /><br />Macy 's portrayal of the only situation in which his character is not able to be careful is nothing short of complete mastery .
1 I recently caught up with this little gem of a film on cable . It took me by surprise , even though , I should have expected it from the team involved with this movie . < br /><br />Henry Bromwell directed this film with a sure hand , and it shows . One always wonders about the secret life of hit killers . One does n't have to go too far to realize they probably are one 's own neighbors , or social acquaintances , or even friends ; they 're no different from us , at least on the surface.<br /><br />In this story , the grandfather , is a despicable character who does not hesitate in eliminating anyone for the right price . He has no scruples in teaching the ropes to his own son , and even to the grandson!<br /><br />Alex , is a man living in turmoil . He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly is coming to realize the consequence of his actions . He has to see someone to help him find peace with himself . In going to Dr. Parks , he is trying to find absolution , although , he does n't find it there . On the contrary , there is a dramatic twist when Alex learns about who is supposed to kill next.<br /><br />Alex , brilliantly portrayed by William H. Macy , mesmerizes us . Not only is he a fantastic actor , but he makes us believe he is that man . One of the best things in the movie is the late John Ritter . He is equally convincing as Dr. Parks , the man who unravels the mystery.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland , as the grandfather is perfect . He is a natural actor in everything he does . Neve Campbell surprised in her pivotal role of Sarah . She shows a capability and range that are incredible . Tracey Ullman is Martha , the suffering wife , and she does n't get to do much . Also Barbara Bain , in a rare appearance , is the grandmother from hell . David Dorfman , is a delight in the film . He shows a maturity beyond his years.<br /><br / >
1 This is the kind of movie Hollywood needs to make more of . No extravagant props , no car chases , no clever one - liners . Just people dealing with being people.<br /><br />William Macy plays an unlikely hitman who works for his father , Donald Sutherland . Macy is the dutiful son , Sutherland is the domineering father . Son wants out of the business , father wo n't let him . Macy loves his own son , played beautifully by David Dorfman ( " The Ring " ) . He also starts to fall in love with Neve Campbell , a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatrist 's office.<br /><br />It 's an interesting juxtaposition of characters and the film follows the reluctant killer as he balances his own needs with those of his family . There are many touching scenes , especially between Macy and his little boy . And as you 'd expect in a film with William Macy in it , there 's a bit of humor too.<br /><br />Excellent job all around , actors and director . Nice to know they can still make a good film in Hollywood on a small budget .
1 Panic is a sneaky little gem of a film - you think you have it figured out by the first half hour only to realize , with great pleasure , that Henry Bromell is a much better writer / director than that . < br /><br />The film builds slowly , with one quietly devastating scene after another , all enacted perfectly by William H. Macy , Donald Sutherland , Neve Campbell , Tracey Ullman , John Ritter , and the most remarkable child actor I 've seen in a long time , David Dorfman , as Macy 's son , who delivers his lines as if they 're completely unscripted thoughts being created in his mind . Rich and rewarding , this film will stay with you long after the credits have rolled .
1 I love and admire the Farrelly brothers ! How come I only got to see this great movie 3 years after it 's release ? It made me laugh , it made me cry and it reeeaally warmed my heart . Big Time . It 's hard to describe in my rotten English - but I have to try anyway:<br /><br />The cast is excellent throughout - from the lead- to the supporting roles , the acting is great , the dialogs are great and the film is perfectly directed and edited.<br /><br />I think that the Farrelly brothers movies are often underestimated - they are not light comedies - they 're deeeeeep ! They talk about what life is all about ( I wo n't tell YOU!).<br /><br />In my case , this movie affirmed to me what relationships are all about:<br /><br />If you love somebody : Set them free , let them be - try to share the passion and the pain and always be true to each other.<br /><br />I'm not a sports - hater , but definitely a sports ignorant . But in this movie - the vibes get you . I could smell the atmosphere of Baseball . Finally , this movie explained to me what being a sports - fan can mean to you and what cool fan - families there must be out there.<br /><br />Thanks so much , Pete & Bob!<br /><br />P.S. : If you have n't seen it - please check out KINGPIN !
1 Fever Pitch has many of the clichés we have come to identify with Hollywood romantic comedies : a relationship between two people with little in common , the secret he 's been hiding that she discovers , the inevitable breakup , and the very public  well , I wo n't go any further but you get the picture . In spite of its predictability , it works , especially if you love baseball as I do , though I 'm not quite as obsessive as Ben Wrightman , a Boston schoolteacher played by Saturday Night Live comedian Jimmy Fallon.<br /><br />Adapted from a novel by Nick Hornby by veteran screenplay writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel , Ben is a lifelong Boston Red Sox fan whose Uncle gave him season tickets when he was seven years old and he 's been kind of stuck emotionally at that point all of his life to the detriment of his relationships with women . Ben is not just a fan but a " fanatic " who travels to Fort Meyers , Florida each winter for the Red Sox Spring Training games and never misses a home game during the regular season . His family does not consist of parents or siblings but the fellow groupies who attend each game with him and his bedroom is not a place to sleep but a Red Sox museum to visit.<br /><br />When he falls for business consultant Lindsay Meeks ( Drew Barrymore ) , he is threatened with the possibility of having to grow up but Ben is not quite ready to do that . He would rather attend the Yankee series than go with her to Baltimore to meet her parents or to go to Paris with her and miss the Anaheim series . It takes his relationship being on the verge of dissolving , for him to stop and think about his priorities , especially when a pint - size Dr. Phil wannabe asks him , " You love the Red Sox , but have they ever loved you back ? " While the premise of Fever Pitch is that some things are more important than baseball ( perish the thought ) , you would never know it from the way things turn out . Of course , to any one familiar with the history of the Boston Red Sox , it is a team that will break the hearts of its most die hard fans -- but this is 2004 , the year the curse of the Bambino came to an end and as the Red Sox move to a new level , Ben might just do the same . Both lead performances are excellent and the Farrelly Brothers even manage a pretty gross gag . While Fever Pitch will never be mistaken for an art film , it is a joyous romp that will have to go down as one of my guilty pleasures . Go Blue Jays!.
1 OK , I would not normally watch a Farrelly brothers movie . I ca n't recall ever watching one . I also do n't recall watching a Jimmy Fallon movie . Alright , I did watch taxi , but I said penance and was forgiven for that mistake . But , this movie had Drew Barrymore and I just think she is the cutest thing . I do n't know what it is about her , but I just smile the whole time I am watch her . She just captivates me that way . I mean I even watched Adam Sandler just to see her in 50 First Dates . How sad is that ? This was n't the greatest baseball movie - it was n't supposed to be . It was a love story about a sad puppy that hung on to the only thing that never let him down until he found something worth giving that up for . It had a predictable ending , but there was so much on the way there that made it worthwhile .
1 Somebody mastered the difficult task of merging sports with romance . In reality , sports and romance go together like oil and water . So , to successfully put the two together on screen ... well , that is about the equivalent of splitting the atom . I never thought it could be done . I will be the first to say that in general I do n't like romantic comedies ... but I do like sports and most movies about sports . This movie was a pretty good mix of the two . Being a baseball fan , I could really appreciate the comedic ordeal with Ben Wrightman ( Jimmy Falon ) being a rabid Boston Redsox fan . Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the curse of the Babe that plagued the Redsox for 86 years , and they know just how nuts about baseball a lot of Redsox fans are . The Farrely brothers did a great job capturing that and it made for good comedy . This was a very good movie that could appeal to many .
1 I got this film about a month ago and I am now a fanatic fan of Drew Barrymore 's . I love a happy ending and this film gives a brilliant one with the truths of Red Sox slotted in ! It 's about a maths teacher who takes some promising kids on a maths trip to a company where the successful Lindsey(Drew ) shows them some information . This then leads in the Ben(teacher ) and Lindsey dating . But it is n't all simple when he confesses he is a massive Red Sox fan . < br /><br />First of all things are fine but then his baseball gets in the way of Lindseys life . It 's all fine in the end and It took one shot to get Drew running across the field ! ! I got it for two quid in Blockbusters so I was happy . If you like films like this I suggest you see some more of Drew 's work like Charlie 's Angels and 50 first dates or even her new film with Hugh Grant in called Music and Lyrics .
1 If you want to watch something that is for ' him ' and ' her ' so to say then this is the film to pick . I am a sucker for rom coms but my husband is not always so keen ( what a guy ! ! ! ) . Anyway I managed to get him to watch it because I told him it was about sport , and you know what , he loved it!!!<br /><br />Drew Barrymore is very funny and her leading man ( sorry but ca n't remember his name ) is equally as good . When I watched the film it was called ' The Perfect Match ' but I think the title was changed for the UK as it is based on the book Fever Pitch and there was already a film made about football with that title ( the same film but the UK version - phew!),<br /><br />Anyway all of the reviews on here will tell you more details if you need them buy girls , take it from me , get your hubby / boyfriend in front of the television on a Saturday night and you will both laugh and cry together . A real gem .
1 I saw " Fever Pitch " sort of by accident ; it was playing on the airplane going over to Europe . It actually was n't half bad . Ben ( Jimmy Fallon ) is the world 's # 1 Red Sox fan , but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks ( Drew Barrymore ) may strain that . The movie is a fairly interesting look at how world events can affect peoples ' relationships . It 's especially eye - opening now that the Red Sox have ended their 80-odd - year losing streak . I guess that these sorts of things happen all the time and we just do n't tend to notice them . Not too bad.<br /><br />Another movie portraying an unusual relation to baseball is 2000 's " Frequency " . Check them both out .
1 I liked this movie,,cute and funny . I found this film to be a good family film.the dirtiest part of this movie was when it made references to the New York Yankees . You have to be in Red Sox nation to understand that NY Yankees is a dirty word . Sorry to say that to the Yankee 's fans . I recommend this picture for the entire family . Of course with your typical love / comedy movie,,there 's a long moment in the movie,,with i 'm in love and what do I do,,but the movie makes up for that with all the slapstick moments . The movie show 's some moments of how the Red Sox nation ( in Fenway Park)how the fans felt about 86 years of the Sox always screwed up at the end of the season and how the love of the Sox and the love with another human go hand to hand .
1 As a long time Red Sox fan , I just had to go see the movie . It was great ! While there can never be enough live footage from the miracle 2004 Red Sox season , there were great shots of some of my favorite Red Sox players . While the movie is certainly a chick flick , it has enough baseball footage from the amazing 2004 Red Sox comeback to make it one of my top 10 movies of all time . I especially enjoyed the Red Sox fans that were part of Ben 's baseball family . The scene where Ben is meeting with his buddies on draft day to determine who will get seats to certain games is hilarious ! A must see if you are looking for a wholesome movie to watch with your spouse , date , or significant other ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... and even more especially if you are Red Sox fan ! ! !
1 A very cute movie with a great background provided by the city of Boston and Fenway Park . As a baseball fan and light movie addict , it hit a homerun for me . Plenty of laughs and plenty of authentic baseball scenes with real ballplayers and real references to past Bosox failures . And how enjoyable was it to watch a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure an overage , over - the - hill , self - serving Kevin Costner attempting to make believers out of a critical audience ? Jimmy and Drew did a fine job as a young love - struck couple suffering from Jimmy 's Bosox " jones " . It was a bit whacky and out of left field , but there really are Sox fans that are that fanatic and live their lives through the fortunes of their beloved team . The movie coasted along at a fast pace and the ending , although predictable , had the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular movies , without being overly pretentious . < br /><br />Also enjoyable was the return of Willie Garson to the screen . I miss the forever - popular " Stanford Blatch " from Sex & the City . He 's always funny , even when he does or says very little . < br /><br />So buy yourself two box seats , some popcorn , and get ready for a fun time . " Fever Pitch " is a winner .
1 Bette Midler is again Divine ! Raunchily humorous . In love with Burlesque . Capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power & punch than ever . All in All Singing new ballads , power - singing the good old / perennial ones such as " The Rose " ; " Stay With Me " and yes , even " Wind Beneath My Wings " . The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always been libe - since this is the next best thing to it , I strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide - eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child 's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries !
1 Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert . She gives her all every time she is on stage . Whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads , Bette Midler moves her audience . If you ca n't see it live ( which is the best way to see Bette ) then this is the next best thing . An interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power . Her more " vocally correct " version of " Stay With Me " never loses anything in spirit from THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS , Here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever . I will treasure this concert for a very long time .
1 Bette Midler showcases her talents and beauty in " Diva Las Vegas " . I am thrilled that I taped it and I am able to view whenever I want to . She possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity . Her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you . The highlight of the show was her singing " Stay With Me " from her 1979 movie " The Rose " . You can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having goose bumps . The show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of Bette Midler 's albums .
1 Love it , love it , love it ! This is another absolutely superb performance from the Divine Miss M. From the beginning to the end , this is one big treat ! Do n't rent it- buy it now !
1 A longtime fan of Bette Midler , I must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites . Bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads . A literal rainbow of emotion and talent , Bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire , as well as new songs from the " Bette of Roses " album . Spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone . The one and only Divine Diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around .
1 After losing the Emmy for her performance as Mama Rose in the television version of GYPSY , Bette won an Emmy the following year for BETTE MIDLER : DIVA LAS VEGAS , a live concert special filmed for HBO from Las Vegas . Midler , who has been performing live on stage since the 1970 's , proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business . From her opening number , her classic " Friends " , where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud , Bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap - styled number called " I Look Good " she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections . The section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old Sophie Tucker jokes here to good advantage ( even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it , but her ad - libbing until she remembers it is hysterical ) . Bette also treats us to " Rose 's Turn " from GYPSY and the title tune from her smash film THE ROSE as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie THE FIRST WIVES CLUB . She brings the house down near the end with " Stay with Me , Baby " from THE ROSE and her only # 1 hit record , " Wind Beneath My Wings " from BEACHES . It 's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for Midler fans , it 's a must .
1 A common plotline in films consists of the main characters leaving the hustle and bustle of the city behind , and finding themselves in the tranquility of nature . In Power of Kangwon Province , we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that , trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular Korean parks in the mountains of Kangwon Province . However , rather than epiphanal moments , we have two characters whose trip into nature was just another form of escape.<br /><br />The pace of this movie is slow , contemplative . We learn in the end what really brought each to Kangwon Province and we learn how they 're connected . For those who want Hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer , this movie will not satisfy . But for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking , wondering , affecting them years after , this movie will more than satiate that longing .
1 In the film Kongwon - do ui him it features a relatively intimate look into the meaningfulness ( as well as general meaninglessness ) into the lives of various Koreans ; empty people seeking ways to fill themselves , enjoying the escapism of nature . From the beginning to the end of the film we observe the fallibility of the various characters ; we learn of their shortcomings and their desires , the overall complexity captured within human life ( and yet the overal simplicity of humanity ) . Although the film is slow - moving , it can be very contemplative . It does not force any ideas , but allows the ideas to come about themselves , it allows the concepts to reveal themselves.<br /><br />The film ends as well and as suddenly as it begins , and one truly understands the meaning of aloneness , that love is often an act of selfishness , and the many mistakes that we make . It is a look into everyday life , very well and beautifully done.<br /><br />If you are looking for action or for intense drama , this is not the film for you . However , if you enjoy honest , original , and meaningful films that are not forced and without glitz , this is a great film to watch .
1 This is a great film . If this is any indication , than Hong Sang - Soo really is " Asian cinema 's best kept secret " . It 's very similar in style to Tsai Ming - Liang and Hou Hsiao - hsien , and covers a lot of the same ground as them thematically , but I think I actually enjoy this more as a whole than any single one of their films . The overt minimalism is slightly less pronounced here than in their work , although it still completely fits that style ( the camera never moves even once ) , and somehow I found the film less self - consciously " slow " than Tsai Ming - Liang or Hou Hsiao - hsien , which I think is part of the reason I enjoyed it more . Plus , it does n't keep it 's subjects quite as detached as Hou does . I felt like the film was also somehow more " complete " and less open - ended ( just barely ) than some of their work , although that 's not to say it had much of anything resembling a forward - moving plot . I would have a hard time believing that Sophia Coppola was n't directly influenced by this film for " Lost in Translation " ( scenes of a young woman wandering around by herself , and languishing in her hotel room wearing punk panties ca n't help but seem familiar ) .
1 The Power of Kangwon Province is director Hong Sang - Soo 's second feature effort and clearly much of what he started with in his previous film returns in this film , including the multiple connected narratives ( in this case , two ) , and stories of troubled or troubling relationships , as well as a potent dosage of irony.<br /><br />One thing that 's clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of fancy that included elements of surrealism . However , this film also contains a single moment of surreal that strikes a contrast against the otherwise rather realistic depiction found therein . The two stories follow a young woman who goes on a trip to Kangwon Province with her friends , only to find herself drawn to a stranger , the second about a man who also goes on a trip to Kangwon Province with his friend and struggles with his relationship woes.<br /><br />Again , Hong shows a strong understanding of irony and of the flaws in human nature and yet I do n't think he 's entirely unsympathetic when it comes to his characters , drawing in just enough compassion to offset the criticism he draws with his irony . I think the think I 've come to love about Hong 's films is that they just feel so real , especially the complex and conflicted characters . Not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings , but rather , that these characters he and the actors present , feel fully developed and believable.<br /><br />This is not a fast moving film . There 's a lot of lingering and like the previous film , things do n't always connect immediately so patience does pay off and in surprising ways . There does n't appear to be any element of the film that is n't intentionally placed in the film and it 's made my a little hyper - aware of various seemingly extra characters as they get dragged into the mix as the film progresses.<br /><br />Power is an excellent film that manages to inject a level of personal emotion , regret , longing into a story that highlights irony and the fallibility of human decision - making . It 's a rather hard balance to keep and it 's surprising how Hong manages to pull it off twice in a row . Technical production values have gotten much better since the first film and direction has gotten steady and clear . This film does n't pack the same emotional wallop that the first does , but gains a lot in its assured exploration and the refinement really helps tighten the overall vision . Great viewing for art cinema lovers . 8/10 .
1 Let us begin by saying that this film 's English title " The Power of Kangwon Province " is an absolute misnomer . It is because in Hong Sang Soo 's film , there are no actual shots of wars , troubles and conflicts . So the idea of establishing power of a province is neither suitable nor valid in the context of this film . If we were to judge this film by its Korean language title,"Kangwon - do ui him " is going to appear as a cryptic statement about emotional turmoils of its young protagonists whose minds are not at rest . Hong Sang Soo has also directed a highly prolific visual document about erratic choices made by people in their lives . The people in question are a couple of young girls who are constantly in the process of displaying their moods , whims and fancies . If making a film out of nothingness can be claimed as a film maker 's meritorious virtue then Hong Sang Soo has to be saluted as a courageous film maker whose films speak volumes about ubiquitous nothingness of human relationships , sentiments and lives . Whether one likes it or not , this is the only fair conclusion that be deduced from this particular film .
1 At last - I 've finally got round to it and managed to see a " clean " copy of Pakeezah ! Up until now I 've only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off Dubai TV sometime in the ' 90 's , with quirky English subtitles , dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own . Having thought the world of such a poor ( and short ) copy I find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full 140 minutes even more of a pleasure than I thought possible.<br /><br />This was the lovely Meena Kumari 's film from start to finish , and I believe was planned by her from 1958 on , finally realising it in 1971 . What a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards , and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in Pakeezah , necessitating a body double . In some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face.<br /><br />The story of Purity versus Adversity I can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it , but I 'm led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in India . It 's a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message , an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too . But to me it 's the peerless golden music by Ghulam Mohammed as sung by the incomparable Lata Mangeshkar - especially Thare Rahiyo - and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding . I 've seldom heard such serious , beautiful , poetic , wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack . Singin ' In The Rain may be my favourite musical film but Pakeezah has my favourite music - yet Lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her . The only pity is that the also unique Mohammed Rafi only had the one song in here , albeit a classic duet with Lata . < br /><br />Because of all this but not blind to its faults , Pakeezah is my favourite Indian movie , filmed at a time when the Westernisation of India was gathering pace and watched now when Western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur . At the very least watch Pakeezah for a taste of what Indian " pop " music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines , the Bollywood Beat and bhangra .
1 Without question , this film has to be one of the greatest ........ in cinematic history . I have it watched too many times to remember , and each time it is like I am seeing the film for the first time.<br /><br />Where does one begin?<br /><br />Meena Kumari 's central performance is undoubtedly one of the finest of her career , followed closely by Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam and Phool aur Pathar . Each movement and nuance of her performance , makes any other Bollywood heroine pale into significance . Her masterly interpretation of Kathak coupled with her grace , tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of Urdhu , is like nothing ever seen on the bollywood screen.<br /><br />Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylised interpretation of the human condition ; the photography , sumptuous cinematography and mise en scene , are so charged with symbolism and meaning , that the viewer is left breathless.<br /><br />Naushads music , is unsurpassed , his knowledge of the music of the courtesan gharanas is incredible , and the way in which he punctuates the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkable.<br /><br />My only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys the spectacle of total cinema , should watch this epic mediation on life and art .
1 This movie is one among the very few Indian movies , that would never fade away with the passage of time , nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish , even as the Indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the P.T. styled film songs.<br /><br />The cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of Josef Werching that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entirety.<br /><br />Gone are the days of great cinema , when every scene had to be clipped many times and retakes taken before finalizing it , while meticulous attention was paid in crafting and editing the scenes . Some of its poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity , like the instance , when Meena Kumari refuses to say " YES " as an approval for Nikah ( Marriage Bond ) and climbs down the hill while running berserk in traumatized frenzy . At the moment , Raj Kumar follows her , and a strong gale of wind blew away the veil of Kumari and onto the legs of Kumar ........ <br /><br />Kamal Amrohi shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of Indian Cinema 's history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting 12 years . He had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without Meena 's close ups , because Meena Kumari , the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early 1971 .
1 Pakeezah is in my mind the greatest achievement of Indian cinema . The film is visually overwhelming but also emotionally breathtaking . The music , the songs , the sets , the costumes , the cinematography , in fact every creative element is worthy of superlatives .
1 Perhaps the most polished and accomplished of all Indian films - Pakeezah does not fall into any of the traps commonly associated with Bollywood film ( ie tackiness , farce , wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of western film themes / genres ) . Pakeezah is indigenous to the Sub - Continent and authentic , almost Madam Butterfly - like in plot . Characters are well - developed , direction , although sometimes unrefined by today 's standards , perceptive and convincing . The Urdu - speaking milieux at the time of Pakeezah were masters of understatement and how the dialogue conveys the subtleties of the age ! The acting ( particularly the ' looks ' and the dynamic between characters ) are a delight to behold although the nuances may be lost on contemporary viewers or those not acquainted with the mores and customs of Muslim India.<br /><br />Coupled , with a captivating screenplay is a beautiful musical score , enhanced by the protagonist displaying eminent command of classical Indian dance ( kathak ) . As is the case with most romantic tragedies , the heroine must die , but she does not take her leave of the audience without the viewer feeling he / she has been party to a truly memorable cinema experience . Pakeezah is surely the pinnacle of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled .
1 Besides the fact that it was one of the few movies that I ever shed a tear over ( bye - bye manhood ) , this is one of the most beautifully crafted Indian films that has ever been made . From the finely crafted sets , to those haunting looks Meena Kumari gives , no one can ever forget it . The music of Pakeezah is amazing , all the more if you can understand the sublime poetry , and is definitely one of those " OMG , 5 minutes another song " movies . You get the feeling of how trapped Sahibjaan is in among all the amazing jewelery she wears and fountained court yard she casually walks past.<br /><br />A parody of all the dreams you 've ever had ..........
1 Pakeezah has a very interesting history ( which is well documented in the ' Trivia ' section ) about how it came to be . It seems as if destiny conspired to test Kamal Amrohi ( the director ) while at the same time secretly desiring to see him complete his masterpiece.<br /><br />Pakeezah rides on metaphors , poetry and visual elocution . As a result the intensity with which emotions come out achieve a dimension which may not be very real but are very effective and leave an impact on the viewer.<br /><br />Meena Kumari lives the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib Jaan like her own . The other stars of the film , besides her , are Ghulam Mohammed ( the music director ) , Lata Mangeshkar , Naushad ( background score ) and Joseph Wirsching ( the d.o.p ) . Their music and cinematography leaves you spell bound.<br /><br />Pakeezah is a classic in world cinema . It reveals new layers to you every time you watch it again . Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare poets of cinema and he left us all a gift .
1 A great film requiring an acquired taste . If you 're into action , wham bam films and hate serious love stories then its not for you . Otherwise , if you like to sit in front of a good intelligent movie now and again I recommend this very highly . Easily the best film produced in Bollywood this century.<br /><br />The only other Indian film I would give 10/10 for is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge . Even then it comes second to this masterpiece .
1 This is definitely one of the best movies I 've ever seen-- it has everything-- a genuinely touching screenplay , fine actors that make subtlety a beautiful art to watch , an actually elegant romance ( it 's a shame that that kind of romance just does n't seem to exist anymore ) , lovely songs and lyrics ( especially the final song ) , an artistic score , and costumes and sets that make you want to live in them . The ending was only a disappointment in that I was expecting a spectacular film to have a brilliant end-- but it was still more wonderful then the vast majority of movies out there . Definitely check this movie out-- over and over again . There are many details you miss the first time that deserve a second look .
1 The ultimate homage to a great film actress . The film is a masterpiece of poetry on the screen . Like great poetry it is timeless . Direction , cast , screenplay , music , lyrics , in fact all the norms for movie - making are perfectly chosen to suit the message of the film . The Muslim society in India has never been presented with such respect , nobility and reality . The script is memorable in the hands of Meena , Ashok , Raaj Kumar , Nadira etc to name a few . Personally i was most impressed by the regal looking Kamal Kapoor . The master movie maker Kamal Amrohi 's lasting legacy to the sub - continent . A very beautiful film on a controversial theme that makes humanity look up and face the reality of the outcasts in the world.'In ka naam ? Pakeeza ! haan Pakeza'.Such acting is unheard of in this age of sex , dance and pornography .
1 Mina Kumari exhibits more style and grace just moving from standing , to sitting on the floor than you can find in most other movies . The director has produced more memorable scenes of touching beauty than it would seem possible . The music and dancing is of the highest possible quality . You may notice in the first dance scene the director has all sorts of things occurring in the background : other girl dancing , a drunk falling down stairs , much activity , but he knew that we would be watching Mina dance and I 'll bet unless you viewed this many times , you did n't notice . All in all , perfection . J.Q.
1 Such a film of beauty that it 's hard to describe . Maybe it 's the absence of superfluous dialogue , or maybe it 's the absolutely stellar soundtrack , or maybe it 's just Meena Mumari 's feet , but it 's a joy to watch this movie again and again . I 've never seen another Indian movie that comes close to it , and few from any country rival its perfection .
1 This film opened to poor showings in the first few weeks . Then Meena Kumari died and it just brought the crowds rolling in . Songs on All India Radio , especially Inhi LogoN ne were played so often that I was sick of them at the time , despite recognising their beauty ! < br /><br />Yes , it did take all those years to make . This was because the marriage was a very unhappy one and Kamal Amrohi also had difficulty finding the money to make the film ; looking at the sumptous sets and costumes , not surprising ! ! Not only does Meena Kumari age and fall ill but listen carefully to Lata 's voice . Inhi logoN ne has her 50 's younger voice while songs that were re - recorded like Chalo dildar chalo show clear development . I only wish someone would find the Ghulam Mohammad songs that were n't included in the film , because of changing fashions that called for fewer though slightly songs and publish them . Lata in a recent interview ( 2007 ) rated Ghulam Mohammad as one of the best composers she had ever worked with , apart from Madan Mohan ( a great personal friend ) . Notice also that you hardly see the actors at all in the Chalo dildar songs , very unusual . There is only a brief shot of Raj Kumar from the middle distance and you only see the back of the supposed Meena Kumari . Kamal Amrohi made a virtue out of necessity and focused on the stars and moon . Any other film , this song would have had close - ups of both of them.<br /><br />As for this being the finest film ever , I would beg to differ . It means you have missed a lot of Indian cinema , in no particular order , films like Barsaat ( old ) , Devdas ( older versions ) , Bandini , Do Bigha Zameen , Garam Hava , Dastak , Guddi , Aan , Pyasa , Kagaz ke Phool , Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam , Kabuliwallah , Abhimaan , Guide , Sujatha , Bombay ka Babu , Daag , Parineeta ( old ) , Umrao Jaan , etc . etc . And if you valued music more than story the list would simply grow with beautiful scores from Barsat Ki Raat to Naya Daur , Teesri Manzil , Mahal , Aag , Jugnu , Anand , Mera Naam Joker : the list is really endless!<br /><br />So enjoy Pakeezah but do n't miss out on any of the above ...
1 If ever I was asked to remember a song from a film of yester years , then it would have to be " Chalo Di Daar Chalo Chand Ke Paar Chalo " for its meaning , the way it is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd . Rafi , the lyrics by Kaif Bhopali and not to mention the cinema photography when the sailing boat goes out against the black background and the shining stars . The other would have to be " Chalte Chalte . " Pakeezah was Meena Kumari 's last film before she died and the amount of it time it took can be seen on the screen . In each of the the songs that are picturised , she looks young but after that she does not . But one actor who did n't change in his looks was the late Raj Kumar , who falls in love with her and especially her feet , after he accidentally goes into her train cabin and upon seeing them , he leaves a note describing how beautiful they are.<br /><br />Conclusion : Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that , if at all possible should be viewed on large screen just for the sake of the cinema photography and songs . The movie stars the Meena kumari , Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and is directed by Kamal Amrohi.<br /><br />Kamal Amrohi 's grandson has now started to revive his grand father 's studio by making a comedy movie .
1 Paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film I 've ever seen . Often classed as a " horror movie " this , I believe , is a grave error . Some journo once called it " the thinking person 's Nightmare on Elm Street " and while I accept the logic of his conclusion I ca n't help but think it 's a tag that is ill deserved and misleading . Those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate they 're really not thinking at all.<br /><br / > In fact , just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea . Quite simply , Paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart . As someone wiser than me once said , " the film hits you on a completely emotional level " , which may go some way to explaining why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing . To be honest , I make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your taste , stop reading now because there 's more to come.<br /><br / > It 's so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives . Even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work . In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of Paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood ( often overlooked ) in a seamless and convincing way.<br /><br / > And yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away.<br /><br / > Add to all this an incredibly talented director ( Bernard Rose ) , imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you 're ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why I have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express.<br /><br / >
1 A great film this , and a shame that it will receive little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay up until two in the morning to watch it on Channel Four.<br /><br />The plot is a simple one but works very effectively , the blurring between child - like fantasy and hard - hitting nightmare is very well blurred . The budget looks pretty low , but to the credit of those involved it does n't show too often . It also has n't dated that much either.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to tape this off the telly when it was on a few years ago , and it has withstood half - a - dozen viewings . It 's one of those films that wo n't appeal to all ; though as usual , those with a more thoughtful approach to cinema would get a lot out of this.<br /><br />Charlotte Buerke puts in a good performance as Anna , the spoilt brat and it is a shame she seems to have gone from the acting scene . Cross is also very good , carrying the stature of his character very well within the context of the picture.<br /><br />There are some genuinely ( and I do n't say that lightly ) disturbing moments in this film , both half - second shockers and more drawn - out tensions . Watch it with the lights out!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br / >
1 Anna ( Charlotte Burke ) , who is just on the verge of puberty , begins to have strange dreams which start affecting her in real life -- especially involving a boy named Mark ( Elliott Spiers ) who she meets in her dreams.<br /><br />Very unusual fantasy with some truly terrifying moments . Despite the fact that this is about a teenage girl and has a PG-13 rating , this is NOT for children . Also , if you hate fantasies stay far away . But if you 're game for something different this fits the bill.<br /><br />Well directed by Bernard Rose with a just beautiful music score and a few nice , scary jolts . The only thing that prevents this from being a really great movie is Burke -- she 's not a very good actress ( it 's no surprise that this has been her only film ) and it hurts the movie . However , everybody else is just great.<br /><br />Spiers is very good as Mark ; Glenne Headley ( faking a British accent very well ) is also very good as Anna 's mother and Ben Cross is both frightening and sympathetic as Anna 's father.<br /><br />A sleeper hit when released in 1988 , it 's since faded away . That 's too bad -- it 's really very good .
1 I do miss the company Vestron , they sure had their finger on the pulse of unique and unusual cinema back in the 1980s . This is very apparent with the astonishing Paperhouse , a film that touches me deeply each and every time I watch it.<br /><br />The idea of a girl manipulating a dream world with her drawings ( thusly the dream world manipulating reality ) , and also connecting with and affecting the life of a boy she 's never actually met , is fascinating and never disappoints . Charlotte Burke at first seems quite precocious and yet you warm up to her because by being a bit of a mischievous child , it makes it hard for the adults to believe what she is experiencing . She becomes very self aware and strong towards the end , even finding she does n't " hate boys " as she so defiantly claimed at first . Through this we are treated to many touching moments and some immensely scary ones , all visually stunning with a grand score from Hans Zimmer . I 'm quite proud to be an owner of the soundtrack on CD when it was released in the United States on RCA Victor . At the time of this writing there is no DVD of Paperhouse yet available in the U.S. ( only in Europe ) , here 's hoping one of my wishes will come true as I truly cherish this beautiful film and a DVD of it would be very welcome!<br /><br />It 's satisfying watching the girl work out her thoughts like a puzzle game trying to make the dream world work for her and her newfound friend Marc ( Elliot Spiers ) . Both Charlotte Burke and Elliot Spiers do a magnificent job throughout , I find the editorial comment on Amazon.com about it being " hammy acting " quite perplexing -- I found every aspect of Paperhouse to be exhilarating . Even in minor scenes of brilliance like when Charlotte and the girl in the classroom are staring at each other through the glass on a door , it 's quite powerful.<br /><br />You do n't have to be an arthouse type to enjoy Paperhouse , just be a person that enjoys a film that stimulates and has you wanting more . There is enough in this film to invite repeated viewings and I 'm still in awe of the cinematography and sets . For me , it 's never like watching the same film twice , as there are so many details to absorb and savor . A very emotional experience indeed.<br /><br />While there are many films I adore , there are only a few specific ones that strike a great emotional chord in me : films like Paperhouse , Static , Resurrection , and Donnie Darko . When I see so much drek out there passing as films that will easily be forgotten and in bargain bins , all I have to do is watch Paperhouse and my faith in wondrous storytelling is renewed .
1 This is a way cool fantasy movie . One of my faves , it really is so cool . The director is Bernard Rose who went on to direct Candyman , he made a great start with this film.<br /><br />The film about a girl called Anna who falls ill with glandular fever on her 11th birthday . She draws a house on a shred of paper from her exercise book and falls into a dream in which the house is real . Each subsequent dream that she has is altered by the presence of whatever she adds to the picture . In her third dream she meets a boy she thinks she has created called Mark . She befriends him and their relationship becomes stronger as the dreams become darker and scarier.<br /><br />Charlotte Burke who plays Anna is a terrific actress and it is very strange that , after just one film , she should disappear and never be in anything ever again . She really does give a great performance in this film.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer 's score is also ace . Much like Broken Arrow , the music is ghostly and mysterious . It 's a real shame that the soundtrack is not available on CD anymore . The DVD is available in R2 only .
1 My friend and I picked " Paperhouse " out of a random pile of movies on our weekly excursion to the Horror section-- neither of us had heard of it , but the blurb on the box was really promising . And the movie did n't disappoint , though I still probably would n't call it a horror movie exclusively.<br /><br />11-year old Anna Madden draws a house , and visits it in her dreams . She is definitely asleep when she 's seeing the house , but it 's so real in a sense that it 's almost like a completely separate reality . Which , in view of later events , does n't seem like a far cry from the truth . Anyhow , she finds she can add to the house , its contents and its surroundings by simply adding to the picture . < br /><br />While this is going on , Anna is getting increasingly more ill with a fever , and besides that is getting totally obsessed with the house and her drawing . On top of that , she and her mother are also dealing with her absent father ; he has a job that takes him away for long stretches , though one gets the impression there 's actually more to the story than that.<br /><br />OK , so the drawing stuff sounds nice enough-- but frankly there 's something really menacing about it . The dreamworld is eerily surreal -- the house , for instance , is just a grey block in the middle of a desolate field . The folks who made the movie did a great job of making us very uncomfortable with this alternate world / ongoing dream ... <br /><br />One of the things Anna adds to the house is a boy , Mark , who seems to be the same patient her doctor keeps talking about ( I 'm not giving that away , you know from the moment he appears that it 's the same kid ) . In reality , Mark ca n't walk due to an illness ; in Anna 's drawing - world , he ca n't walk because she did n't draw him any legs . She blames herself for his real - life illness , and tries to rectify the situation , but ... everything starts getting really weird . She even brings her absent father into the drawing , with disastrous results . The bits with the father are really terrifying.<br /><br />I do n't want to give anything away , so I 'll stop there ... There seems to be a lot going on in this film . I 'm sure you 'll have a ball analyzing this thing do death with your pals after you watch it-- Is it a simple a story as it seems , or are there actually layers of meaning ? I do n't know , but either way it 's quite fascinating . There was a " Nightmare On Elm Street "- ish quality about it , in that at a certain point reality and dreams intersect . I love things like that.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it feels like it COULD have ended many times , but did n't . I 'm satisfied with the ending it had ( some of you sensitive types might want to have Kleenex handy ! ) , though it really could have a variety of conclusions . Anyway , it does n't exactly feel drawn out once it 's actually over , but while you 're watching and it keeps fading back in , it 's a little nerve wracking.<br /><br />Still , " Paperhouse " is a really GOOD film . It 's well done , and acting-- especially Charlotte Burke as Anna-- is top notch . Burke , who has never before or since appeared in a film , is a real gem . I do n't know why she never went onto do anything else , but either way she 's really convincing and enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />"Paperhouse " is n't exactly a horror movie , it 's sort of a fantasy / suspense / something else type of movie , with some definite horroresque moments-- but you can still watch it with your family and not be worried that your little brother or grandmother will get grossed out by blood splashing or something.<br /><br />Give it a chance , you wo n't regret it ! And maybe you should read the book , too ...
1 Put quite simply , this film is terrifying.<br /><br />It starts off simply , looking like a study of a rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror film.<br /><br />Don't expect gore , or zombies . This is psychological , and just as he would also do in Candyman , Bernard Rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believed.<br /><br />Each time you watch this film , you realise more about what 's happening , and about how the two worlds in this film interconnect.<br /><br />Drawings have never been scarier .
1 Anna ( Charlotte Burke ) develops a strange fever that causes her to pass out and drift off into a world of her own creation . A bleak world she drew with a sad little boy as the inhabitant of an old dumpy house in the middle of a lonely field . Lacking in detail , much like any child drawing the house and it 's inhabitant Marc ( who ca n't walk because Anna did n't draw him any legs ) are inhabitants of this purgatory / limbo world . Anna begins visiting the boy and the house more frequently trying to figure what 's what and in the process tries to help save the boy , but her fever is making it harder for her to wake up each time and may not only kill her , but trap her and Marc there forever.<br /><br />Wow ! Is a good word to sum up Bernard Rose 's brilliantly haunting and poetic Paperhouse . A film that is so simple that it 's damn near impossible to explain and impossible to forget . While you may find this puppy in your horror section it 's anything but . It 's more of a serious fantasy , expertly directed , and exceptionally well acted by it 's cast , in particular Charlotte Burke and Elliot Speirs ( Marc ) . And yet , it 's not a children 's movie either , but meant to make us remember those carefree days of old that are now just dark memories . Rose creates a rich tapestry of moody ambiance that creates a thrilling backdrop for the brilliant story and great actors to play with . Paperhouse stays away from trying to explain it 's more dreamy qualities and leaves most things to the viewers imagination . There 's much symbolism and ambiguity here to sink your teeth into . Paperhouse enjoys playing games with the viewers mind , engrossing you with it 's very own sense of reasoning . As the story unfolded I was again and again impressed at just how powerful the film managed to be up to the finale which left me with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye.<br /><br />Bernard Rose 's visuals are brilliant here . He 's able to create an unnervingly bleak atmosphere that appears simple on the surface , but as a whole is much greater than the sum of it 's parts . The acting is of young Charlotte Burke in this , her feature debut , is a truly impressing as well . Unfortunately she 's not graced the screen since . A much deserved Burnout Central award only seems proper for that performance . Toward the end the movie lags a bit here and there , but I was easily able to overlook it . I wished they had took a darker turn creating a far more powerful finale that would have proved to be all the more unnerving and truly riveting in retrospect . The movie as is , is still one for the books and deserves to be seen by any serious film lover . It 's a poetic ride told through the innocent eyes of a child , a powerful film in which much is left to be pondered and far more to be praised .
1 My name is John Mourby and this is my story about Paperhouse : In May 2003 I saw Alfred Hitchcock 's psycho , I was very scared and deeply disturbed . I began a frantic search for a film that was frightening in the same way . But none where satisfactory . Amongst those tried and failed were The Birds , Night of the Living Dead , The Silence of the Lambs , The Blair Witch Project , Ring , The Evil Dead , The Sixth Sense , 28 Days Later , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Halloween , Near Dark , Alien , Peeping Tom , The Cell , Rosemary 's Baby , Do n't Look Now , Witchfinder General , Friday the 13th and The Omen . That should confirm I was desperate ! Long after I had stopped searching I found out about Paperhouse  .<br /><br />Paperhouse is based on a favourite book that I own , called Marianne Dreams . Paperhouse had also come up in some of the books I had found on horror films , but they did n't tell me about the link between book and film . I discovered the truth while on the Internet , I bought the film later that day.<br /><br />I thought Paperhouse would not be faithful to the book and dull . Unfaithal it certainly was but dull certainly not . It was the answer to my prayers Marianne is renamed Anna in the film but most of the original story is the same . One day in school Anna draws a house in her scrap book ( nothing remarkable about that ) then she becomes ill and every time she faints or falls asleep she finds herself outside a creepy old house ( and I mean genuinely unnerving ) . More she also finds that every time she puts something new in the drawing it appears in the dreamworld , EG an apple tree . Anna draws into the dreamworld a rather sad boy named mark who apparently is a person in the real world . Mark is a cripple but wants to leave the house , obligingly Anna draws in a lighthouse ( a place to go to ) but still the problem remains mark ca n't walk . So Anna decides to draw her father in . she gets her pencil out and gets too work , but the outcome is deformed and unsettling Anna particularly dislikes his eyes . Quote " he looks like madman " . So Anna tries to rub him out and start again , but the pencil proves indelible ( that means nothing can be rubbed out ) . Then Anna loses her temper and crosses out her father 's eyes ! I leave you too find out for you self the terrible consequences of the rash action.<br /><br />Paperhouse truly is the British answer to A Nightmare on elm Street ! The viewing of this film left me shocked and upset . But I have found what I was looking for after 2 years . The question is how dose the compare with Psycho ? Answer , 1 the old dark house , 2 psychological parental fears , 3 a genuine shock , 4 and very scary music .
1 As a lover of the surreal ( in art and film ) I was pleased to discover this film on IFC . It is definitely a keeper . Most of the other reviews tell the general plot ( not all correct ) so I wo n't bother to bore anyone with that . The main thing is the alternate worlds concept which is brought on by Ana 's impending illness , and the way she manages to link with someone else after being so " alone " , and finally with her family , which I believe is still at least a little troubled . It only can be called a horror movie in that it has frightening scenes but is a fantasy ( with a little hint of " coming of age " only because Ana is a pre - teen who " hates boys " ) . I heartily recommend it to those who appreciate the stretch of their imagination .
1 Not knowing what this film was about , I checked it out at the video store and after seeing it , I enjoyed it . Little seen multi - genre flick from director Bernard Rose ( Candyman , Immortal Beloved ) . Great story and characters . As a fan of Glenne Healdy 's , I was surprised of her british accent . The only exception for this film was the ending . However , it is worth the rent .
1 Who would have thought that such an obscure little film could be so haunting and touching ? I am really impressed . It 's a shame that more people have not seen it . I loved , as always , Hans Zimmer 's score . And what a directorial debut by Bernard Rose ! Yet I wonder if I should call this a horror film . It could easily be argued that it is a fantasy or a drama as well . Well , regardless , I love the interpretive potential it has . Everything and everyone in Anna 's ( played by Charlotte Burke)dreams represents a real conflict in her life ... the house itself , the tree , Mark , the lighthouse , etc . It is the many details such as these that make the film so good for repeated viewings . I hope I come across another little movie as loaded with emotion and psychological meaning as this one some time soon .
1 I 've only ever seen this film once before , about ten years ago . I bought the DVD two days ago and after watching it I think it is even better than I remembered it to be.<br /><br />Paperhouse is much more than just a horror . It had such an amazing level of emotion and great characterisation running through it . I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really excellent here . It 's such a pity that she has n't done anything else as she was an excellent actress altogether . Her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across , especially at the end when she realised that although Marc had died , she knew he was going to be alright.<br /><br />Several scenes did make me jump ( which is a rarity for me in modern horror films ) , most notably the scene in the bathtub , the scene where Anna 's father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and crumbled to dust.<br /><br />All in all , an excellent and very moving film .
1 I 'm glad that this is available on DVD now . This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content & style over empty - headed flashing lights & constant loud noises.<br /><br />Essentially , if you have a short attention span or lack the wit & imagination to engage with literary narrative you wo n't like this film . The reasons for this are quite simple , but unfortunately rarely achieved : Matthew Jacobs has done a fantastic job of transposing the story of Catherine Storr 's novel ' Marianne Dreams ' successfully to a screenplay . An unenviable task as anyone who has seen a film of a book will undoubtedly know.<br /><br />The casting is excellent , allowing director Bernard Rose to use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now ; they indulge in the craft of acting ! I know , I know , actors doing their job & acting instead of resorting to mugging inanely at the camera lens whist a kaleidoscope of car chases , explosions & fire fights break out around them is a genuinely rare treat , but it does actually happen in this film.<br /><br />This brings me to the final reason that this is a film for the imaginative thinker & not the spoon - fed tabloid reader - Apart from a solid script , direction & acting , it relies on atmosphere , suspense & implied horror . If it is to be categorized as horror then the presentation of ' Paper House ' is more in the vein of Sophocles than Tobe Hooper.<br /><br />In conclusion then , if you like lots of loud noises , explosions , constant cuts , & bright flashing colours you 'd be better off watching ' Transformers ' , but if you like a suspenseful story which unfolds through a skillful & evocative use of narrative without insulting your intelligence by force feeding you cacophonous nonsense then this might just be your thing .
1 This is a wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama . It is not really a horror flick so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed . What really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to be internally consistent . I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble or New Age revisionism . Rather than advancing an agenda , the filmmakers just told the story , told it well and let the viewer think about it . The sparse dreamscapes were reminiscent of Wyeth paintings and amazingly effective . < br /><br />A great example of how to make a good film on a small budget , without big studios , star actors , big - name directors ( this was far better than many of Hitchcock 's films ) , special effects or " clever " plot twists .
1 This film is fantastic as it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a child would , for adults . The idea of a child 's drawings becoming a place she can physically visit and have influence over is wonderful . At the same time you could get all child psychologist about it and say she 's really exploring her subconscious , just as we all do in our dreams when we sleep . The bit that gives me goose - pimples is when her Dad is in the paper house , and chases her . The only thing I ca n't stand is that it was marketed as a horror film ... it really is n't . If you want to see something British with plenty of storyline which keeps you guessing without the usual cheap thrills most films have to use , then watch Paperhouse .
1 49 . PAPERHOUSE ( thriller / horror , 1988 ) Sick in bed with a fever 11-year old Anna ( Charlotte Burke ) has only her drawings to keep her company . Her health progressively worsens as a series of mysterious ' black outs ' grip her . In each of these episodes she dreams of a house in a desolate field , with only a sickly - invalid boy named Marc ( Elliot Spiers ) inhabiting it . When a dark , unknown danger threatens her idyllic " paperhouse " , the life of Marc is put in jeopardy . Her life is also in danger as these dreams mirror her own state of health.<br /><br />Critique : Haunting first debut feature from British director Bernard Rose . Taken from a fable ( " Marianne Dreams " ) by Catherine Storr , it leaves plenty of other ' original ' fantasy works in its wake . Whenever a story deals with dreams and nightmares it is hard to give it the mixture of fable and reality to make it work in film form . Director Rose successfully captures the children fantasy world aspect along with a darkness that seeks to usurp them.<br /><br />Feverishly scored by Phillip Glass , Rose knows how to use music wisely with expertly timed ' jump out of your seat ' moments . Most thrillers are very sloppy in this all - important aspect of scaring the audience into not knowing what the next scene will bring . I also like the way he captures suspense and never lets it go or falter sluggishly into the next sequence of events . Also , his mastery of placing objects within the frame ( as in his P.O.V.shots ) gives the cinematography an added dimension it would otherwise seem to lack . Only in Europe will you find such ominous looking places as the ones presented here : the lonely house , the fields , coastal towns , watchtower etc . < br /><br />Rose would follow this film with " Candyman " ( 1992 ) , a true ' thinking person 's ' horror gem and bona fide cult horror favorite .
1 I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old . Unfortunately I could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night . Now I bought it on DVD because I can remember that I liked it.<br /><br />This is really not an ordinary horror movie . It has some horror elements but I rather categorize it as fantasy . I liked it but I hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes . Especially the scene when Anna 's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short.<br /><br />Now to the plot . This movie is about a young girl named Anna who gets ill . While she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house - the paperhouse . When she fells a sleep , which often strangely happens just immediately , she finds herself near the house on a big green field . She realizes that the house is exactly like the one she has drawn and that every new detail also appears in her dreams . One day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to . As she forgets to draw his legs ( because he is sitting behind a window ) the boy can not walk . Later she is being told by the doctor , that a boy also has this strange disease and she realizes that with the boy she has drawn , she also got that boy into her disturbing dreams . She also notices that it gets harder and harder for her to wake up from her dreams . As she misses her father who is ofter abroad she draws her father into the house . She makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting . She tries to rubber him out but realizes that she can not change anything already drawn . And next time she falls asleep the horror begins . Her father is mad and blind ( because she draw s * * * on his head to mark him as ' invalid ' ) and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill Anna and his friend . Her dreams became a horrendous nightmare . They manage to escape and to kill her father and Anna can finally wake up . Than Anna finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed . The doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so . They tell Anna that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those tragical happenings . Anna draws a watchtower and notices that the same watchtower can be found near the hotel they traveled to . She runs to the watchtower and meets the boy ( I am just not mentioning his name because I can not remember it and do not want to go back to the previous html page ) and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dreams forever.<br /><br />There were a few thing I did not understand in the movie . First of all it was the ending which I absolutely dislike . I think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short . How does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to Anna as he is supposed to be dead ? Why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall ? I hated that scene it was so dumb to me . It almost ruined the main horror scene.<br /><br />Things I liked were the scene with the photograph of Anna 's dad which was the first real scary and horror scene . I liked the boy . The actor was awesome . He was even better than Anna . I also liked how Anna tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage.<br /><br />Overall a good movie . I give it a 8 out of 10 .
1 This is one of three 80 's movies that I can think of that were sadly overlooked at the time and unfortunately , still overlooked . One of the others was Clownhouse directed by Victor Salva , a movie horribly overlook due to Salva 's legal / sexual problems . Another would be Cameron 's Closet which strikes me as somewhat underrated -- not great , but not nearly as bad as the reviews I 've seen . Paper House is well worth your time and I think that it is one of those very quiet films that will just stick in your brain for far longer than you might think . I mean , 10 years after I 've seen it and I still give it some pause , whereas something that I might have seen 6 months ago has gone into the ether .
1 I 'm giving it only 9 out of 10 , because I need to view it again , in a more current mind - frame to have a fresh perspective . What I remember is an amazing psychological thriller that dazzled my brain and my eyes when I watched it . I would watch it every time it came on HBO back in the day ( probably 1990 or so ) . I might have even recorded it , but that recording is long gone , I 'm sure.<br /><br />I wrote to GreenCine to try and get this title in , they currently do n't carry it . I hope I can find it at a local video store.<br /><br />I would highly recommend giving it a try if you find it somewhere . It 's interesting at the very least . If you enjoyed movies such as Edward Scissorhands , Beetlejuice , Gummo , or anything sort of strange and along those lines , try this one out .
1 Coming from the same director who 'd done " Candyman " and " Immortal Beloved " , I 'm not surprised it 's a good film . Ironically , " Papierhaus " is a movie I 'd never heard of until now , yet it must be one of the best movies of the late 80s - partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades . ( Not talking about Iranian or Swedish " cinema " here ... ) The acting is not brilliant , but merely solid - unlike what some people here claim ( they must have dreamt this " wondrous acting " , much like Anna ) . The story is an interesting fantasy that does n't end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly . These unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose , leaving it up to the individual 's interpretation , and there 's nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this . " Pepperhaus " is a somewhat unusual mix of kids ' film and horror , with effective use of sounds and music . I like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie - cliché ultra - shy - but - secretly - brilliant social - outcast girl , but a regular , normal kid ; very refreshing . I am sick and tired of writers projecting their own misfit - like childhoods into their books and onto the screens , as if anyone cares anymore to watch or read about yet another miserly , lonely childhood , as if that 's all there is or as if that kind of character background holds a monopoly on good potential . The scene with Anna and the boy " snogging " ( for quite a stretch ) was a bit much - evoking feelings of both vague disgust and amusement - considering that she was supposed to be only 11 , but predictably it turned out that Burke was 13 or 14 when this was filmed . I have no idea why they did n't upgrade the character 's age or get a younger actress . It was quite obvious that Burke is n't that young . Why directors always cast kids older than what they play , hence dilute the realism , I 'll never know .
1 I was always a big fan of this movie , first of all have you seen the cast , the acting is superb and help make this movie move along very well . Cybill Shepherd was given great reviews for her role , and they were well deserved . The beginning of this movie starts in the past when Corinne Jeffries ( Cybill ) whose picture - perfect marriage comes to a shattering halt when her husband Louie dies unexpectedly . Fortunately , Louse gets a second shot at life when he agrees to be " recycled " back to earth as the newborn Alex Finch ( Robert Downey , JR ) . Alex goes on to live his new life forgetting his past life while Corinne tries to get on with hers . But fate crosses Alexs path 23 years later when he meets Corinne 's daughter Miranda ( Mary Stuart Masterson ) and is suddenly flooded with a wealth of unwanted memories ( this is where the fun begins , and embarrassing situations occur . ) The music is great and the scenes are heart felt and very cute . You wo nt be disappointed if you give it a chance , Chances Are you 'll like it . Very funny and sweet !
1 Writers Perry and Randy Howze crafted a very engaging little story in " Chances Are . " < br /><br />Using the idea of a reincarnated man who happens to return to his former wife 's home many years later , the plot takes unexpected , delightful turns.<br /><br />Twenty four year old Robert Downey , Jr. renders a delightful performance , ably assisted by Cybil Shepherd as the widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend . < br /><br />This trio has just the right chemistry for this caper , playing off one another with a graceful style . I 've watched this film a number of times on tv , and each time found it most enjoyable .
1 CHANCES ARE is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman ( Cybill Shepherd ) whose husband ( Christopher McDonald ) is killed shortly after learning she is pregnant . We then see the husband in heaven letting the powers that be know that he was taken too soon and that his wife needs him . He is told he can return to earth but not as himself . Flashforward 19 years where we see Shepherd 's daughter ( Mary Stuart Masterson ) preparing to graduate from college and encountering a young man ( Robert Downey Jr.)who , it turns out is the reincarnation of her father . The film is a little on the predictable side ... the story goes all the places you expect it to , but it is so charmingly played by an energetic cast ( especially Shepherd and Downey ) that you ca n't help but get wrapped up in the fun . Shepherd has rarely been seen on screen to better advantage and she and Downey are backed by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles . A lovely and charming fantasy that will engulf and enchant you .
1 A charming romantic comedy . The plot is a little too complicated -- I tried to summarize it three times and I ca n't . Suffice to say it 's worth seeing . The movie is funny , beautiful -- the plot is totally unrealistic but it works . Everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great -- it creates a sweet , romantic feel through the entire film . < br /><br />The acting is great -- Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it . Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are just OK but fine . If you 're a sucker for good , sweet sentimental films ( like me ) , catch this one . Also Downey looks great in his underwear!<br /><br />Extra bonuses -- the title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song " After All " sung by Cher and Peter Cetera .
1 Yes , I 'm sentimental & schmaltzy ! ! But this movie ( and it 's theme song ) remain one of my all time greats ! ! Robert Downey Jr. does such justice to the role of " Louis Jeffries " reincarnated and the storyline ( although far - fetched ) is romantic & makes one believe in happy endings ! !
1 Another Downey must - see ! If you are an obsessed fan like me , you have got to see this movie ! He plays Alex Finch , a 22 year old Yale grad who realizes that the life he just came into is the life he left 26 years earlier . Alex is the re - incarnation of Louie Jeffries , a no - nonsense lawyer happily married to Corrine ( Cybil Sheppard ) . Louie is killed on their one - year anniversary when he is hit by a car . He demands to go back , only this time in the body of Alex Finch . Enter Robert Downey Jr. , a lot of confusion , and a lot of laughs.<br /><br />Although this movie is 15-years old , it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as re - incarnation . And if so , how often to you meet the same souls life after life . I do n't know the answer . But I do know that you need to see this movie . It is a riot , and Downey looks SO GOOD in a tuxedo . This film makes you believe in love , and true love never dies . It just gets recycled .
1 I 've always been a big Cybill Shepperd fan , ever since I saw her series a few years ago ! ! This film certainly shows her in her best light yet ! ! The film was so wonderfully cast and played ! ! Every now and again she drops little amusing lines , just to make this film one of the best I 've ever seen ! ! Everybody really out does themselves ! ! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd , they really made the film come true ! ! Also I loved the little bit where Mavis loses her wig and she nearly dies when she falls to the floor ! ! This is film at its best ! !
1 What a loss the passing of director Emile Ardolino was ! He could take a light script and , with the right casting and editing , put a twinkle in it and make it shine like a star . This particular star may not be the brightest in the sky as great romances go , but it is definitely one that keeps you tuned in to the end . You really want to know how things are going to work out.<br /><br />The script is perfect for Cybill Shepherd , who at the time needed to capitalize on her " Moonlighting " success for the new generation who was ( fortunately for her ) probably unaware of how many big screen major duds she had after a very promising start . In this film she 's every bit back in form as a still - pining widow living vicariously through her daughter ( Mary Stuart Masterson on the cusp of stardom which would peak with " Fried Green Tomatoes " two years later ) . She may have looked too young for the role , but that works well for the way the story unfolds . This is her film , but she does n't overstep her bounds as a lead.<br /><br />SHepherd graciously allows Robert Downey Jr. to carry much of the film and shows a more mature comic flair than he had in his previous films to that point . And there 's ample support from Ryan O'Neal ( in his best role in years ) and Christopher MacDonald . Masterson 's natural charm pretty much coasts on its own , either that or she has a way of making her character seem like a breath of fresh air with every word.<br /><br />Ardolino makes good use of his cast 's sex appeal the same way he did with " Dirty Dancing " , but this film is not quite as sizzling so you could still watch it with your parents if they happened to be in the room . ( Use your best judgment , they 're your parents after all . ) I give this film a high mark because it is very user friendly , romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it sublime , and those who are just watching along with them should find plenty of humor to enjoy as well.<br /><br />Again , credit goes to Emile Ardolino for making the most of a charming script by Randy and Perry Howze . ( Where are they now ? ) Ardolino 's next film would be the phoned - in sequel to " Three Men and A Baby " but his final theatrical release ( Sister Act ) would finally give him the nine - figure - grossing smash hit he deserved . Mr. Ardolino , your cinematic touch IS missed !
1 Ordinarily I really enjoy movies like " Chances Are , " but I was n't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons . The first half was pretty well done overall , with Alex Finch dying and being reincarnated in a new body ( played by Robert Downey Jr. ) . He meets up with his wife ( Cybill Shepherd ) and friend ( Ryan O'Neal ) and his daughter , who is now grown up . The scenes with them meeting again and Downey rediscovering who he once was are well done , and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once Shepherd finally believes its really her husband reincarnated , but from there the film goes downhill . There are several sex - related scenes that turned me off completely , especially Downey and Shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now . After that , however , the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible , considering the circumstances of the plot . I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end . There was great potential with this story , and the scenes in heaven are well done . There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher , but ultimately the film is not great . For a better , similar film , try " Heaven Can Wait . " Decent , but I really kind of wish I had n't seen it because of the scenes in the second half.<br /><br / > * * * out of * * * *
1 I do n't think I could have enjoyed it more , though certain things were disturbing . I 'm not going to say what , if you have n't seen it ... you'll have to find out for yourself . At any rate , what movie can lack with Robert Downey Jr. 's puppy - dog eyes ? All - in - all , the plot was developed sufficiently . Nothing seemed too rushed , as movies like this tend to be . The characters were like - able , and there were plenty of hilarious scenes in it . The idea over - all is that the story is very well tied together , even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactory ... by matter of opinion . But like I said before , it 's hard not to love any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
1 Nay Sayers of this film are likely bitter from some seriously unrequited love . This is a great film for anyone capable of understanding Johnny Mathis 's song , or any song from that era : Bobby Darin 's , Beyond the Sea ... or Stan Getz 's , The Girl From Ipanema , et al ... <br /><br />I measure films by how many times I have to watch them before I 'm satisfied ... Chances Are had me back a few good times.<br /><br />I also watch the synergy between the cast ... I thought they worked well together.<br /><br />Open your heart , and let the comedic magic of film transport you.<br /><br />'Alan
1 People call this a comedy , but when I just watched it , I laughed < br /><br />only once . I guess the problem is that I first saw it when I was 14,<br /><br />and I was n't old enough to understand that it was n't meant to be < br /><br />taken seriously . There were quite a few scenes that were meant < br /><br />to be funny , but I cared too much about the characters to laugh at < br /><br />them.<br /><br />I suggest that you watch this film next time you 're falling in love,<br /><br />and try to take it seriously . I think you 'll find that , despite a few silly < br /><br />flaws , it 's one of the most moving love stories you 've ever seen .
1 This is n't the best romantic comedy ever made , but it is certainly pretty nice and watchable . It 's directed in an old - fashioned way and that works fine . Cybill Shepherd as Corinne is n't bad in her role as the woman who ca n't get over her husband 's death . She has a sexy maturity . But I ca n't say much for Ryan O'Neal as Philip , because he is , at best , nondescript . He may be adequate in the role , but that 's not good enough.<br /><br />However , I get the feeling that some of the characters , particularly Alex and Miranda , are not written with enough in - depth thought . We do n't know anything else about them because minutes after they appear the story gets thick , and the writers do n't tell us much beyond what happens . But that problem was salvaged because Mary Stuart Masterson has a fresh - as - a - daisy sweetness to brighten it up , and Robert Downey Jr. is so charming that he melts the screen . Even his smile is infectious . And it so happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenes.<br /><br />Anyway , this movie is light and easy and if you like them that way , why not give it a try.<br /><br / >
1 I happen to run into this movie one night so I decided to watch it ! I was very pleased with the movie ... I thought it was a wonderful plot . It 's a great feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say ! And this wife stayed devoted for 23 years ! ! ! I thought it was a great movie ! !
1 I 've just seen this movie for the second time on television . It 's lovely , warm , sentimental , very very romantic . I 've rarely seen actors better able to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another -Cybill Shepherd , Ryan O'Neal , Robert Downey , Jr . and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply outdo themselves . Masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable . < br /><br />The movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as While You Were Sleeping , When Harry Met Sally , Sleepless in Seattle and the " high gimmick " sorts of movies like Big , Back to the Future , Peggy Sue Got Married . I hate to say this , because this cast was superb and I 'd never change any of them- but I think it did n't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as Meg Ryan , Tom Hanks , Michael J. Fox , and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made.<br /><br / > It 's not superbly written - e.g. , the characters ' lines are not particularly memorable . Yet it 's executed to perfection . < br /><br />The romantic yearnings are truly palpable , the " feeling " of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated , love 's timelessness and all - encompassing sweep , the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection , are so touchingly delivered . Again and again , you will find yourself moved . Actually , a comparable movie is Made in Heaven -the same romantic yearning.<br /><br />Do see this - it 's lovely .
1 Chances Are uses that marvelous song by the same name throughout the film . Robert Downey , Jr. is excellent in this movie . His extra large eyes and wonderfully variable facial expressions are part of expertise in acting as different people in diverse films . Compare Robert Downey , Jr. in Chaplin . You will enjoy Chances Are . I did .
1 Every scene was put together perfectly . This movie had a wonderful cast and crew . I mean , how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. in it , none have and ever will exist . He has the ability to brighten up any movie with his amazing talent . This movie was perfect ! I saw this movie sitting all alone on a movie shelf in " Blockbuster " and like it was calling out to me , I could n't resist picking it up and bringing it home with me . You can call me a sappy romantic , but this movie just touched my heart , not to mention made me laugh with pleasure at the same time . Even though it made me cry , I admit , at the end , the whole movie just brightened up my outlook on life thereafter . I suggested to my horror , action , and pure humor movie buff of a brother , who absolutely adored this movie . This is a movie with a good sense of feeling . It could make you laugh out loud , touch your heart , make you fall in love , and enjoy your life . Every time you purposefully walk past this movie , just be aware that you are consciously making the choice to live and feel this inspiring movie . Who knows ? What if it could really happen to you ? , and keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life .
1 Good work by everyone , from scriptwriters , director , and cast ; a lovely fun film that becomes believable for sentimental reasons only ; a good film for television on those cloudy , cold wintry days when you just want to sit back and enjoy .
1 Not a film to be taken seriously , but a great little film nonetheless.<br /><br />It 's definitely NOT just a piece of fluff . The acting , IMO , is excellent.<br /><br />One of those films you would n't go out of your way to see , but it brings a smile every time it comes around on cable . Like an old friend.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance.<br /><br />- - - - - - - -
1 The story of " A Woman From Nowhere " is rather simple and pretty much adapted right out of a Eastwood Spaghetti Western : A mysterious stranger comes into a lawless town run by a kingpin and starts shooting up the place . Even the opening credits and music have that spaghetti feel : Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud . The really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful ( ! ) woman , Saki ( Ryoko Yonekura ) on a Harley , and the location is in a town somewhere in Japan.<br /><br />In this actioner , there 's a considerable amount of gunplay , some of it good , some predictable , and other spots somewhat hokey , but it 's a whole lot of fun . Ryoko handles her guns with believability and aplomb and gives the thugs their due . It was n't much of an acting challenge for her as it was a physical challenge , but she handled things very well . She shows her acting skills much more as Otsu in the NHK drama , " Musashi." < br /><br />I'd highly recommend film if you 're a Ryoko Yonekura fan ( which I adoringly am ) and/or a " girls with guns " movie fan and it does hold up to repeated viewings . To me , there 's something eminently and inexplicably appealing about " girls with guns " movies like " La Femme Nikita " and " The Long Kiss Goodnight . " And to have a gorgeous gal like Ryoko starring in it as well is just gobs of icing on the cake .
1 Yet another remake of " Fistful of Dollars " , Sergio Leone 's remake of Kurosawa 's " Yojimbo " ( suggested by the novel ' Red Harvest').<br /><br />This one is strictly a B - Movie ; taken as that , it is rather enjoyable . the direction is crisp , the acting full of verve , the limitations of its ' direct - to - video ' photography well - handled.<br /><br />The weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the ' fistful'/'yojimbo ' plot to a sub - plot from Leone 's ' Once Upon a Time in the West ' . Although leone directed both ' Fistful ' and ' West ' , his motivations behind the two films could n't be anymore different . The ' Man With No Name ' ( Eastwood ) is a borderline socio - path with a soft spot for broken families . Harmonica ( Chaeles Bronson ) is obsessed with his own broken family , and obsessed with revenge . These two characters would not have had much to do with each other . In order to bring them together , ' Gun Crazy ' has to twist it 's plot and complicate it until we lose track of which story we 're actually following.<br /><br />But this is a B - Movie after all , and filled with action and silliness ; it 's entertaining on that level , just do n't expect anything more .
1 Another one for the Babes & Bullets crowd . The story is much edgier than any other musical I have seen : cannons hidden up the missing legs of females , and places each generatively in the other in a way that comes closer to intelligent comment than we might expect for the locale . More effective than contemporary ' drama . ' It is hard identify with a woman who keeps a cannon up her pants -- in lue of leggage . Pretty remarkable if you consider the context.<br /><br />Despite the cannon up the leg thing providing 90 % of the surprises , this film also chronicles how greed supersedes all other considerations in the lives of a group of yakuzas who pursue a woman who keeps up her leg a concealed cannon / rocket - launcher ( hence no group shower scenes or thongs ) The hidden projectile - launcher which is pulled out from the behind the protagonists back , seemingly from nowhere , in miike 's Dead or Alive ( 1999 ) , The torch brought forth out of thin air by the heroine towards the end of the original Tomie ( 2000 ) , or the harrowing flame - thrower scene in Sunny Gets Blue ( 1992 ) , all testify to an almost third - world Cantinflas - esquire influence in the contemporary Japanese cinema , of which I am at a loss to explain , but can not complain.<br /><br />You wo n't see good quality movies of this essence made in Hollywood , its all but extinct and with cheap crap they pump out for a cheap thrill , is all but laughable . This is a true film and while its great in its entirety , the ending is a brilliant , if not unblatant rip - off of certain Sergio Leon pictures , involving cannons where legs should be , and certainly is appropriate !
1 Corbin Bernsen 's sent letters to four criminal associates he 's worked with in the past and it 's a real intergenerational mix with Fred Gwynne , Lou Diamond Phillips , William Russ , and Ruben Blades . They 're to meet him in this obscure Montana town and he does n't explain why because he 's then picked up by out of state police from New Jersey on a warrant . < br /><br />Of the criminal group that 's been gathered together , they all know Bernsen , but do n't know each other . A lot of comedy involved is them feeling each other out . As the oldest Gwynne though denying it kind of takes charge with the others grumbling , but going along . Especially when they figure out what Bernsen had in mind.<br /><br />As for Bernsen , he 's got the good fortune to be picked up by a pair of bumblers in Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck . He gets the drop on O'Neill and escapes.<br /><br />After that it 's the four criminals trying to finish what Bernsen started and Bernsen getting away the police . In the intricately plotted screenplay , it 's fascinating how both story lines keep intertwining with each other . Hoyt Axton as the local sheriff watches in amazement at what unfolds in his town.<br /><br />Disorganized Crime is a fabulously funny caper film by a bunch of players who seem mostly to have had a background in television or would soon . I ca n't say that anyone stood out in the cast they also seem to click so well together . < br /><br />Ironically none of these people are comedians per se , but they all exhibit a light comic touch that good directing brought out . < br /><br />Disorganized Crime is one very funny caper movie , the kind of film that well known pessimist Mr. Murphy would have written .
1 The plot is tight . The acting is flawless . The directing , script , scenery , casting are all well done . I watch this movie frequently , though I do n't know what it is about the whole thing that grabs me . See it and drop me a line if you can figure out why I like it so much .
1 I do n't know why I like this movie so well , but I never get tired of watching it .
1 I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing . Everything about this movie seemed to click , the storyline , the characters , the setting . As far as film is concerned I would n't call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic . It gets it 's meaning across . The cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie . Corben Berbson , Fred Gwynne , Ruben Blades , and Ed O'Neil are hilarious . For this who have n't seen it , I will give you a brief synopsis : Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist . However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey , they try to figure out what s going on and all hell breaks loose . The film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven , only with four criminals who ca n't stand each other , and in Montana rather than Las Vegas . All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you to see this movie .
1 I like this film for several reasons . I have a soft spot for films about intricately plotted criminal plots like TOPKAPI . I also enjoy films ( like TOPKAPI and BIG DEAL ON MADONNA STREET ) that spoof the the genre . One of the best ones is DISORGANIZED CRIME.<br /><br />Corbin Bernsen has met four cons over the years , and he decides they can all be useful in a bank robbery he is planning in a small Montana town . But he has n't given any details on the crime to the fellows , nor do they really know each other at all . Shortly after he sends for them Bernsen is arrested by two New Jersey policemen ( Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck ) whom he escaped from before and have a warrant to bring him back . While he is in their custody the four cons ( Fred Gwynne , Lou Diamond Philips , Ruben Blades , and Will Russ ) show up without a clue about why they are there except that Bernsen was planning something . < br /><br />The first twenty minutes of the film deal with the four cons slowly getting used to each other , with Gwynne and Philips managing to push away their own suspicions to figure out they have to trust each other . At the same time we see Bernsen patiently waiting for the right moment to escape from O'Neill and Roebuck again - not too difficult as they are not the brightest bulbs who ever existed . The result are two sets of plots that will keep juxtaposing against each other throughout the film : the four cons trying to figure out what Bernsen 's scheme was , and how to put it into operation , and Bernsen trying to maintain his own freedom from his pursuers and regain his cabin ( and hopefully find his gang there for him to take command of ) . There is also a third , smaller , plot involving the growing annoyance and anger of local Sheriff Hoyt Axton against the idiots from New Jersey who keep getting into his hair.<br /><br />There are many delightful moments in the film , such as Axton , egged on by O'Neil and Roebuck , into surrounding a house in the town that Bernsen is supposed to be hiding inside of , and yelling ( through a megaphone , " Come out , we have you surrounded ! ! " , only to have the scene switch to a huge , Montana plain that Bernsen is struggling and stumbling through miles from where the police think he is at that moment . There are moments of misadventures by our four cons , who fortunately put the oldest ( Gwynne ) into leadership position . This does not always guarantee anything . At one point their car wo n't start , and they have to thumb a ride by truck . Unfortunately it is a truck carrying manure.<br /><br />The conclusion with the gang successfully carrying out the robbery , including disabling all the police cars at the critical time ( Philips specialty is cars ) is also a gem of timing , suspense , and comic results . The film is very entertaining , and certainly worth watching .
1 I could n't agree more with Nomad 7 's and I A HVR 's comments . A perfect laid back Sunday morning movie . The humor is subtle ( exact opposite of " slapstick " as one misguided commenter noted).<br /><br />But what always ceases to amaze me is how often I find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over . I originally copied this movie onto VHS about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of those Pay Cable free weekend previews(HBO maybe ? ) . Had never heard of it previously . Do n't know why it was n't marketed that well . ? ? When DVD 's were released en mass , it was one of the first movies I replaced . A great combination of cast and writing . Plus , the back drop of Montana wilderness does n't hurt things either ( beautiful).<br /><br />It 's probably not the type of comedy for everyone , but what is ? If Adam Sandler type stuff is up your alley , this probably wo n't be your cup of tea . This movie needs your full attention . The humor is mostly in the dialog.<br /><br />I believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th . But I still know that when it gets to the scenes like the one where the hoods of the police cars start blowing off , I 'm going to loose it ( Ed O'Neill 's face is PRICELESS ! ) . Recommended 110 % .
1 Remember the early days of Pay Per View ? I do , and i can almost remember the number you had to CALL to actually rent the movie on your t.v . As a kid we always wanted to rent playboy , but this meant actually calling someone from PPV and asking to rent it . And then you get the nerve to do it and your watching four hours of soft core no angle crap . Well the reason i bring that up is because this movie too was on ppv . And i remember almost every scene that was in the add . I 've been on a kick in the last few years to obtain all the great movies i use to see as a kid and this was one of them . It 's one that when its on its hard to shut off . All star cast trying to commit the perfect bank bust but nothing goes right . There are plenty of spoof bank capers that are good and this one has to fall in that category . It has enough action and laughs to sustain it . check it out if you dare !
1 I saw this movie with my dad . I must have been pretty young , around 15 . It was on Star Movies one afternoon . The movie started a bit vaguely , but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score . It really caught pace after the first half hour.<br /><br />All the actors are great , especially Blades and Lou Diamond . I Guess it 's the ensemble , they just play so well together . I can watch this film anytime . I think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score . The jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious.<br /><br />A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon .
1 Action . Comedy . Suspense . This movie has it all.<br /><br />The Plot goes that 4 would be professional thieves are invited to take part in a heist in a small town in Montana . every type of crime movie archetype character is here . Frank , the master mind . Carlos , the weapons expert . Max , the explosives expert . Nick , the safe cracker and Ray , the car man . Unfortunately for Frank , he is apprehended by 2 bumbling detectives ( portrayed very well by Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck ) that have been chasing him from New Jersey write after he sends out the letters to the other 4.<br /><br />Our 4 characters meet up at the train station and from the beginning none of them like or trust one another . Added to the mix is the fact that Frank is gone and they are not sure why they have called together.<br /><br />Now Frank is being taken back to New Jersey by the 2 detectives but soon escapes on foot and tries to make his way back to the guys who are having all sorts of problems of their own.<br /><br />Truly a great film loaded with laughs and great acting . Just an overall good movie for anyone looking for a laugh or something a little different
1 I found this film by mistake many years ago & wondered then ( still do ) why it did n't get the acclaim it should have . Well written , beautiful acting , one ironic twist after another , and THERE IS PLAUSIBILITY in what the nefarious characters are attempting . I would not recommend this film for people with short attention spans ; it requires sufficient intelligence to comprehend that there maybe a kernel of truth in this story .
1 Why do I like DISORGANIZED CRIME so much ? Why do I chuckle or laugh out loud any time I think of a dozen or more scenes from this movie ? It 's kind of hard to explain , but I 'll give it a try . First of all , it 's very funny indeed - in contrast to what lots of " official " reviews want you to believe . But then again , that depends entirely on your sense of humour , so there is no sense in arguing about that . Often the humour is in the dialogue , and often it is situational comedy . There is for instance this very hilarious scene in which the 4 gang members have been given a lift in the back of a truck . When the farmer drops them , they just stand there by the road , covered all over with cow s * * * or whatever . They are totally unnerved ; then , realizing the humour of the scene , they one by one start laughing about themselves , and Ruben Blades ( as Carlos ) , looking ( and certainly smelling ) terrible , nonchalantly takes out some mouth spray to at least do something about his breath ( simply describing the scene here makes me chuckle again ! ) . Which leads to the second point : the acting . Fred Gwynne , Lou Diamond Phillips , William Russ , Ruben Blades and Corbin Bernsen ( okay , the latter overdoes it a bit at times ) all fit and play their parts beautifully - in fact , you get the feeling they must have been enjoying themselves too when shooting the film . Thirdly , there is the plot . Jim Kouf , the director and screenwriter , is very laid - back ; he takes his time to let the plot unfold and have the individual characters establish themselves . More often than not , there is no real action , and yet you enjoy these 4 very different people - who attempt to rob a bank although their boss ( Bernsen ) does not seem to turn up - grumble about each other and even - tually , grudgingly , like each other . The movie is a fantastic parody of the typical bank robbery plot - totally impossible with all its twists and coincidences , yet utterly convincing in its love for ironic details . Incidentally , the title of the film is one of the best I have ever come across , because it per - fectly summarizes the plot in a very ironic way . Therefore , take my advice : watch this film , but if you do n't chuckle , grin or smile during the first 10 minutes , forget it - it 's not your type of film . PS . The only negative thing about this movie is that there seems to be no way to get hold of the screenplay - if you happen to know how , do tell me .
1 The Finnish version of Robert Altman 's " Short Cuts " , set in the small rural town of Äänekoski . The episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events , problems and emotions of human life : joy and love , deception and disillusionment , hopelessness and death . I was particularly impressed by two episodes . The first is the story of the young waitress , who tries to stir up a romance for his co - workers : she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life . The other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity . Particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the " routines " of the hospital crew ( despite the signs of occasional empathy ) . Compared with Altman 's classic , this movie is perhaps less professional , but it is definitely a great piece of art .
1 Following my experience of Finland for slightly more than a week , I 'd say this movie depicts the nature of the Finnish society very accurately . Especially the young - couple - with - a - baby - having - serious - issues phenomenon is very familiar to me , as I witnessed the exact same thing in person when I was in Finland . The relationships and problems of people , fragility of the marriage institution , the drinking culture , unemployment and the ascending money problem , all are very well put , without any subjectivity or exaggeration.<br /><br />There are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to comprehend and tie to each other , but the joint big picture is nonetheless rewarding . Not each one of the short stories is exciting or profound , but as said above , the big picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of " real life " and captivate the viewer . I happen to think in a calm moment : What is happening in the lives of all these people on the street ? Well , this is what is happening . Movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power . It would be safe to assume this film could apply to the life in many countries , but it particularly reflects Finland as it is , and pretty damn well.<br /><br />One comment about the acting : Being the fan of Finnish cinema I am , I 've never seen any of these actors on any other movie , but I found the acting in this feature right next door to perfect overall . Maybe not a masterpiece , but a very good try by the entire crew . I 'll be keeping an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast .. <br /><br />7,5 / 10
1 Half a dozen short stories of varying interest enlighten us about life in Finland . These stories are interwoven and each contains a scene in which a sonic boom is heard . This indicates that the events depicted happen at the same time.<br /><br />The film begins with a bungy jump which promises some excitement but the early stories are quite low key . The film improves so stick with it . Two broken marriages in stories that follow provide plenty of drama while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief . The last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving.<br /><br />While the various scenes of family life take place in Finland , the themes are of a general nature wherever you happen to live.<br /><br />Collections of short stories are rarely as satisfying as a good tense 90-minute drama .
1 Excellent movie , a realistic picture of contemporary Finland , touching and profound . One of the best Finnish films ever made . Captures marvelously the everyday life in a Central Finland small town , people 's desires and weaknesses , joys and sorrows . The bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society . Lampela is indeed one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers . He shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed . His next film Eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in Joki .
1 I thought it was an extremely clever film . I was very pleased with it and truly could n't ' ask for more . I actually own the film because I did n't return it to someone ... Which I should do , but I really want to keep it due to how much I enjoyed it . Also , the fact I do n't own too many foreign films and this is a first . Now , I personally love Finnish stuff so , that definitely added to how much I enjoyed it . But overall , its worth watching . However , if you 're not into the whole trying to understand Finnish or read Subtitles bit , then this film is not for you.<br /><br />9/10 for sure .
1 This is a top finnish film this year , although Tango Kabaree comes close . The Director Lampela made couple of years back another nice little film called Rakastin epätoivoista naista ( I was in love with a desperate woman).Joki is truly true - to - life beautiful film of one saturday afternoon in a little village / town . The actors are maybe not so handsome or beautiful but they do act beautifully . I certainly do hope that many of them get JUSSI statue ( finnish OSCAR ) next spring . I think this film could make it abroad as well .
1 Went to see this finnish film and I 've got to say that it is one of the better films I 've seen this year . The intrigue is made up of 5 - 6 different stories , all taking place the very same day in a small finnish town . The stories come together very nicely in the end , reminding , perhaps , a bit of the way Tarantino 's movies are made . Most of the actors performed very well , which most certainly is needed in realistic dramas of this type . I especially enjoyed the acting by Sanna Hietala , the lead actress , and Juha Kukkonen . I noticed btw that IMDB has got the wrong information about Sanna . Her name , as you might have noticed in my review ;) , is NOT Heikkilä , but Hietala .
1 Soldier is n't a great movie , and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons . But I liked Soldier alot , partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised me.<br /><br />First , the art direction is tight and well executed . As far as science fiction backdrops go , Soldier was doing things with more design then 90 % the genre . The sets , costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed ; I did n't love all of their future military style , but I was impressed with the effort . For me , this made the movie worth the time it took to watch.<br /><br />Second , I 'm a Kurt Russell fan . I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter films . Soldier is essentially an action movie , and the role of Sergeant Todd is an essential action hero . It 's not an award winning role , but Kurt musters up convincing emotion with VERY little dialog.<br /><br />Third , the fight scenes and battles are well choreographed . This is n't iron monkey , or even the matrix , but once again , it far exceeds the average level of quality in the genre.<br /><br />If you have n't seen it , and you like sci - fi action films , pick it up if you pass at your rental depot of choice . Just do n't expect the next Bladerunner .
1 OK , so Soldier is n't deep and meaningful like Blade Runner or as big budget as Terminator 2 but on the whole I found it quite enjoyable.<br /><br />The fact that Kurt Russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant . I found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than Arnie 's in the T films ( and before I get comments yes I know that Arnie was a cyborg and Kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same).<br /><br />So to the film itself , a reasonable US / Brit cast are able to flesh out this little story . Not really sure if Gary Busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies , so was unable to decide whether I liked them or not . The colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving / gullible / cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other.<br /><br />Kurt Russell is good and unlike other comments I do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career ( unlike maybe Escape from LA - sequels are such fickle creatures ! ) . Sean Pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble Sci - Fi lineage . And the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly.<br /><br />If you see this on your TV schedule I would recommend giving it a chance . I do n't think you will be disappointed .
1 In a future society , the military component does not have to recruit ; rather , their candidates are chosen at birth , culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government . They are given over to the war machine , body and soul , for no reason other than to protect and serve ; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank , and no autonomy whatsoever . This is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in ` Soldier , ' directed by Paul Anderson and starring Kurt Russell . The scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time , from preadolescence to adulthood . Russell is Sergeant Todd , the best of the best , and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign ; he is what he was born to be , a soldier . But even the best can not go on forever , and the day arrives when Todd and his peers are no longer the elite . A new generation of soldiers has been created , products of advanced genetics and technology , and Todd 's generation is suddenly obsolete . What follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life , while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality , traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life : Fear and discipline . Russell gives a commanding performance as Todd , the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts . He has few lines in this movie , but Russell speaks volumes with his eyes . This role demonstrates that he is , in fact , one of the under - appreciated actors of our times ; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of Todd is a credit to his ability , and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he 's done before . And he 's given Todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype . Notable performances are also turned in here by Connie Nielsen ( Sandra ) and Jason Isaacs ( Colonel Mekum ) . Rounding out the supporting cast are Jason Scott Lee , memorable as Caine 607 , one of the new generation of soldiers ; Sean Pertwee ( Mace ) ; Gary Busey ( Captain Church ) ; Michael Chiklis ( Jimmy Pig ) ; and Mark Bringleson ( Rubrick ) . Anderson has delivered an action film with a message , a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science - fiction . ` Soldier ' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact . It 's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives , like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just would n't make a whole lot of difference . Much like ` 1984 , ' and ` Mad Max , ' this movie , which is ultimately uplifting , is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of Universe in which we all must live together and share . I rate this one 7/10 .
1 David Webb Peoples meets Paul Anderson ... if it already sounds weird to you , then you are right , because it is.<br /><br />Peoples is known for his scripts with moral implications of what is right and wrong , the value of life , etc ... He covered these issues in Bladerunner , Unforgiven , and pretty much in all of his screenplays there is something along those lines.<br /><br />Paul Anderson 's first successful movie was a violent thriller . Not surprisingly so have all of his other movies ! And here is a violent thriller with moral implications!<br /><br />Peoples ' script is quite apparent in the first half of the movie . Soldiers trained from birth , taught to kill , and never had a normal life . They are replaced by better , genetically engineered soldiers and Todd , one of the original soldiers , is left on a planet and left for dead . There he must cope with a group of refugees , some want him to stay others hate him and there is an interesting drama here . BUT THEN ... <br /><br /> ... The bullets start to fly as the new soldiers move onto the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people . Big , violent , loud action ensues and Peoples ' script turns into an Anderson action - fest . It is hard to believe that the script was originally written that way , but the end product is better then I expected . Entertaining , somewhat , though admittedly not very , thought - provoking , and exciting once the action starts . 7/10<br /><br />Rated R : a lot of violence
1 Kurt Russell is strong and ( mostly ) silent in this futuristic action - thriller from Paul Anderson ( Event Horizon , Resident Evil . ) Set on a garbage - dump planet , Soldier plays like a cross between Rambo and Shane , with Russell barely speaking as the title character , an " obsolete " genetic soldier left for dead . The supporting cast of colonists , including Connie Nielsen , Sean Pertwee and a surprisingly hirsute Michael Chiklis , is able . They spend most of the movie being scared of Russell , and the rest of it running for their lives . Russell 's performance here is one of the best he 's ever given . With almost no words to say , he conveys emotion , feeling and meaning with looks and glances . It is almost a mime performance . When the action sequences kick into gear , he kicks ass -- and does so in a strong , silent , matter - of fact way . There are flaws . Jason Scott Lee is brutish as a " superior " genetic soldier . Jason Isaacs does a great impression of Frank Burns from M*A*S*H as a weaselly commanding officer , and Gary Busey busts a gut ( and nearly busts his girdle ) as Todd 's mentor . This is an underrated , and excellent sci - fi flick , and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of Blade Runner -- David Webb Peoples wrote both screenplays .
1 I do n't remember this film getting a cinema release over here . I only saw it when it came onto cable . The film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines . Specifically one person , the way he gets replaced and dumped ( literally ) into an off - world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels.<br /><br />Seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be Rambo in space , and would have been happy if it was.<br /><br />I'm certainly happy it was'nt - Kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple . The scene where he 's sitting outside the compound shows this , albeit the decision for two slow - mo replays detracts from the moment.<br /><br />This is not a classic SF movie in the way that Bladerunner , Alien , Silent running , Logan 's run or THX1138 were , however it is unfortunately the nearest I 've seen to it in a long time.<br /><br />He changes in the movie to a believable degree , he does'nt crack Arnie one liners , he does'nt become Snake Plissken and there is no definative happy ending.<br /><br />That 's why this film did'nt do well . It did'nt follow formula , and among a 18 - 25 year old target American audience , that 's unforgivable as it was was'nt what they expected to see.<br /><br />Fear and discipline.<br /><br />Always .
1 When I rented this movie to watch it , I knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie . Instead I thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating . And you know what it worked . Kurt Russel did what I though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was . I recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film .
1 I watched this movie expecting what I got : good sci - fi cowboy stuff . What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role.<br /><br />Imagine trying to act under these two restraints : you have hardly any dialogue , and because you are playing a hardass , military robot , you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions ! Howzat ? Kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct - taped . In spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed , Russell pulls off an incredible characterization . His robot becomes human , in spite of the constraints . Great job!<br /><br />As usual , Jason Isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain -- the one you 'd love to see drawn and quartered . Connie Nielsen was sweet , soft , motherly , and gorgeous . I 'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty , but it was hard to take one 's eyes off her . Unfortunately , Gary Busey 's role was too small and limited . < br /><br />Much of the plot is quite standard , with a fair amount of weaknesses , but as it does have a sci - fi comic book feeling , I do n't see what 's wrong with a few weaknesses . By the end of the story the good guy wins , and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction . Yes!<br /><br />The sort of feeb who thinks that Russell did n't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point .
1 Ok , basically this is a popcorn sci - fi movie , but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence . You can count about 10 clichés that the film is building up to , but it only delivers on about three of them , and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director has n't assumed that you are an idiot . Kurt Russell 's acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding . Recommended if you 've just seen something really stupid , and want to rebuild your faith !
1 The first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts : the -thematic- conflict between the soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity , and the -physical- conflict between Todd and his bio - engineered replacement . Both sequences are quite gripping in different ways.<br /><br />Peoples ' screenplay falters somewhat by resolving the first of these arcs half - way through the movie , which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp.<br /><br />Nonetheless , kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to Kurt Russell who conveys much with very little.<br /><br />Not a great film , but one worth seeing .
1 In the movie several references are made in subtly to Blade runner , but one of the most obvious is the fact the Cain 607 and his unit are all genetic constructs , breed to be expendable warriors . But as favorite quote of mine from the movie is , " you should have made them smart as well as fast " . Kurt Russell did a incredible job , his facial expressions or lack of in the movies gave more in the way of relating the story then the rest of the cast combined . Even when he falls in love with Sandra but does not know how to deal with these emotions , and his tears after being expelled from the group , or his shuddering when he is given a hug , and his attachment to the mute young boy who in many ways reminded Todd of himself , and what he could have been if not for his selection to be a soldier .
1 Soldier may not have academy acting or Lucas special effects but it definitely does it for me . I wo n't tell you what its about , I 'm sure you already read the summary . This is a great doomed futureistic action / science fiction movie . Kurt Russell does n't say much , he usually has an eerie or drone look on his face but it fits the character . There are great action and fight scenes ; some of the scenes are unrealistic , but that s Hollywood make believe land that we should have to escape our normal lives . I have not seen Soldier 2 but this one it one of my favorites . I 'm lucky enough to have a wife that digs on guy movies ; we both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes tough guy / sci - fi movies .
1 This is a great movie . It has a captivating story , an awesome main character , very good acting and killer action . This takes place mostly in the year 2036 but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story.<br /><br />The story is very well done and there are no holes . Kurt Russell is a solider named Todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives . Eventually the military introduces newer , younger , faster and stronger soldiers . Jason Scott Lee being one of them . As a result they do n't have any need for the old soldiers like Todd . They test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers , in the battle Russell is injured and assumed to be dead . The military dumps his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they do n't realize is that Russell is alive.<br /><br />Todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on . For a while he lives there but ca n't adjust to normal life . He rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people . When they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert.<br /><br />Just as Russell 's leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers . What the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like Todd and the other old soldiers . So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd , Todd easily outsmarts them . The military starts realizing this and Todd kills all of their men but one . That one is Jason Scott Lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between Russell and Scott Lee . Russell obviously comes out on top.<br /><br />This is one of the best action films I 've ever seen and I 've seen a lot . This has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines . The writer also did n't forget that Russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women " sir " . There are no holes in this film , every minute has a purpose and it 's very entertaining.<br /><br />An awesome one man army action film for fans of Rambo , Commando and Missing In Action . This is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and action / sci - fi fans .
1 Nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci - fi movie that 's been vilified at the US box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of Kurt Russell 's career.<br /><br />I have my reasons.<br /><br />Firstly when you read negative reviews of this film , they usually start with the wooden nature of Russell 's interpretation of Todd , the eponymous Soldier . I 'm going to start here too , with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting I 've seen Russell pull off . Todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense PTSD - this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now.<br /><br />The portrayal is spot on . Todd is withdrawn , uncommunicative and a loner . He suffers from irrational anxiety - keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger . His hyper - focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within - there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed , not cleaning up the cut or the blood . Many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand , but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote - not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he 's preparing and the food that will be eaten later.<br /><br />Todd 's dialog is spartan to say the least - the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence . Fear and Discipline we are told . Always . Fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by , keeping him ready to react on a knife edge . Discipline to hold him in check through his fear , to overcome it and perform tactically . The inference is that he has no time to think and can not afford feelings . Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from Nielsen 's Sandra - but I believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who 's only experience of an embrace is in combat - the trembling represents him suppressing his fight / flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled , his movement and vision restricted - Fear and Discipline indeed.<br /><br />Then there is the subtext of his abandonment ( Twice in fact ) - so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they 've served their terms . 40 % of the unemployed are ex - military in OUR world , in HIS it can only be worse . Russell quickly picks up the mantle of Mace 's responsibility to his wife and child - desperately in need of a mission , even one with such a high likelihood of his death.<br /><br />Then there is the military subtext too - the conflict between Busey 's Church and the hotshot from HQ , Mekum . Mekum 's new men are faster , stronger , more accurate and aggressive . Any one of them could pound Todd into the ground - but it 's not about the tools you have it 's how you use them . An incentivized Todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit - sent in without support , cover or reconnaissance . It is a reminder that military power can not make up for a failure in leadership.<br /><br />There are many other subtle themes . When a film is shot and scripted so minimally , it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root . Watch Soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches YOU .
1 Kurt Russell is so believable and the action so non - stop that it takes thinking about it afterward to realize that there were honest - to - goodness important themes [ overcoming fear of The Stranger , learning to rise above early conditioning , the strength that love and friendship can bring , etc . ] in the storyline . This is so very rare for a ' guy 's action flick ' that even I [ who thinks most A / A is violent pap ] liked the film and have recommended it to every guy I know ..... it 's a shame this one was overlooked because by rights it should have been one of the biggest action - adventure box office hits -- it has something for everyone without straining credulity or losing the nearly non - stop action moments . I 'm afraid the answer to it not becoming a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it . Anyone under 20 probably has not only seen more violent action in their video games but probably would either not catch the multi - layered , multi - themed beauty or not care about it . This film could convert anyone who avoids A / A as mindless violence . If a guy takes his lady [ or rents it or sees it in a cable listing ] to see this film he 'll be much more likely to get her to go with him to other action flicks .
1 Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd ( a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable Kurt Russell ) gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he 's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant Colonel Mekum ( deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Jason Isaacs ) , who has Todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants . Todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self - reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise . Director Paul W.S. Anderson , working from a smart and provocative script by David Webb Peoples , depicts a chilling vision of a bleak , cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough , gritty tone throughout . Moreover , Anderson handles moving moments of humanity well ( Todd 's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant ) and stages the stirring action scenes with rip - roaring gusto . Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of Todd ; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions . Bang - up supporting turns by Jason Scott Lee as brutish rival soldier Caine 607 , Connie Nielson as the compassionate Sandra , Sean Pertwee as the kindly Mace , Jared and Taylor Thorne as mute little boy Nathan , Gary Busey as crusty seasoned veteran Captain Church , Michael Chiklis as the jolly Johnny Pig , and Brenda Wehle as the sensible Mayor Hawkins . Better still , this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might . David Tattersall 's polished cinematography , Joel McNeely 's rousing full - bore orchestral score , and the first - rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction / action hybrid outing .
1 This was excellent . Touching , action - packed , and perfect for Kurt Russel . I loved this movie , it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars . This movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering , and people who learn that there is a time for fighting , a need to defend . I cried , laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story . Good writing job for an action flick , and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid . The ending was n't twisty , but it was still excellent . If you like escape from New York , or rooting for the underdog , this movie is for you . Not an undue amount of gore or violence , it was not difficult to watch in that respect . Something for everyone .
1 I fell in love with this silent action drama . Kurt Russell and only Kurt Russell could have played this so well . Raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting , Todd ( Kurt Russell ) is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiers.<br /><br />The stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born - SOLDIER . Not Rambo , not Schwarzenegger , not Bruce Willis , not Mel Gibson , not Jason Statham - Kurt Russell owns this role and made it entirely his - original , daring , and all too human . I miss the fact that sequels were never made.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />-LD < br /><br />_________<br /><br />my faith : http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
1 What a perfect example of " Less Is More ... " Kurt Russell ( Sgt . Todd ) only has 72 lines , and something like 104 words . What a challenge ! Like a black and white photo , when your mind 's eye has to fill in the blanks , the facial expressions , the physical drama , the emotive gesture , all combines to make a stronger impact . This is one of those top 5 movies I ca n't live without , right up there with the classics like Road Warrior . If you liked this , check out " Mad Max 2 , The Road Warrior " and " Braveheart " both starring Mel Gibson . Also " Gladiator " with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was in Soldier also . The " Thirteenth Warrior " starring Antonio Banderas and " Blade Runner " starring Harrison Ford .
1 I 've watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it was n't as successful ( commercially or artistically ) as it should have been , and discovered considerable artistic merit -- which may ultimately have been its commercial undoing.<br /><br />First of all , this movie attempts " serious " science - fiction , social commentary , more than action - adventure . There is action in it , but that 's not really what it 's about . If you focus on that , you 'll end up with ( as others have noted ) a bad " Aliens " clone . But , again , that 's not what it 's about.<br /><br />The movie is really about Todd 's ( Kurt Russell ) transformation from human to near - machine and back to human ( mostly * back * ) . But because it 's not trying to give you a typically glib Hollywood style answer , Kurt Russell must make this transformation without speaking , and largely without broad expressions . And he really does a wonderful job -- it can take two viewings to appreciate it.<br /><br />The surrounding " social logic " is flawed and it 's never adequately explained whether Todd 's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human - ness or what , but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for Russell 's ( easy to underestimate ) talent .
1 this movie is ok if you like mindless action , corny acting , and a very small plot ! The special effects are decent considering this movie is from the director of"Event Horizon " . The costumes are like something from a mad max movie .None of the soldiers talk , so others tell them what to do . It eventually end up as a big shoot'em up movie with explosions all the place . I personally liked Russell better in " tango and cash""escape from la / new york " and " executive decision " . It must see this movie leave your mind at the door for a no brainer action science fiction movie ! !
1 SOLDIER is not as bad as many have made it out to be . I found the film to have some of the sacarstic , cynical humour like that in Paul Verhoven 's Starship Troopers . The lack of dialogue and over the top action is deliberate and adds to the comic - book atmosphere.<br /><br />One particular trivia - bit stands out for me - Todd has the names of several space - war campaigns tattoo'd onto his chest and one of these battles is TANNHAUSER GATE . For the oblivious ones out there , Tannhauser Gate is mentioned in Roy Batty 's elegiac last lines in Blade Runner . To imagine that Todd could have fought alongside android troops like Roy is mind boggling to say the least . Maybe script writer David Peoples was nostalgic?<br /><br />I'll give this one 3 out of 5 .
1 Interesting mix of comments that it would be hard to add anything constructive to . However , i 'll try . This was a very good action film with some great set pieces . You 'll note I specified the genre . I did n't snipe about the lack of characterisation , and I did n't berate the acting . Enjoy if for what it is people , a well above average action film . I could go on but I 've made my comment .
1 I have to say I quite enjoyed Soldier . Russell was very good as this trained psychopath rediscovering his humanity . Very watchable and nowhere near as bad as I 'd been led to believe . Yes it has problems but provides its share of entertainment .
1 Of course , by any normal standard of film criticism , Soldier is a very poor film indeed . Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a Gladiators contest without the crash mats.<br /><br />Abandoned on a junk planet , he 's befriended by a community of naff space hippies that teach him about gardening , family life and , um , breasts . Kurt does n't talk much . Finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they 're running away . Kurt gets angry and kills everyone . A planet gets totalled . The end.<br /><br />Unless the Academy start a new category for " Best Explosion " , Soldier is not going to win any awards . However , as ludicrous as it is , it remains an enjoyable experience . The military hardware is the coolest since Aliens ( the APC 's especially ) and , at 90 minutes long , it does n't outstay its welcome . Please note that the below mark is only a guide . Knock five points off if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more if you do n't like miniguns.<br /><br />7 out of 10
1 I really liked this movie . Kurt manages to act without speaking , letting moments speak for themselves . He does n't have to verbalize or rationalize his actions , he simply decides and takes action . He is supported by a good cast of actors and settings , and is able to show us a more humane side of soldiers without getting to corny .
1 I saw this in the theater and I instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video . I am a big nut for Sci - Fi action flicks though anyway.<br /><br />Without giving any of the story away , it is worth seeing if you like Sci - Fi without requiring much thought . The story is basic , and the plot is very good . Worth your time to see!<br /><br />Maybe they will make a sequel ? : ) < br /><br />8 out of 10
1 I loved this movie and will watch it again . Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self . I think this is Kurt Russell 's best movie . His eyes conveyed more than most actors words . Perhaps there 's hope for Mankind in spite of Government Intervention ?
1 I think that this film was one of Kurt Russels good movies . Kurt russel is my favorite actor so I think that he is a good actor in any role he plays . But this movie had a lot of action in it and I know that it should have more then a 5.6 out of 10 on the meter but many people did not like this movie . Oh well I thought it was good so I think that every one should see this movie . If you see this movie and like it I think that you should see Back Draft also with Kurt Russel . I give Soldier * * * 1/2 out of * * * * *
1 I ca n't understand why many IMDb users do n't like this movie . Why they think it 's sooooo bad etc . It 's not worse than anything else out there . Personally I think " Soldier " is a great movie , far better than most other films in the same genre.<br /><br />Reasons why I liked " Soldier " : Kurt Russel , Connie Nielsen , Jason Scott Lee , the script ( David Webb Peoples ) , great visual effects , and the directing ( Paul Anderson).<br /><br />I even think that this is the best work I 've seen from director Paul Anderson , who has previously directed the entertaining " Mortal Kombat " and the not so entertaining " Event Horizon " .
1 This is an early film " Pilot " for the hit Canadian tv show Trailer Park Boys . It was played to executives at a few networks before Showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series . Great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films . The movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around " exterminating " peoples pets for money . If you have a dog next door who s barking all night these are the guys you go to ! But they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout . Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series . I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Rated R for swearing , violence , and drug use.<br /><br />Its not too offensive either ( they do nt actually show killing animals )
1 This is a great Canadian comedy series . The movie tells of how the stars Jean Paul Tremblay-(Julian ) and the head writer of the show and his buddies Rickie and Bubbles play it over the top in what is a true life satirical look at trailer parks and the denizens of said trashy hoods . The movie will tell you why Rickie and Julian begin doing their more advanced forays into the world of crime . WHY and the reasons behind everything would be a spoiler so I shall not give the real reasons behind their more brilliant escapades . Their friend and oft - time partner(Bubbles ) is a brilliant character . The whole show is brilliant and missing the movie will not affect the way you see the sit - com one bit . It is a comedy with a capital C and a brilliant satire on trailer park living and small time crooks with small time ideas but big time dreams . If you ever have the opportunity to watch -- buy -- steal this program grab it . You will be glad you did . And to my American friends --- It will break you up also . 10 out of 9 . Brilliant . TV how TV should be .
1 Steven Spielberg ( at 24 ) had already directed two superb episodes of a 1971 series called " The Psychiatrist " , starring Roy Thinnes . One episode had been about an emotionally troubled 12-year old boy and the other was about a vibrant young man ( Clu Gulager in his best performance ) who is dying of cancer . Both episodes were stunning , visually unlike anything else on TV , and emotionally complex and adult . The creators of " The Psychiatrist " were Richard Levinson and William Link , who created " Columbo " and also produced its first season.<br /><br />Peter Falk insisted on first rank , experienced TV directors for the first season of " Columbo " , like Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight . But Falk agreed to Spielberg after watching part of the Clu Gulagher episode of " The Psychiatrist".<br /><br />Spielberg says on the DVD of " Duel " that he loved Steven Bochco 's " Murder by the Book " script ( based on a Levinson / Link story ) , and he tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature , even thought he had a lot less money to work with.<br /><br />This episode of " Columbo " is far more visually stylish and makes better use of the sound track and background music than almost any other " Columbo " episode , even though the series always used top directors . Spielberg manages to keep the great Falk and Cassidy from hamming it up too much , but both actors are still a lot of fun . Spielberg also gets fine supporting work from Martin Milner , Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby . All the performances have a freshness and vitality about them . The only " Columbo " episode that was close to being as well directed is the " By Dawn 's Early Light " episode with Patrick McGoohan ( directed by Harvey Hart).<br /><br />I think the two episodes of " The Psychiatrist " and this episode of " Columbo " suggest Spielberg has n't developed technically all that much as a director . He was great from the beginning . In a " Combat ! " DVD commentary of a 1962 episode guest starring Albert Salmi , Robert Altman says that episode was pretty much as good as he ever got as a director . Maybe the same is true of Spielberg .
1 First off , I 'm not some Justin Timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good , in fact I 'm not even a huge Justin fan , but I did like this movie.<br /><br />I work at a video store and when I saw this movie with its huge cast that I 'd never even heard of I had to see what it was about . I did n't find Justin 's acting that bad , it was clearly the worst out of the group , but it 's a pretty impressive group , with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott being two names that did n't even make the first credits list . The story is basic , a journalist uncovering corrupt cops , but I found it well done . L L Cool J 's character was clearly conflicted , but I honestly did n't know what he would do in the end . Morgan Freeman is as always , the wise mentor figure he does so well , and as much as I love Kevin SPacey , he was kind of just there . HIs character did n't have a whole lot of substance , but it 's Kevin Spacey , he can do no wrong.<br /><br />Surprisingly I thought Dylan McDermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop . Truly believable and really in character , he freaked me out a couple of times.<br /><br />I was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest . Horrible catchphrases , unjustified action sequences , stuff like that , but it was surprisingly well done and I did n't find any of that . Every shooting had a point , it was n't clichéd , pretty solid really.<br /><br />overall , amazing cast , decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump . I do n't know why it did n't appear in theatres , it was better than some garbage I 've seen on the big screen . I would say it 's worth seeing .
1 Though this movie has a first rate roster of fine actors , special effects that are excellent , and a story line that is full of surprises , it was n't picked up for studio distribution and went directly to DVD . Perhaps it contains too much ' anti - police force ' information , or perhaps it is juts one too many action flicks released during a glut , but whatever the reason the big screens missed the opportunity , fortunately the new concept of releasing direct to DVD allows us to enjoy it.<br /><br />The theme is old : rookie reporter uncovers an inner circle of cops that are corrupt - in this case the F.R.A.T. ( First Response Assault and Tactical ) team , a group of well trained policeman created to clean up the mythical city of Edison from its low point of crime , drugs , prostitution etc . Working undercover the temptation of pocketing the confiscated goods and money proves too much of an opportunity and now , 15 years after its formation , FRAT is responsible for murder , drug trafficking , terrorizing innocent people etc . The lead dog is Lazerov ( Dylan McDermott , who makes a terrifyingly real gangster ! ) and his partner Rafe Deed ( LL Cool J , even more buff than usual and proving he can be a sensitive actor ) . Reporter Pollack ( Justin Timberlake ) catches wind of a ' bad mistake ' and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to his paper 's boss Ashford ( the always reliably fine Morgan Freeman ) . Gradually Polack convinces Ashford and subsequently Wallace ( Kevin Spacey , also a consistently fine character actor ) and they aid Pollack in this investigative reporting . The closer Pollack gets to the truth the more surprises and bad incidents happen and the story runs pall mall toward a series of unexpected results.<br /><br />Timberlake lacks the charisma to carry the lead , especially in the company of such seasoned actors . But LL Cool J , Freeman , Spacey , and McDermott keep the well - oiled machine of a movie rolling to the very end . No , it is not a great movie , but it is one that makes for an edge of the seat action flick with a message . Grady Harp
1 I thought it was a pretty good movie and should have been released in theaters first . It would n't have been a big Blockbuster but it would have made some pretty good money . The movie has suspense and makes you wonder just how much of this is going on in the real world . Justin Timberlake did a good job . I was n't expecting Justin Timberlake to do that good a job . Considering it is his first movie he did a good job . This is a movie that is good to pick up and watch when you just do n't know what you want to rent that night . It should go pretty well . The cast was great . So I highly recommend that everyone checks this movie out !
1 First of all , this film was not released to theatres ( TESTED POORLY THEY SAY),I say they figured the story of crooked cops , politicians & dedicated newspaper people had been done to death , just send it DVD & cable TV > & take the money & run.<br /><br />That being said I usually like this type of movie , especially with this named cast . Morgan Freeman , Justin Timberlake , Kevin Spacey,<br /><br />L.L.Cool J , Cary Elways , John Heard & on the distaff side , Piper Perabo & Roslyn Sanchez.<br /><br />The plot & story have been done to death , BUT the above cast brings life to this violent movie & it is actually watchable.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake Is good as the dedicated young reporter for a throw - away newspaper edited by Morgan Freeman , The others are either crooked Cops , & Politicians or somewhat decent guys , The 2 ladies are the girl friends of LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE & do what s required , It is quite violent , many killings etc , not for children . By no means is the a great film , BUT for what it is & the cast It is definitely good,<br /><br />Ratings * * * ( out of 4 ) 86 points ( out of 100 ) IMDb 8 ( out of 10 )
1 Having never heard of this film until I saw the rental DVD I as a bit sceptical , there have been many films in the past with good ensemble casts that ca n't do anything film a bad script , and in some cases do n't seem to care.<br /><br />Well having just watched it there was no reason not to give this movie a theatrical release , it IS good . The story like most in this genre can seem a little forced at times but there does appear to be a good amount of realism here too that allows the momentum to carry . I was pleasantly surprised at how good a job Justin Timberlake does here too with such a major role , OK he 's not Oscar material yet , but he 'll learn with each role and he shows a LOT of promise for the future here . Dylan McDermott too was amazingly good in his unexpectedly nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie.<br /><br />Ultimately , just give it a go . you wo n't be disappointed , you wo n't be bored , in fact , I think you 'll be more than happy with the end result .
1 TACHIGUI : THE AMAZING LIVES OF THE FAST - FOOD GRIFTERS Japanese title : Tachiguishi Retsuden < br /><br />Director : Mamoru Oshii Featuring : Toshio Suzuki , Mako Hyodo , Kenji Kawai , Shinji Higuchi , Katsuya Terada Narrated by Koichi Yamadera ----------------------------------------<br /><br />Way back in 1995 , Mamoru Oshii unleashed his dazzling animation feature Ghost In The Shell , which helped consolidate anime 's international acceptance - and also burrowed itself into Andy and Larry Wachowski 's overall concept for The Matrix.<br /><br />The movie 's sequel , Innocence ( 2004 ) , was the inaugural Japanese animated film to compete for the Palme d'Or at Cannes , and it left heads spinning as much for its style and innovative effects as for its oft unfathomable plot.<br /><br />Always the trendsetter , Oshii has now presented us with Tachigui : The Amazing Lives Of The Fast - Food Grifters  which has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell , nor Japanese anime for that matter.<br /><br />Say hello to Oshii 's creation " superlivemation " : not quite animation , nor exactly live - action . Instead the cast endured somewhere in the vicinity of 30,000 snapshots , which were digitally processed and reconstituted in a deceptively simple paper cut - out fashion reminiscent of Balinese puppetry . The movement itself is a stilted , stop - motion style that echoes sequences from Shinya Tsukamoto 's experimental Tetsuo : Iron Man ( 1988).<br /><br />"I could n't think of any method but this one , " said Oshii in a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri . " I realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation." < br /><br />The cast choice is equally enigmatic . Kenji Kawai - who also composed the superlative soundtrack - appears as a ravenous burger fanatic , while renowned Studio Ghibli producer Toshio Suzuki spends his screen time being murdered in bizarre fashion . Others include Katsuya Terada , who dabbled with Oshii on Blood : The Last Vampire , and Shinji Higuchi - a special effects whiz who 's worked on Godzilla movies.<br /><br />Koichi Yamadera 's narration sounds like the stuff of a dry NHK documentary  which belies the comic undertone here as well as Yamadera 's extensive career voicing stoic anime characters like Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop.<br /><br />And the plot itself is a bizarre re - imagining of post - WWII Japan in the context of various fast - food off - shoots - from soba ramen shops to gyudon stand - up bars ; American dogs in the heat - up trays of convenience stores to McDonalds- inspired burger - chain restaurants . " Food is a primal root of desire , " asserted Oshii , by way of explanation . < br /><br />Thrown into the mix is a new breed of consumer : the fast - food grifters of the title , people who do n't like to pay for their tucker and are constantly fine - tuning their elaborate scams to score free munchies . < br /><br />Oshii said his ulterior motive was homage to the " art " of eating food on the streets  something still considered a bit of a taboo in this country , and which goes some way toward explaining the use of " tachigui " in the title.<br /><br />The director of live - action movies ( Avalon , Stray Dog ) as well as animation , Oshii has often blurred the definition between the two mediums . The celluloid result here is deposited somewhere in the grey area between both formats.<br /><br />At times the visual experiment here is as exhilarating as it can be irritating . Just do n't ask what it 's all really supposed to mean ; Oshii 's films , which are equal parts cerebral and innovative , are often not particularly clear story - wise . Where Oshii succeeds is via a liberal dose of black humor  here you 'll find Kentucky Fried Rat , death by hula - hoop , the world 's fastest samurai burger chef  and in the movie 's very nature of surrealism.<br /><br />This is a man who defers to the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut , and perhaps owes as much to Andrei Tarkovsky as he does David Lynch . So it should n't come as any surprise that at one stage a B-52 bomber does a fly- through in a Yoshinoya look - alike franchise . The 54-year - old writer - director seemed to think this natural . " The Japan I depicted in the movie may not necessarily be faithful to reality , " he suggested.<br /><br />Of course . --------------<br /><br />By Andrez Bergen
1 A documentary without a loss for words ... ever ... <br /><br />Let us assume that the narration is more than a spoof , let us assume it is a commentary on Japanese society . And as this film is as fast paced an absurdist documentary as they come , the constant wordplay , as fast is it goes , and as poorly translated as it is-- in its current festival screener version as seen tonight at the Copenhagen Cinematek-- It is still quite enjoyable . < br /><br />But for the patient , and ONLY the truly patient and open - minded , I 'm talking to you Jim Jarmusch fans with ADD relapses , I believe this is a film for you . It 's an intelligent film if you allow it to win you over.<br /><br />Quite beautiful , and quite kitsch , and quite Japanese sub - culture . And quite experimental . Static 2D in a 3D world . All in all , Fun for those that want to see a Japanese film that spoofs Japanese food culture . A thumbs up if you 're in the mood for something completely different .
1 There is no director I like more than Mamoru Oshii . But sadly , even though he directed quite a few films that gained huge international attention , there are still a fair few of his films that have slipped through the cracks . Tachiguishi is one of them , and even though I loved it to bits , it 's not hard to see why distributors in the West are somewhat reluctant to release it.<br /><br />In between his big and serious films , Oshii is known to do some smaller and quirkier projects . While Tachiguishi definitely falls into this category , Oshii has really outdone himself with this one , creating something that is very hard to classify , even as a freaky Japanese flick . Go figure.<br /><br />At its very core lies a documentary not quite unlike Otaku no Video . But rather than make a fool of an existing subculture , Oshii invents his own and delves into the lives of culinary heroes , scrounging away food for free and upholding the Japanese culinary level . Oshii 's approach on the subject has close ties with Dai - Nipponjin , as the subject is handled with a deadly sense of gravity while the images on screen look as ridiculous as can be . Deadpan humor taken to the extreme.<br /><br />But that is not all , rather than simply shooting his mockumentary Oshii decided to make it using a new visual technique baptized superlivemation . A weird mix of live action , photography , digital animation and puppets on a stick . Performed and acted out ( or posed , if you want ) by the greats of the Japanese animation industry no less , as the project was supposed to be as low - budget as possible.<br /><br />And if you think that just about covers it , know that the film is extremely dialogue - heavy , making it a good companion piece for Innocence . The influence of the grifters is analyzed from all kinds of cultural , political and even philosophical angles , fired at the audience through a continuous stream of monologues and dialogues . And to make it even worse , the whole film is completely grounded in actual Japanese history and customs , making it even harder for a foreigner to get a good grip on the material . Needless to say , multiple viewings are advised to make the best of all the details tucked away inside the film.<br /><br />That said , on a conceptual level the film is easy to follow and already pretty hilarious . Various grifters are introduced as were they the most influential historical figures of post - war Japan . The film plays like you 'd expect a serious documentary of any other important figure to unfold , but somehow the big and crudely animated cut - out photography limbs of which figures are assembled do n't quite make it all that serious . The range of characters introduced is sublime , Shinji Higuchi taking the cake as cow - creature wearing a nose ring while taking on the fast - food chains with his gang of bull / people.<br /><br />Oshii regular Kenji Kawai provides , besides a pretty comical performance , a score ranging from atmospheric and dark to wacky , strange and comical . A lot of fun is to be had from the exaggerated noises and effects , complementing the animation and totally contradicting the tone of the rest of the film.<br /><br />Visually the film is very atmospheric , though it must be said that the animation is pretty scarce and while effective , remains toned down , only to burst out in hyperactive weirdness from time to time . Which is not exactly a bad thing , seeing how Tachiguishi is so dialogue - heavy . Despite that , the film is still a visual masterpiece as each frame looks absolutely lush and is tailored to match and improve the general atmosphere of the film.<br /><br />Beware though , because Tachiguishi does demand a lot from the viewer . If you do n't speak Japanese , there is a lot of reading to be done and there are many cultural references that demand some attention . On top of that , the monologues in the film area quite extended and can be hard to follow . The film still lacks English subtitles and even though my French was largely sufficient to get what it was all about , I 'm sure I missed many of the finer points of the film.<br /><br />Tachiguishi is not an easy film to get into , but around halfway through it reaches full steam and it does n't let off from there on . I still hope to see this one again with English or Dutch subs . A dub would actually be best for a film like this ( much like Container ) , though I guess a quality anime dub is a bit too much to ask for.<br /><br />With all of that said , I can only congratulate Oshii on another marvelous film . It 's rare to find a film that blends and mixes so many styles and influences to create something that is so unique and still works . The film is smart , looks and sounds great and is filled to the brim with creativity . It is immensely funny , even if you ca n't catch all the details on the first viewing . But be sure to at least get this with decent subs , as the automated English translation that is floating out there is completely worthless and does the film no justice at all.<br /><br />Tachiguishi caters to a very specific audience and I 'm not surprised the French got their release while the rest of Europe ( and the rest of the Western world ) is still waiting for a sign of this film . But for those that like Oshii , appreciate dry and deadpan humor and crave creative spirits , it is a film that can not be missed , even though it could just as well misfire . 4.5*/5.0 *
1 Yesterday I attended the world premiere of " Descent " at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC . I had a great time . It was sold out and attended by all the major stars including fellow my - spacer Marcus Patrick.<br /><br />I give the movie 7.5 starts out of a possible 10 stars.<br /><br />The movie begins with Maya ( Rosario Dawson ) at college . You can envision the typical college environment with wild parties and flirtations going on . The photography in this film was excellent . She meets Jared ( Chad Faust ) and they become sweethearts . It appears like any other relationship in the beginning . The man is in quest of the woman 's attention and affection and the woman is playing hard to get . Both played this well . Very innocent flirtation between the two . He invites her to his apartment and everything falls apart.<br /><br />The apartment is very dreary and dark . They eventually end up in the basement which is extremely dark and lit by numerous candles . This actually reminded me of a dungeon . Here is where he shows his true colors and proceeds to rape her . This is a very dark and gritty rape scene . This scene is not for the young or weak at heart . The rape scene is a little long and hard to take , but it is necessary for the rest of the movie that follows.<br /><br />Maya now starts to lose her soul to drugs and sex . She falls into her own abyss . She starts attending the wildest of parties and wakes up one morning in a room with no recollection on how she got there . She is told to go see Adrian ( Marcus Patrick ) . The first thing I remember about this character is that they say " he is the person who saves anyone who needs saving " . He is actually the one who introduces Maya to drugs . They begin a relationship of dependency which comes into play later in the movie . The club scenes at this point of the movie are photographed with extreme expertise . I thought they were well done and I noticed that the director of photography was applauded at the end of the showing during the credits by the audience.<br /><br />Maya is then back in college as a TA and who is in her class -- Jared her rapist ! ! You could see the confusion and emotion on Maya 's face . What should I do ? ? What do I do next ? ? The shots of her face and the emotions are priceless.<br /><br />What unfolds next is not actually what s happening . She acts interested in Jared . She appears to be looking to revive the relationship and be sweethearts again . I was sitting there saying could this really be happening . It was n't . Nothing could be farther from the truth.<br /><br />She invites him to her apartment and of course , he shows up . Now her apartment is dark and gritty . She has him strip down completely . He thinks he 's going to get " lucky " . She then teases him like any woman can . She 's caressing him everywhere and he 's getting excited . Note : : for anyone who plans on seeing this movie this scene is full frontal nudity - may not be right for the younger viewer.<br /><br />She then turns the situation around and she becomes the beast and proceeds to rape him . Once again , the scene is dark , gritty , and very rough.<br /><br />If you are going to see the movie and do n't want to know what happens next , skip this paragraph and go on to the last paragraph.<br /><br />This is where Adrian reenters the picture . Maya has Adrian save ( ? ) her by performing extremely rough male sex with Jared . She thinks this is the final revenge . Adrian continues to take all of Jared 's manhood and strips his dignity to nothing . Marcus , as Adrian , plays this scene as believable as anyone can . He is a strong actor playing a strong character and the strength comes out all over the screen . After the movie , during a Q&A session , Marcus explained that this scene required a lot of trust between him and Chad . Maya believes that this revenge will save her but I do n't think it does . One of the final scenes has a closeup of Mays 's face and you see a tear roll down her cheek . This was a fabulous closeup scene and evokes constant discussion from anyone who goes to see this movie . Did she get the revenge she wanted ? ? Was it as satisfying as she expected ? ? In my opinion , it does not . It only makes matters worse.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie , will well acted roles , and I recommend it to anyone who is thinking about going to see it . I would just be a little hesitant if under 17 years of age . Rosario , Chad , and Marcus should be commended for jobs well done . The directing and photography must also be commended . It was a night that I enjoyed .
1 First , this was a BRAVE film . I 've seen Irreversible and can understand the comparisons . However , I can not begin to understand the people who 've trashed this film . I can see how the end may have come off extreme but I 'd be lying if I did n't say I wished that every guy who 's ever forced a woman into sex deserved exactly what Jared got . Conversely , it did n't solve anything or make anything better and the fact that the film does n't pretend to is what made me appreciate it.<br /><br />The comment prior to this one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult would stick with . I certainly did and intently . I 'm 24 years old . The way the film drags made it realistic to me . People have become so used to eye candy and fast paced plots on screen that if you ask them to concentrate too long on one brick in the foundation of a film , not only do they lose interest , they demolish whatever has been built , and call it rubbish . When in actuality it 's their lack of patience and comprehension that needs fine tuning and not the product of a creative mind such as Talia Lugacy's.<br /><br />Rosario Dawson displayed the numbness of self - destruction flawlessly . I think she portrayed Maya pre and post assault with great ease and the transition between the two is an act I rarely ever see done well . Often times , much like the films " aimed at teens " mentioned in the prior comment , the effects of rape are displayed as either extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed , isolated and lifeless . Dawson , in my opinion , manages to perform the balancing act so many survivors fall prey to : drone - like existence in the waking hours , working some dead end job to survive ( and distract ) and then overindulging in vices in order to lose themselves in the haze of substance abuse rather than face what sobriety brings.<br /><br />I thought this film told the truth and I appreciated it for finally showing people a different side of rape . So many people let the end of this film devour the middle and the beginning ... I believe that Maya 's face during the act was the end ... not the act itself ... not the vengeance or the meaning behind it ... just her face ... <br /><br />thank you
1 I rented this movie simply because Rosario Dawson was in it . I sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats . Not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes , but because it was a real film . No Hollywood BS , no explosions , no corny one liners ; film . It drew you in slowly , reeling you toward a tragically human fate . Some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken . They like movies ; mindless entertainment for entertainment 's sake alone . Michael Bay 's Transformers and the like were produced for just this audience . No need to think people , just watch and allow ever stereotype we can muster to slowly dissolve your brain . We 'll even place advertisements throughout the movie , to keep you buying our products . And do n't forget the explosions , we all love explosions . Here we make the distinction , art can be entertaining , but it 's also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways . Entertainment is rarely artful and even then only arbitrarily . Movie are entertainment . Descent is a film . Film is art.<br /><br />If you still house a soul within your walking meat - sack apparatus , this rape scene is every bit as powerful as " Irreversable " . The distinction here is that " Irreversable " was a violent rape scene involving two people whose paths have unfortunately crossed at the wrong time and hell ensued . " Descent " is about date rape . No less disgusting . No less depraved . Just different . This is about trust violation , soul desecration and the scars that run deep . Had the character " Maya " been consenting it would have been a hot sex scene . But seeing as she was desperate to escape , the scene is sickening . " Jared " is a sick and manipulative serial rapist , and it 's wholly unsettling because it so closely resembles a passionate love affair . How could " Maya " ever be close to anyone again when even in the midst of raping her " Jared 's " slick lover boy facade only ever hints at slipping ? She is ruined.<br /><br />The film as a whole is beautiful . The camera work and lighting at times removes the surroundings and focuses everything on " Maya " and the silent inner workings of her mind . All this accomplished by Rosario with facial expression and gesture . The soundtrack was excellent , a blend of everything . My particularly favorite scene being a synchronism of all these film aspects working together ; " Maya " dancing in a sea of writhing bodies , something inside her awakening , becoming aware , all set to a beautifully sad Jeff Buckley tune.<br /><br />I do n't think I 've really spoiled anything here but I 'm stopping before I do . Bottom line , I think this was the best film of 2007 , hands down . Unfortunately it seems that everyone is so jaded these days that if you do n't hack and slash , gang rape , or nuke anything then people just ca n't be bothered . Death is n't the worst thing that can happen to you . It 's only the last thing that will happen in this existence . The worst things that happen never leave you . They are always in your thoughts . When you shower ; when you brush your teeth ; when you buy a Christmas present , when you tie your shoe ; they haunt you . They haunt you until that last thing releases you.<br /><br />Treat yourself . Challenge yourself . Watch this film .
1 A compelling , honest , daring , and unforgettable psychological horror film that touches on the painful experiences of pain caused by rape - " Descent " is a film that went under - the - radar due to its lack of distribution because , frankly , the film is so brutal in its depictions , that if it had been released theatrically , it may have met itself to some strong biased hate.<br /><br />The film deserves to be discovered for , not only its dark themes , and not only for its amazing direction and authentic style - but most of all for its performances . Chad Faust is absolutely stunning , bringing enough sickness and enough vulnerability to make one , not relate to , but understand this fractured man with a twisted perspective on his sexuality with not only the women he rapes , but also the fragile insecurities deep within his own self . It 's a supporting performance that is so complex , brave , and emotional on Faust 's part . And hard to forget.<br /><br />However , the standout is Rosario Dawson , whose performance here is an absolute revelation . A tour - de - force of realistic dramatic tics , and one of the most subtle , yet loud - as - can - be performances in quite some time . While Dawson is seen in some good supporting performances in some great - to - bad films , she proves here she has what it takes to deliver some emotionally sweeping and moving performances , believably and thematically.<br /><br />One of the best films of its year ( and 2007 was a strong one ) - had this underrated and intelligent film hit theatrical release , I would be screaming praises for it , as well as Dawson and Faust . Too bad it was way too blunt for a widespread appeal . Films like this deserve better !
1 This movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story . I too can not understand why people would trash this movie.<br /><br />If you are a Jerry Bruckheimer fan , this movie may not suitable for u.<br /><br />This movie presents high degree of realism . The actors and actresses ' performance is examplary . Not fake , just natural . < br /><br />No special sound.effects , so special side effects.<br /><br />The camera work is excellent , the music is oh so good . I ca n't wait to get the soundtrack.<br /><br />It leaves your body numb , like Constant Garderner . The directly has raw talent , certainly not a follower .
1 This movie is incredibly realistic and I feel does a great justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of a lack of experience . The many people who think they could fathom what goes through a victim 's mind are arrogant . As a victim , I feel that Dawson did a fantastic job in her role of Maya . I agree that this is an incredibly brave film . This looks at rape from a different , more realistic standpoint than any other movie I 've ever seen on the subject . The end did drag on a bit long , but I know that many victims imagine this kind of justice , since the chances of an attacker being sent to jail for their crime is around 1 % . It 's good to see a movie that sticks closer to reality than most would dare to .
1 Love Rosario Dawson , think she 's one of the finest actresses of the modern era.<br /><br />Descent seems to be more about self - empowerment than anything else . It 's the consistent undertone in everything in the film . The dialog is flat , the characters seemingly intentionally bland and one sided . The only consistency is the representation of self - empowerment in the characters and Rosario 's journey from self empowerment to loss of empowerment and back again.<br /><br />Pitching this as a rape classic is n't appropriate , and that 's probably why so many people do n't enjoy the film . The standard ' rape ' audience would n't particularly like this film , and maybe that 's the point ? The film asks more questions than it answers , and it does confront it 's target audience , whether they like it or not . There 's a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the film does n't slap the audience across the face with self - righteous audacity it does engage the viewer for what may or may not be , all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />Descent is a good film which IMHO is severely under - rated .
1 " Descent . " Yeah . Boy ... I have n't seen anything this powerful and scintillating since Bruno Dumont 's , " Twentynine Palms " ( 2003 ) . ( By the way this film is not to be confused with another fairly recent pic about the topic of " female empowerment , " " THE Descent " ( 2005 ) , directed by our Splat Pack friend , Neil Marshall , who also happens to be a major talent his own right . ) But getting back to this " Descent , " the NC-17 rated ( uh - oh ) effort on which the lovely Ms. Dawson takes a producer 's credit ( congratulations ) and directed by Talia Lugacy ( strong chance that 's not a real name ) , as good as it is ( in moments ) , it will not be appreciated by most lay people out there because the script is pretty flawed . As a producer , you really have to tighten up that script . Of course , in the premise alone , you have the promise of rising conflict , but there still lies the task therein of accomplishing rising conflict.<br /><br />At times , this thing plays like an interesting piece of experimental theater and , well , I guess I 'll let the others who 've already commented here speak to the boringness of it , namely that which occurs in the second act -but find me a second act that is n't boring ? There 's also this Catch 22 that goes along with these quasi - independent films like " Descent " in which Rosario happens to be attaching herself to and leveraging her " fame - identity " to get a script into production that would , under usual circumstances , not get made at all while at the same time she is basically a miscast in the film 's leading role . Rosario Dawson is gorgeous and , apparently , you can shoot this girl from just about any angle all day long , but , oh , wow - wee , how fast the time just slips away : Rosy ai n't no undergraduate no more . That 's part of the confusion about the screenplay : " Is she a graduate student ? A TA ? No , graduate students do n't really have these type of qualms with football players , do they ? " Again , if you are Rosario Dawson , Executive Producer , that 's the one of many , many aspects to the professional film process you 'll have to think about as you embark on this wonderful new role in your film career . And if you do n't have the answer to why you 're movie is n't convincing , let me tell you : there is a boatload and a bevy of vivacious , well - qualified , undergraduate aged talents , pining to get involved in the business , who might have nailed that lead character down , all the while , looking just as darn good as you know who ; but unfortunately without Ms. Dawson -no Honey , NO money . I have to say , the camera department did an outstanding job , however , because this film is really well shot ( i.e. lit ) in all its dreary / dreamy darkness . The nightclub scenes look wonderful ; one can tell all those music videos are starting to pay off and the play with time ... The shooting / framing is all quite excellent which makes the picture a rewarding watch.<br /><br />"Descent " is good not great . However , I have a feeling , thanks to NetFlix , this movie will find a life of its own . I hope this group continues making films . If you 're into experimental American film - making , cinematographic imagery of implausibly well formed college studs ( or male model drop - outs ) in their early twenties , or if you 're an undergraduate , just plain angry at the hormonally aggressive young men that comprise less than half of your American university , " Rosario Dawson 's Descent " might be your flavor of RockaRoll .
1 The film was very outstanding despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes . In reality things like this do happen and that is why this movie shows a lot of it . It all starts with Maya ( Rosario Dawson in superb performance ) whose recently started attending college has everything going well for her . She meets Jared ( Chad Faust in a terrific performance ) at a frat party who turns out to be a real gentleman and sweet . He invites her out to dinner . They look at the stars from a bridge and they end going to his apartment . They talk and takes her to the basement were they become flirtatious with each other . She tries to put an end to it , but he rapes her . This incident scars her . She goes to a club meets a bartender / DJ Adrian ( greatfully played by Marcus Patrick ) who sees that she is getting to drunk and helps before she goes to far . They strike a friendship . He also does drugs and Maya starts using as well . In other words introduces her to a different world . She starts going back to school and working as TA ( Teaching Assistant ) and spots Jared as one of the students . While the students are taking a Midterm , she catches Jared cheating . Jared tries to smooth talk Maya , but she still has the upper hand decides to invite him to her place . Will history repeat itself ? Or Will Maya have a surprise for Jared ? You watch the movie . Excellent A. Rosario Dawson portrays the role with focus and endurance . Chad Faust does not like he can be a rapist , but he does a terrific job as Jared . Marcus Patrick is very brilliant the man who saves Maya and coaches her into a new world . This film deserves an award .
1 Some genre films need to be dressed up . This one was an exception . Taken on its own merit , it 's a dressed down version of the horror genre film . With minimal special effects , it manages to be a psychological study of sorts , with a simple yet existential theme - who gets hit by the bus , and why her ? It 's not a great film , yet because there is little contrived about it , the story works . Subtle , and all about the interactions of the characters . Actually , there is one contrivance in the opening scenes , but it may have been placed there to simply set the tone for what 's to come . I very much appreciate the balance of male and female energy , and would not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than people reacting to a physical and psychological challenge . You will enjoy the film if you have some empathy , value the need for a bit of adventure in your life , and wonder " What would I do in this situation ? "
1 Letters with no destination end up in another world found in the back rooms of the post office . Here , Alice manages to land a job in hope of finding her lost father . What she does discover is the tormented soul of her boss , Frank . A quiet little Aussie flic that came and went at the cinema . Now you find it in the deep dark corner of the video shop , overshadowed by fifty copies of that dreaded GODZILLA film . It 's a shame because this turned out to be a satisfying film telling a brave tale with strong simple images and effective performances from the two leads . This film succeeds where Garry Marshall 's other dead letter office flic DEAR GOD ( 1996 - USA ) failed , and comes close to the brilliance of , not the Kevin Costner turkey , but He Jianjun 's POSTMAN ( 1995 - China ) .
1 This film is a wonderfully simplistic work . Enjoyable from start to end it is both sad yet uplifting at the same time . The performances from Miranda Otto ( oh , how she deserves so much more recognition!)and George del Hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch , as the two tortured souls come to understand each other . The supporting cast of workers at the Dead Letter Office are wonderful bit - parts in them selves , as is Alice 's long - suffering boyfriend , who I could n't help but feel slightly sorry for . There 's one particular scene I could watch over and over ( and I have ! ) , it 's such a shame that films like these do n't get recognition , and therefore bring them futher into the public eye for more people to enjoy . I cried , I laughed and I sighed . I 'd recommend this film to anyone .
1 If the Australian Post Office ever needed a promotional film for recruitment then this is it . This is one of those movies who 's heart is in the right place and you can watch again and again . Miranda 's performance is touching as it shows an aspect of Australia unimagined by many Europeans , in that it can be cold , wet and bleak , just like anywhere else and just like anywhere else what is important is the people that surrounds you . The characters in the movie are warm and welcoming and make the prospect of a career move into a ' dead letter office ' a thought to be considered . Miranda has gone on to do bigger movies , but I hope she always keeps a thought inside for this one ? .
1 I first saw this at a foreign film festival . It 's a beautifully paced nail - biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold . It 's all shot in a gritty , grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states beautifully ( note : Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there).<br /><br />There 's a lot of humor and some romance , too . I do n't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises , so I 'll just say this heist film starts from a great script , and the directing and performances are top notch . DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most nerve - racking example of its genre --- I 'd put it up against RAFIFI , TOPKAPI , and it 's miles ahead of the new OCEAN 'S 11 , though ( deliberately ) not as glossy . RENT OR BUY IT NOW .
1 This is one of those landmark films which needs to be situated in the context of time . Darkness in Tallinn was made in 1993.It was a period of chaos , confusion and gross disorder not only for ordinary denizens of Estonia but also for countless citizens of other former nations which were a part of mighty Soviet empire . It was in such a tense climate that a young country named Estonia was born . As newly established governments are known to encounter teething problems , Estonia too faced numerous troubles as some corrupt officials manipulated state machinery for filling their dirty pockets by making use of their selfish means . This is one of this film 's core themes . Darkness in Tallinn appears as an Estonian film but it was made by a Finnish director Ilka Järvilaturi . He has tried his best to infuse as many possible doses of Estonian humor . This is why one can call it a comedy film of political undertones . As ordinary people are involved in this film , we can say that this film signifies good versus evil . This is not a new concept as it is readily available in most of the religious books of different faiths . Darkness in Talinn shows us as to how ordinary governments can also be toppled by corrupt people . A nice film to watch on a sunny day .
1 Simply the best Estonian film that I have ever seen , although it is made by a Finnish director Ilkka Järvi - Laturi . Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold , a national treasure that belongs to the republic of Estonia . But at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time . In the early 90s Soviet Union fell into pieces and many countries , such as Estonia , became independent . Now the conditions may be better in most of those countries . But in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had left them as inheritance . ( And many of them still do ... at least on some level ... ) < br /><br />Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a well - written script . The actors are also very good , especially Jüri Järvet ( perhaps the best known Estonian actor , plays Snaut in Tarkovski 's Solaris ) , playing and old gangster who 's slowly becoming tired of his way of life . But the most astonishing performance comes from Monika Mäger , a child - actor playing Terje , a boyish girl in her early teens , whose presence in the plot is quite essential . ( and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb - credit list!!!)w < br /><br />There are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time . But Tallinn Pimeduses does that . Unfortenately Järvi - Laturi 's other films are far from this kind of achievements . His first one , Kotia päin was too artificial and his latest , History is Made at Night was just a weird mess .
1 I caught this at a screening at the Sundance Film Festival and was in Awe over the absolute power this film has . It is an examination of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers who join the military with hopes that they will protect and serve our country with honor as well as be taken care of by our government for it . The film details the psychological changes that takes place in boot camp as the soldiers are turned into " killers for their country " and put into the war and the after effects once they return home . It also portrays the effect that killing has on the human psyche . It pays homage to the Soldiers and never ever criticizes the soldiers unlike other films , instead criticizes a system that is not prepared to and does not take care of all the physical and psychological needs of the returned Vets.<br /><br />This film is powerful , moving , emotional and thought provoking . It stands as a call to arms to support our troops not only by buying stickers and going to parades but by actually listening to them , and helping to support a change in the way their health and well being is taken care of after the killing ends.<br /><br />The best film of the Festival so far , * * * * / * * * *
1 I saw this film premiere Friday ( 1/19 ) night in Park City for Sundance and was incredibly moved . Sitting in a theater and hearing first - hand the anguish soldiers go through was almost more than I could bear . Others in the audience were equally moved and while we wanted to turn away , the least we could do was bear witness as these men and women shared their experience with us . Robert Acosta , Paul Rieckhoff , Sean Huze , and Herold Noel , all veterans of the war in Iraq and featured in the film , were present . While they may be home now , you can tell this war is still inside them and probably always will be . Whether you support the war or not , it is OUR duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker . See this film !
1 I saw this film tonight in NYC at the Landmark Sunshine . I did n't know what to expect , I 'd not read much about it as I knew I would see it no matter what . All in All , it is very well done . It does n't focus on the generalization of " Anti - War " statements , which to me , left the politics out of it . The soldiers mainly spoke of their awareness of toxicity in their training in boot camp , and how hard it was once they returned to civilian life . It was really good to see Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia tell about the difficulty in surviving not only the war , but refusing the command to go back when it was against personal morals . Make no mistake - this is not an anti - war film . Anyone who says it is has n't seen it or is not living with the scars of war on their souls .
1 This film illustrates the worst part of surviving war , the memories . For many soldiers , men and women alike , returning home can be the beginning of real problems . I am reminded of my father and his brothers returning from WWII . For one of my uncles the war was never over . He survived the D - Day invasion , something akin to the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan . For him the memories not only lingered but tortured him . He became an alcoholic as did several of my cousins , his sons . Jump ahead 60 years and place the soldiers in a different war , in a different country , the result is the same . When I saw this at the KC FilmFest , I was reminded that there are somethings about war that never change . The idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in Iraq , and especially if you are against the war you will come away with more compassion for the soldiers there trying to do what they believe or have been told is right.<br /><br />The tag line from the Vietnam war film Platoon says it all . " The First Casualty of War is Innocence . "
1 That is no criticism of the film , but rather a comment on how blind we are to our own past . < br /><br />I recently watched Winter Soldier , and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or sequel-- except it was about Iraq rather than Vietnam . Similar to Winter Soldier because of it 's one - sided message , both films illustrate how gleefully we rush to engage in conflicts based on false pretenses , and allow our young and brave ( and often naive ) to bear the brunt of this greedy war profiteering . Both films effectively show that the mentality forced into the minds of the young and willing make them efficient killing machines , but the training falls woefully short of teaching the diplomatic and policing skills necessary to effectively win the hearts and minds of the people they 're supposedly fighting for . This is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam , and will likely lose the war in Iraq as well . < br /><br />My only negative comment is that the film is so one - sided it could be easily passed off as left- wing propaganda . Not by me , mind you , but by those aiming to discredit the film and message . A more balanced point of view would speak to a larger audience .
1 There is an episode of The Simpsons which has a joke news report referring to an army training base as a " Killbot Factory " . Here the comment is simply part of a throwaway joke , but what Patricia Foulkrod 's documentary does is show us , scarily , that it is not that far from the truth . After World War Two the US Army decided to tackle a problem they faced throughout the war ; that many soldiers got into battle and found themselves totally unable to kill another human being unless it was a matter of ' me or them ' . Since then the training process of the US army has been to remove all moral scruples and turn recruits into killing machines who do n't think of combatants as people . To develop in them a most unnatural state : " The sustainable urge to kill".<br /><br />First off , this is n't an antiwar movie as such . Whilst it certainly paints war in a very bad light , Foulkrod focuses rather on an aspect that does n't get as much media attention as , say , the debate over the legality of a war or it 's physical successes or failures ; the affect the process of turning a man into a soldier has on that person as a human being . It 's the paradox that to train someone to be a soldier to defend society makes them totally unsuitable to live as part of that society themselves , and whilst most of the examples and interviewees are from the current Middle East conflict Foulkrod makes the links to past conflicts , especially Vietnam , painfully clear . This is n't about any particular war , it 's about the problems caused by war in general.<br /><br />Structurally the film seems to be split into three sections ; how recruits are drawn into the army and the training they receive , how they are treated once they are in combat , and what happens once they leave the army . Once this point is reached you realise that the main target of this film is actually the policies that are inherent in the armed forced , policies that are put into place to make soldiers into an affective combat force but removing all humanity from the individuals . Those interviewed tell the camera how the recruiting process seems so clean and simple , how word like " democracy " and " freedom " are banded around , but once the training begins they become " enemy " and " kill " and " destroy " . How once in action soldiers do n't care what they are ordered to do , as they are ingrained with the idea that as soon as they carry out an order , whatever it may be , they are one step closer to going home . They have no political or social ideals to fight for but fight and kill as that 's what they 've been trained to do.<br /><br />But The Ground Truth 's main goal is to highlight the way the US Army discards those who have fought for their country once they return home . There is no real rehabilitation given to soldiers returning , and many are forced to go home unable to cope with what they have seen and done , and most policies in place seem to be to make sure the army has no legal responsibility whatsoever for psychological affects their soldiers pick up . This is the final indignity , that once they are used they are cast away.<br /><br />If there is a flaw in the film it is that Foulkrod does n't attempt to show another side to the argument . You would get the impression that every single soldier who ever went to war would come back with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome . It would have been interesting to see those of a   less liberal upbringing give their opinions of how the army handles training and policies . There is never a chance for the other side of the argument to make itself known.<br /><br />But other than that this is an expertly crafted documentary , and Foulkrod 's use of stock footage and music is perfectly utilised to get across a side of war that too often get s passed by when discussing the fallout of war .
1 The information contained in this movie is somewhat familiar to many who have been paying attention to the news lately . The Walter Reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job taking care of our injured heroes when they return.<br /><br />What this movie further shows is a truth common to all wars . The psychological trauma that soldiers suffer while engaging in war and the difficulty they have when returning to civilian life . They are not just changed or affected , they are different people and most do not know how to deal with that as they do not know themselves.<br /><br />Finally , this film shows what the military does to our young men in women in getting them ready for war and the policies and practices that they have to follow in prosecuting war that leads to all the psychological trauma.<br /><br />We have over 3000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion ; but we have many tens of thousands that will suffer lifelong physical and psychological trauma because of this war . It does n't matter what side you are on , it behooves you to know the cost of war to decide if we should be in that business . This film illustrates the costs to the men and women perfectly .
1 Do not expect a depiction of the " truth " . However , the accounts of these veterans of the Iraqi & Afghanistan wars demand thoughtful consideration . < br /><br />The major strength of the film is that it vividly portrays the words and war wounds of these vets and their post - war struggles to reconstruct some degree of normalcy and functionality to their lives . < br /><br />My major criticism of the film is twofold : it is one - sided and it advocates anti - war activism but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the military 's and Veterans Affairs ' programs for helping those who 've suffered and still suffer the traumas of war . These are NOT fatal flaws of the film.<br /><br />As a veteran myself , I know that the horrible aftermath of war is real , and these young men and women articulate it very well . These vets vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most veterans experience and that ordinary people need to understand because the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and disturbing .
1 I desperately need this on a tape , not a DVD , and soon!<br /><br />I have one nephew who is in the infantry but has not yet deployed , although he set to go to Iraq soon after December 2008 . I lost my beloved step son in Ramadi Iraq on 09 - 15 - 05 from an unmanned missile in a green zone . I have another nephew who is joining the army as soon as he graduates from high school this spring because he , like his older brother , has some idealized and romanticized idea about what serving in the military is . My stepson died after only 10 days in country and he never went out on any missions so my nephews have no way to reference any of the experiences shown in this candid documentary from any type of personal experiences that might have been conveyed by my now deceased son . < br /><br />There is nothing I can do about those who are in , or now gone , but I have one left that has not raised his hand and been sworn in YET . I desperately want him to do so informed , none of the others did.<br /><br />Pleases help me with this.<br /><br />The movie documentary The Ground Truth is the best visual reference I have ever seen . I need to somehow make my youngest nephew see what he is getting himself into before it is to late . BUT : ( do not laugh ) I NEED my mother to see this first . She must actually see and hear these men and women , not simply the idea of them , but the truth of what they will be immersed in , possibly forever . Then she will have the emotional determination to make my brother watch this film and once he has then he may then make his son , my youngest nephew , watch it too . Then , my nephew might begin to take this seriously . < br /><br / > ( ( ( is there another time when this will be shown on TV ? if so please tell me when ? ) ) ) < br /><br />However , my problem is , my mother does not own a DVD player , she still uses video ( is that correct ? with tapes ? ) So , I need to find a way for her to be able to watch this film . Can I purchase this from anyone in that form ? If not , is there any other way for me to get this in the form of a tape from anyone ? Is there any legitimate link from which I can pay to download it onto my computer and then transfer it to a tape . If so who would I contact . I will gladly pay for the privilege providing it is a legitimate link . < br /><br />Or , if you have any alternative ideas I will consider anything you can suggest.<br /><br />Please help me , I have lost one very precious adored and loved one already , I already know my oldest nephew will never be the same when he returns and I may loose him too . I can not loose three and the emotional toll for all of those that do make it back is too high a price to pay for every male child in my family of that generation . Please help me . I will happily call you , email me a number if that is the best way to get the needed information . Thank you so much for any help you can offer.<br /><br />Sincerely , Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
1 This shorter movie is the epitome the expected results when the imbecile runs the asylum . It is sad how the futures of these young people were rolled down a craps table when neither Saddam Hussein nor the people of Iraq , God rest the souls of the 350,000 plus that have been killed , had anything to do with terrorism nor al - Quida.<br /><br />Following this movie the astute viewer will need to pick up or download a copy of " Loose Change . " This movie is available free on the internet , until the Bush cabal locks it down , by googling - up the very title , as indicated in parenthesis.<br /><br />God Save our country . This will not be done by following the Christo - fascists that controlled the Halls of Congress for over 10 years prior to November , 2006 !
1 This movie is a must - see movie for all . Congress should see this truthful documentary from the point - of - view of the soldier , as should everyone in America . The previous reviewer totally missed the point -- the point is to reveal the truth about teaching our soldiers to kill people who are NOT terrorists , but who just live in our " enemy 's " territory , and what it does to the soldiers . We must support our troops by bringing them home IMMEDIATELY , before another person is killed or injured . This also reveals that the government does not help its veterans , those who are injured mentally , with ptsd- post - traumatic stress disorder , or physically , with lost limbs . Julie A.

1 Having Just " Welcomed Home " my 23 YR old daughter from a year in Iraq , Camp Anaconda medical support unit , I felt compelled to get this DVD . I wanted to hear other returning vets feelings in order to attempt to better understand her mentality on arrival and not waiting until after something bad happened . Regardless on your take on the war and peace this movie serves as a great start for all Americans to begin the healing of our returning vets emotional void . The paramount statement of the entire movie is " Take Action " on the problem . Incredibly emotional movie . I would highly recommend this movie to the vet the vets entire mature family and ask that they follow through with a plan to listen comfort help the returning Gulf War Enduring Freedom vets.<br /><br />Fast forward nearly one year later & My daughter has seen this DVD . Took account of her emotions and actually has made a commitment to re - up for another 6 years . Her take on her time spent in the sand is that she did some good . Local Balad children got first rate medical treatment for various common ailments not ordinarily able to afford free with an escort and translator . Her look over her shoulder at her Iraq tour was . " We changed some hearts and minds back there " Great DVD you have to keep an open mind and see all sides
1 The hip hop rendition of a mos def performance ( according to the film 's musical credits) ... it is an incredible piece of savage consciousness that slams the violence in your heart with each " snap " if anyone can tell me someplace this song , " Live Wire Snap " by Mos Def from " The Ground Truth " , an undeniable duty to see as the Americans who might not support the mission but embrace each soul caught inside this savage miscalculation of purpose ... they take on the haunting as so many of us can sit back and be angry ... <br /><br />"Live Wire Snap " by Mos Def , where can it be found < br /><br />desperate to find it : < br /><br />medically unable to serve
1 Before seeing this , I was put off by the subject matter , but this is not your average triumph over adversity story . Although this is technically about blind Tibetan kids climbing Mt. Everest , there is so much more to it . This movie shows the very strong , often contradictory personalities of two highly accomplished blind adults leading the children , Erik and Sabriye . Erik is an American blind mountain climber / athlete and Sabriye is a blind German academic who started a school in Lhasa Tibet . They are both exceptional in their own ways , but disagree on what will really build confidence in the kids . Erik wants them to reach the summit while Sabriye wants them to enjoy Erik as a role model and take pleasure in moment . The nuances are complicated and one walks away not really being sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea . The most profound scenes are with the Tibetan children themselves and the hardships they faced before finding their way to the school . The most moving for me was the story of Tashi , a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him . I could watch a whole movie on his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school , he is now running a successful small business with some of his fellow students . If you liked Spellbound or Murderball , you will love this .
1 I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival . I loved this , and not just for the obvious reasons . Blindsight is a documentary about a group of blind Tibetan teenagers who attempt to climb one of Mount Everest 's sister peaks . Now , this kind of thing is usually a ca n't miss . Inspirational . Moving . Pretty standard , right ? And even if the film were just that , I 'd still have liked it . But it was so much more . Blind herself , German Sabriye Tenberken established a school for blind children in Tibet , in a culture that sees blindness as a curse , as evidence that a person did bad things in a previous life . Many of the children at the school have been shunned their whole lives , and at best , are a burden to their families . As part of their education , Tenberken shares with them the story of American Erik Weihenmayer , the first blind person to reach the summit of Mount Everest . She sends him a letter inviting him to come and visit her students . Instead , he comes up with a plan . He 'll arrange an expedition for them to climb 23,000 foot Lhakpa Ri and provide all the guides and equipment . Sabriye finds six willing participants and this is when the fun starts.<br /><br />Erik 's team are mostly American , mostly male , and mostly sighted . As experienced mountaineers , they 're Type - A personalities , very gung - ho and goal - oriented . Sabriye is European , female , and blind , and the students for her are more than a " project , " no matter how well - intentioned . Additionally , the students are Tibetan , and not old enough or confident enough to always stand up for themselves . As the expedition unfolds , they become pawns in between the two adult " sides , " wanting to please both , while at the same time wanting to gain the confidence that comes from accomplishment . As an additional obstacle ( other than being blind , that is ) , they are speaking English as a second or in most cases , a third language , and struggle to understand and make themselves understood.<br /><br />When it turns out that none of the students have any climbing experience , and that some are much more coordinated than others , it begins to unravel Erik 's original plan for them all to reach the summit together . As both students and teachers begin to suffer the effects of high altitude , decisions must be made as to whether to continue on or to send some down the mountain . Among the effects of high altitude is increased irritability , and you can see how this feeds the conflict between the adults . At the risk of oversimplifying , on one side are those for whom the destination is all , and on the other are those who just want to enjoy the journey . I wo n't tell you how it all turns out , except to say that this was one of the most surprising and thought - provoking stories I 've seen in a long time.<br /><br />The film also weaves bits of each climber 's story into the narrative , and this was sorely needed , since once on the climb , the kids tended to keep their heads down and their mouths shut . With all the drama going on around them , that was n't surprising . The backstories are by turns charming and heartbreaking , and I found it very strange that I found myself closer to tears at the beginning of the film than at the end . This was contrary to my expectations , and another pleasant surprise.<br /><br />In addition to all the human drama to cover , director Walker and her small crew had to contend with the frigid and oxygen - deprived conditions herself , lugging equipment up the mountains and hoping it would n't break down . As with all great documentaries , the filmmaker was just lucky enough ( or smart enough , or prepared enough ) to be at the right place at the right time , and she 's captured a very special story that has as much to say about people who want to do " what 's best for the kids " as it does about the kids themselves .
1 This film was amazing . It is an inspiring piece of cinema . The characters are fully developed through the truth in which Director , Lucy Walker brings to the film . I highly recommend this to any one looking for that special film that shows the humanity in the human condition . Lucy Wlaker showcases the landscape beauty . This film i d a true example of man vs. nature and sometimes man vs. man . The inner turmoil and triumph is tremendous in its subject matter . The subject of how the Tiebtans view blindness as a sign of demons is interesting . This film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been showcased . Lucy Walker has given Erik Weihenmayer a voice when he would have not normally been heard . Thank you Lucy for being true to your vison as a filmmaker .
1 This interesting documentary tells a remarkable tale of an expedition to take blind Tibetan children trekking in the Himalayas ; but also of a personality clash between two remarkable people . On one hand , there is Erik Weihenmeyer , the first blind man to climb Everest , and the team of ( sighted ) mountaineers who are guiding the kids . On the other , there is Sabriye Tenberken , a blind woman who runs the first school for blind Tibetans , who agrees to the expedition but subsequently has doubts about how it is progressing . At some level , Sabine simply does n't understand the mountaineer 's philosophy ( with it 's emphasis on summitting ) ; she is probably right in identifying the mismatch between the mountaineers goals and the desires of the children but her certainty in her own correctness makes her a hard person to sympathise with , especially as she has an effective veto . In the background to this ( reasonably well - mannered ) clash , we get an insight into the lives of the children themselves . I enjoyed the film , although it delivers a message clearly designed to be uplifting - even though it details the quarrel , the film somewhat relentlessly asserts how amazing all those who feature in it are . But it 's hard to argue with that assessment , even if it is presented to the viewer somewhat unsubtly .
1 Just got out and can not believe what a brilliant documentary this is . Rarely do you walk out of a movie theater in such awe and amazement . Lately movies have become so over hyped that the thrill of discovering something truly special and unique rarely happens . Amores Perros did this to me when it first came out and this movie is doing to me now . I did n't know a thing about this before going into it and what a surprise . If you hear the concept you might get the feeling that this is one of those touchy movies about an amazing triumph covered with over the top music and trying to have us fully convinced of what a great story it is telling but then not letting us in . Fortunetly this is not that movie . The people tell the story ! This does such a good job of capturing every moment of their involvement while we enter their world and feel every second with them . There is so much beyond the climb that makes everything they go through so much more tense . Touching the Void was also a great doc about mountain climbing and showing the intensity in an engaging way but this film is much more of a human story . I just saw it today but I will go and say that this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen .
1 DOCTEUR PETIOT , starring Michel Serrault , is a brutal story about a brutal man . A doctor who heals the sick in occupied France , even if their ability to compensate is not there . Yet , he preys on the weakest amidst the populace . The imagery and cinematography are superb , and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story . He is the perfect psychopath . Seductive and altruistic , intelligent and caring , calculating and murderous . A movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer . Kudos to Mr. Serrault , for his chilling portrayal .
1 This is easily a 9 . Michel Serrault , known more for comic roles in the earlier part of his acting career , does a stunning , even worryingly stunning job of impersonating Dr Petiot , a legendary French serial killer.<br /><br />He is just so believable at every and any moment in the film , that the actor completely disappears behind the character - only the very best ever achieve this feat , and when they do it is only in a handful of parts at best.<br /><br />The whole story ( a real story which happened in 20th century France ) is so powerful , so sinister - it makes for a very strong film that one remembers for a long , long time .
1 I discovered this film after reading the book that inspired it . It is not a strictly biographical film ; it is " loosely based " on the facts . But I found it a compelling and eerie exploration of evil and madness , and Michel Serrault gives an unforgettable performance as Dr. Petiot.<br /><br />There are many memorable images in this movie ; Petiot traveling through the night like a vampire , his black cloak flapping behind him , is almost iconic . There are also several touches of expressionism - Petiot 's crooked silhouette mounting the stairs leading from the cellar where the butchered remains of his victims await cremation , reminds me of some scenes from ' Nosferatu'.<br /><br />But I found the primary appeal of this movie to be aural . The soundtrack is loaded with ominous sounds , starting with the foreboding music of the opening credits , accompanied by wordless wailing . Petiot lives and runs his medical practice in a complex with many small shops , and there is a persistent background noise of knives being sharpened somewhere , as well as a peddler playing eerie tunes on a saw . There are animal noises as well - the concierge keeps a goat , unseen cats howl - and later in the film we see hapless cattle being herded through an underpass . The whole atmosphere is unsettling , with overtones of violence and slaughter.<br /><br />Not only animals , but human voices are often heard - the screams of Gestapo victims , Petiot 's patients in his waiting room , monitored by a listening device , just the same as the suspected collaborators after the war are monitored in their cells . Even the action of the film is often arranged so that we hear the voices of the participants without seeing them - when Petiot goes to see Mme Kern , we hear her singing as she works , her voice echoing in the theater , before we ever see her . And even when she does appear , she is often filmed from behind , her voice calling out to her husband , whose voice calls out to her in conversation . Disembodied voices echo in large halls , and their owners , when seen at all , are photographed at a distance , so we can not actually see them speaking . This is a ghost story , and these are the voices of ghosts - many of them Petiot 's future victims.<br /><br />Yet Petiot himself is often only a voice ; his frightening laughter echoes as he retreats from the camera , throwing comments behind him or into the air to nobody . In a way , he is as much a ghost as those he murders . He is always frantically busy , scurrying from appointment to appointment , never at rest . But his activity is that of a machine - lifeless and imperturbable . It is interesting that among all the horror and danger of occupied Paris , Petiot alone is unafraid ; he is amused , enthusiastic , angry , irritated , contemptuous , but never afraid , unlike those real people he lures to their deaths . It is no surprise that he boasts of his mechanical inventions , including a perpetual motion machine ( a true detail from the book - he did claim to have invented many machines ) ; he is a sort of perpetual motion machine himself . And mechanical imagery is everywhere in the film , from the opening giant wheel in the movie house , to Petiot 's bicycle ( with its squeaking wheels echoing the sound of sharpening knives ) , to the Victrola he keeps winding up to play music before he makes a kill . Even his routine with his victims is mechanical - write a note to your wife , let me disguise you before you leave , you need a vaccination , Barcelona , Casablanca , Dakar - like a well - oiled machine , the routine is always the same , just as the record is always the same.<br /><br />Maeder , the author , says that it was the clockwork perfection of his crimes that weighed so heavily against Petiot at his trial . His system was as smooth and efficient as a Nazi concentration camp , and this may be why the movie invents a subplot of Petiot 's involvement with the French Gestapo and the occupying Nazis . Unfortunately , it does n't quite work as part of the story , because it 's very hard to figure out just what Petiot is doing for the collaborators , or what is going on when he ends up at their headquarters in the middle of the night . Disposing of bodies ? Hiding stolen goods ? It 's hard to say , and harder to believe ; it 's not likely the state would turn to a freelancer like Petiot.<br /><br />But it does remind us of the duality of evil people ; Petiot is a robber and a murderer , but he is also a devoted father and husband . Just as we learned that Hitler loved dogs , and that Nazis guilty of the worst war crimes could also be loving fathers and family men , so we have to recognize that Petiot could commit unspeakable horrors and yet also function normally . His insanity is easily camouflaged by the insanity and horror of the wartime situation in Paris ; when killing , robbing and disappearing are happening all around , nobody pays attention as Petiot tosses more corpses on the pile .
1 North Africa in the 1930 's . To a small Arab town on the edge of the Sahara comes a beautiful woman looking for meaning to her life & a handsome Trappist monk fleeing from his crisis of faith . They will meet and passions will be stirred , but not even the Sand Diviner knows if they will find happiness or sorrow , here , in THE GARDEN OF ALLAH.<br /><br />The plot is pure hokum , but the film is still great fun & beautiful to look at . Marlene Dietrich & Charles Boyer are a superb screen couple . She is , to put it simply , gorgeous , and Boyer gives a most effective , understated performance , letting his sensitive face do much of his acting for him . < br /><br />The supporting cast is excellent : Basil Rathbone , in a sympathetic role as a Count who loves the desert ; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly , talkative guide ( all the " Arabic " he & others speak in the film is pure gibberish ) ; Lucile Watson as a gentle Mother Superior ; Alan Marshal as an honorable young French officer ; Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer ; Henry Brandon as a comic porter ; John Carradine as the mysterious Sand Diviner ; and magnificent Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest.<br /><br />Movie mavens will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun ; Marcia Mae Jones & Bonita Granville ( peeking over the nun 's shoulder ) as convent girls ; gaunt Nigel De Brulier as a monastery lector ; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel clerk , all uncredited.<br /><br />Color films of the 1930 's are both rare & lovely to look at , and this movie is no exception - the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself . THE GARDEN OF ALLAH was the first Technicolor film to be shot on location . Yuma , Arizona gave the film makers all the sand dunes they could desire , but contaminated drinking water & 135 degree heat soon had the company in revolt . When the daily rushes showed Boyer 's face had burned a bright tomato red , producer David O. Selznick finally gave in . The remainder of the film was shot on a Hollywood sound stage .
1 I give this movie an A+ for the sheer camp of it ! As Dietrich 's daughter Maria Riva wrote in the book on her mother , " If one sees The Garden of Allah in the context of high camp , it can be very amusing . " And how ! I laughed with delight at the overwrought score and the astoundingly , ridiculously , fantastically melodramatic dialogue . Viewers who 've read the accounts of Boyer 's toupee ( it kept coming unstuck in the heat ) will snicker every time it makes an appearance.<br /><br />Dietrich and Boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines -- instead they gaze dreamily off into the distance , presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light ( if you 're starring in a turkey might as well look good ! ) . Dietrich 's costumes are out of this world . As Riva notes in her book , Dietrich managed to steal Paramount 's Travis Banton and have him design some of the most divine gowns , such as the chiffon beige dress & cape.<br /><br />I heartily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the Technicolor . It really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936 -- the color is fantastic.<br /><br />In short , if you watch The Garden of Allah with a lenient attitude and embrace its silliness , you ca n't help but enjoy it .
1 Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty film . The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life . Truly gorgeous cinematography and sets , and yes Dietrich 's bottomless trunk of clothes are also fabulous . She look great ; Boyer looks young and trim.<br /><br />Story of a woman seeking meaning and an ex - priest seeking life seems pretty stale , but set against such unreal sets and skies it somehow works , given the two stars , the terrific score by Max Steiner , and a good supporting cast . The film runs like 76 minutes and seems badly edited , plus certain characters just appear or disappear.<br /><br />Joseph Schildkraut is funny as the Arab guide , C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest , Lucile Watson the mother superior , Tilly Losch the dancer , John Carradine the diviner , and Basil Rathbone plays .... well I 'm not sure . He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything ! As others have noted , John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich . I ca n't help but think he would have been wonderful . The role of world - weary Boris would have suited the great Gilbert quite well . And after the success of Queen Christina ( with Garbo ) , his career might have gotten back on track.<br /><br />I ca n't think of any other 30s film Dietrich did in color . She looks great and wears some terrific clothes . My favorite is the Valentino as The Shiek - like outfit she wears by the pool.<br /><br />Certainly worth a look for the lush sets and color and the two great stars .
1 In terms of visual beauty this movie is outstanding ! I had no idea that Technicolor came out so early . Although I did n't like the ending , the entire movie is fantastic and makes me wish that I was in North Africa . The cast is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so alluring and I just loved her in this flick . Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie . I could n't get over the scenery and the sets ... The hotel , the palm trees , the desert , it 's all there ... the legionnaires also bring a " Beau Geste " feeling to the film . They certainly do n't make movies like these anymore . Do n't fail to watch this classic !
1 " The Garden of Allah " was one of the first feature length , 3-strip Technicolor films . To correct a previous poster the first Technicolor feature ( after Disney 's 5-year exclusivity deal ) was 1935 's " Becky Sharp " which was a costume drama that used the color for it 's garish color costumes.<br /><br />"The Garden of Allah " looks as if it could have been shot years later as the cinematography uses not only the color but also the use of shadows . It must have been amazing for an audiences at the time to see a color feature after seeing basically only black and white films for their whole life . Unfortunately , the film does not stand up to the cinematography . That being said , the film is worth seeing just as a visual treat .
1 Audiences back in 1936 must have been stunned at what they were watching : a full - fledged , beautiful full - length Technicolor film . I ca n't say for sure , but this might have been the first one ( 3-strip ) . At any rate , it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on DVD . In fact , just how good it looks is amazing.<br /><br />Kudos for that have to go out to Director Richard Boleslowski , Director Of Photography Virgil Miller , Selznick International Pictures and , for the DVD - MGM Home Entertainment . All of them combined to give us one of the best - looking films of the classic - era age.<br /><br />I thought the story was so - so : excellent in the first half , stagnant in the second . It gave a nice message in the end , even though a lot of people might not have been happy with it . I ca n't say more without spoiling things.<br /><br />Marlene Dietrich never looked better , I do n't believe , and certainly never played such a soft - hearted character ( " Domini Enfilden " ) . Heart - throb Charles Boyer was the male star and Domini 's object of affection , but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me . People like Joseph Schildkraut as " Batouch ; " John Carradine as " The Sand Diviner ; " The most memorable , to me at least , was the dancer " Irena , " played by Tilly Losch . Wow , there is a face and a dance you wo n't soon forget ! I 've never seen anything like it in the thousands of films I 've viewed . Just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the DVD . Looking at her IMDb resume , she was only in four movies , but they were all well - known films.<br /><br />Basil Rathbone , the actor who really became famous for playing " Sherlock Holmes , " also is in here as is C. Aubrey Smith , another famous British actor of his day . Schildkraut , by the way , will be recognized by classic film buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit , " The Shop Around The Corner , " with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan.<br /><br />The beautiful direction , photography and color , and Tilly 's dance , are the things I 'll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and not - so - good things all rolled into one . Had the last half hour been better - although I admire the ending - I would have rated it even higher . It 's definitely one film collectors want to add to their collection .
1 Gorgeous Techicolor production telling the unusual tale of the romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a Trappist monk who has left his monastery , breaking his vows . The film opens at a convent in Europe , where a former student prays - a lonely beauty in black named Domini ( Marlene Dietrich ) . She is advised by the Mother Superior to go to the desert and " find herself " , and lose her grief over her father who has recently died . In the train car on the way into the Sahara she sits opposite a very , very troubled man ( Charles Boyer ) - our former monk . She 's soon at a hotel near a palm - treed oasis where she again sees our mysterious troubled man as he is stumped over what to do when confronted by a very seductive dancing girl . Domini becomes friends with him , though knows nothing of his past - romance soon to follow.<br /><br />This film is sentimental , melodramatic , and different ( in a way , almost surreal and even a bit campy ) - I found it to be quite fun and entertaining . The photography in this is really interesting - it is full of extreme facial close - ups and beautiful color shots of caravans of horses crossing the desert , silhouetted figures against a sunset sky . Marlene Dietrich gives a nicely done , though restrained , performance here and looks gorgeous . Charles Boyer - not usually one of my favorites - is actually pretty good in this , I think the part sort of suits him and he looks quite young and handsome too . Basil Rathbone is fine here , except given very little to do . Another great orchestral score by Max Steiner helps keep the drama rolling - all in all , a very enjoyable film .
1 " The Garden of Allah " is a prime example of " popular women 's literature " , turn of the XXth century style , combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism and the sado - masochistic bite of Catholic guilt . Just as Jane Eyre could n't really be happy until her castle burned down around her and her lover was permanently maimed for his sins , or the heroine of " Rebecca " could n't find true fulfillment in her marriage until her lordly husband was put on trial for the murder of his first wife ( and her castle burned down around her ) , or poor Psyche could n't leave well enough alone and had to extract Cupid 's secret at all costs , Domini , the devout Catholic heroine of this piece of tripe , can only find true sexual realization by inadvertently marrying a man who has renounced his sacred religious vows . Like all such narratives aiming to stimulate the female reader and induce the vapours , this one relies on the oldest tricks in the book : basic misunderstandings and the inability to express one 's true feelings at the right place and at the right time until it is too late . The logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be indulged in as long as one is willing to eventually pay a high enough price for it in atonement in the last act . It is Paul Claudel reduced to beauty salon magazine standards . Oh well ... It could have been much worse and it often was ... <br /><br />Without the religious overtones , the film 's plot is that of your basic porn flick : Oversexed monk driven mad by abstinence escapes to the desert where he has a few rolls in the dunes with a romantic , shapely but naive Catholic heiress before reintegrating his monastery , all passion spent , leaving her to clean up his mess . And I really resent another commentator 's comparison with Anatole France 's " Thais " , a sophisticated novel whose intention was to make fun of the whole concept of Catholic sexual repression , some of which transpired in Massenet 's opera of the same name , thankfully.<br /><br />But what makes this picture unique in the annals of commercial female eroticism , of course , is the enormous constellation of talents gathered under one banner to make this cinematic wet dream come to shimmering , vibrant life . Imperishable Technicolor photography that will outlive us all , a truckload of worthy character actors ( including one cute dog ) , a music score by Max Steiner that seems determined to accomplish the " composed film " that Michael Powell ( who , ironically , had a bit part in the 1927 silent version ) always dreamed about , tittering at times on the brink of dissonance but always coming through in splendid symphonic , operatic exoticism , a dream - like atmosphere where material considerations are no object , characters travel as if by magic from one spot to the next , dialog is sparse , vague and suggestive , the art direction is close to celestial , flower arrangements appear in the humblest hut or tent , the heroine 's wardrobe is inexhaustible and all the male characters are either aristocrats , saints , doomed but horny sinners , mystics or poets.<br /><br />Ahh ... Hollywood ! The MGM DVD presentation of this film is bare bones but impeccable . The bit rate is very high throughout , the colour registration is almost always perfect and the 2.0 mono sound truly does justice to Max Steiner 's score and to Boyer 's penultimate confession.<br /><br />A historical note on this sort of " women 's subject " : The following year ( 1937 ) , Julien Duvivier , visibly inspired by " The Garden of Allah " , directed " Carnet de Bal " , where a very similar clothes - horse butter - won't - melt - in - her - mouth heroine ( widowed after taking care of an ailing husband in the exotic remoteness of some impossibly romantic Alpine lakeside villa ) wants to discover what she has missed by looking up the male dancers in her first dance book . She finds them all in time , only to realize that whatever feeling there was at one point between her beaus and herself were either misunderstood , overestimated or else had lifelong tragic consequences . It was Duvivier 's cynical way of telling us to beware of impossibly idealistic notions and that we all need to grow up sooner or later .
1 The pioneering Technicolor Cinematography ( Winner of Special Technical Achievement Oscar ) is indeed enchanting . Add an endless variety of glamorous costumes and a romantic cinema dream team like Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer , and you 've got a rather pleasant " picture".<br /><br />Unfortunately the contrived plot as well as the over - blown acting leave much to be desired . Still , there have not been any more breathtaking Technicolor films before this one ( 1936 ) , and very few since then , that can top this breathtaking visual experience of stunning colors . Cinema fans who have enjoyed the glorious color cinematography in " Robin Hood " ( 1938 ) , " Jesse James " ( 1939 ) and " Gone With The Wind " ( 1939 ) , will not be disappointed in the fantastic work done here . " The Garden Of Allah " will always be synonymous with brilliant color cinematography .
1 Domini Enfilren ( Marlene Dietrich ) has spent most of her life caring for her father . Now that he has died she is free -- but does n't know what she wants . Boris Androvsky ( Charles Boyer ) is a monk who has fled a monastery to taste more of life . They meet accidentally in Algiers , fall in love and get married . But he ca n't leave his past behind and she ca n't live without him ... <br /><br />WAY overdone romance full of hysterically bad dialogue and situations . Dietrich and Boyer do their best to give good performances but NOBODY could get away with some of their lines ! Still , in a way , it is a classic . It 's shot in gorgeous Technicolor ( try to see it on DVD ) where every frame is breath - takingly beautiful . Dietrich is always dressed to the 9s ( even in the middle of the desert ) and strikes hysterical poses to show off the clothes and her body . Boyer just walks around looking stricken ( no shock there ) . Still I was never bored . It was wonderful to look at and the non - stop stupid dialogue kept me in stitches . The end almost had me falling out of my chair because I was laughing so hard ! Now I love corny romances and give them plenty of space but really --- this is unbelievable ! It also runs a very short 80 minutes.<br /><br />As a camp classic I give this an 8 . As a serious movie -- a 1 .
1 This was Eddie Robinson 's 101st film and his last , and he died of cancer nine days after shooting was complete . All of which makes his key scene in the movie all the more poignant.<br /><br />Although some of the hair and clothing styles are a bit dated ( also note the video game shown in the film ) , but the subject of the film is pretty much timeless . Heston said he had wanted to make the film for some time because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation.<br /><br />Several things make this film a classic . The story is solid.<br /><br />The acting is top - notch , especially the interplay between Heston and Robinson , with nice performances also by Cotten and Peters.<br /><br />The music is absolutely perfect . The medley of Beethoven , Grieg , and Tchaikovsky combined with the pastoral visual elements make for some truly moving scenes . This was the icing on the cake for the film.<br /><br />And the theme ( or the " point " ) of the film is a significant one . Yes , it 's a film about overpopulation , but on a more important note it 's a cautionary tale about what can go wrong with Man 's stewardship of Earth . It 's in the subtext that you find the real message of the film . Pay attention to what Sol says about the " old days " of the past ( which is our present ) , and note how Thorn is incapable of comprehending what Sol is saying.<br /><br />This film is one of my top sci - fi films of all time .
1 I saw Soylent Green back in 1973 when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years on T.V. or video . It was always one of my favorite sci - fi and/or Charlton Heston films.<br /><br />Recently , the Egyptian theater in L.A. had a twelve film Charlton Heston retrospective . I flew in from out of state to see six of the films over a two day period . Soylent Green looked great on the large Egyptian screen with a perfect new print . From its opening montage to the going home scene to the great ending the film was fantastic.<br /><br />Charlton Heston as a cop who lives in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and no understanding as to how the world used to be and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great.<br /><br />Their chemistry together is wonderful . The film also looks so much better in a great 35 mm print . Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen , and the cinematoraphy , writing , music used , and everything about it works . The film is also very powerful in its bleak and very possible view of the future . Just think how the world population grew , the rain forest that disappeared , resources used up , green house effect getting worse since 1973 . I just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years . Its reputation should be better.<br /><br />Speaking of reputations , often people speak as if Charlton Heston is not a great actor . Seeing him in El - Cid , Soylent Green , The Warlord , The Omega Man , Will Penny , and Major Dundee back to back I am convinced he is one of our best actors . Of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are.<br /><br / >
1 Soylent Green IS ... a really good movie , actually.<br /><br />I never would 've thought it . I do n't really like Heston in his sci - fi efforts . He 's one of those actors who , like Superman , manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time . I prefer more vulnerable heroes . And indeed , he sneers his way through much of Soylent Green , too , but as he 's supposed to be playing an overconfident bully I do n't really mind.<br /><br />I can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie . Soylent Green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals ( what do you know - it looks just like 1973 ) , and it 's lacking in action . But I admired the film 's vision of a complex , corrupt , and highly stratified society , and I was so pleased to see that Edward G. Robinson had such a moving , funny final role . Nice little character moments - like when he shares some precious food with Heston - really make the movie.<br /><br />The message of Soylent Green is pretty relevant these days , when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to . Funny , is n't it , to see Heston in a prototype Michael Moore movie ...
1 Very interesting . The big twist was n't as big a shock as maybe they had hoped for and it was very dated but it did get my mind working . It really got me thinking about a world without vegetation or livestock and made me appreciate the world I live in a lot more . Charlton Heston does a good job , as do all the supporting characters , and it was a very realistic film which was surprising . It lacked direction at times and a lot of the settings and background needed more explanation but it was still a surprisingly good and intelligent movie . The main fault that I could find was that I did n't want the film to end when it did , I would have liked to see what happened next.<br /><br />7/10
1 This is a brilliant sci - fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film . I have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant -- while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid ! This is the only movie I know of that has such polarized views based on gender . Perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots -- but whatever the cause , I have always found this difference fascinating.<br /><br />The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by Charlton Heston . This is set in the near future and the head of the huge international Soylent Corporation has been assassinated . As the film unfolds , you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future American society . The rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buy(including " furniture "-- a euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment ) . At the same time , the masses are dirt poor , unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways . Overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed ! < br /><br />Why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with I really should NOT discuss -- it could ruin the film for you . However , the film has a great plot and acting and is super - exciting to watch . Plus , it features Edward G. Robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to Heston . Though not for the easily depressed or squeamish , this is a great sci - fi film that is allegorical and profound .
1 I watched this film sort of by accident , having bought it as the B side on The Omega Man DVD . The Omega Man was a bit of a disappointment - except for the beginning , which was clearly the inspiration for 28 Days Later , the rest of it is just the stuff of TV movies . But Soylent Green is in a whole other league . I bet this is one of Tarantino 's favourites . There are at least 3 scenes in the film that I 've never seen anything like before . Heston casually getting into bed with the " furniture " while discussing something else completely unrelated ! A whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers ! A priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor . Ok maybe that 's been done since - but there are n't many films that are so consistently original like this . And what the heck is going on between Heston and Edward G. Robinson ? Is this the most unlikely gay couple ever , or what ? Luckily , I saw this film without knowing the ending - which apparently is rare . Then I watched it again , and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile . A very nice script - and some great sets too . Just when you thought you 'd seen everything . . .
1 The only other film besides Soylent Green that has such an air of hopelessness is On the Beach . Both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms . On the Beach with nuclear war and Soylent Green with the environmental poisoning of the planet.<br /><br />Maybe there 's cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we have n't reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now . New York City still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in Soylent Green . Environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming . For myself it also shows the Right to Life ethic run amuck . Obviously there 's no family planning in this world either.<br /><br />Charlton Heston is an NYPD detective who lives with room mate Edward G. Robinson who 's old enough to remember the Earth before catastrophe struck . There 's been a murder committed , Joseph Cotten an executive with the Soylent Corporation , a multi - national concern that has come up with a food product , some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world 's population . It 's latest product is Soylent Green.<br /><br />The investigation finds Charlton Heston getting his man , but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the Soylent Corporation and the future of mankind . As Heston shouts in the end that Soylent Green is made of people , that we 've become a race of cannibals , the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative . We 've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive.<br /><br />This was the farewell performance of Edward G. Robinson and in his memoirs Heston spoke movingly of Robinson even though they had differing political views . A few weeks after Robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia , he passed away in real life . Not many did , but Heston knew that Robinson was terminally and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them.<br /><br />Though the timetable was off , it does n't mean that the world envisioned by Soylent Green may not come to pass . Hopefully we 'll have not just the intelligence , but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening .
1 This was a very thought provoking film , especially for 1973 . At the time it was actually a huge box office success . After the 1970s it appeared to be forgotten , but its central messages were too important to disappear completely . It was actually at least fifteen years ahead of its time ... no one had ever heard of the ' greenhouse effect'before 1985 , and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely brought up.<br /><br />The sets and special effects might look a little outdated , but big money for sci fi films was a gamble in that period . If you look closely you will see everything usually makes sense . This is a message movie , not for zonked out star wars fans that ca nt sit through one minute of thought stimulation unless it contains a million bucks worth of explosions.<br /><br />This was also Hestons last good film , the end of his famous dystopian sci fi trilogy . After that it was all overblown disaster epics and big budget crowd pleasing trash . THis might not be the most amusing two hour movie ever made , and the ending might be creepy and depressing , but its hard to find any film producer with guts anymore who would tackle a subject like this .
1 As with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s SOYLENT GREEN has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is . Overpopulation means there`s too many people to feed ? I was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies . Stalin`s policy in the Soviet Union in the 1930s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was Mao`s rural policy in China which led over 30 million starvation deaths in the 1950s . And let`s not forget the great famines in the horn of Africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation . You might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on Earth , Hong Kong and Macau , have never suffered a famine in modern times . Likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn`t strictly down to overpopulation - it`s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside ( It`s a symptom of industrial progress - not of too many births ) so the image of the streets of New York city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughable < br /><br />But don`t be fooled into thinking SOYLENT GREEN is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because I consider this to be the best ecological film of the < br /><br />70s . It plays on the contempary audience`s knowledge of the world where Sol and Thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit , brandy and fresh meat . Thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky , puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line " If I could afford it I`d smoke two , maybe three of these a day " . But it`s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that`s memorable as Thorn gazes at the images of wild animals , flowers , running water and snow covered mountains , a world Thorn`s generation has never known . This is a very haunting scene which makes SOYLENT GREEN a very memorable film , combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of Edward G Robinson as the wise old Jew Sol Roth
1 The time is the future and for many not aware of it , that day is now . In this final movie for legendary actor , Edward G. Robinson , " Solent Green " becomes a landmark classic . Many a film buff and environmentalist believe this is our eventual history . The movie is taken from the novel entitled , ' Make room , make room ' but who 's working title was changed to " Solent Green . " The story concerns the Earth as it evolves into the future with the world 's environmental problems becoming nothing short of Catastrophic . The planet 's natural resources have been exhausted and basic food has been reduced to simple staples . They come in a variety of colors , such as Solent Yellow , Solent Red , and now ' Solent Green . ' However there are those who know the ' real ' ingredient in Solent Green and cringe at their own culpability and fear divine retribution . The first is a food executive named William R. Simonson ( Joseph Cotton ) . Upon his death , a dedicated police detective called Robert Thorn ( Charleston Heston ) seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide . Although corruption goes all the way to the top , it begins with Simonsons ' Bodyguard , Tad Fielding ( Chuck Connors ) and Security chief Donnovan ( Roy Jenson ) who target Thorn for a Waste Desposal Factory . Thorn 's boss , Lt . Hatcher ( Brock Peters ) believes his suspicions but warns him of those ' Higher and Hot ' who want the case closed , but Thorn will not risk his " Job " for an easy way out . What Thorn discovers marks him for death , but like the film , awaits a final warning . * * * *
1 The world of the 1973 sci - fi drama SOYLENT GREEN is what we could be seeing if we are n't careful . It is a world in which New York City 's population has topped the 40 million mark in the year 2022 . Overpopulation , air pollution , year - long heat waves , and food shortages are the rule . The only hope comes from a food product called Soylent Green . But what is this particular food stuff really made of ? That question is at the heart of this admittedly somewhat dated but still intriguing film , based on Harry Harrison 's 1966 novel " Make Room ! Make Room ! " Charlton Heston stars as Thorne , an NYPD detective who comes across the murder of a top corporate executive ( Joseph Cotten ) . As it turns out , Cotten was on the board of directors of the Soylent Corporation , the people responsible for all those food stuffs that the people have to consume in lieu of the real thing . Heston believes that this was n't just a garden - variety murder , that Cotten was bumped off for a reason . He gets a lot of help from his slightly cantankerous but very astute " book " ( Edward G. Robinson , in his 101st and final cinematic appearance ) , and a few timely reminders of what the world used to be like . What Robinson finds out about Soylent Green shocks him beyond all imagination ; but before he can tell Heston all of what he knows , he has himself euthanized . And when Heston does indeed find out the secret of Soylent Green ... well , that part has become immortalized into cinematic history.<br /><br />Under the very professional guiding hand of director Richard Fleischer ( THE BOSTON STRANGLER ; FANTASTIC VOYAGE ) , SOYLENT GREEN is a fairly grim but thought - provoking look at a Dystopian future that humanity might be living if we do n't curb our tendency to strip our planet of its natural resources . Indeed , this was a project that Heston himself had had in mind for filming as far back as 1968 , after he had struck gold in the sci - fi genre with PLANET OF THE APES -- a fact that probably gets lost whenever his ultra - conservative political philosophy comes up in conversation ( after all , SOYLENT GREEN is hardly a tract for unrestrained capitalism ) . Robinson , as always , is the consummate professional in his last role ; the sequence where he is euthanized ( as he looks at video of the world from a better era , set to the music of Tchaikovsky , Beethoven , and Grieg ) is quite simply heartbreaking . The film also benefits from solid supporting help from Chuck Connors ( as a very convincing heavy ) , Brock Peters ( as Heston 's superior ) , and Leigh Taylor - Young as the woman who tries to help Heston in his inquiries.<br /><br />It must seem easy these days to dismiss SOYLENT GREEN for being dated . But those who do it ought to think twice ; for this film 's world may end up becoming ours in actuality if we do n't watch what we do with what we have today .
1 NYC , 2022 : The Greenhouse effect , vanished oceans , grinding unemployment and scarcity of water , power and food .. and New York 's population has topped 40 million . This is a little gem of a picture , not least because a resource - depleted future is a reality for us 21st Century citizens . < br /><br />The low - budget opening titles of this movie are great : set to music , a low - tech ' tape - slide ' sequence composed entirely of archive stills from the dawn of photography right up to 1973 , depicts an unspoiled American pastoral developing into a polluted and crowded Hell in less than 2 minutes . Succinct and unambiguous , it 's truly memorable . Budget limitations are also behind rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraints , at odds with the story 's brilliant premise . The police station sequences are like an episode of some 70 's TV detective show , and the other interior sets look basic at best . The budget probably all went on trying to ' futurise ' the Soylent Executive 's ' Chelsea West ' apartment with state - of - the art goodies , meaning the other costumes are perfunctory , some establishing shots are bizarrely underpopulated and the daytime exteriors seemingly all shot through a smoke filter.<br /><br />The memorable scene where Sol and Thorn ( Charlton Heston ) share a meal of expensive and rare food neatly summarises their society : They enjoy real bourbon , lettuce , celery , tomato , apple , and beef , and we really sense their lip - smacking appreciation of someone else 's wealthy privileges.<br /><br />Robinson 's pivotal death scene , in which his character is willingly euthenased at a place called ' Home ' , depicts him immersed in images of the world 's once - beautiful flora and fauna as he remembered them , beautifully contrasted with the jaundiced Thorn 's dawning realization that the future has been bankrupted , among other horrors.<br /><br />This is one smart film , and its core message is as pertinent today as it was in the early 70s . Yes , I know we 're not eating the dead yet , but with our resource - sapping longevity , spiraling poverty gap , corporate global capitalism and unchecked habitat destruction leading to climate change , the lasting prediction of ' Soylent Green ' may come to pass .
1 Truly amazing film , the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening . A world vastly overpopulated , unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer , and all our natural resources spent . In this nightmarish degenerate society we have the great Charlton Heston as a likable film noirish style detective trying to fathom the truth behind a murder , opposite the film noir legend Edward G Robinson turning in a fine last performance.<br /><br />One of the images that will always stay with me from this film , is the masses of people that populate the stairwells and the way in which Thorne ( Heston ) has to hop through them every time he uses them.<br /><br />The movie 's use of music is note worthy too , although it contains no score in the usual sense , The opening theme is good , and the subsequent snatches of music we here in Simonson 's apartment , and especially the Beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic are outstandingly atmospheric .
1 Is this the future that awaits us ? An overpopulated , unforgiving wasteland with a hellish , unwanted existence ? This film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us , doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973 . Let 's hope that the world is n't going to end up like this ... <br /><br />Soylent Green is a wild movie that I enjoyed very much . It had likable characters , a semi - apocalyptic setting , a compelling and thought - provoking storyline , and the macho - est macho man out there : Charleton Heston . Richard Fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant , dirty feel . You 're almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants.<br /><br />The characters are wonderful . Charleton Heston , who has become one of my favorite actors , IS Thorn . The man created this role of badass , yet likable tough - guy . I could definitely put myself in Thorn 's shoes . He sees that something is n't right , but everyone around him either does n't listen ( more like paid not to listen ) or wants him dead . Edward G. Robinson ( in his last film , R.I.P. ) plays the lovable old Sol , who has had enough of this nasty place . Everyone else is great , especially Leigh Taylor - Young as Shirl , a piece of " furniture " that comes with the apartment in which she resides.<br /><br />The special effects are fantastic , even for 1973 . The Soylent Green factory , the futuristic apartments , and especially the " scoops " ( bulldozers that get rid of people ) were excellent . The polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty . The empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling.<br /><br />One final note is the ending , which even now still shocked me . It is gruesome , but if you think about it , it 's a pretty good idea.<br /><br />The Bottom Line : < br /><br />An excellent 70 's Science Fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy .
1 Soylent Green I found to be an excellent movie.<br /><br />If you like Logan 's Run you 'll like this.<br /><br />Yes the movie is old and there are no special effects and some of the acting can somewhat be best described as " cheesy " but the story is excellent.<br /><br />The story of how the world can be and its impact on society is very poignant.<br /><br />At the end the mystery was n't a mystery but the story unfolded in an easy at the right pace.<br /><br />It 's nearest modern day equivalent would be " Dark Angel " in terms of how the US is shown to be third - world country .
1 My evaluation : 8/10<br /><br />I like a lot this movie . Compare to today brainless movie ( just action and special effet and nothing new about ideas ) , " Soylent Green " ask to something that today does n't exist anymore : To Think.<br /><br />Well it would not a big surprise a day human eat " cookies " which are create with body of human . With all what happen on this planet , and to see how people are so indifferent to all , this kind of future is possible.<br /><br />Sure this movie take some age but the idea behind the movie is actual again . Rich at Paradise , other in the hell . Well a luck today they are TV and idiocy like " Reality Show".<br /><br />TV is a good wash brain . It 's pity to see that intelligence of human have not progress like technologies . Since writing all stop.<br /><br />If you like reality show this movie is not for you . If you believe all politician same too . If you do n't like ask yourself question about now and future well never look this movie .
1 Especially for a time when not much science fiction was being filmed ( 1973 ) , this is a terrific vision of a future where everything has gone wrong . Too many people , and nothing works . The only people who can live in comfort are the rich . It 's set in New York in 2022 ( I think ) , and it reminds you of your worst vision of Calcutta.<br /><br />I got to appreciate Charlton Heston 's acting after seeing him in Orson Welles ' Touch of Evil . He was ( maybe is ) capable of portraying a range of heroic or semi - heroic people . Here , he is torn between being a cop who is just a little bit corrupt ( taking rare food treats from the rich ) , and being totally corrupt ( actively condoning evil ) . < br /><br />The movie all seems to take place at night , and sweat is dripping off everyone , except in one of the rare air - conditioned apartments . Even though I had n't seen it before , I knew the famous ending ( which will not here be revealed ) , but the ending is certainly foreshadowed.<br /><br />Great scenes with Edward G. Robinson : going to the council ( made up of elderly Jews with heavy accents , so it seems ) , where the truth is revealed . And then going off to the Thanatopsis to check out.<br /><br />Gritty , pre - Star Wars dystopian science fiction .
1 Not often have i had the feeling of a movie it could be visionary . But clearly this movie has the seed of a premonition.<br /><br />We should not tend to be alarmists and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions of the moment . But , did n't we say this of " 1984 " ? Had James Orwell known the Internet becoming reality not long after 1984 ; In fact it was in 1994 ; he might have reconsidered writing his story the way he did . Hindsight rewarded.<br /><br />It does n't matter . What DOES matter is that we often regard ourselves as superior to our surroundings but indeed become emotional about a " love apple " when necessity knocks at our door . A snapshot of ourselves at old age.<br /><br />Whatever the time - line will prove to be for us , I know for a fact we have n't seen the beginning of it yet.<br /><br / >
1 This is a great movie but there could be more about Soylent Green . There should be more scenes of what they do to people . How people act in 2022 . I think it would be neat to see if all this does happen in the year 2022 and beyond . Even if you still know what the secret is it is a great movie . So go rent or buy this movie right NOW ! !
1 I 've seen tons of science fiction from the 70s ; some horrendously bad , and others thought provoking and truly frightening . Soylent Green fits into the latter category . Yes , at times it 's a little campy , and yes , the furniture is good for a giggle or two , but some of the film seems awfully prescient . Here we have a film , 9 years before Blade Runner , that dares to imagine the future as somthing dark , scary , and nihilistic . Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson fare far better in this than The Ten Commandments , and Robinson 's assisted - suicide scene is creepily prescient of Kevorkian and his ilk . Some of the attitudes are dated ( can you imagine a filmmaker getting away with the " women as furniture " concept in our oh - so - politically - correct-90s ? ) , but it 's rare to find a film from the Me Decade that actually can make you think . This is one I 'd love to see on the big screen , because even in a widescreen presentation , I do n't think the overall scope of this film would receive its due . Check it out .
1 In the ' 70s , Charlton Heston starred in sci - fi flicks of varying quality . " Soylent Green " is one of the better ones . He plays Robert Thorn , a detective in 2022 New York . In this future , most food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green . But when Thorn finds out the unsavory truth about this product , he finds himself on the run.<br /><br />I guess that it 's only natural that this movie should seem dated to us nowadays . But even so , it still brings up interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture . Also starring Leigh Taylor - Young , Chuck Connors , Brock Peters , Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson ( in his final role ) .
1 This movie came to me highly recommended by Matt Groening . Well actually I watched both The Simpsons and Futurama and it gets a mention in both so I figured " what the heck " . The film brings home a few " what if 's " that make you realise how lucky we are in this day and age where we take simple things like soap and water for granted . Interesting though that in the year 2022 men are still shaving with a single blade safety razor ! Nice that Those responsible did n't over load the film with unnecessary special effects , ray guns , etc . Some nice looking ' furniture ' once you figure out what that means . Remember , " Tuesday is Soylent Green Day "
1 Soylent Green is a classic . I have been waiting for someone to re - do it . They seem to be remaking sci - fi classics these days ( i.e. War of the Worlds)and I am hoping some director / producer will re - do Soylent Green . With todays computer animation and technology , it would have the potential to be a great picture . Anti - Utopian films may not be that far - fetched . The human race breeds like roaches with no outside influence to curtail it . We , as humans , have the option of putting the kibosh on the procreation of lesser species if they get out of hand , but there 's nothing to control human breeding except for ourselves . Despite all the diseases , wars , abortions , birth control , etc . the human race still multiplies like bacteria in a petri dish . Classic Malthusian economics states that any species , including humans , will multiply beyond their means of subsistence . 6 billion and growing .... that 's obscene .
1 This movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast , a gripping story with a chilling ending , great music , and excellent visuals without significant special effects . It is interesting to note though that , like so much science fiction , its predictions for the future do n't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted . That 's not to say we 're out of the woods yet , but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition . It shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics : " 1984 " , " 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( compare its space station with our International Space Station ) and Isaac Asimov 's " I Robot " ( positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990 's ) .
1 In this movie the year 2022 looks much like the seventies . This is amusing at first , but soon the viewer perceives how very different that decadent futuristic world is despite the appearances , how many things that we take for granted could become unavailable.<br /><br />Characters often interact in a peculiar way , with no tact or manners or respect . I believe this is intentional , not bad acting . After all , who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by 2022 an overpopulated city 's inhabitants behave like that.<br /><br />I did n't like most of the action scenes , apart the death of the priest : too cheap even for the seventies . The plot is n't too polished . But the great scenes and ideas - like the death of Sol , the way rioters and dead bodies are dealt with , the " furniture " - outweigh the shortcomings of this film.<br /><br />8 out of 10 .
1 " Soylent Green " is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70 's and still very persuasive even by today 's standards . Although flawed and a little dated , the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise ( typical for that time ) still feel very unsettling and thought - provoking . This film 's quality - level surpasses the majority of contemporary SF flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider classic . The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive , with over - population , unemployment , an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product . The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company . Charlton Heston ( in a great shape ) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent 's most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets ... The script is a little over - sentimental at times and the climax does n't really come as a big surprise , still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny . The riot - sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70 's cinema . Edward G. Robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there 's a great ( but too modest ) supportive role for Joseph Cotton ( " Baron Blood " , " The Abominable Dr. Phibes " ) . THIS is Science - Fiction in my book : a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity ! No fancy space - ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet .
1 In terms of the arts , the 1970s were a very turbulent era . In literature and the visual arts , it was the closing of a great fifty or sixty year period of creativity that has yet to be restarted . In music it was a decade that many see as a low point , due to corporate rock and disco . On television it was a Golden Age for situation comedies , from The Odd Couple to the Mary Tyler Moore Show to M*A*S*H to All In The Family , but in film it was even a greater period of creativity , in all genres , that saw the rise of the American auteur- directors like Robert Altman , Francis Ford Coppola , and Martin Scorsese- from the ashes of the old studio systems that had dominated Hollywood for over half a century . These directors wanted to craft literate , arts films for the masses , of the sort that had been staples in Europe since the end of the Second World War . Yet , the studios were trying to keep pace , with socially aware films of the sort not seen since the 1930s.<br /><br />But , unlike the films of the 1930s , starring actors like Jimmy Cagney and John Garfield ( usually co - starring the Dead End Kids ) , that dealt with social issues in a gritty realistic way , or as realistic as one could get on a sound stage , the social consciousness of the late 1960s and early 1970s manifested itself most in science fiction films , which allowed the Left Wing of Hollywood to preach to the masses under the guise of what most considered little above comic strip entertainment . There was precedent for this approach , for several of the flying saucer films of the 1950s dealt with the political zeitgeist of the McCarthy era- most notably The Day The Earth Stood Still and Invasion Of The Body Snatchers . And the early 1960s saw Rod Serling constantly subverting the political conservatism of the time by casting social issues into science fiction settings on his classic sci fi television anthology show The Twilight Zone . Among the studio offerings of this time were the ecologically sensitive Silent Running ; George Lucas 's first film THX 1138 , which dealt with consumerism , group think , and existentialism ; and Logan 's Run , which hammered away at Communism and state control versus the rights of an individual . Some of the film 's references are quite heavyhanded- and reek of the then current Arab oil crisis and rampant inflation . A few jarred strawberries cost $ 150 , and Soylent rations its assorted colored foods- Soylent Yellow , Soylent Red , and the new Soylent Green , reputedly made from ' the finest undersea growth , ' in a manner not unlike the gas rationing of the time . Scenes of food riots are eerie echoes of the oil riots at many gas stations during the year of the film 's release , and the scenes of crowding , and bodies , live and dead , lying all about are still chilling , as well as influential . A later film like Escape From New York is an obvious progeny . The rest of the script , by Stanley R. Greenberg , however , is rather pedestrian , and fairly standard for a dystopian flick , but Fleischer and cinematographer Richard H. Kline do a great job of filling the screen with interesting images and sounds , to spice things up . The use of soft , dimly lit visuals , murkily filtered , add a Stygian feel to the New York of the film , almost like a colorized version of Carl Theodor Dreyer 's Vampyr . The only light in the film comes from artificial sources , and were it not for the fashion faux pas the film could truly seem timeless.<br /><br />The end of the film , where Thorn sneaks into the processing plant where human corpses are made into Soylent Green wafers , is both chilling , and oddly drama - less . In the end , the Soylent minions hunt Thorn down , but he survives long enough to utter the film 's catchphrase to Chief Hatcher . Yet , one does not know if it is enough , for Hatcher has already been co - opted , and has a track record of taking the easy way out . Yet , that fact , and its ambiguity , shows that the film does not recapitulate its characters ' dilemmas , and has a depth many later , better made films , sci fi or not , do not have . It is also why Soylent Green is still a film worth watching .
1 Its time to pay tribute to the great Charton Heston after his recent passing but this film is not the one . His other films of a past generation were BEN HUR , THE TEN COMMANDENTS , OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES were his better works.<br /><br />This film made in 1973 attempts to prophesies a future earth , in 2022 , that is so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by authorities to eat a universally produced food product called " Soylent Green " which is manufactured with Human flesh . This bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assumes India 's population which would be about 2 billion by that stage would be then meat eaters without knowing it.<br /><br />Charlton Heston 's character this supers secret international conspiracy that world powers have concocted to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation by using cannibalism.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the producers of this film the Green message they deliver is not the Greens Party of today 's ethos thank god . Cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous populations in New Zealand , Fiji and Borneo up until only 40 years before this film was made but has been long abandoned by human civilization.<br /><br />Another silly prediction in the film is that women become quasi sex slaves turning back the tide of radical feminism which was on the rise in 1972 when this film was made.<br /><br />The film was stupid then and is as silly now but does contain a very unmemorable last film performance by the late and great Edward G. Robinson but still no a valid reason to revisit the film other than for academic reasons.<br /><br />This is a dud of a film and I would n't even recommend it to baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans . All the other reviews of this film I have read all sound the same referring to a dystopian society in the future of which the centralised theme only seems to involve the USA in which an ecological disaster has occurred.<br /><br />The only merit in the film is that earth does face overpopulation .
1 No , this is n't a sequel to the fabulous OVA series , but rather a remake of the events that occurred after the death of Ghim ( and the disappearance of Woodchuck ) . It is also more accurate to the novels that inspired this wonderful series , which is why characters ( namely Orson and Shiris ) are reintroduced , and why the story may seem slightly different to those used to the OVA . ( The booklet included in the set provides excellent answers to such questions , as do various online sites . ) The first eight episodes of this 27-part TV series focus on the fateful battle at Demon Dragon Mountain . The remaining 19 episodes introduce us to Spark , a blue - haired knight wannabe who identifies with Parn , and his ragtag team of misfits as they attempt to stop the Dark Wizard Wagnard from resurrecting Kardis the Destroyer.<br /><br />While it is n't quite the equivalent of the original LODOSS WAR ( we all love the finale where Parn saves Deedlit from Wagnard , do n't we ? ) , this TV follow - up is still great fun for fantasy fans . Even if the animation is limited ( and a step down from the artistic streak of the first LODOSS ) , this 27-part series has its elements of appeal . The fully - realized characters , engaging storyline , magic , romance , and a superb soundtrack scored by Kaoru Wada of NINJA SCROLL , all give this uneven spin - off some punch.<br /><br />While the OVA dub of LODOSS has been criticized for one reason or another , I generally liked it and still consider it one of my favorite dubs . So I had significant hopes for the dub for CHRONICLES , made in 1999 - 2000 . For the most part , the LODOSS TV English track is of passable ( if not stellar ) quality ; it does , however , have its share of problems . Much of the original cast who lent their English voices to the characters of LODOSS return ( including Lisa Ortiz as Deedlit ! ) , which is a nice bonus . On the other hand , Billy Regan 's more mature sounding Parn is a bit offputting . He does n't do a bad job , but his voice came across as grating for the first eight episodes ( causing some anti - dub fans to instantly diss the dub ) , but by the time Spark and company take the stage , I found it less bothersome . ( I do n't know if it 's because he improved or if it just grew on me . ) Also , not everyone from the OAV dub returns . Jayce Reeves only voices Wagnard ( terrifically ) for one episode ; he 's replaced by Pete Zarustica for the whole show , who gives a scratchy , but still malevolent turn ( as well as the expected evil laughter ) . Anthony Cruise 's Kashue , on the other hand , is too weary and takes about five or so episodes to find his stride . Oliver Gregory is probably the most effective as Orson , especially during his final dramatic scenes.<br /><br />Aside from Lisa Ortiz ( Deedlit ) , Karen Smith ( Shiris ) , John Knox ( Ashram ) , and Al Muscari ( Slayn ) , the dub 's best voices come from some of the newer characters , including Crispin Freeman ( Spark , Maar , Garrack -episodes 16 - 27- ) , Roxanne Beck ( Little Neese ) , Meg Frances ( who voices Pirotess in the OAV but also voices Ryna with vulnerability and sassiness as well as Karla ) and especially Angora Deb ( who steals every scene she 's in as Leaf the Half - Elf ) . The rest of the cast is n't terrible by any means , but a little more uneven than the OAV dub . Some are all right ( Aldonova , Greevus ) while others are lackluster ( Hobb , palace guards , dragons , etc . ) and few were awful ( in particular , Prince Reona 's VA is too harsh and monotone for a fighter of justice).<br /><br />In fact the lack of aural continuity ( some cast members get new voices for some unexplained reason by the time we get to some of the later episodes ) is one of the problems of the dub . Others include less memorable and more awkward sounding dialogue , uneven synchronization , and finally ( I apologize in advance to the fans of this ) the LODOSS ISLAND segments . These offbeat , super - deformed interludes at the end of each episode will either amuse or drive you batty . Admittingly , I at first found them to be a major nuisance , but they sorta grew on me after a while . ( Besides , there are some showstoppingly hilarious lines such as " I 'm King Kashue , and this is my CASHEW ! I 'm REALLY quite a nut ! " ) These flaws rank the dub for CHRONICLES just a notch just below that for the OVA , resulting in an uneven English track summed up best as " OK".<br /><br />If one wonders if the Japanese language track is the preferred listening choice , well , guess what ? The Japanese version has its good and bad points , too . While some voices are less annoying than the English language track , I found others to be less appealing than the English equivalents ( in particular , the actress who does Deedlit is nowhere nearly as good as Lisa Ortiz OR Yumi Tohma ) . Plus , I should mention that the Japanese cast is NOT THE SAME AS THE OVA . Because the series was made seven years after the original , all but one ( Sho Hayami ) of the cast members are replaced by new ones . Although they do a respectably good job , it may be a major annoyance for those who were used to the Japanese OVA cast . Shows that not everything in Japanese is better than English , eh ? Despite its flaws , CHRONICLES OF THE HEROIC KNIGHT is still a fine series which deserves to hold its own ground . Its not without its rough spots and does n't always live up to its predecessor , yet there 's enough good points to counter the bad , making this a moderately enjoyable fantasy Anime .
1 Having just finished Cronicles of the Heroic Knight mere minutes ago I find myself extremely please but questions still loom over me . While it would appear that the first 7 episodes or so are actually a retelling of the events of the first Record of Lodoss War the truth is that they really are n't . It would appear that the creator of CotHK had a different vision as to how the original ended ( and that may be the reason that the first 7 episodes occur ) but I do not find that to be the case . CotHK does say it starts 5 years after the War of Heros which Parn was a part of . I think the director made the first 5 episodes seem so much like a recap of the original just to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to characters and their deeds done because they appear much less after the series kicks into Spark 's story . Now , once the series does kick into Spark 's portion we find ourselves kicked up another 10 years ( 15 years now since the War of Heros ) . Spark and his crew do , in some cases , resemble Parn and his crew once the journey kicks into gear , especially the love story that brews between Spark and Neese . I also thought several times throughout CotHK that I threw in the original series and if it was n't for Spark 's long blue hair I know I would 've pressed stop more than once to make sure the right disc was in . By no means do I consider these major set backs however , the writers did a fine job in crafting believable characters and a remarkable storyline . The only thing that makes me hurt is that Ashram and Wagnard return . Ummmm ... how ? ? ? Do n't get me wrong both are great villains even though Ashram 's only villainous trait is that he supports the Marmo . Perhaps I missed something during the coarse of the series that explained that part . As far as sequels go though , I highly recommend CotHK . I place both CotHK and , even more so , the original Record of Lodoss War far above the Lord of the Rings trilogy . Both of these are more epic than anything I 've ever seen or read . I highly recommend this .
1 Despite what the title may imply , " Pigs Is Pigs " does not star Porky Pig . Rather , it features a young swine with an appetite more insatiable than John Belushi 's character in " Animal House " . His mother repeatedly scolds him , but it does no good . So much so that he goes to another house where a deranged scientist force - feeds him more than any mere mortal can handle ( but there 's a surprise at the end).<br /><br />I would mostly say that this cartoon seemed like a place holder in between the really great cartoons ( Daffy Duck debuted three months after this came out ) . But make no mistake about it , they do some neat things here . The whole force - feeding sequence looks more relevant today , given the obesity epidemic overtaking our country.<br /><br />Anyway , not the greatest cartoon , but worth seeing .
1 A visit by Hitler in Rome is the backdrop of this tender story of love , friendship , homosexuality and fascism . Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stays at home while her entire family go to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini . She has to stay at home since the family can not afford a maid . She would have loved to go though as she along with the entire housing complex where she lives is an ardent admirer of Il Duce.<br /><br />There is one exception though . Across the yard sits Marcello Mastroianni on his chair contemplating suicide . The reason ? He is homosexual and because of that has recently lost his job as a radio announcer . The film really takes off when these two people meet by chance . Mastroianni is in despair and badly in need of a friend . Loren , frustrated by her own cheating husband misunderstands Mastroianni and in a masterfully shot , directed and acted scene on the roof of the building complex offers her body to him only to be rejected . The initial chock is replaced soon afterwards by her hunger for this man , this anti fascist , this homosexual , this other world who is so willing to give her all that she longs for.<br /><br />This is a beautifully crafted movie with two of the most talented actors ever . Loren proves here that she is an actress of caliber when well directed . This is a simple but yet powerful film about fascism , love , ordinary people and most importantly the human condition . Despite its sad ending there is a glimpse of hope in the denouement , things will change , someone has understood .
1 This film has great acting , great photography and a very strong story line that really makes you think about who you are , how you define yourself , how you fit in , whether you accept to play a role or break free ... There already are excellent comments dealing with these aspects . I want to comment on the formal setting of the film . Basically , it 's two people on a roof . There is unity of place and time , with 2 protagonists , and the radio acting as the choir . Many directors have turned Greek tragedies into film , many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy , but no director , in my opinion , has succeeded as admirably as Ettore Scola in approaching the purity and force of the great Greek tragedies both in story line and formal setting . A masterpiece .
1 Ettore Scola , one of the most refined and grand directors we worldly citizens have , is not yet available on DVD ... ( it 's summer 2001 right now .... ) Mysteries to goggle the mind . < br /><br />This grand classic returned to the theaters in my home - town thanks to a Sophia Loren - summer - retrospective , and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of viewing it on a video - tape ... it is a true gift . < br /><br />To avoid a critique but nonetheless try to prove a point : i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film . He never saw the film before and " does n't like those Italian Oldies ... " Like all the others in the theater he was intrigued by this wonder . Even during the end - titles the theater remained completely silent . < br /><br />This SPECIAL DAY is truly special . A wonder of refinement . And a big loss if you have n't seen it ( yet ) ...
1 A SPECIAL DAY ( Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977).<br /><br />Every once in a while , you come across a film that really touches a nerve . This one offers a very simple premise , almost flawlessly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time . It 's surprising Ettore Scola 's " Una giornate particulare " is relatively unheralded , even hated by some critics . Time Out calls it ' rubbish ' and Leonard Maltin , somewhat milder , ' pleasant but trifling . ' I disagree , not only because this film is deeply moving , but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist Italy than most films I 've seen . The cinematography is distinctly unflashy , even a bit bland , and the storyline straightforward , which might explain the film 's relative unpopularity . Considering late ' 70s audiences were n't exactly spoiled with great Italian films , it 's even stranger this one did n't really catch on with the critics.<br /><br />The film begins with a ten - minute collage of archive footage from Hitler 's visit to Italy on may 8th 1938 . Set against this background , we first meet Antonietta ( Loren ) , a lonely , love - ridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building . One day , when her Beo escapes , she meets her neighbour Gabriele ( Mastroianni ) , who seems to be only one in the building not attending the ceremonies . He is well - mannered , cultured and soon she is attracted to him . During the whole film , we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge hollering through the courtyard . Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings . After the opening scene , the camera swanks across the courtyard of the modernist ( hypermodern at the time ) apartment block , seemingly searching for our main characters , whom we have n't met yet . < br /><br />Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles , all the more astonishing since they are cast completely against type . Canadian born John Vernon plays Loren 's husband , but he is only on screen in the first and last scene . I figure his voice must have been dubbed , since he 's not of Italian descent and never lived there , to my knowledge , so I can not imagine he speaks Italian . If his voice has been dubbed , I did n't notice at all . On the contrary , he 's completely believable as an Italian , even more than the rest of the cast . The story is simple but extremely effective , the performances are outstanding , the ending is just perfect and the framing does n't come off as overly pretentious but works completely . Do n't miss out on this one.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 9/10
1 I too was quite astonished to see how few people had voted on this film , and just HAD to write something about it , although my comments are quite similar to those written already.<br /><br />I like many things about the film . The superb acting between Mastroianni & Loren . The way the film is narrated : Humanity and love slowly developing between these two outsiders , and contrasted to the simultaneously & continuously ongoing inhumane marching pace of the fascist radio announcer ( who happens to be a colleague of Mastroianni 's part)and the adherents " going to and coming from the show " . To me this is a very fine film about what it is to be human . Maybe some of you would argue that the anti - fascist " message " is too clearly delivered , but to me this did n't destroy the film in any way . My vote is 10/10 .
1 The first thing you meet when you study fascism is ostracism : because this " philosophy " is a fake one , there 's a need to use scapegoats to assess the " thought".Ettore Scola 's movie , probably his masterpiece , focuses on the outcasts , the scapegoats of the regime.<br /><br />Of the historical event ( Hitler and Mussolini 's alliance),we will see almost nothing : some military march , some garlands , some scattered voices .. Our two heroes are not invited for the feast of virility . " Genius is essentially masculine " : this is the golden rule Antonietta ( a never better Sophia Loren)embroidered on her cushion;Antonietta , whose world amounts to her kitchen , whose pride is her offsprings .At the beginning of the movie , she 's a victim of this hypermacho world , but she does not realize it . She thinks she should be happy . Gabriel , on the contrary , is politically aware , he knows about the cancer that is destroying inexorably his country . But as a gay man , he is no longer part of it , he 's about to be arrested.<br /><br />Forgetting everything that comes between them , they realize what they have in common and they make love . This is an act of rebellion , particularly for Antonietta , whose ethic should forbid such a thing . Becoming an adulteress in a land where politics and religion combine to repress women as ever leads her to some kind of political awareness . One of the last shots shows her listening to the news on the radio.<br /><br />Expect the unexpected and maybe a doctrine which denies the human being his intimate personality will see that its days are numbered .
1 ' Una Giornata Particolare ' is a movie that has a title that sounds so familiar I thought I had seen it more than once . Now that I finally I have seen it , I am very glad . This is one of the better Italian movies I know , with one of the most wonderful performances by Marcello Mastroianni , who stars in other masterpieces such as ' La Dolce Vita ' and ' 8 1/2 ' , both from the great Federico Fellini . Directed by Ettore Scola , this is a movie that takes the time to introduce the characters and slowly develops a story on a special day , the day Adolf Hitler visited Rome.<br /><br />Marcello Mastroianni plays Gabriele , the neighbor of Antonietta ( Sophia Loren ) . She is a member of Mussolini 's party , pretty fanatic in her thoughts , and he is a member no more . The reason for that I will not reveal . On the day every person from their building , including her husband and children , is out to see Hitler , they are still in the building . Antonietta 's bird escapes and flies to Gabriele 's apartment , and this is how the two meet . Right before Antonietta went to Gabriele he thought of killing himself , again for reasons I will not reveal . How the story develops from here I will not reveal , but it is what happens between the two that makes this such a special day , not the fact that Hitler is in Rome.<br /><br />Like I said , Mastroianni has a wonderful performance . You see he is a man who desperately wants someone around him , although at first we do n't know why . May be he likes Antonietta , may be he is in love with her , may be there are other reasons . Antonietta feels what we feel . What does this man want from her ? She likes the attention anyway . We see how she does her hair to look attractive for the man . Loren plays the scenes very good as well . We understand her questions , although we ca n't be sure what her intentions are . The moments where we find out both their secrets , if that is what you can call it , is a great moment . How the story develops from there is even more interesting , but I do n't want to spoil it for you . This is a movie you should see . Great performances and a beautiful cinematography , and the message it gives us still stands today .
1 I had intended to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Marcello Mastroianni 's passing with numerous unwatched films of his that I own on VHS ; however , given my ongoing light - hearted Christmas marathon , I had to make do with just this one ! As it happens , it features one of his best performances - and he was justly Oscar - nominated for it ( with the film itself being likewise honored ) . This was also one of 14 collaborations with that other most widely - recognized star to emerge from Italy , Sophia Loren ; both , incidentally , are playing against type here - she as an unglamorous housewife and he a homosexual ! < br /><br />By the way , the film 's title has a double meaning : the leading characters are brought together on the historic day in which Hitler came to Italy to meet Mussolini ( the event itself being shown in lengthy archive footage ) , but it more specifically refers to the stars ' ' brief encounter ' in which they share moments of friendship , revelation and , briefly , passion - though each knows that a return to their normal existence is inevitable , which leads to the film 's abrupt bittersweet ending . This is virtually a two - hander ( with all other characters - save for the nosy concierge of the apartment block in which the story takes place in its entirety - which include Loren 's gruff and fervently patriotic husband , surprisingly played by John Vernon , appear only at the beginning and closing sequences ) ; still , the cramped setting does n't deter director Scola ( for the record , this is the 7th film of his that I 've watched and own 3 more on VHS ) and cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis , so that the result - though essentially low - key - is far from stagy : the camera is allowed to prowl the various sections of the large building , observing the proceedings intimately or dispassionately as the situation requires , but always keenly.<br /><br />The narrative , of course , depends entirely on the performances of the two stars for it to be convincing , and they both deliver ( their on - screen chemistry is quite incomparable ) ; it 's interesting , however , that while Loren walked away with the prizes in their home turf , it 's Mastroianni 's moving yet unsentimental outsider ( the film , somewhat dubiously , does seem to equate his sexual deviance with Anti - Fascism ! ) who generally impressed international audiences !
1 A May day 1938 when happen a huge rally celebrating Hitler 's visit to Rome serves as the backdrop for a love story between Antoniette(Sophia Loren)married to fascist(John Vernon ) and Gabriel(Marcello Mastroianni ) . She 's a boring housewife with several sons and he 's a unhappy , solitary homosexual fired from radio and pursued by the fascists . She 's left alone in her home when her spouse must to attend the historical celebration . Then both develop a very enjoyable relationship in spite of their differences . The film is set on the historic meeting Fuher Hitler and Duce Mussolini along with others authorities as Count Ciano and King Victor Manuel III , describing the events by a radio - voice in off which sometimes is irritating . < br /><br />It 's a romantic drama carried out with sense and sensibility . An unrelentingly passionate romance between two conflicting characters . Magnificent performances from two pros make a splendid movie well worth seeing . Of course Ruggero Macarri and Ettore Scola 's sensible screenplay results in ever interesting , elaborate and sentimental . Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Pascualino De Santis . Emotive musical score by Armando Trovajoly with sensitive leitmotif . The film won deservedly Golden Globes 1978 to best Foreign Film.<br /><br />Director Scola 's imagination stretches to light up the limited scenarios where are developing the drama . Usually his films take place on a few stages and are semi - theatrical . For example : ¨Le Bal¨(1982 ) uses a French dance - hall to illustrate the changes in society 2)¨Nuit of Varennes(1983 ) a stagecoach is the scenario where meet an unlikely group as Thomas Paine , Luis XVI and Marie Antoinette who fled from revolutionary Paris 3 ) ¨The family¨(1987)all take place in the family 's grand old Roman flat ; and of course 4)¨Una Giornata Particulare¨ or ¨A special day¨ where Loren and Mastroianni strikes up a marvelous relationship into their respective apartments and at the flat roof .
1 Una giornata particolare is a film which has made brilliant use of closed spaces . It is in these dull , empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of Ettore Scola 's two leading characters . Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives . It is the element of sadness associated with the narrative that makes us believe that people will take sides with characters close to them . All men would really feel sorry for Sophia Loren 's character . All women would surely cry their hearts out at Marcello Mastroianni 's existential plight . Disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber , poignant film . Most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities . Una giornata particolare can not be termed as a pro gay film although it has been nicely depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women . This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has crafted a fairly good mix of fact and fiction . His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed destinies of ordinary Italian folks . A word about the courageous personnage played magnificently by great Marcello Mastroianni . He acts as a real man who does not beg for pity . He happily accepts his fate and readies himself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life . A true masterpiece of cinema ! ! !
1 First of all for this movie I just have one word : ' wow ' . This is probably , one of the best movies that touched me , from it 's story to it 's performances , so wonderfully played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni . I was very impressed with this last one , because he really brought depth to the character , as it was a very hard role . Still , the two of them formed a pair , that surprised me , from the beginning until the end , showing in the way , a friendship filled with love , that develops during the entire day , settled in the movie . The story takes some time to roll , as the introduction of the characters is long , but finally we are compensated with a wonderful tale about love and humanity . If you have the chance , see it , because it 's a movie that will stay in your mind for many time . Simply amazing - 9/10 .
1 While Rome goes mad celebrating Hitler 's visit - uniforms , bands , parades - two outsiders stay home , in a large building , and wind up meeting . She is Sofia Loren , who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children . He is Mastroianni , a radio speaker who 's been fired because of his homosexuality . Both of them need company and understanding , both f them find it in each other.<br /><br />The movie covers a span of a few hours . The color are faded and everything takes place with a sound track of military marches and hysterical radio announcers . Strangely enough , the Nazi anthem - the Horst - Wessel - Lied - ends up becoming a romantic musical theme.<br /><br />Beautiful movie , excellent recreation of a special era in Italian history and a touching , sad story . Mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect and Sofia Loren does a superb job , very far away from her usual truck driver 's pin - up , Neapolitan fishwife personas . Do n't miss it .
1 Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors . My parents and I watched together " C'eravamo tanto amati " on a summer night : we liked it , but we did n't love it as we loved " A special day " . I believe Ettore Scola is pretty underrated : we often forget to remember him , maybe because his latest films were disappointing . And so , yesterday night , my mum and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece . Writing , direction , cinematography , score and production design were sober and accurate , but the thing I liked the most was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni . They 're both excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele . Antonietta is an housewife : married with a fanatic Fascist , she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families . Gabriele is simply an Anti - Fascist . They spend together a special day , that special day of 1938 when Hitler came to Rome visiting Mussolini . I do n't want to spoil anymore about the plot : go looking for this film !
1 May 1938 . Hitler in Italy . Preparations for historical appointment with Mussolini . Emotions , tensions and forms of self - affirmation . a empty town , a housewife and a journalist . The meeting of two different worlds . Refuge for a mother with a sad life . Short filling for a classical victim . A story about solitude and silence . About the form of of life 's nooks and desire like fight 's form . The great character- a book gifted in a spring 's afternoon . This movie is a poem , remarkable for the art to describe the shades of common loneliness . A pleading for a ineffable relation with reality . And with your interior world . The pictures of Il Duce , the clumsiness of Antonietta , the patience and the frailty tension of Gabriele , the art of director to give the sense of script grace two great actors makes this film sublime , foretaste of subtle delicacy , a wonderful film about hypocrisy and arbitrary verdict , about essence of life and repulsiveness of any tyranny . Loren and Mastroianni are the masters of a magnificent intelligent acting . A clear masterpiece .
1 This movie is finally out on DVD in Italy ( completely restored ) . I have seen this movie so many times and I find it even actual these days ( 2003 ) when Italy suffers again from a sort of brainwashing dictatorship ( or the US for that matter ) . I am glad there are outcasts as the one played by Mastroianni in this movie who can sing out of tune ; maybe they can teach the Sophia Lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognised as human beings.<br /><br />Back to the movie : as most people here already mentioned the acting is wonderful but the audio background is astonishing . I must assume that unfortunately something is lost if you do n't understand the Italian language but I can assure you that the show - off of machism , the distortion of reality in that ever - present radio - chronicle of the Hitler visit to Rome can really make you shiver!<br /><br />A masterpiece!<br /><br / >
1 This film makes a strong comment about the Italian people of the time . The use of the mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is lovely and I ca n't not mention the beauty and magnificence of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni . I love them both . Their way of interacting is so beautiful and natural that you may question whether or not the camera is actually there . The husband , in his brief role , is also excellently portrayed as the fascist Italian who commands his wife and children but , in his own way , a loving father . The beginning scenes with Hitler at Piazza Venezia with all the Italians is incredible and really places the film historically . I loved the film and I also agree that it is funny it is n't more renowned .
1 there should be a sub - genre in the Western called ' the Robert Mitchum Western ' . Mitchum 's brilliant , idiosyncratic , usually undervalued Westerns import his film noir persona to etch some compellingly dark character sketches , and bring an elegiac world - weariness more familiar from the films of Sam Peckinpah . ' Man with the gun ' is one of his best . Directed by Orson Welles protege Richard Wilson , it is a stark , monochrome beauty , full of chilling silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of savage violence , as Mitchum comes to tame a town terrorised by a monopolist with a private army . Mitchum 's regression from soft - spoken stranger to deranged murderer , with a host of dark emotions in between , is a marvel of expressive , physical acting .
1 Very good western . This was the first time writer Richard Wilson directed a film , also this was a first for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer . It is a pleasure to see a very young and pretty Angie Dickinson as a saloon girl . Robert Mitchum comes to this town dominated by outlaws and is hired as a town tamer , but people are worried that he will go too far , also about the harm that he will do to the town´s businesses . There are some similarities in the story with " Warlock " which was made in 1959 . This film keeps a very fast and exciting pace , it really keeps you on the edge .
1 I do n't remember ever seeing this one before tonight , probably the title sounded so ordinary it kept passing me by . But it is a well crafted b Western , with an interestingly brooding storyline complimented by acting veering from the good to corny.<br /><br />Robert Mitchum slopes into wide open town looking for his wife and news of their daughter , and stays for a time as town - tamer . As usual the good business folk have mixed emotions - they want to get rid of the baddies but like the business they bring . It still applies : relax drink and gambling laws and encourage the industries but pretend to deplore the seedy effects it can have on ordinary people . What 's fascinating about this film is Mitchum 's cynically intense portrayal in going about cleaning the town of baddies , and the townsfolk 's acceptance that his violent methods were the only ones . Favourite bit : the sudden demise of 2 of the baddies in the Red Dog saloon . The firing of the main saloon bordered on nasty , but it was an effective way to combat the spread of poison.<br /><br />Overall a very good film with its only fault tending to be a little hokeyness - not so good for Do - Gooders who would probably prefer a lifetime of negotiation with Evil rather than end it .
1 Man With the Gun is pretty much forgotten now , but caused a minor storm of media interest back in 1955 when Robert Mitchum turned down both Jett Rink in Giant ( which had actually been written for him and which was subsequently substantially reworked ) and Charles Laughton 's intended version of The Naked and the Dead to make it instead . Despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that occasionally renders both Mitch and Jan Sterling in unflattering tones , it 's a terrific dark western that more than stands comparison with his earlier Blood on the Moon as his ' town tamer ' sets to work on a town that never had the chance to grow up before getting run down by the local badmen before turning out to  possibly  be almost as bad as the men he dispatches . Certainly his way of dealing with news of a death in the family  burning a saloon to the ground and goading its manager into trying to kill him  does n't inspire much confidence in his stability . As well as a good script and a surprisingly good supporting turn from the usually irritating but here well cast Henry Hull , it also boasts a strikingly good early Alex North score , which even includes an early workout for one of his tormented emotional cues that would later turn up in Spartacus .
1 Clint Tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter , tho he finds her , the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim . Whilst here , the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of Tollinger 's reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer . As they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit , they hold a meeting that chooses to hire Tollinger to rid the town of it 's unsavoury elements.<br /><br />Man With The Gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one , at the time of me writing this , it has just over 200 votes and a paltry 9 user comments written for it . It 's a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a B movie Western , this is a fine entry in the Western genre . That the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel , probably has n't done the film any favours over the years , i myself read the synopsis and thought it 's just another in the line of similarly themed pictures . Yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments , both technically and as a functioning story.<br /><br />Robert Mitchum is in the lead as Tollinger , perfectly cast , he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace . We often talk about the screen presence that John Wayne and Charlton Heston had { justifiably of course } , Mitchum is right up there with the best of them . One sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place , we do n't see his face , but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us!. The rest of the cast are also very much in Mitchum 's shadow , so really it 's solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high , perhaps it 's unfair to single out Ted de Corsia for a kick , but Man With The Gun 's minor failings are with its villains , and sadly de Corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace . The score from Alex North is excellently layered { fans of Spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up } and the cinematography from Lee Garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot . Directed and co - written by first time director Richard Wilson , Man With The Gun holds few surprises for the genre , but it 's dark in tone , violent and above all else , highly watchable . 7.5/10
1 Robert Mitchum stars as Clint Tollinger in this short but tough western : Man With The Gun . Tollinger is a professional town tamer - as in , when a town needs someone to save itself ; he is the one who is brought in to do it . Tollinger 's latest gig comes by as an accident : strolling into town looking for his former fling , he stumbles into a town being played like a puppet by a local western gangster . But many townspeople begin to rue the day they hired Tollinger , as his way of cleaning up the town becomes very taxing ( suddenly High Plains Drifter seems less original ) . < br /><br />Man With The Gun starts off as an average western tough - guy film but begins to surprise you more and more as the film progresses . What starts off as forgettable and run - of - the - mill ends up dark and character - centered . The entire film is very well shot and the cast is very enjoyable . Mitchum is his usual excellent self here in Man With The Gun - not one of his very best performances , Mitchum still has his classic and effective tough - guy screen presence in high gear and he knocks the action - packed , meaningful , and shocking scenes of the film right out of the park . Man With The Gun is a nice Mitchum western and is easily worth one 's time .
1 In the Old west there are always the men who live breathe violence and the women who hold their breath . A famous ¨town tamer¨ named Clit Tollinger(Robert Mitchum ) comes hired by the citizens to rid the gunslingers ( Leo Genn , Claude Atkins , among others ) , Baronland 's hoodlums . There he meets the blacksmith ( Emile Meyer ) , his daughter ( Karen Sharpe ) , her boyfriend(John Lupton ) , the marshal(Henry Hull ) and the Saloon owner ( Ted De Corsia ) . Clint as lawman is appointed deputy to bring peace and puts some cartels saying the following : ¨ Warning , wearing of guns or other weapons in town is banned . Check all hardware at the marshal 's office ¨. Clint finds his ex - girlfriend , a local madame ( Jan Sterling ) in charge of the Saloon girls ( Angie Dickinson , Barbara Lawrence , among them ) . But the town council afraid the raw methods carried out by Clint . At the end the kingpin landowner appears and attempts to murder Tollinger with his own hands.<br /><br />This is a tremendously exciting story of a sheriff - for - hire who had only one more killing to go . It begins as a slow - moving Western but follows to surprise us with dark characters and solid plot . The tale is almost grim , a pacifier comes to a town just in time to make sure its citizenry but later the events get worse . The highlights are the burning at Saloon and the climatic showdown at the ending . Phenomenal and great role for Robert Mitchum as avenger angel and bitter gunfighter , he 's the whole show . Vivid and lively musical score by Alex North ( Spartacus , Cleopatra ) , Atmospheric cinematography in black and white by Lee Garmes . The motion picture is stunningly realized by Richard Wilson ( Al Capone , Three in Attic ) who made good Western as ¨Invitation to a gunfighter and ¨Zane Grey¨ episodes . Watchable results for this offbeat Western .
1 What I expected : A rather lame overly - stereotypical portrayal of a sports - mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team.<br /><br />What I got : An even - handed story where both guy and gal end up admitting -- to themselves and each other -- that they each have passions in their lives yet each can forgive the other to save the love they share.<br /><br />Sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performances this story works ! Barrymore is classic Barrymore : that perfect blend of sweet , strong , and adorable . We expect that from her and she delivered.<br /><br />But Fallon is the nice surprise in this film . He brings to the role the perfect blend of sports nut combined with the appreciation for the normal things in life , like caring about kids and his girlfriend . Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection . He can be caring ( " You just ran across the field for me ! " ) and in the same breath be obliviously blinded by his love for the Red Sox ( " How did the grass feel ? Kinda spongy ? " ) at the same time . Fallon 's portrayal " made " the movie . Hopefully , this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for Fallon , something beyond the over - the - top sophomoric humor typical of SNL alums ( i.e. Will Ferrell).<br /><br />In short , a movie that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male vs. female characters rose above that limitation and provided nonstop spot - on humorous lines , most delivered with brilliant subtlety by Fallon.<br /><br />Hey , I saw this with my wife -- not a baseball fan -- and she loved it as much as I did . It 's neither a " Guy Flick " nor a " Chick Flick " . It 's a terrific make - you - laugh flick . Go see it !
1 I went to see Fever Pitch with my Mom , and I can say that we both loved it . It was n't the typical romantic comedy where someone is pining for the other , and blah blah blah ... You were n't waiting for the climatic first kiss or for them to finally get together . It was more real , because you saw them through the relationship , rather than the whole movie be about them getting together . People could actually relate to the film , because it did n't seem like extraordinary circumstances , or impossible situations . It was really funny , and I think it was Jimmy Fallon 's best performance . All in all ... I would definitely recommend it !
1 My daughter gets really put out at me when I refer to Drew Barrymore as looking as if she 'd been hit in the face with a frying pan , not to mention her Dudley Dooright chin that Jay Leno would die for . How wonderful , then , when I discovered in " Fever Pitch " that I really like Miss Barrymore ; and Jimmy Fallon ; and the Red Sox ; and Boston ! This film is probably best characterized as a sweet , light comedy . To be absolutely stereotypical , the girls will like the movie for its romantic charm and Jimmy Fallon 's vulnerability , and the boys will like it for all the male bonding and the depiction of sports mania.<br /><br />My sports - hating wife , my teenage daughter , and I all found something to like in the film . That says something in itself . It 's a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half or so , and is probably a really good date flic , too .
1 If you enjoy romantic comedies then you will find this tale of two 30 year old singles who fall in love during the American League pennant race satisfying . On the other hand , if you are hanging around waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2 then you probably should stay away . The plot contains the obligatory guy meets girl 's friends , girl meets guy 's friends , and guy meets girl 's parents scenes . There is even a guy meets girl 's pet dog scene . That 's all par for the course in a movie like this . However , what I liked about it was that the plot delved into the decision making process people make as they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is in fact a bit quirky . The plot centers around answering the questions ; how much quirkiness is too much and how much love does it take to trump those quirks ? It is interesting to see the characters work that out because deep down ( if we admit it ) we all have quirks . Barrymore does a very good job in her role and Fallon sorta surprised me -- he 's good as well . I rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy . Add one point if you are a baseball fan or romantically involved with one . Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you are a Yankees fan .
1 I saw this movie on Thursdays night after having a really boring day . I had no expectations , those I had were rather negative . Being that the only movie I 've ever watched Jimmy in is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah(?) ... don't ask why ! But seriously .. this movie is so cute ! Drew Barrymore is always sweet , but I almost fell in love with Fallon 's character . Why ca n't I meet a cute nerd like that . :) Movies like that are excellent . Simple , sweet and necessary . Sunday on a Thursdays . I 'm not even a sports fan , but it 's something about American movies with baseball that fascinates me . Probably the fact that we do n't have that sport here in Norway.<br /><br />(My first comment ever . ) Haha
1 " Fever Pitch " is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances as date movies or movies a son could be willing to go to with his mother ( though the guys in the audience got noticeably restless during the romantic scenes).<br /><br />I have lived through a milder version of such a story , as my first exposure to baseball was dating my husband the spring after the Mets first World Series win and then I watched the Mets clinch their next one because I was the one still up in the wee hours with our two little sons , who have grown up to teach me more about baseball through our local neighborhood National League team 's other heartbreaking failures to win it again ( and it was me who took our older son to his only Fenway Park game as I caught a bit of Red Sox fever as a graduate student in Boston).<br /><br />So compared to reality , the script believably creates two people with actual jobs . It is particularly impressive that Drew Barrymore 's character is a substantive workaholic who has anti - Barbie skills , though she pretty much only visits with her three bland girlfriends during gym workouts that allow for much jiggling and the minor side stories with her parents do n't completely work.<br /><br />It is even set up credibly how she meets Jimmy Fallon 's math teacher and how she falls for his " winter guy " -- though it 's surprising that his Red Sox paraphernalia filled apartment did n't tip her off to his Jekyll - and - Hyde " summer guy . " Their relationship crisis during the baseball season is also played out in a refreshingly grown - up way , from efforts at compromise to her frank challenges to him , centered around that they are both facing thirty and single . Fallon surprisingly rises to his character 's gradual emotional maturity.<br /><br />While the ending borrows heavily from O. Henry , the script writers did a yeoman job of quickly incorporating the Sox 's incredible 2004 season into a revised story line ( with lots of cooperation from the Red Sox organization for filming at the stadium).<br /><br />The script goes out of its way to explain why Fallon does n't have a Boston accent , as an immigrant from New Jersey , but that does n't explain why his motley friends do n't . The most authentic sounding Boston sounds come from most of his " summer family " of other season ticket holders , who kindly kibitz the basics of Sox lore to neophyte Barrymore ( and any such audience members).<br /><br />The song selection includes many Red Sox fans ' favorites , from the opening notes of the classic " Dirty Water , " though most are held to be heard over the closing credits as if you are listening to local radio and are worth sitting through to hear .
1 The Farrelly brothers , Bobby and Peter , are at it again . With " Fever Pitch " the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes , abandon that tactic when they decided to bring Nick Hornby 's film to the screen , something that it would have been hard to do . The novel , of the same title , dealt with a man 's obsession with soccer , since it is set in England , where that sport consumes most of British sports fans . It 's to the credit of the writing team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell , to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most Americans , when they make their hero , a Boston Red Sox fan.<br /><br />"Fever Pitch " is a film that presents an obsessive fan , Ben Wrightly , whose life revolves into the Red Sox season , and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them . When Ben takes four of his best pupils for a tour of a local firm , he meets , and falls hopelessly in love with the brainy Lindsey Meeks , a young woman who is going places , but at thirty , has no life of her own.<br /><br />The story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the Red Sox , at home games , in Fenway Park . This team 's fans are probably the most loyal people in the world , having stuck with a team that does marvelous things but , until 2004 , never won a World Series . In fact , the ending , from what we heard , had to be changed because that was the year in which they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty six years ! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film . Ms. Barrymore is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera . Jimmy Fallon , a popular television comedian , turned movie actor , has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in " Taxi " , in our humble opinion.<br /><br />The Farrelly brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale .
1 Fever Pitch is a fun enough movie . It has a lot of funny moments ( including a hilariously disturbing shower scene ) . Like most romantic comedies , it has a " dead zone " in the middle where all the heavy , " she 's breaking up with me " stuff happens , but other than that it continues to be funny until the end.<br /><br />Even though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the Red Sox , it 's not overloaded with sports . You do n't have to be a fan to enjoy this film.<br /><br />Of course that 's easy for me to say : I 've been a Red Sox fan since I was a boy , too.<br /><br />7 out of 10.<br /><br />Barky
1 This is a great movie for the true romantics and sports lovers alike.<br /><br />Drew Barrymore is at her best in this movie . As a Drew fan it was quite nice to see her shine after having several flops . I had my doubts about Jimmy Fallon but he totally delivered as Ben the comical , sports crazed sweetheart . The comedy in this movie is great , there were several laugh out loud moments.<br /><br />Their first date started rocky when he showed up at her apartment with flowers and she was sick to her stomach from eating a new place earlier in the day . Instead of leaving he helps take care of her , helping her change into pajama 's then cleaning up the puke on her toilet and bathroom later telling her that she was ' very lady - like ... no chunks . ' Everything goes great between Ben and Lindsay the whole winter but then baseball season starts . Lindsay starts to realize just how obsessed Ben is with the Red Sox and why this seemingly great guy is still single . She tries to shrug it off and think of it as a good thing as she has a busy work schedule and she wo nt feel guilty for working extra hours while he is at games . She even buys all the books on The Red Sox she can find including one on ' The curse of Bambino'.<br /><br />Everything is going pretty well until Lindsay has a false alarm having missed her period . It both makes them both realize how serious they are getting and she begins to question if this is the person she wants to be with . A very touching part in the movie is after she tells him she got her period it shows him sadly putting away a baby sized Red Sox jersey he had bought just in case she was pregnant.<br /><br />Eventually Ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her friends birthday Party after she said " I had to check my calender and when I saw the there was a Red Sox / Yankee game I knew I would be going stag ' . After the party Ben tells her it was ' the best night of his life ' . Shortly after he gets a call from his pal who went to the game he gave up for the party and told him " IT WAS THE BEST GAME EVER ! ! ! " Ben freaks out about missing it and ends up really hurting Lindsay when she says " A few minutes ago you were saying this was the best night of your life " he says " well that was a few minutes ago." < br /><br />So they separate for a while , he realizes how immature his obsession is and decides to sell his season tickets which he inherited from his uncle because if he did n't it would ' remind him too much of what he gave up for them ' . Lindsay finds out through a friend and decides to stop him realizing he is doing it for her . It ends very sweetly showing how his childhood love for baseball has been over shadowed for a whole new deeper love , Lindsay . They still go to the games and even attend the final World Series game and St. Louis and it is a happy ending all around . 2 thumbs up ! !
1 I have to admit that I went into Fever Pitch with low expectations . It 's no huge revelation for me to say that Jimmy Fallon 's last movie ( Taxi ) was Catwomanly bad , and the trailers for Fever Pitch were all right but did n't mesmerize me . I was already preparing some cheesy baseball puns for my review ... <br /><br />"I like Jimmy Fallon , but Taxi was strike one in his movie career . Well , now we 've got steeeeee - riiiiiike twoooooooo ! One more strike , and it 's back to SNL ! " or " Buy yourself some peanuts and cracker jacks , but do n't buy tickets to Fever Pitch . You 'll walk out of the theater and never go back ! " Then the movie had to go and be way more entertaining than I was expecting . But hey , I could n't let my puns go to waste , right ? Another reason I thought I would n't care for the movie is that I hate the Boston Red Sox . My whole family hates 'em . The mere mention of Pedro Martinez ' name sends me running to the bathroom . Oh man , hold on ... <br /><br /> ... All right , I 'm back . Anyway , my mom , who is a St. Louis Cardinals fan , still believes the World Series was rigged last year . She refuses to believe the Sox won it legitimately . But I 'm man enough to admit that Fever Pitch caused me to sympathize , albeit only slightly , with the plight of Red Sox fans.<br /><br />Anybody who has a passion for sports will be able to relate to this movie on some level . Unless you have a favorite sports team you ca n't fully understand the extreme highs and lows that a fan such as Fallon 's Ben can go through . There 's nothing quite so fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing quite so smooth as a clean slate . Well , figuratively speaking . It 's the joy of being a sports fan . " Wait ' til next year , " becomes your mantra , your motto , your prayer - and Fever Pitch effectively captures that essence.<br /><br />I love the fact that the movie takes a fictional story and throws it against the real - life backdrop of the Red Sox ' improbable World Series run last year . I do n't love it so much that I want to marry it , but you know what I mean . I expected this to be handled in a fairly cheesy manner , and while some of the humor is a little silly , it 's actually pretty realistic.<br /><br />You see , Ben 's uncle took him to his first Red Sox game when he was 7 years old , and when he died he left Ben his two season tickets . Ben has n't missed a game in 23 years . At the beginning of each season he has a draft day where he and his friends get together to figure out who gets to go to which games with him . He makes everybody dance for the Yankees games and whenever somebody complains he threatens them with tickets for the games with the Royals ( sorry Mr. Shade ) and the Devil Rays . It 's a very good scene , and it works so well because I actually know of people who do the " ticket draft day . " I also must admit that I can relate to when Ben goes to dinner with Lindsey and her parents . The Red Sox are playing a road game , but instead of watching it live on TV Ben decides to tape it . One of the most dangerous things in life is taping a game and then being in public and trying to avoid hearing the result . Been there . It 's a very tense and scary situation . Weeeeeell , Ben enters the danger zone when a guy shows up at the restaurant and mentions watching the game . Ben immediately covers his ears and starts shrieking like a banshee so as not to hear the outcome . Lindsey is embarrassed , and her parents do n't know what to think . Yeah , sports fans can be weird , I do n't deny it . But it 's real.<br /><br />Now if you 're expecting the crude , edgy stuff that the Farrelly brothers are known for then you could be disappointed . They do have their moments though , like when Ben says he likes how Lindsey sometimes talks out of the side of her mouth " like an adorable stroke victim , " but overall this is definitely a softer , more romantic side that the bros are putting on display.<br /><br />That 's not to say that the movie ever gets way too sappy . Thankfully , when the sap starts to ooze a bit , the Farrellys know when to pull away . A romantic moment with Lindsey jumping on the field and running over to Ben to declare her undying love for him turns into Ben sincerely replying , " You 've got ta tell me about the outfield . Is it spongy ? " Jimmy Fallon proves that with the right material he can handle himself well on the big screen , and Drew Barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm . Fever Pitch is just good , solid entertainment that takes a somewhat fresh look at the romantic comedy genre . It 's a movie that guys and gals can both relate to . Particularly the guys who practice sports fanaticism at some point during the year and the ladies who must deal with ' em.<br /><br />Now if the Red Sox fans could please shut up about the " Curse of the Bambino " I would appreciate it . My Memphis Tigers have NEVER won the NCAA basketball championship , so I officially declare my plight greater than yours.<br /><br />THE GIST Fans of Jimmy Fallon , Drew Barrymore , romantic comedy , the Red Sox , baseball , or sports fanaticism in general should consider giving Fever Pitch a look . I would n't go out of my way to rush and see it at the first available time , but it 'll make a great matinée.<br /><br />Rating : 3.25 ( out of 5 )
1 The movie shocked me . Personally i had herd mostly bad buzz . Well finally after owning the DVD for months now i pooped it in on a sleepless night . though the movie did drag the extra footage was used with purpose the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had left out any scenes . The best thing about the movie is it 's consistency with the relationship . There were no ex 's popping up or characters threatening the relationship . I mean typically we see the girl meets boy by some amazing twist of fate , they date , something we saw coming breaks them up up and then they get back together in the last five minutes of the movie . but this movie did not follow that mold . We actually experienced the relationship and it 's flaws and though the characters did have there moments of anti - love they did not have dramatic pauses were they went off and did a montage every 15 and then reunite in love again . i did not feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies . The story was unique and truthful to reality in the way that i felt these people in the film were the most believable that i have seen in a romance film from modern times . And it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were at the actual world series so fate kicked in a little there also . It 's no " My fair lady " but it is a spirited and honest film . I 'll simply say i like it .
1 I really liked this movie because I have a husband just like the guy in this movie . This movie is about Lindsey who meets Ben in the middle of winter when baseball season is n't in . She falls in love but when spring comes along , she gets the shock of her life when she is placed one step lower on her pedestal that Ben has put her on.<br /><br />It 's a funny movie with all of the baseball obsession that Ben has . He ca n't part from what he loves the most , that 's what makes it so funny and why so many women can relate to Lindsey in real life . Also the people he sits with at the baseball games are just as obsessed as he is.<br /><br />It 's a funny movie and you wo n't strike out if you rent this one .
1 I got to see this on the plane to NZ last week , and was wondering how it would measure up to both the UK film and the book . I have to say I was favorable impressed . If anything the fanatical attachment to the Red Sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to Arsenal FC , who have had success through the years . As a Brit I was also interested to see that you do n't need to understand baseball to get what 's going on . One question springs to mind - Was the screenplay written using the Sox as the team even before they finally broke the Curse of the Bambino ? Or was another team in the frame ? As a Red Sox fan myself ( weird I know , a Brit who understands baseball ) I have to say that it added to the enjoyment .
1 Yes , commitment . Let 's say " Fever Pitch " might trick you into believing it 's a baseball movie.<br /><br />But no , you do n't have to be a baseball fan to actually enjoy this picture from the Farrelly Brothers . But of course , if you are one , you will enjoy it even more ; with all the references ( pretty accurate ones , I 'd say ) to the Boston Red Sox and its bittersweet history ; from the Curse of the Bambino and everything attributed to it , including those two words you CANNOT pronounce in front of a Boston fan : Bill Buckner.<br /><br />Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon portray two people who , usually might have second thoughts of going into a relationship : the successful workaholic who is also affluent meeting a school teacher ? Thing is , Fallon 's character wins Barrymore 's heart by being funny , caring , sweet and downright perfect . But her friends ask her a logical question : if he 's such a keeper , why is he still on the market ? Enter the Boston Red Sox . He 's been so committed to his team ever since his uncle passed his Sox season tickets to him ; he has never missed a Red Sox home game at Fenway Park in a long while.<br /><br />And that delicate balance , how much is the workaholic willing to give up for his guy 's obsession ; and how much is that baseball - crazed teacher willing to compromise in order to keep the OTHER love of his life , is what this movie is all about.<br /><br />At first , you might think that the sports - obsession bits of the movie are exaggerated for comic relief . Well , I 'm sad to admit , they are not . Myself , as a die - hard Houston Astros fan , can say they are all true . I would try at every way available to see every ' Stros game ; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the Internet . I read the Chronicle 's sports section every day . And yes , my room looks like The Shed , Minute Maid Park 's gift shop ; with a closet full of Astros gear , including 5 jerseys , 20 t - shirts and you know the rest . Fallon 's character even has the Red Sox MBNA MasterCard.<br /><br />Fallon was credible enough as the fanatical Red Sox faithful , even though he could pull it off without becoming a cartoon ( Thank God Adam Sandler was n't in it ) ; and the plot revolved around how this couple tried to manage with each other 's passions.<br /><br />I'd say it 'll be a classical romantic comedy . Not enough to be among the best movies in history ; but certainly breaks a mold into the genre and is appealing enough for men and women alike .
1 Admittedly , I know nothing about baseball , I 'm not even a fan of the sport , but that did n't stop me enjoying the Farrelly brothers ' latest film , Fever Pitch , a charmingly irreverent romantic comedy . The film is not really about baseball ; rather , it 's really about relationships , and the emotional disconnectedness that can often take place.<br /><br />Jimmy Fallen  giving his best performance to date  stars as Ben , a dorky , lightly nerdy schoolteacher . Ben is a kind of man - boy , who unfortunately has never really grown up , and he fosters an almost fanatical addiction to the Red Sox baseball team . Ben has devoted his life to the Sox , and does everything from making the pilgrimage to Florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia.<br /><br />One day , while taking his honors geometry class to on a field trip to her office , Ben meets the go - getting Lindsey ( a wonderful Drew Barrymore ) . Lindsey is a corporate , career orientated kind of girl , but she has a kind of cuteness that Ben finds totally endearing . He 's initially hesitant to ask her out , thinking that she 's way out of his " class , " and , Lindsey does n't immediately see a potential partner in Ben.<br /><br />Their first date gets off to a disastrous start when Lindsey is stricken with a severe case of food poisoning  and her resonant retching provides the first clue that we are , in fact , watching a Farrelly brothers movie . Rather than accept Lindsey 's - rather urgent - request to reschedule , Ben sticks around to play nurse , orderly , and janitor . So Ben scrubs the toilet and the dog 's teeth , while his love interest is passed out with a bucket next to her bed.<br /><br />When Lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch , she begins the long , fitful process of dismantling the web of status anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her standards . Soon they are falling in love , with Lindsey blithely accepting Ben 's fanatical devotion to his sport.<br /><br />Having inherited choice season tickets from his beloved uncle , Ben has organized his life around the season  he 's never missed a game . But their relationship , which has progressed without a hitch throughout the winter , hits a snag at the start of the season.<br /><br />Lindsey wants Ben to do other things , like holiday with her parents and party with her friends , but Ben begins to have trouble modulating his interest to meet Lindsey halfway . Can Lindsey consent to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer in order to make their relationship work ? Can she really accommodate Ben 's infatuation with sports ? Can a die - hard and nerdy Red Sox fan find true love after all ? Of course , Lindsey and Ben come with a colorful assortment of opinion - wielding friends . Lindsey 's strictest buddy , the skinny , rich and blond Robin ( KaDee Strickland ) , insists that there must be something wrong with the guy if he 's still single at 30 . However , plump , curly - haired Sarah ( Marissa Jaret Winokur ) and Molly ( Ione Skye ) supply a more optimistic and positive view of Ben.<br /><br />Ben 's eccentricity could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan , while Lindsay 's frustrations could be representative of any upwardly mobile career driven woman . Fallon is terrific as Ben , exhibiting real big screen potential , overcoming the not - insignificant challenge of keeping Ben from being unsympathetic . Barrymore , meanwhile , is equally charming as the workaholic Lindsey , particularly as she struggles to accept Ben for who he is without losing sight of her own needs.<br /><br />Fever Pitch really works , and even though there are lots of inspired comedic moments , the movie is also addressing the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to negotiate this fragile territory.<br /><br />Much of the movie was filmed at Boston 's Fenway Park , which adds a fine sense of authenticity to the proceedings , as well as the ambiance of the games , though fully appreciating what transpired with the team will probably be limited to baseball aficionados . Even so , Fever Pitch is blessed with such a finely wrought and intelligently funny script that even novice baseball fans will find much with which to connect . Mike Leonard September 05 .
1 I was not only an extra in this movie , I got to see it in Boston to a sold out cinema . Over a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans jammed themselves into a movie theater near Boston Common to watch a comedy .... about them .... Red Sox fanatics ! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon star is this cute comedy about love and lust . The love is between the two young lovers . The lust is for the Red Sox winning the world series . Although Fallon is not a great actor , he is the best actor for the role . He is funny enough and gets the most laughs . Barrymore on the other hand is the same old Barrymore . At times , I felt supporting actress Ione Skye would have been a better actor for the role . All in all , all Boston Red Sox fans will love this movie . For the rest of the world , this is just a funny movie .
1 The only reason I saw this movie was for Jimmy Fallon , who I 've had a crush on since 9th grade , which was his first year on SNL . I am a die - hard Yankees fan , and I did n't find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes , when they begin showing clips of the ALCS games . I had to cover my ears and make small noises so I would n't have to hear that which must not be heard , but otherwise it was completely bearable.<br /><br />I thought Jimmy played the role very well , because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky , and he is a nervous and quirky guy . I know that it may not be a Academy Award - winning stretch , but the movie is just a light , fun , romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see.<br /><br />Jimmy and Drew worked well together , and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past . ( Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie ? What ? ) I think Jimmy has a positive career ahead of him , and thank goodness , because Taxi could have killed it . I think Fever Pitch will help him out a lot . Everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies . I imagine it must be difficult , and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time ( Tom Hanks , Russell Crowe , etc ) you 'll see that they started off in some flops . Busom Buddies ? Australian soap operas ? Here 's wishing Jimmy a successful career on screen . I never wanted him to leave SNL but what can you do ?
1 It 's rare , nowadays , to find a romantic comedy that is n't incredibly disgusting in short doses throughout the entire movie ( eg . Big Fat Greek wedding ; Me , Myself & Irene ) . There were only a couple of unnecessarily demented jokes in this movie , nothing unpalatably profane . All around , it was a cute movie with likable characters . I thought the ending was a little abrupt . It feels like they should have ended it at the world series for a real bang up finish . The acting left a little to be desired , but was made up for by the pace of the story . If I 'd known it was a Farrelly brothers movie I would have assumed it to be a stomach turning piece of garbage and not watched it , but it seems that even they are capable of accidentally making an okay movie . Good for them , I hope they pull their heads out the rest of the way and start consistently making good films .
1 This was a great movie but it had the worst ending I think I have ever seen ! ! ! The actors were great and displayed wonderful talent . The entire story was twisted and unexpecting , which , is what made it entertaining . As good as the movie was , the entire film is judged by the ending , which was terrible ! Maybe a sequel could eliminate this bad ending .
1 Here 's yet another film from the 80 's that most people just do n't know exists . This slow , picturesque ( the loving shots of the Montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of Costner 's recent " Open Range " , which also starred Robert Duval ) , and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect type of movie to watch late one night when you ca n't sleep or on a listless Sunday afternoon . Those in the right mood will be treated to a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while hunting . The performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced . Glenn Close , Robert Duval , and Wilford Brimley are pitch perfect in their portrayals , as are all the supporting players and young actors . I especially liked how director Cain ( who unfortunately has n't directed anything of note since this except the first " Young Guns " ) gives us quiet little glimpses into everyone 's personal grief . We do n't just see how the death effects the younger brother or the parents , but also the confused middle sister , the wayward uncle , his crazy wife , and the dead teenager 's girlfriend . What we essentially get here is the rural Mid - Western answer to " Ordinary People . " There 's also shades of David Lynch 's " The Straight Story " in some of the stoic downhome Mid - West morality of the folks depicted here and also in the lovingly haunting shots of the farmland they inhabit . This is one of the better and more realistic " tear - jerkers " of the era , and a nice little find for you quality movie hunters out there .
1 I had seen this film way back in the 80 's and had nearly forgotten it when I noticed it was on tv again and watched it . I remembered having liked this little sleeper when I first saw it , and I liked it even better on second viewing.<br /><br />All of the actors , especially Robert Duvall , Glenn Close , Wilfred Brimley , Frederic Forrest , and Jason Presson ( as the twelve - year - old boy who feels responsible for the accidental shooting death of his older brother ) , are superb . The film has a very genuine feel to it -- an understated , quiet , deeply moving story of a family aching with grief . The dialogue is sparse but telling , and the nonverbal acting is outstanding . Sort of like a simpler , rural version of Ordinary People sans psychiatrist but equally impressive family dynamics.<br /><br />The Stone Boy is well worth the time and emotional energy involved in watching it .
1 I do n't think a movie like this would be released today . It takes it 's time to present the depth of the characters and the plot is n't full of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />But , what this film does have : an interesting study in how families ' deal with grief . How when the language for healing and over - coming tremendous loss leaves us mute , and we rely on raw emotions instead . Grief without reason and patience is anger , even hate . And unfortunately , the lead character ( a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting ) in the film is given more than his fair share of it . He eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather ( Wilford Brimley ) who makes it clear to him that it WAS an accident . I got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart , but needed to hear those words from his parents , and to receive their forgiveness.<br /><br />What I loved about this film : the lack of dialog . There was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction , facial expressions . And the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors . Something we do n't get to do alot of with today 's films.<br /><br / >
1 The Stone Boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s . Considering how many famous or soon to be famous people are in the film , one wonders how it could have been so overlooked . This is a slow , moody , but touching account of a tragedy that befalls a farm family . The film is more or less an indictment of Midwestern stoic values and suppression of emotion . The film will not be for all tastes , but anyone who can appreciate real human drama should like it OK.<br /><br />In the early moments of the film , we see two brothers head off in the early morning hours to pick some peas and maybe shoot a duck or two if they 're lucky . While climbing through a barbed wire fence , the gun accidentally discharges and the younger boy fatally shoots his older brother . These boys have apparently never taken a hunter safety course . The way for two men to properly go through a fence like this with one gun would be as follows : First man climbs through . Second man then passes him the gun through the fence . The first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence . At no time should either man have his hands on both the gun and the fence.<br /><br />Anyway , once his brother is killed , 12-yr - old Arnold regresses into his own world . He does not even run for help after his brother is shot . He simply goes ahead and picks the peas and tells his family about the accident later . At no point during the funeral or inquest does Arnold seem to show any regret or sorrow at all . His family seems to shun him . Perhaps they are even angry at him for killing his brother . An ornery uncle played by Frederick Forrest is outwardly upset with Arnold , even though the older brother 's death allows him to hit on the kid 's girlfriend . Arnold 's parents do n't seem to understand how to deal with their son . They really do n't even try to talk to him . About the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfatherly skill by Wilford Brimley . After a while , Arnold even moves in with the old timer.<br /><br />Nothing seems to get Arnold to open up until he takes a bizarre road trip to Reno Nevada to inexplicably look up his uncle 's ex - wife . Once he meets her , he begins to emerge from his shell after apologizing to her for breaking up her marriage by starting all of the family 's turmoil with the accident . From here on , the film becomes a quick study in reconciliation and reawakening.<br /><br />The acting is hauntingly distant in most cases . Robert Duvall and Glenn Close make the perfect stoic farm parents . Forrest is good , but maybe trying too hard to channel Paul Newman 's performance in Hud . The cinematography is exceptional , too . If you like moody pictures about common folk , this one may be for you . Some even may be advised to bring some tissues . 8 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound .
1 12 year old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugene . His feelings are arrested by the fact that his family can not interact with him ( or feel it is not the right thing to do ) . His ONLY refuge is his grandfather , who is the ONLY one who seems to have compassion on him . The Realism will captivate " true-2-life " movie lovers , but will not satisfy those that desire action & thrills .
1 This movie probably never made a blip on the radar screen , but it 's got quite a bit of quality . It 's pretty lifelike , yet you think " It 's only a movie . " Duvall and Close portray common people , and you 'd never even realize they are now big - name actors . It seems that the jerk in this story is a little too old to be chasing Eugene 's girlfriend , but I guess it 's possible . It seems unlikely that the kid would travel from Montana to Nevada by himself , but I guess it 's possible . You might think that the family troubles in this movie would never happen in your own family , but I guess it 's possible . I remember Glenn Close saying something like " You think the work you do is the hardest part of your life , but it is n't . "
1 Honestly , I find this film almost too depressing for my own good . It is VERY depressing until pretty much the very end . There is no way I can justify passing judgement to any character who did things I did n't like ( well , except for the disgusting character played by Fredrick Forrest ) . But it 's still so frustrating to see people behaving this way , putting up walls around themselves when just a word or so could break the ice and promote healing.<br /><br />A horrible tragedy strikes a Montana family . They believe they 've lost one son , but it turns out they 've lost 2 . The key is , if they just communicate and face their grief together , they wo n't end up losing their second son permanently.<br /><br />But they just ca n't . Something is blocking this family from sharing their sorrows . Some family retreat into silence and resentment while certain others point fingers of blame ( and then go ahead and cheat on their poor pregnant wife by seducing the pretty girlfriend of the deceased ... that Andy character truly is a snake ! ) The only member of the family that is n't threatening Arnold in some way is his Grandpa ( Wilford Brimley ) . Grandpa seems to be able to speak to the boy without judgements or even kid gloves . He seems to know what the child is thinking about even though Arnold is n't saying much these days . It is truly a blessing for the poor kid to have that one someone he can turn to . No one else seems to grasp the fact that Arnold might be in shock , in denial , or that his way of grieving may not be the same style , or at the same speed , as they would expect . It 's so easy to judge and to be angry and to feel someone is " made of stone " just because they do n't grieve in a way we believe they ought.<br /><br />The story is very quiet and naturalistic . You 're not going to get some spoon - fed narration or some Hollywood feel - good resolution . I was very concerned by the fact that this child was so burdened with guilt that he felt it necessary to hitchhike several hundred miles to apologize to that piggy Andy 's wife , for something he should not blame himself for . Arnold may have accidentally killed his brother , but nobody is responsible for the end of that marriage , which apparently was a lousy one anyway , except for the two people in the marriage . It 's only dumb luck Arnold did n't get into the car with a pedophile or a murderer.<br /><br />Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are frustratingly effective as the parents who somehow can not find it in themselves to communicate with their son , to find out what Arnold is going through . Jason Presson , whom I 've not seen anywhere else except for a childhood favorite called EXPLORERS and a creepy ghost story called THE LADY IN WHITE , did an incredible job as Arnold , a great performance from a child actor.<br /><br />Aside from being somewhat slow at times , THE STONE BOY is an excellent , and very depressing movie .
1 Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such believability , I simply cried . Glenn Close 's role as Ruth , showed her wanting to deal with the situation , but she was under the domination of her husband . " Let him think about what he did , " Robert Duvall 's character , Joe , said staunchly . The story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother , called " The Stone Boy , " meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did , he became emotionally paralyzed . Then towards the end when Jason Presson 's character , Arnold , let it all out to a stranger , I was so broken hearted for him , that I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life . I personalized and identified with his character . Frederick Forrest 's and Gail Youngs ' roles , did NOT add not much to the film . I thought of Frederick Forrest , who played Ruth 's antagonistic , womanizing brother , Andy , as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation . His wife , Lou , played by Gail Youngs , acted like a crazy - lady smacking Arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles . I could NOT really feel sorry for these two . Though Lou tried to keep her marriage together , she was unsuccessful . Both did NOT deal with their problems effectively . They really did NOTHING for the film and were totally ridiculous . Wilfred Brimley 's minor role as the grandfather was , touching for he was the only character that showed Arnold any attention . I felt his role should have been elaborated . The players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient . However , I really liked the ending so much , I actually smiled and cried tears of joy . I felt good . The Hillermans were a family again . I actually wanted to be a part of this family . They were so realistic .
1 It 's hard to say sometimes why exactly a film is so effective . From the moment I first came across " The Stone Boy " , something told me it would be a great film . In spite of that , it seemed very unlikely that I 'd ever have the opportunity to actually see it for myself . Then , one day , while looking through the online catalogue of my local library , I saw that they had recently purchased the DVD release of this film . Which I 'm extremely glad for , because the cinematography is of a stunning depth and quality that an old VHS copy could never replicate.<br /><br />And speaking of the cinematography , I must single it out as far and above the most stunning aspect of this film . As a photographer who pursues very nearly the exact visual style portrayed in " The Stone Boy " , I 'm a firm believer in the fact that a great cinematographer can almost single - handedly carry a film . Here , he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast , and a director who understands perfectly what the story needs . But to have Juan Ruiz Anchía behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty . And you can almost never say that . Most films would never even expect such a thing of you . Scene after scene captures some detail , some little bit of visual magic that takes your breath away.<br /><br />The director , Christopher Cain , has had a long and interesting career . As far as I can gather , this film is not very representative of it . But , sometimes , to catch a director near the beginnings of his career , before all the big budgets and loss of focus , there 's a real subtle magic to be found . Cain steps back in this film , lets things happen with a life of their own , and then ever further . Much like early John Sayles films , characters are given space to breathe , time to talk . Side stories happen because they do , and that 's how life is . Cain displays a remarkable , raw , even outright painful understanding of human nature in this film.<br /><br />The acting ties much of this story together . When people talk , when they exist in this film , they do so as actual people , not held back by the fact that they are playing characters . Gina Berriault 's script allows immensely talented and respected actors like Wilford Brimley , Robert Duvall , Glenn Close , and Frederic Forrest to spend time simply existing . Whether the things they have to say are minor or of deep significance , it all comes down with the weight of pure reality.<br /><br />When you look at the actors involved , or the great soundtrack by James Horner , it seems strange that such a film be very nearly forgotten . Maybe much of what makes " The Stone Boy " what it is was the time period it was made in . There 's this 1970s hangover feeling to this picture that reminds me deeply of my own childhood . People talk of the 80s in terms of modern styles and music , but that 's not the 80s I lived in or remember . The look of the images , the understated and dark knowing quality of the acting , and the overall result should get under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in North America . I see myself in this . I see how I saw the world . And a film like " The Stone Boy " sees the world for how it truly is.<br /><br />For more of this feeling , please see:<br /><br />The Black Stallion ( 1979 ) , Never Cry Wolf ( 1983 ) , Tender Mercies ( 1983 ) , Testament ( 1983 ) , Places in the Heart ( 1984 ) , Matewan ( 1987 ) , High Tide ( 1987 ) , Driving Miss Daisy ( 1989 ) , The Secret Garden ( 1993 ) , The Secret of Roan Inish ( 1994 ) , Wendy and Lucy ( 2008 )
1 this film was almost a great imaginative film . A mixture of shakespeare , pop , jazz , and faerie tales . This movie was an imaginative twist on the Cinderella theme . Featuring a strong cast , headed by the perfectly cast Kathleen Turner , this movie had everything going for it . Everything but production values . I almost never think that a movie needs special effects or big budgets , but with an over the top production like this , it came off with the same seedy quality as every other made for tv movie . Besides better cinematography , this film was almost perfect.<br /><br / >
1 I remember watching the Disney version and watching it now makes me think it has somehow lost its magic touch . Plenty of other renditions , Ever After put aside , of Cinderella , have , in fact , lost their touch throughout the years . Then I found this production with a flawless performance by Kathleen Turner as the evil stepmother and was blown away by the phantasmagorical essence of this fantasy story that has cast me under its spell since childhood.<br /><br />We all know the story of Cinderella , a young girl who 's father died and was dominated by her wicked stepmother and stepdaughters and longs to go to the ball for one last chance for freedom . But this plot line takes a different twist in the classic Fairy Tale by causing Cinderella ( whose real name is Zizola , and is only called Cinderella by her family because of her slavery ) to be trapped in a situation of her father ( who still lives ) slowly losing himself to a dominant wife who manipulates him into playing favorites with his wife and step - daughters against his own and tries to poison him . Thus , Zizola goes out to save her father by stopping her stepmother from finding another suitor at the ball by distracting the men who come her way . There , the bored Prince Valiant has a change of heart from his dull life and falls in love with the mysterious lady in the strange dress ( forged by a water nymph named Mab ) with rose petals for slippers . < br /><br />What drew me to this film most of all was it 's original take on the old Fairy Tale that none can compare to . It does not weave a web of lies like most Cinderella stories , it does not ignore any reason as to why Cinderella would want to attend the ball and nor does it show a shallow side to the Prince as the Disney version did . Instead it shows more of Cinderella 's selfless heart more than any other production and the artwork is simply stunning ! The costumes are all beautifully made , especially Zizola 's sapphire blue ballgown to match the Marcella Plunkett 's fantastical beauty and soft , spirit - like voice . < br /><br />I would highly suggest this film for anyone who is interested in a dream - like sequence of the classic Fairy Tale with an interesting twist . My only problem is that the producers and director did not make a full collection of other Fairy Tales with this same element and the fact that the film is now out of print .
1 I 've seen this movie twice with my teenagers who love it . This one ought to be a cult fave ! The best line , " Your dress is deeply cool ! " says the Prince to Cinderella . Kathleen Turner shines as the stepmother . I also like the 1950 's era cars and motorcycles . The melancholy prince is a great departure from the typical swashbuckler . He tries to stay cool , but fails to hide his love for the fairy - tale princess - to - be . Her slipper is not glass ( truer to the original story ) , but Cinderella loses is nonetheless but gets it back from the heir to the throne . My only complaint is that it is not shown more and seems to be almost impossible to get . Hopefully Blockbuster or Amazon will start stocking this one sometime soon .
1 I thought it was an original story , very nicely told . I think all you people are expecting too much . I mean ... it 's just a made for television movie ! What are you expecting ? Some Great wonderful dramtic piece ? I thought it was a really great story for a made for television movie .... and that 's my opinion .
1 Creative use of modern and mystical elements : 1956 Cadillac convertible to transport evil stepmother Kathleen Turner ( John Waters ' " Serial Mom " ) and the 2 twisted sisters ; Queen Mab as the faerie godmother ; David Warner ( Evil in " Time Bandits " ) in redcoat at court ; Cinderella ( she 's a babe ) shovelling coal into an insatiable furnace ; Cinderella and her prince charming both look like ( and act like ) rock stars . Isle of Man locations .
1 This film moves the Cinderella story forward to the early 1950s and makes good , if eccentric , use of the Isle of Man as a background . The Ugly Sisters have become wildly glamorous upper - class English girls , and together with Kathleen Turner as the stepmother they flounce about in various wonderful period costumes . The story is altered a little from the traditional version : early on it is oddly combined with the plot of " King Lear " , and in later stages Cinderella is rather more assertive than is usual . It looks splendid and works on the whole pretty well , but does go over the top at times .
1 Damon Runyon 's world of Times Square , in New York , prior to its Disneyfication , is the basis for this musical . Joseph L. Mankiewicz , a man who knew about movies , directed this nostalgic tribute to the " crossroads of the world " that show us that underside of New York of the past . Frank Loesser 's music sounds great . We watch a magnificent cast of characters that were typical of the area . People at the edges of society tended to gravitate toward that area because of the lights , the action , the possibilities in that part of town . This underbelly of the city made a living out of the street life that was so intense.<br /><br />Some of the songs from the original production were not included in the film . We do n't know whether this makes sense , but this is not unusual for a Hollywood musical to change and alter what worked on the stage . That original cast included the wonderful Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye , and we wonder about the decision of not letting Robert Alda , Sam Levene , Isabel Bigley repeat their original roles . These were distinguished actors that could have made an amazing contribution.<br /><br />The film , visually , is amazing . The look follows closely the fashions of the times . As far as the casting of Marlon Brando , otherwise not known for his singing abilities , Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons , seem to work in the film . Sky Masterson is , after all , a man 's man , who would look otherwise sissy if he presented a different ' look ' . Frank Sinatra is good as Nathan Detroit . Jean Simmons , as Sarah Brown , does a nice job portraying the woman from the Salvation Army who suddenly finds fulfillment with the same kind of man she is trying to save.<br /><br />Vivian Blaine is a delight . She never ceases to amaze as Miss Adelaide , a woman with a heart of gold who 's Nathan Detroit 's love interest . Ms. Blaine makes a fantastic impression as the show girl who is wiser than she lets out to be . Stubby Kaye makes a wonderful job out of reprising his Nicely Nicely Johnson.<br /><br />The wonderful production owes a lot to the talented Abe Burrows , who made the adaptation to the screen . The costumes by Irene Sharaff set the right tone .
1 In 1954 Marlon Brando was THE hot actor after his performances in Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront . Frank Sinatra had yet to re - invent himself on the silver screen . But Sinatra 's portrayal as the erstwhile Nathan Detroit , helped re - establish Sinatra with his fans.<br /><br />It is a great screen version of a great play and the choices of leads and support players are terrific . Imagine a movie where Brando sings ? This was his one and only singing role as he portrayed Sky Masterson . In addition the female leads , Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine(replaying her stage role as Nathan 's long suffering girlfriend Adelade ) , put in superlative efforts . Special mention goes to the great Stubby Kaye(as Nicely Nicely ) , and with all due respect to Eric Clapton , no one 's version of Rockin ' The Boat even comes close to Stubby 's . Sheldon Leonard , who would go on to fame as TV producer of such shows as The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show does " Harry The Horse " wonders , B.S.Pulley is excellent as the harsh mannered and rough talking " Big Julie " , and even Regis Toomey offers his excellence as " Brother Arvide".<br /><br />It is one of the fun musicals to see , good comedy , and you get Sinatra and Brando . Soooooo " Luck Be A Lady Tonight " and brother ... "it 's your dice "
1 Guys and Dolls is a unique play based on the characters . Sky Masterson < br /><br />(Marlon Brando ) is a high - class gambler who takes up a bet with Nathan Detroit ( Frank Sinatra ) for one - thousand dollars . Nathan needs the money so he can < br /><br />run his usual crap game and make a fortune . The bet was that Sky would n't be able to take just any girl to Havana , Cuba and the " doll " he chose was Sarah < br /><br />Brown ( Jean Simmons ) who was in charge of a missionary . Sky finally bribes < br /><br />Sarah enough to go to Havana with him . They end up falling in love with each other , but later she accuses him of something he had no part in . Nathan ran a crap game in the missionary the night they were gone . Nathan 's 14 year fiancé Adelaide ( Vivian Blaine ) disapproves of Nathan 's gambling and tries to stop him from doing it . However , when the movie ends it all ends happy with a double < br /><br />wedding.<br /><br />The songs in this movie are just wonderful no matter who sings it . Marlon < br /><br />Brando has no singing voice at all and true they could have dubbed him but it did n't really matter . He did a wonderful acting job ( obviously seeing as it 's Brando ) and played his character very well . I have seen a few movies with Jean Simmons and thought that this movie was her weakest one , she also couldn't < br /><br />sing at all . However , the singing is made up by Frank Sinatra , Vivien Blaine , and Stubby Kaye . Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye was also in the original < br /><br />Broadway production of Guys and Dolls . Vivien Blaine had a terrific voice and was the perfect Adelaide . If you like musical , and even if you do n't , i advise you to watch this .
1 { Possible spoilers coming up ... you 've been forewarned.}<br /><br />This is absolutely one of my all time favorite musicals and movie musicals ! ( The other is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon , Tab Hunter and Ray Walston ) As we all know , sometimes the luster ( not to mention the songs ) of a show are lost in its transition from stage to screen . This is , for the most part , DEFINITELY not the case here.<br /><br />The sets are divine , bright and colorful , the characters are bigger than life and you ca n't help but love them , and Michael Kidd 's choreography is absolutely stunning . ( So glad to know they used the original Broadway choreographer)<br /><br />All of the actors " bounce the ball " ( that is , have unbeatable chemistry ) to perfection in this film . Frank and Marlon are absolutely believable as the proprietor of the oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York , and the most notorious gambler who bets on even the most minute things-- such as his fever going up to 104 if he does n't take penicillin . Sweet , fresh faced Jean Simmons is perfect for the role of Sarah ( although it is true , her singing pipes are not as outstanding as that of Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman)-- the mission doll with a heart of gold and a drive to heal all . And last but certainly not least ( on my list anyway ) is Miss Vivian Blaine , reprising her Broadway role as Miss Adelaide-- the Hot Box lead singer and dancer who would like to finally end her 14 year engagement to Nathan with marriage , and rid herself of the psychosomatic cold he 's given her.<br /><br />First off , kudos to Stubby Kaye and B.S. Pulley as they reprise their Broadway roles as Nicely - Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet . There were never two more loveable gamblers than these guys.<br /><br />Brando is superb , as usual , and though he 's not got the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher , you forget it-- as he has this sense of determination to bring all he can to his role as Sky Masterson . " Luck Be A Lady " gives me chills every time I see him perform the number . Especially enjoyable is hearing him say " Daddy ... I got cider in my ear." < br /><br />Simmons is charming and pleasant in a role well suited to her looks , voice and the way she carries herself . You long so dearly for her not only to win Sky ( or , toward the end , believe him ) , but to help people overcome their gambling , drinking and other sins , and live a life with God . Her rendition of " If I Were A Bell " is splendid , to say the least!<br /><br />Sinatra is the man . He is so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit-- and here he sings parts that Sam Levene from the Broadway cast never could ( terrific actor , but the chap was tone deaf ... go figure ) . I really enjoyed the addition of the song " Adelaide " ... wish some guy would sing like that to ME . Frankie 's cool , slick demeanor transcends the boundaries of this movie . But most importantly , you want him to marry Adelaide.<br /><br />And speaking of Adelaide , Vivian Blaine is just sheer perfection in this role . From the accent to her belting out " Adelaide 's Lament " , she 's just terrific . And she 's also my favorite part of the entire movie . She really makes you feel for Adelaide ... especially when she cries right before and then again during " Sue Me " . I still have n't decided whether I like " Pet Me Poppa " better than " Bushel and a Peck " ... maybe I like them equally . Either way , she does fantastic with those as well as " Take Back Your Mink . " ( I 'm sad that they left out " hollanderize " from the film ... ) She 's absolutely MARVELOUS , not to mention hilarious , and my favorite part of the entire film.<br /><br />One of the best things about this movie is their lingo . It 's a mixture of high class and street slang . Never do they use " It 's " , " I 'll " or " That 's . " It 's always " It is " , " I will " and " That is . " Overall , Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite all time movies and musicals , and it 's one that you should take time to watch every time it comes on . My only complaint ? No " Marry The Man Today . " Now THAT 'S a good song .
1 I 'm intrigued by the strong sense of favour towards ( or sympathy for ! ) Sinatra in the other reviews here . I 've read elsewhere that Sinatra never seems to have forgiven anyone for * not * being cast as Sky Masterson.<br /><br />OK , so who would n't want to be cast as Sky Masterson ?  it 's a great part : the charismatic successful gambler who makes a grave mistake when he allows himself to be suckered into a bet , in which he must take Salvation Army Sargeant Sarah Brown on a date to Cuba , or lose . It 's not the money  it 's the pride , but he and she meet their match . Meanwhile Nathan Detroit must juggle his long - suffering fiancée Adelaide with trying to find a spot for a craps game which will make him rich if it does n't alienate his fiancée forever first.<br /><br />The film started life as a series of short stories by Damon Runyon : that 's his unique dialogue you hear , and those are his great character names , and that 's his horse - racing / nightclub / late night gambling world . Then it became a musical , and you ca n't help but feel that in film form it never really left the stage . The camera is unusually static and the sets remarkably  and not pleasingly  flat and childlike . Fortunately the music is so great , I do n't care that much.<br /><br />My absolute favourite thing about this film , though , is the singing and acting of the two non - singers , Brando ( as Sky ) and Jean Simmons ( as Sargeant Sarah Brown ) . Of course , putting pro singers into these roles would have produced better music ; but what surely gets forgotten is that two such excellent actors brought something else to the party instead : what they lacked in vocal talent they more than made up for in gusto , acting ability , and pathos , pathos , pathos . You 're with Sky as he argues with Sarah against reason , steadiness , pipes and safety . You enjoy Sarah 's loosening up under the influence of Cuban " milk " . You feel completely the suddenness and passion of their scene in the courtyard with bells ringing and an hour to go before the plane takes them home . As Sky rightly says , it 's " chemistry " . Pro singers  be they Broadway belters or smooth crooners  ca n't necessarily be relied on to make this happen . ( And they certainly did n't . ) I read somewhere that Brando criticised Sinatra for not putting all of himself into his role of Nathan Detroit . Sinatra in turn was infuriated by Brando 's four - take acting method . As a Brando fan ( does it show ? ! ) I 'm bound to take the other side , but I ca n't imagine that this film would have been the much - adored classic it is today if Brando and Simmons had n't been in it with their wonderful chemistry ; Brando 's unpredictability ; Simmons ' face , all pink cheeks and brown hair , drunk and ashamed in a Cuban bar . Beautiful . I 'll always want a copy of this film lying around in case I need to feel good again . You 'll forgive me if give some of the Nathan ( sleep)talking parts the 100 % brush - off though , wo n't you ? You wo n't ? Oh , be quiet and have some more of Mindy 's cheesecake !
1 Nathan Detroit ( Frank Sinatra ) is the manager of the New York 's longest- established floating craps game , and he needs $ 1000 to secure a new location . Confident of his odds , he bets the city 's highest - roller , Sky Masterson ( Marlon Brando ) , that he ca n't woo uptight missionary Sarah Brown ( Jean Simmons ) . ' Guys and Dolls ( 1955 ) ' is such a great musical because it deftly blends the contrasting styles of film and stage . During a dazzling opening sequence , crowds of pedestrians move in rhythm , stopping and starting as though responding to backstage cues . Even the walking movements themselves are stylised and angular , halfway between a walk and a dance . Mankiewicz 's New York City is a glittering flurry of art deco colour and movement , a fantasy world so completely removed from reality that even the business of underground gambling and criminal thuggery seems perfectly genial . < br /><br />As I write this review , I 've just received word that Jean Simmons has passed away , age 80 . This , unbelievably , was the first time I 'd seen her in a film , yet she dazzled me from the beginning . Her idealistic and sexually - repressed Sarah comes out of her shell following an alcohol binge in Havana , letting loose with an adorably playful rendition of " If I Were A Bell . " Even though both Simmons and Brando were non - singers , producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to dub their vocals , contending that " maybe you do n't sound so good , but at least it 's you . " Despite Goldwyn 's backhanded confidence , the pair both do well to carry entire musical numbers themselves . Simmons suggests the same child - like liveliness that Audrey Hepburn might have brought to the role , and Brando exudes such self - assurance and charisma that it does n't matter that his singing voice is n't quite there .
1 At least something good came out of Damon Runyon 's misguided attempt to sentimentalize the Mafia . " Guys and Dolls , " the seemingly indestructible stage musical , was captured on film in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ( " All About Eve " ) in a colorful , enjoyable movie that featured an all - star cast including Vivian Blaine ( from the original Broadway show ) , Jean Simmons ( whose character bears an odd resemblance to Audrey Hepburn in " Roman Holiday " ) and two of the all - time great leading men , Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando , both of whom had recently won Oscars for Best Supporting Actor ( " From Here To Eternity " ) and Best Actor ( " On the Waterfront " ) and were on the top of their game . One listen to Brando singing " Luck Be a Lady Tonight " speaks volumes about where the early Dylan got his voice . Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson , who brings down the house with " Sit Down You 're Rocking The Boat . " The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds yet another page to his rogue 's gallery of screen gangsters . The film has a bright , cartoonish look , anticipating the Pop Art of the early 1960s . The characters speak in a stylized patois , apparently based on Yiddish idioms . Although the film 's social attitudes and gender roles are dated , it 's all great fun , and even the gentle kidding of the Salvation Army is harmless and reflects no real animosity toward organized religion . Just seeing Sinatra and Brando in the same film is reason enough to watch this movie , but it has lots of other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes .
1 Joseph L. Mankiewicz is not remembered by most today as one of the finest directors in Hollywood history , but this film proves that he is . Already a success by doing sophisticated American dramas such as A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve as well as successfully adapting Shakespeare to life in Julius Caesar , Mankiewicz does a marvelous job of bringing this hit Broadway play to film and does it with style . Marlon Brando is perfect as Sky Masterson , even if he ca n't sing too well . He is the only actor who could pull it off perfectly wit his sheer coolness and clarity . Frank Sinatra is a wonderful singer , as expected , and does a good job of acting as Nathan Detroit . Jean Simmons is also very good as Sarah Brown and her scenes with Brando sizzle with great chemistry . All supporting actors do their part , especially Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse in a very funny bit . Still , Mankiewicz should be given most of the credit for bringing a fine musical in its own right to the screen in such a way that it feels authentic in many scenes but is still a story in its own world . All in all , Guys and Dolls is a great musical and works on many levels it normally should not have .
1 I love this movie . My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed.<br /><br />It 's true that Frank Sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but it 's also nice that it 's not just another Frank Sinatra movie where it 's mostly him doing the singing.<br /><br />I actually thought it was better to use Marlon Brando 's own voice as he has the voice that fits and I could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voice.<br /><br />Stubby Kaye 's " Sit Down , You 're Rockin ' the Boat " is a foot - tappin ' , sing - a - long that I just love . He is a hard act to follow with his version and I still like his the best.<br /><br />Vivian Blaine is just excellent in this part and " Adelaide 's Lament " is my favorite of her songs.<br /><br />I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part . Maybe I would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part , it made sense.<br /><br />Michael Kidd 's choreography is timeless . If it were being re staged in the year 2008 , I would not change a thing.<br /><br />I find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version but this kept the feel of the stage , even though it was on film.<br /><br />I thought the movie was well cast . I performed in regional versions of this and it 's one of my favorites of that period .
1 Along with South Pacific , Guys and Dolls is for grown - ups - - it is sassy , sexy , and full of men being men and women being strung along.<br /><br />There is an energy and drive that makes this stand out from the pack - the strength of Jean Simmond 's performance , and the charm of a young Brando , and an already masterful Sinatra add much to the overall feel and look of the piece.<br /><br />Guys and Dolls wins as it is unashamedly what it is : an MGM musical.<br /><br />Still good to look at and listen too with great tunes and dance numbers - it will remain one of the classics of 20th Century cinema and be watched with pleasure for years to come.<br /><br />Warmly recommended .
1 This movie makes me want to fall in love all over again!I am naming my next daughter " Adelaide " . Just so that someone who sings like Ol Blue eyes can swoon her one day , and feel the butterflies I felt hearing it sung , and it was n't even to me ! I give it a 9/10
1 Oh , this is such a glorious musical . There 's a bit of miscasting -- Frank Sinatra is sorely miscast as the Jewish Nathan Detroit , though it only becomes evident on " Sue Me " , which is a distinctly Jewish song . Sadly , the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs from the show , " Marry the Man Today " , and replaced it with an inferior Sinatra showpiece . With these two flaws in mind , the movie is otherwise magnificent . Jean Simmons shines as Sarah Brown . Marlon Brando ca n't sing worth beans , but pulls it off anyway . Stubby Kaye wonderfully reprises his Broadway role ( it was written for him ) . Damon Runyon 's language and pacing and humor come through quite well . This is on my see - it - every - chance - I - get list .
1 This musical was not quite what I expected , foremost being there were n't many scenes between Brando and Sinatra . As it was based on a Damon Runyon story , I expected irony and surprise , of which there was one really good one - when we find that Sinatra 's gang has used the Salvation Army office for their crap game while Brando was in Havana with Simmons . If course it comes at the right moment too , when Brando brings her back . I really did n't expect much from Brando as a singer , but he surprised me . He was n't great but he was just fine in the role . His big number in the sewer , however , with the rest of Sinatra 's boys was the only place I felt Brando 's voice was weak . He just did n't have the power the grand climax demanded . Overall I found the scenes between Brando and Simmons to be filled with electricity , something I did n't think would happen when we first see Simmons by herself , and later when we 're introduced to Brando in the restaurant with Sinatra trying to pull a fast one on him . It was n't until Brando goes to her office that the story came to life . < br /><br />Frank Sinatra , on the other hand , was flat , even his vocal performances . And Vivian Blaine , who I never heard of , but who I guess played the role on Broadway , just seemed to slow the proceedings down . The scenes between her and Sinatra were obvious . Also , her songs felt the weakest to me both in terms of advancing story or character . On top of that , all the Goldwyn Girls numbers seemed shoe horned in , just there for glitz . For example , when Frank meets with Brando in the nightclub , we just cut to the stage routine for the cat number - then it cuts back to the guys who continue on as if there had n't been any dance number at all . Whenever Brando and Simmons were on screen , I was having a great time , but each time we return to the Sinatra - Blaine story , my interest level waned . < br /><br />As for the songs , there were some good ones , particularly the very first number with Stubby Kaye , the Fugue for Tinhorns number ( Can Do ! ) . That 's a great song and it reminded me of the very first song in The Music Man - Cash for the Merchandise ... whatever it 's called . And the number in the sewer - I could n't help but be reminded of " Cool " from West Side Story - which brings me to a point . I really did not like the art direction in this film . The fake Times Square was just so completely phony it drew attention to itself . Same for the Havana sequence , and particularly the sewer . I realize back in 1955 most musicals were shot on sets , but things were changing - Carousel , for example , made great use of location photography . Even On the Town shot scenes in Mahattan in 1949 . By the time we get to West Side Story in 1961 it 's a given that stuff taking place in Manhattan had to be actually shot in Manhattan . So by comparison , Guys and Dolls set - bound Manhattan felt dated and more than a little too cute . And changing Lindy 's to Mindy 's - did they really have to do that for legal reasons ? Now , I always thought Guys and Dolls was a musical about Sinatra and Brando and their adventures with various girls . It was much more focused than that , which is to its credit . In that regard it is much better than Les Girls , which was interesting in it 's own right , but had a certain shallowness to it . < br /><br />My one major complaint about Guys and Dolls , and I do n't know if this is endemic to the original stage show , but when Jean Simmons realizes that Brando never took any money for a bet that he made with Sinatra and even said that he lost the bet , she just runs off to find him and we cut to the wedding . It seems to me a scene between Brando and Simmons would have added to the impact of the story . To see Brando come around as she came around to him would have been a great scene . There is such a scene in The Music Man ( SPOILERS AHEAD ) , when Harold and Marion have that duet while he 's waiting for her to change . She 's upstairs in her house , he 's down on the sidewalk . He 's singing 76 Trombones . She 's singing Goodnight My Someone . They suddenly switch and sing each other 's songs - a beautiful way to convey their cross over to each other . It 's an emotional high moment of the film . Still , Guys and Dolls had a lot going for it .
1 Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra HATED each other while doing this film and in the years following it . Brando asked Sinatra for some singing lessons , but Sinatra ( who was already upset over the fact that he was cast as Nathan Detroit , when he wanted the part of Skye Masterson)wanted to be the star singer in the production and did n't want any one to be better than he was . He told Brando to get lost , so to get back at him Marlon kept screwing up the scene in the diner where Sinatra was eating cheesecake so that he would have to keep eating , eating and eating . In the later years , Sinatra gave Brando the nickname " Mumbles " or " Mr . Mumbles " because of the way he talks .
1 Guys and Dolls is a movie itching for a remake . It was made forty - eight years ago . Its two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds . Although a remake , with big stars now , would be box - office success , it would not be able to capture the magic that went into this version . Its boundless energy ca n't be recaptured , nor can the pure joy you get when watching something like this : a huge , widescreen , big entertainment movie.<br /><br />Marlon Brando ( who last clocked in at 409 lbs . last time I heard ) plays Sky Masterson , one of the biggest gamblers in New York . Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit , whose as - often - as - he - can - find - a - speakeasy - for - it crap game is city - wide famous . However , when the one place he has left to hold it is charging $ 1,000 , Detroit needs the money fast . He bets Masterson $ 1,000 that he ca n't take missionary Sarah Brown ( Jean Simmons ) to Havana with him the next day.<br /><br />Guys and Dolls is basically nothing more than unsavory types singing and dancing , which usually , as it does here , add up to fun . It 's obvious to see how this was a Broadway musical : there were n't that many sets , and the scenes were long . If I was to complain about one thing , it 's how uneven the songs were . At times , there were two songs in a scene ; other times , thirty minutes went by without one . Guys and Dolls is never boring , just a great time.<br /><br />My rating : 8/10<br /><br />Not Rated .
1 I just want to add my two cents worth , and forgive me if I am repeating something that has already been posted , but I feel it is worth reminding people of the everlovin ' genius of Damon Runyon . Without the wonderfully street , hilarious writings of Damon Runyon this film would never have been made - nor most of the other great classics that deal with gamblers & the like from before 1960 . Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper man , and he was from Colorado , but he sure did _ get _ the street scene of the East Coast . If you are not a dedicated fan of old Hollywood comedies , I would recommend a few other flicks from Damon Runyon 's writings ; " the Lemondrop Kid , " and " Little Miss Marker , " both feature Bob Hope , who , aside from his politics , has always been a funny man . ( As a West Coast liberal , I find his politics fairly funny , too ! ) Damon Runyon lives ! ! ! !
1 This is a Frank Loesser masterpiece of amusing lyrics , competent themes and solid construction by those who adapted Damon Runyon material to the musical 's " book " . What is surprising about the film is how seamlessly the musical numbers flow from the storyline . Abe Burrows did the book with contributions from Loesser ; Michael Kidd was the choreographer , and the outstanding art direction was contributed by Joseph Wright . The storyline can be told in two sentences . Nathan Detroit , played by Frank Sinatra , needs cash to finance his permanent floating crap game to amuse Big Julie , a Chicago Mob Boss . He bets odds - player Sky Masterson , well - presented by Marlon Brando , that he can not get a Salvation Army girl to go to Havana with him ; Masterson wins the bet , saves the Mission , falls in love with the girl , gets the gamblers and riffraff at the crap game to attend a service , and tells everybody the lady was impervious to his charms -- a complete lie . Of course he ends up with the lady ; and Detroit marries hi long - suffering fiancée , Vivian Blaine . Others in the cast include Stubby Kaye , Johnny Silver , Robert Keith , B.S. Pulley as Big Julie the Mobster , Sheldon Leonard , Regis Toomey , Mary Alan Kokanson , Kathryn Givney as the Salvation Army leader , Veda Ann Borg and Jean Simmons as the tepid Salvation Army girl , Sarah Brown . The famous musical numbers in this award - winning Broadway smash include " Fugue For Tinhorns " , " Guys and Dolls " , " Luck Be a Lady " , " I 'll Know " , " A Person Could Develop a Cold " , and " The Oldest Established Permnanet Floating Crap Game in New York ! " . Joseph L. Mankiewicz of " Cleopatra " and " Letter to Three Wives " Fame directed the proceedings ; and the flow of the work is very interestingly and successfully kept moving . He is equally adept at getting fine dialogue acting and directing such huge numbers as " Luck Be Lady " , the varied and challenging brawl section , the Havana " A Woman in Love " section created for the film that precedes it , the presenting of the title song " Guys and Dolls " and " Pet Me , Poppa " set in the club where Blaine works . The acting is very uneven . Simmons seems wrong for the part at times , Brando gets by with the singing and is very good much of the time on instinct , charm and underplaying , even in the comedy . scenes . Sinatra tries hard but is wrong for the role for several reasons as Nathan Detroit ; Blaine is a bit too - theatrical in selling her numbers , which she of course sings professionally . Leonard , Toomey , Kaye , Keith and Pulley do what is asked and more at all points . The stylized opening and closing are made to work well ; all in all , this film is a triumph for Loesser 's amiable and subtle lyrics , for director Mankiewicz as ringmaster , and for the genre of musicals itself , so ably justified in this instance . Delightful and very different .
1 This is what the musical genre was made of . Humor , talent , romance , and action all rolled into one.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra was wonderful . Nothing else needs to be said . Marlon Brando , although not a singer , did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of Sky Masterson . The fact that he could n't sing added to his character . The ladies in the film were alright , but the men in the movie definitely stole the show.<br /><br />It is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age . It connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh.<br /><br />Definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed !
1 It 'd be easy to call Guys and Dolls great . It 's got Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando ( and , contrary to Sinatra 's original wishes , the casting works ) , it 's got a really cool 1950s feel , even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption . And most of the songs are often a lot of fun , and catchy , and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself . If it 's not entirely as great as some others of its ilk , it should n't be any fault of the filmmaker Joseph L. Mankiewicz . Not all the songs entirely click , and a little of the dialog feels like it 's being performed for the stage as opposed to film ( it 's hard to tell at times- Brando and Sinatra straddle the line so often that one has to watch carefully to tell when one plays for the camera or for the " stage " , while the actress playing Adele is better for stage than screen).<br /><br />The plot is one of those winners that works well for its period , even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of 1999 's She 's All That ( well , not quite , but close ) . A gambler ( and 14-year betrothed ) , played by Sinatra , wants to host a big - time game , but is told that the " heat is on " , meaning the cops are on watch . So , he has only one choice to host the game , with a thousand dollar tab . The only way he can get it is through a big - time bet with fellow gambler Brando , who 's put on to make a wild wooing job of a mission worker . It allows for the predictable twists in the story , in the sudden turn - on - turn - off of the charms of the character , of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets ( gangsters and dancers and the " saitn " played by Jean Simmons who falls for Brando ) . It is , in its basic concept , about this whole world of guys and dolls , and how to balance one or the other- obviously without getting married or too compromised.<br /><br />Mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece , even when keeping still with the camera on the subject , and his stars are properly reeled in . Hell , even Brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply THE method actor and shows his chops for singing and big - star quality . The story and characters eventually wind down to what you 'd hope will happen , and that 's fine . All we ask for- and what we get- is entertainment in good spurts of witty , involving dialog , and a few songs and dances that bring the house down ( my favorites were the number with the lady - cats at the club , Luck be a Lady , and the two numbers down in Havana , Cuba ) . A-
1 Just saw this movie version of Frank Loesser 's Guys and Dolls for the third time with my mother who had never seen this before . She was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando . And she thought the Havana sequences where Simmons and Brando dance up a storm were excellent . Those were pretty impressive to me too and were usually the highlights of the film . Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz , this movie which originated as a story by Damon Runyon takes a while with the slow pacing of the non - musical scenes at first but pulls you in after a while . The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was n't as compelling to me but still had their charms especially during the " Sue Me " number . Also loved Stubby Kaye 's " Sit Down , You 're Rocking the Boat " number and the performances of Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully . With a theatrical look throughout , Guys and Dolls is n't a great film musical but certainly a very good one .
1 Entertaining musical where Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000.00 to get up a floating crap game so he entices Sky Masterson to try and get salvation army girl , played by Jean Simmons , to go with Masterson to Havana.<br /><br />5 years later , Simmons would be in the missionary again in the fabulous " Elmer Gantry . " There she was sister Sharon and here she is Sister Sarah . Same temperament , different story.<br /><br />Frank Sinatra is that devilish Nathan Detroit . He has been engaged to Vivian Blaine for 14 years and she loathes his gambling habit.<br /><br />In a real change of pace , Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando who actually did his own singing here!<br /><br />The film is saved by superlative choreography . Those dance and singing routines are fabulous . They are especially realized by Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely ( Johnson).<br /><br />All in all , it 's a very nice production .
1 One of the best musicals ever made , this is an example of where the producers and director were not afraid to pick actors for their talent , rather than for what people might expect . The lighting and set are unique , giving it a very interesting effect ( this has a special name that I can not think of ) . The dialog is also unique in that no contractions are used . The movie is well paced , beautifully acted and interesting from start to finish . A real joy is the MUSIC . Such an array of first - rate songs , from beginning to end , that are perfectly performed and orchestrated . Also , the music is very original and very memorable , and I think superior to many musicals from the thirties through the sixties . It certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musicals , that might have only two or three . Not bad for a director with no experience in this type of movie . Another quality is that it is fresh each time one sees it .
1 Big splashy film of the Broadway music . Nathan ( Frank Sinatra ) loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games . Blonde loving Adelaide ( Vivian Blaine ) wants to marry him IF he gives up craps . He decides on one last game when Sky Masterson ( Marlon Brando ! ) , who bets big , is in town . He bets Sky that he ca n't get mission worker Sarah Brown ( Jean Simmons ) to go with him to Havana . That may sound like a strange plot summary but so is the movie!<br /><br />This is a real mixed bag -- there 's some wonderful stuff here . The songs are all good and the dancing is incredible . The real show stopper is at the crap game at the end . Also Brando is really quite good here -- it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing but he pulls it off . I have to admit seeing big , bulky Brando pulling off some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun ! Also Sinatra is pretty good and Blaine is just wonderful as his long - suffering girlfriend . Her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here.<br /><br />Now for the bad parts -- Jean Simmons is a wonderful actress but she 's stuck with a drab colorless role and ca n't do much with it . The movie is far too long at 150 minutes -- the scenes between Brando and Simmons really drag and should have been shortened . Also most of the characters speak in very precise English -- contractions are never used . Maybe it 's trying to be amusing coming out of the mouths of gangsters but I found it jarring and it kept throwing me out of the movie.<br /><br />It 's worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while . I give it a 7 .
1 Guys and Dolls has to be one of my favorite musical movies ever . It is a very fun movie to watch and nothing more . it embodies what people have forgotten about musicals - musicals were made to entertain , not to to preach . Nowadays we have Rent and Chicago which are great musicals and good movies but they fail to bring us solid entertainment with no strings attached . The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando , the guy ca n't sing ! It was very annoying to listen to him sing and talk when I could n't understand him . If it were n't for Marlon I would have given this 10 stars . Guys and Dolls provides old - fashioned entertainment that we rarely get these days . Watch it to have a good time ! !
1 I wo n't try to speculate as to what Brando was attempting . At his best he turns in such oddball performances , insinuating so many things at once , that it does n't seem he does anything so much as play by unfailing instinct . Often it seems he is calling attention to some favored aspect of his character over all others , a concentration which , if followed , turns out something of a red herring , as he turns out subtler , craftier than at first appeared . This is a mastery of artifice , not naturalism , as might be associated with the Method . The role of Sky Masterson , as Mankiewicz so wonderfully realized , seems tailored for him , which is to begin with odd , and odd still at the end , because whatever it is Brando has done , he has managed a grace maybe all his own , but a consummate grace nonetheless -- again , odd , coming from an actor with limited musical ability , not ever before or after associated with the musical comedy . Jean Simmons , also oddly cast , is not quite as impressive , but certainly above just - adequate , really delightful in the Havana sequence , and never less than enjoyable throughout . < br /><br />And yet ... perhaps because actors are both so concentrated on what it is they are doing , and characters on what it is they intend of each other , there does n't seem to be the lovers ' " chemistry " brought up so insistently more than once . Brando / Sky Masterson and Simmons / Sister Sarah respectively feed off one another well enough , but I for one do n't see more beyond that . In a movie this outrightly dazzling and entertaining ( and most everything about it , craft - wise , is just that -- dazzling ) , that lack would seem something tactfully and easily overlooked , but so much would depend upon true chemistry ! An , at least partial , transformation of the characters through such chemistry , would lend something positively moving to the final scene . As it is , one leaves this film certainly delighted , but not really moved , except in a way as to negate the trueness of the union . Note Sister Sarah marries in her missionary 's uniform , Sky Masterson in his same natty man - about - town duds rather than wedding tux . And they have changed back to those from their previous scene!<br /><br />Funnily enough ( that is , insightfully ) , the most touching , and most serious , scene is , I think , between Brando and Vivian Blaine , as Sinatra / Nathan Detroit 's doll , Adelaide , the only scene where these two are exclusively together , not least because there is just no hint of flirtation between them even though it takes place in Adelaide 's dressing - room while Adelaide is about to change . Though one may submit there is no place for that , Sky really is the type to " check out " Adelaide in this sort of circumstance . He is even there to tell Adelaide Nathan will not be meeting her to elope . Adelaide and Sky are both true in their respective ways to Nathan , even piteous of him , as is demonstrated through a tone in their exchange . Adelaide is of course also frustrated and disappointed , but her anger is mitigated by her deeper feeling for Nathan , as Sky is admonishing her that she ca n't love a man and then wish him to be someone else.<br /><br />Guys and Dolls is another turn at the battle of the sexes , around the themes of gambling and salvation . Since both the compulsive gambler and the salvation seeker are more or less unconsciously courting despair , there just may be a dark secret deliberately behind Brando 's and Simmons ' lack of chemistry . After all , that lack may well denote an excess of narcissistic preoccupation ( echoed by the Sinatra / Blaine pairing , though with considerably less self - deception involved ) , which might explain Brando 's and Simmons ' odd , rather provoking , interpretations of Sky Masterson and Sister Sarah . I realize Simmons may be mostly depicting coldness and skepticism , but Brando , though playing to confront her , is n't exactly heated and eager , and is more than keeping his distance -- he 's also assimilating it , keeping his balance through it . His boldness consists in merely playing against her -- the trip to Cuba , a kiss , whatever it takes -- but he is not actually set on winning through seducing her so much as beating her then in her own turf . This may be shrewd , as playing to zeal may be the only way to get to the missionary , and through . But it makes Sky 's transition from merely trying to win a bet to actually wanting Sarah Brown a little less than persuasive . Yet why does he want her ? What does falling in love mean to Sky ? I find the only way to get around this is by indeed accepting his humanity has kicked in , and that he does not want to end up a mere cad toward Sister Sarah , so he does , as he 's promised her , need to deliver the sinners to her prayer meeting , make good by his " marker , " as he puts it , as a way of winning her back when it seems he had already won only to lose her . But this still denotes self - concern more than anything . However , it also allows for Sarah Brown 's own self - concern , as Sky will placate the missionary in her in order to get back the lover . Neither , at least it seems , will change much by their union , except perhaps in the acceptance of the other . Yet that would seem an all but fatally uneasy proposition : acceptance of is still quite a cry away from achieving happiness in the other , let alone the transcendence they each seem to imply by " chemistry . " And behind all this , I suspect is Mankiewicz 's full knowing.<br /><br />For all those who might say , in defense of Guys and Dolls yet , that not much can be expected from musicals by way of depth , I need only remind them Cabaret , The Three - penny Opera , Carousel , A Star is Born , even The Sound of Music , which I do n't care for as much ( and one can keep adding to this list without even reaching forward toward post - Cabaret musicals ) , all wrap gorgeous music and dance around dire anxieties .
1 Had I been familiar with the stage production of Guys and Dolls before seeing the movie , I might not be as fond of it as I am . Although in all fairness , I would probably still like the film production better because of my general adoration of both Brando ( for his acting ) and Sinatra ( for his voice , although he is quite the actor as well , see The Manchurian Candidate or From Here to Eternity.)<br /><br />As for some of the other reviewers ' statements about the songs , I have the Broadway soundtrack and though Isabel Bingley 's voice outshines that of Jean Simmons , it is not more pleasant . I find it to have a rather shrill quality . Jean Simmons ' voice is much more realistic , though admittedly , that is not always a huge concern in musicals . Also the only time I particularly noticed Marlon Brando 's particularly weak vocal register was during his rendition of " Luck Be A Lady " and only there because I was previously familiar with Sinatra 's version . I also find Vivian Blaine 's voice to be much more pleasing in the movie than it is on Broadway . And Sinatra 's voice alone would be able to redeem the failings of all the others , if they indeed were in need of redemption . ( They were n't ) It is infinitely better than Sam Levene 's , particularly in my favorite song , ' Sue Me ' . < br /><br />Also , the complaint that lots of songs were omitted from the movie for inferior songs , I beg to differ . ' A Bushel and a Peck ' is hardly a gem and the song that replaced it , ' Pet Me Poppa " and its accompanying performance is more Hot Box material . I personally do not care for ' Marry the Man Today ' at all and rejoice that it was not included in the movie . I adore ' I 've Never Been In Love Before ' , and though it was not sung in the movie , the instrumental version can be heard when Nathan is in Adelaide 's dressing room . The song ' A Woman In Love'expresses the same sentiment equally well and probably in a range that both of the stars could more capably reach . And the movie would n't be the same without the song ' Adelaide ' , not included on Broadway . In fact , if the movie soundtrack were available for sale , I 'd recommend purchasing it instead of the Broadway . < br /><br />Though I have not seen the original production , I can not imagine that the acting would be superior to that of the movie 's lead actors . < br /><br />The important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and songs do not make it any less so .
1 It was originally meant to be a film that Gene Kelly would star in , but when the makers could n't get him they got " the greatest actor in the world " , and the result is pretty good . Basically Nathan Detroit ( Frank Sinatra ) is having trouble doing what he does best , setting up a high stakes crap dice game , because he needs $ 1000 to get the place . So to get the money he needs , he has a $ 1000 bet with old friend Sky Masterson ( Marlon Brando ) that he ca n't get Sergeant Sarah Brown ( Great Expectations ' Golden Globe winning , and BAFTA nominated Jean Simmons ) to go with him to Havana . Meanwhile , Nathan is having trouble trying to get rid of the woman who wants him to ask her hand in marriage , Miss Adelaide ( Vivian Blaine ) . Also starring Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan , Stubby Kaye as Nicely Nicely Johnson and B.S. Pulley as Big Jule . An interesting romantic comedy musical , with Brando singing all his own songs , and Sinatra being smooth and cool . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction - Set Decoration , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design and Best Music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge , it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source , and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy . Frank Sinatra was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons , Marlon Brando was number 30 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols , he was number 4 on 100 Years , 100 Stars - Men , Sinatra was number 35 , and Brando was number 1 on The World 's Greatest Actor , " Luck Be a Lady " was number 42 on 100 Years , 100 Songs for , the film was number 23 on 100 Years of Musicals , and it was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Musicals . Very good !
1 I bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart . I am glad I did . It was very entertaining listening to Sean Connery and playing the game . I thought the graphics were the best I have ever seen in a movie / game remake . The bonus levels were very hard ! The sniper one I think was too hard , it made me so frustrated I did n't play the game for a week and a half . There were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it . < br /><br />The only thing I might change was the upgrade system . I did n't notice any difference from un - upgraded equipment to the upgraded , such as buying an armor upgrade did n't seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter . I really liked the Q copter . I think the developers did a good job .
1 Good : Engaging cinematic firefights , great presentation , vehicles are actually fun to drive , fairly appealing multiplayer , faithful to the movie , and the list goes on.<br /><br />Bad : Main missions are a bit short.<br /><br />This game defines what a " good " third person shooter(not necessarily a spy - game ) is . Great firefights carry on the story and make you want to complete EVERY single mission through , and unlock all the genuine bonuses the game has to offer . The hype this game had , was lived up to , and I personally think you should buy it , and hook up with a couple of friends and play this one . Loads of fun . < br /><br />The sound in this game , is a rip - roaring achievement from a few previous bond games , and firing a weapon , really feels like you 're firing a weapon . It ties in with the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy.<br /><br />All in all , this game makes you excited and satisfied after you make it through , and some multiplayer that can compete with the standards of the crafty James Bond " Nightfire " game for gamecube .
1 The goal of any James Bond game is to make the player feel like he is fulfilling an ultimate fantasy : step into the shoes of Agent 007 . " FRWL " comes closer to this goal than any other game , because this time you control the real James Bond . No offense to Pierce Brosnan , who made a fantastic Bond and loaned his voice and likeness to " EON " , but Sean Connery was the original James Bond , and there will never be anyone who comes close to his level of cool.<br /><br />I must say at this point , like many others who have reviewed this game , that Sean 70 year old voice does n't fit his 30 year old image on screen , and this takes some getting used to , but it 's certainly worth it . He makes lines like " Bond   James Bond " and " Shaken , not stirred " into a big deal again . But controlling Sir Sean as he takes on the evil organization known as OCTOPUS is , as Bond said in " Octopussy " , " only the tip of the tentacle . " The awesomeness of the game begins with the opening gun barrel . It 's the original gun barrel from the movies . Then you take on first mission , rescuing the Prime Minister 's hottie blonde daughter from terrorists at Parliament , and everything from the cars to the clothes is perfectly retro . The world of the game is truly the world of the original James Bond , right down to the classic rock - n - roll rendition of the James Bond theme that finally plays during a key moment late in the game , as Bond infiltrates a secret factory.<br /><br />After the game 's opening , the plot faithfully follows the plot of the movie " FRWL . " James Bond is sent to Turkey to retrieve a Lektor device from a Russian cipher clerk who claims she has a crush on him . In Turkey , Bond teams up with lovable sidekick Kerim Bey . Bond must retrieve the device , protect the damsel in distress , and get both safely back to London . Bond screenwriter Bruce Feirstein worked on the script , and he 's done a good job of making the game the same but different to the movie . The characters from the movie are all recreated well , but some are better than others . The impersonators voicing villains Rosa Klebb and Red Grant are uncanny . And there 's a moment early on in the game where you interact with a Miss Moneypenny , M , and Q who all look and behave as they did in the original Sean Connery 007 movies.<br /><br />What puts this game miles ahead of the other Bond games , besides Sir Sean 's voice and likeness , is two notable features in the game play . One is Bond focus . While you can dispatch villains simply by locking onto them with one button and killing them with the other , an additional button push will allow you to zoom in closer on a target and choose between spots Bond would shoot at , such as a grenade attached to a belt that will dispatch an enemy and a few of his friend or a rappel cord that will cause a suspended enemy to plunge to his death . The other notable feature is the stealth and mêlée kills . When you 're in close enough range , just hit a button to beat down an enemy with the raw brutality that only Sean Connery 's James Bond displayed.<br /><br />Sean Connery 's Bond relied mostly on his raw wit and talent , so you only have a few gadgets , but they 're good ones . The Q - copter is a remote control helicopter that can self - destruct and explore areas Bond ca n't reach , like the Q - spider in " EON " , only better . The classic laser watch is useful , not just for getting into sealed rooms , but dispatching enemies when you have no other weapon available . Sonic cuff links and a serum gun are the most fun to play around with , but you must experience them for yourself . Besides the gadgets , you can go dress Bond up in a number of retro costumes found during the game , including the gray suit from the movie , the standard black tuxedo , a retro stealth suit , and that classic white tuxedo , all which look exactly like they did when Sir Sean wore them in the movies . When you drive in the game , you drive the Aston Martin DB5 straight out of " Goldfinger . " It ca n't turn invisible , but it has a gadget for popping tires like in the movie . And when you 're not flying down the streets of Istanbul in the " Goldinger " car , you can fly through the air in the " Thunderball " jet pack.<br /><br />Then there 's the multi - player . Of course , it has to be compared to the standard of the " GoldenEye " game , and it fails . Also , you can only play Bond villains rather than Bond himself or the other heroes of the game . But the multi - player is amusing , and a decent bonus since the awesomeness of the single player campaign alone makes the game worth playing . The basic game does have other flaws . Some of the movie 's most exciting moments , particularly the gypsy camp shootout , Bond 's brawl with Red Grant on the Orient Express , and a confrontation between Bond and Rosa Klebb 's bladed shoe , are n't done justice in game form . And the game is a fast play , even on the hardest difficulty . But overall , this game is the best James Bond experience so far .
1 This James bond game is the best bond game i have played in my life it is my favorite James bond game so far because : < br /><br />The missions in this game are really fun they can be really hard that makes it more fun to play the missions have lots of actions the weapons you use are really good . The cars in this game are awesome the car missions have lots of action and are really fun to play . The voice over actors are really good and it is cool that Sean Connery does the voice for James bond also the way bond looks is really cool because it looks just like Sean Connery when he played James bond in the movies and the other character look pretty much the same as the look in the movie . The graphics a pretty good in this James bond game . Also the game follows the movie pretty much but not all the but most of the time it does which is cool.<br /><br />overall score * * * * * * * * * * out of * * * * * * * * * *
1 EA have shown us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60 's world . The graphics of the game are outstanding and also the voice recording is very professional . I got this game April 2007 ( two years after release ) , and I am still impressed with the gameplay . It 's a shame that EA will no longer make 007 games.<br /><br />I give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains , especially the " consulate " level . I would recommend this game to anyone from the age of 13 and over . The only thing I did n't like in the game is the Russian boat level , it was too much pressure . On the whole I like the game A LOT ! !
1 * * WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS ! * * < br /><br />First of all , I would like to say that I really liked this game . I got it for Christmas after two months of dropping hints to my parents . I am glad that I did that.<br /><br />First off , I would like to say that the single player was very good . The first level is probably one of the best in the game , when you are at a party in London , and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the Prime minister 's daughter . Of course you have to rescue her , and it is quite a big level , but should probably take you at least five minutes . The best part , and I think also the funniest part , is when you are in the jet - pack , and people are rappelling down Big Ben . Just equip the jet - pack 's most trusty rocket launcher and blast the clock faces and the enemies down . Pure fun!<br /><br />The rest of the levels are very good , but pretty short . There are four mini - levels you can unlock , and that is one of the let downs , because only the first two of them are actually fun , and the last two to unlock are just ' kill 25 enemies ' objectives , I mean , c'mon ! We got loads of points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad!<br /><br />The multi player , me and some of my friends agree , is very good and challenging , even if there are no bots . Halo did n't have any bots but that is still some fine multi player games ! You can be a load of bad guys , and you go against each other , and you can also set traps , which is the best way of killing people without going into view of their character.<br /><br />Gameplay - 8.5/10 ( levels can be quite repetitive and bonus missions could be improved ) . Graphics - 9/10 ( there is the odd bad graphic , but that is n't extremely often ) . Multiplayer - 10/10 ( needs no comment , just great , you get to drive in jet - packs and vehicles ) . Sound - 8/10 Replay value - 7/10 ( the only levels I go back on are the Loondon level and Istanbul Part 1).<br /><br />I give this game : 8.5/10<br /><br />Could have a bit of improvement , but it 's still good .
1 This is a very unusual film in that the star with the top billing does n't appear literally until half way in . Nevertheless I was engaged by the hook of the Phantom Lady . Curtis , though competent as the falsely accused Scott Henderson , looks a little tough to be be sympathetic towards ( perhaps he should have shaved his moustache ) and his behavior when he first comes home should have convinced the cops at least to some degree of his innocence . While another commentator had a problem with Franchot Tone as Jack Marlowe I found his portrayal of the character to be impressively complex . He is no stock villain . Superb character actor Elisha Cook Jr. is again in top form as the ' little man with big ambitions . ' His drumming in the musical numbers added a welcome touch of eroticism . This movie however is carried by the very capable and comely Ella Raines as the devoted would be lover of Henderson , Carol Richmond . She definitely has talent and her screen presence is in the tradition of Lauren Bacall . This is the first of her work I have seen and I am definitely inclined to see her other roles . The rest of the supporting cast is also more than competent . All in all a very satisfying film noir mystery which when viewed today fully conveys the dark and complex urban world it is intended to . Recommended , 8/10 .
1 Sadly not available on DVD as yet , but worth pursuing on TCM or VHS . A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder , and courageously takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth . A movie with many twists and dark alleyways , none of which I will mention ! The jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer , is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history , despite being at very low budget and made during WWII in black and white . Despite the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision . Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters , casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru , Hepburn , Angie Dickinson , Lauren Bacall , Ann Sheridan - of their era . Robert Siodmak was of one of several German , Hungarian & Czech film - makers - Sirk , Wilder , Zinnemann , Lubitsch , Curtiz , Lang , etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood , and brought a highly original fresh vision with them . Sadly Ella Raines was never given such a great part again , and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns .
1 Scott Henderson , the engineer that employs Carol Richman , as his assistant , makes a point to call her " Kansas " , whenever he speaks to her . It shows us that Carol , effectively played by Ella Raines , is supposed to be a babe in the woods , as far as the Manhattan of the 40s was concerned . Only a woman , from out of town , would follow the shady bartender to a solitary elevated subway . Even then , only a naive girl could undertake such an adventure.<br /><br />Robert Siodmak directed this film noir very well . He shows a flair for infusing the story with a lot of raw sex that was surprising for those days . How else could we justify the way the drummer in the orchestra of the musical , where Scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat , makes such an overt pass at a lady on a date ? The drummer played with high voltage by Elisha Cook Jr. does n't hide his desires for any of the ladies who sat in the front row of the hit musical where he plays . It was a real explicit invitation , first to the " phantom woman " of the story , Fay Helm ; afterward , Cliff the drummer , insinuates himself very openly to Ella Raines who goes to the theater disguised as the mystery dame her boss had taken originally.<br /><br />This is a film that will hook any viewer from the beginning . There are things not explained in it , but it holds the one 's interest throughout . The killer is not revealed until the end . < br /><br />Ella Raines with her expressive eyes was an under estimated actress . She holds her own against much more experienced actors . Franchot Tone , a New York stage actor , working in Hollywood , never found in this medium the fame he deserved . He is effective as the accused man 's best friend . On the other hand , Alan Curtis , comes across as a man , who when framed , accepts his fate and is saved only by the tenacity of the woman who secretly loved him . Thomas Gomez , as the inspector Burgess , is an asset to the film as a detective who has his doubts the police had caught the man who committed the crime.<br /><br />This movie will not disappoint .
1 Robert Siodmak does a fabulous job with this B noir starring Ella Raines , Franchot Tone , and Alan Curtis . And he does it , I might add , without a lot of help from his male actors , i.e. , Curtis and Tone . It 's Raines all the way , a pretty , leggy actress who for one reason or another never reached the status of some of her " noir " counterparts.<br /><br />Siodmak 's use of sex , light , shadows , and music is truly remarkable as he tackles this genre . The shadows , lighting effects , and camera angles are all effective . But the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by Elisha Cook , egged on by an excited Raines . It 's this scene that brings " Phantom Lady " into new territory.<br /><br />Siodmak 's commitment to the material is matched only by Raines , who gives a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man . Franchot Tone phoned this one in . Alan Curtis did n't seem upset that he might die and did n't seem happy that he lived . And he never , except for a brief moment in prison , seemed to be in love with Raines.<br /><br />The amusing thing about many of these films is that , as World War II progressed , interest in psychiatry deepened . But often the terms were used incorrectly in films such as " Possessed , " " Spellbound , " and " The Greatest Show on Earth . " Tone is called paranoid by Thomas Gomez - Tone probably has some paranoia attached to his disorder , but he appears to be closer to a psychopath . In actuality , as evidenced by his headaches , he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brain.<br /><br />Phantom Lady does n't have the greatest plot , but it 's well worth watching .
1 I can safely admit ( as an IMDb geek ) that ' Phantom Lady ' will never crack into my film noir top twenty . It may not even sneak into the top fifty . But rather than discredit the film for not being as good as so many other classics of the film noir genre , it should be noted that ' Phantom Lady ' has enough strong and lasting images in it to make it a worthwhile viewing . All that is required from the viewer is the ability to get beyond the dreadfully slow beginning.<br /><br />The film does n't get cooking until ' Kansas ' ( Ella Raines ) sets about trying to prove all but single handedly the innocence of her boss , Scott Anderson ( Alan Curtis ) , who has been convicted of murder . ' Kansas ' is Anderson 's secretary by day and amateur detective by night . As the novice sleuth she does quite well for herself while working the streets of New York at night . Little by little she starts putting pieces of a murder mystery puzzle together . To be honest , the film belongs to Raines and it is only due to her presence that the film works well at all . Somehow she is able to breathe life into a film about a condemned man who is not interesting in the slightest . I 'm not sure if this splintered dynamic of a characterless leading man becomes the fault of the actor or the director , but clearly this is where something becomes terribly wrong with the film.<br /><br />As interesting as Raines is as a novice detective , things really accelerate into another hidden gear when ' Kansas ' pays a late night visit to a wandering drummer ( Elisha Cook , Jr. ) in search of some information to help her condemned boss . She and the drummer paint the town a new kind of red while visiting the " all night " jazz clubs . Trying to describe this scene will either prove an injustice to the scene or worse yet , it could ruin the scene all together . You 'll know the scene once the last cymbal crash has finished ringing out . If you 're lucky enough to have this film on DVD , you 'll more than likely be rewinding this scene again and again . As good as Raines is , it is this scene that makes this film noteworthy . It is mainly because of this scene that I rate ' Phantom Lady ' a 7 instead of a 6.<br /><br />For the most part this film comes off as tepid and bland with a few great scenes and one magnificent scene . It is the ' drum / sex scene ' that separates this film from any others of the same ilk.<br /><br />And just like it is said in the film that " you never go wrong with Vanilla " , I would also like to add that " going with Vanilla " is the safe fall back choice when one ca n't decide on having a tastier treat.<br /><br />7/10 .

1 Scott Henderson ( Alan Curtis ) is unjustly accused of killing his unfaithful wife . The night she was murdered he was out with a mystery woman who refused to give him her name . After accused of the murder , the police visit all the places he had been with her , but people only remember him being alone . He 's sentenced to die and his secretary ( Ella Raines ) sets out to find the murderer herself because she loves him.<br /><br />This was made as a B film from Universal ( look at the cast -- all character actors and one star -- Franchot Tone -- on the decline ) . The budget was small and the cast mostly unknown but what came out is one of the best film noirs of the 1940s . It 's beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak and has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by William Irish ( a pen name for Cornell Woolrich ) . It moves quickly and just looks fantastic . And there 's the infamous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr. which just comes off the screen with incredible sexual energy ( I 'm surprised the censors did n't cut it).<br /><br />There are only a few flaws that prevent this from being perfect . Tone gives a dreadful performance . He looks ghastly and he 's just horrible . Also Curtis is stiff and bland as Henderson . You really wonder why Raines loves him -- he 's so unemotional . But Raines is pretty good in the lead role . She 's pretty and full of life . Also the last scene when the murderer is after her never rings true . He 's hardly a threat physically and her reactions just seem overstated.<br /><br />Still I 'm giving this a 9 . A really great film -- flaws aside .
1 I rated this film 7/10 which is an average of 8/10 for screenplay , direction and 1944 production values and 6/10 for acting . My acting rating in turn was calculated at 4/10 for all the screen characters except for that played by heroine Ella Raines as Carol Richman who was excellent at 8/10.Also I commend Thomas Gomez as Inspector Burgess whose character convinces that he personally does not think the guilty verdict on Scott Henderson ( Alan Curtis ) was just in view of his naive alibi . These two then form an alliance to prove Scott 's alibi.<br /><br />I have this film on a " Suevia Film Noir Cine Negro " DVD in Spanish as " La Dama Desconocida " with the original soundtrack " Ingles " as an alternative language , since despite searching I could not find a wholly English version . I was however anxious to see another performance by Ella Raines after being impressed with her performance as a heroine in " Impact " playing a sole female garage proprietor . Here Ella performs another heroic role believing in the innocence of her engineer boss and refuses several suggestions that she should return to her home in Kansas ( her boss 's pet name for her ) before solving the missing alibi . The fact that she is secretly in love with her boss is a little hard to believe since he formally just seemed to have had a formal business relationship with her . He had however designed children 's homes and playgrounds so I suppose " family man " had lit up in Carol 's brain.<br /><br />In the 1940s with " the film code " in operation , producers could only portray sex through metaphors and here it is done in the form of furious drumming played by Elisha Cooke jnr . Carol dolls herself up as a girl of easy virtue in an attempt to lure the drummer into giving her information about " The Phantom Lady " alibi . The other main character , Jack Marlow ( an associate of Scott Henderson ) is played by Franchot Tone whose performance I found too theatrical and wondered why Carol , for instance , did not notice him constantly and strangely admiring his hands . Here the screenplay should have been improved and provided more suspense as these theatrical moves telegraphed the plot far too early to the audience .
1 Scott Henderson ( Alan Curtis ) meets a mystery woman ( Fay Helm ) in a bar and invites her to see a show with him . She agrees on condition that they do n't swap any information about each other - not even names . Sometimes these are the best kind of dates . However , when he returns to his apartment , Inspector Burgess ( Thomas Gomez ) and his team are waiting for him . Scott 's wife has been murdered . His alibi is the mystery woman but no - one can remember seeing her and , as a result of this , Scott is sentenced to die for the murder of his wife . His secretary Kansas ( Ella Raines ) is not convinced of his guilt and sets out to find the woman who can save him from the death penalty.<br /><br />This is a good film and the viewer is 100 % behind the attempts of Kansas to get to the truth . We follow her through some memorable scenes , eg , her pursuit of Mac the bartender ( Andrew Tombes ) at night and the claustrophobic venue where Cliff the drummer ( Elisha Cook Jr ) takes her to hang out , drink and dance while he jams with his friends . This is such a blatant depiction of sexual desire that it is a stand - out part of the film as everyone sweats intensely and rhythmically for the duration of the scene . Ella Raines is good in the female lead role and Thomas Gomez makes a likable policeman . Alan Curtis started well as the confused , innocent man , but once he is arrested his performance took a left turn as he became thoroughly unpleasant to Kansas for no reason . God knows why she stuck by him.<br /><br />The film does n't keep you guessing as to who the murderer is as we know from about halfway through the film , but this does n't matter . In fact , it adds to the tension and dramatic development of the story as we will Kansas to discover what is going on and then to get the hell out ! It 's a good film with some great scenes but although Elisha Cook Jr has a memorable role , I just never like him in anything that I see him in .... someone hand me a neck - tie .....
1 Phantom Lady ( 1944 ) Dir : Robert Siodmak < br /><br />Production : Universal Pictures < br /><br />Scott Henderson ( Alan Curtis ) , following a nasty fight and split with his wife , looks to drown his sorrows at the local watering hole . There he spies a woman in a similar emotional state and , looking for some companionship , asks her to a show at a club to get both their minds off their problems . She agrees , but only on the condition that they keep their names to themselves . Sure enough , when Scott gets home he finds the police there , waiting to question him . His wife 's been murdered . Where were you at 8 o'clock this evening , asks Inspector Burgess ( Thomas Gomez ) ? But Scott has an alibi , right ? Only he does n't know the woman 's name . And the bartender remembers Scott but not the woman . Neither does the cab driver . Nor the drummer ( Elisha Cook Jr. ) at the club . Even the dancer at the club , who Scott clearly caught looking at the woman ( they were both wearing the same hat ) , wo n't acknowledge there was someone with him . Something is going on , but whatever it is Scott is helpless to defend himself at a trial and is sentenced to death for his wife 's murder ( on the flimsiest ' evidence ' in Hollywood judicial history ) . It 's left to his loyal secretary , ' Kansas ' ( Ella Raines ) , who 's later joined by a sympathetic Inspector Burgess , to find out the real killer before Scott is executed.<br /><br />Phantom Lady is built on themes that recur , almost compulsively , in Woolrich 's work . For example , the schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in Black Angel and The Leopard Man . Additionally , there is the character who becomes mentally unhinged by the death of a sweetheart or spouse as found in Rendezvous in Black and The Bride Wore Black . It can leave a viewer feeling like he 's treading on well worn ground . But in the right hands , the feverish plots , sorry dialogue , the narrative inconsistencies , all are beside the point . Fortunately , Phantom Lady was being guided by sound hands.<br /><br />This is Siodmak 's first noir . He would go on to distinguish himself as one of the , if not the , preeminent practitioners of the style ( The Killers , Criss Cross ) . Here he is fortuitously paired with cinematographer Woody Bredell ( they would be reunited on Christmas Holiday and The Killers ) . There is some great storytelling done in the camera . In one shot , the deteriorating mental state of a character is shown as he sits in front of a 3-way mirror , suggesting multiple personalities . The same character , who is an artist , has Van Gogh 's self portrait with the bandaged ear hanging on the wall in his apartment . But what Siodmak and Bredell are really doing in Phantom Lady is practically creating the look for noir . Released very early in 1944 , it 's all here ; the wet pavement , the bags of atmosphere and dread , the sharply contrasting b&w , the wildly expressionistic versions of reality ( when Kansas visits Scott in prison ) , the discordant shafts of light , etc . It is a terrific picture to look at.<br /><br />Franchot Tone aside , the cast , as well as the subject matter and relative inexperience of the director ( and presumably , the budget ) , suggests ' B ' movie ambitions . I thought Tone was a little hammy . Alan Curtis ( High Sierra ) is not up to much , and actually comes off pretty weak in a few scenes . Ella Raines is mostly good ( and quite beautiful ) . Her ' sex scene ' with Elisha Cook Jr. is so delirious it has to be seen to be believed . Another standout scene is when Kansas goes after the bartender to question him . It amounts to a chase scene , as she relentlessly dogs him through the streets , with a stop at a subway station . Some real good tension in there.<br /><br / > * * * out of 4
1 Man , this is a hard DVD to come by . I could only find it on Region 2 , a Spanish import , and it was expensive.<br /><br />Was it worth it ? Well , yes . Not so much because it 's a masterpiece of film making , though directed by Curt Siodmak ( the credits on IMDb.com read " Robert " but the DVD credits list Curt ) , or because it has a couple of familiar figures from other murder mysteries -- Elisha Cook , Jr. , and Thomas Gomez -- but because my decade - long curiosity about the movie has finally been satisfied.<br /><br />Essentially , a respected but self - contained engineer ( Alan Curtis ) has been stood up by his estranged wife and finds himself in a New York bar with two show tickets in his pocket . A woman with a strange hat is on the stool next to his and he politely invites her to join him at the musical review . She accepts , a little gloomily . The mopey bartender gives them both the eye as they leave.<br /><br />At the show , the tempestuous star notices that this lady in the audience is wearing the same hat and erupts offstage with anger . The drummer in the band , Cook , leers at the silent lady but gets no response . Curtis takes the woman to her home and asks her name but she wo n't give it , and she does n't want to know his . If she 'd been a Longfellow devotee she 'd have said something about ships that pass in the night.<br /><br />Okay , Curtis goes home to find his wife has been murdered in his absence . The head police officer , Gomez , turns him over to the DA . His only alibi is that he was with a phantom lady whom no one else seems to remember -- not the bartender , not the Latina star , not the cab driver ( " Al Alp " ) , not the drummer -- and since the lady herself has disappeared , it 's impossible to dig her up.<br /><br />Curtis is convicted and sentenced to die . But Inspector Gomez has thought things over and decided her 's probably innocent because nobody with a brain would make up such a stupid story . He joins Curtis 's loving secretary , Ella Raines , in re - investigating the case informally.<br /><br />They visit the supposed witnesses again . The ominous bartender is run over by a car , perhaps accidentally , so he 's out of the picture . The hot - tempered Latina has left because the show closed and she 's uncooperative and ignorant of the source of the hat anyway . Elisha Cook , Jr. , is strangled by the real murderer but not before he is featured in a scene in which he pounds the drums in an improvised jazz group . His sweaty face assumes an expression which does n't suggest intense focus but rather a monstrous , orgasmic insanity . His eyeballs roll to the ceiling , his mouth gapes , his hammering becomes frenzied . I laughed out loud.<br /><br />Nobody 's performance is otherwise outstanding , but all are professional enough . Thomas Gomez is always reliable . Best performance , though , is probably by Franchot Tone . He 's the real murderer and he fakes his alibi . He 's reserved and artistic . Even when he faints he 's decorous . I do n't know how to put this precisely but Tone seems to be thinking as well as simply acting his part . Alan Curtis as the innocent engineer is near zero on the Kelvin scale and belongs in a B picture . < br /><br />I do n't know why it 's considered as classic . It 's really your basic murder mystery by Cornell Woolrich , not as good as some of his others . But Siodmak 's direction is sensitive . A man gets run over and his hat winds up in a gutter with water running around it . His use of shadows is quietly effective.<br /><br />Glad I got it .
1 For the attention of Chuck Davis and Emefy : I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago , when I was not yet a jazz buff . There is an exhibition going until end of June in Paris 's brand new MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY , named LE SIECLE DU JAZZ , not to be missed , with as a special entertainment NINE excerpts from jazz movies , including PHANTOM LADY 's famous drums sequence . I 've seen Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr - in almost all their film appearances , and I can confirm the following : 1.Elisha Cook Jr was DUBBED in the movie . That was some progress , since in most of his other appearances he was KILLED ( mainly in Howard Hawks 's THE BIG SLEEP ) . 2 . Krupa probably dubbed Cook in PL . I could recognize his style , since he had already graduated from the tom - tom used ( and abused ) at the beginning of his career - namely in 1937 's Hollywood HOTEL 's SING , SING , SING sequence - and eventually got everything that was possible from what we call in French " la caisse claire " . 3 . The sequence from PL , at least as shown in the Museum , is not censored.harry carasso , Paris , France
1 A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director , Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious " phantom " woman , and Franchot Tone as a crazed and murderous sculptor . As well there are some fascinating smaller parts played by Elisha Cook Jr as a drugged out trap drummer , as well as the other characters who make up parts of the conspiracy . If you 're used to seeing Raines in more wholesome parts , she 's allowed to go overboard here , especially in her scenes with Cook . Franchot Tone also plays someone very different , and though it is n't a convincing part , he acts phenomenally . While the conspiracy is too contrived , the film has real atmosphere and is very interesting .
1 This noir may not be the best remembered film from the era , but it features a great mystery plot , the common noir atmosphere and some good performances from its lesser known cast members . Robert Siodmak , the talented director behind the mystery / horror classic ' The Spiral Staircase ' directed this film two years earlier than the aforementioned film , and shows a real flair for creating a dark and brooding atmosphere as well as creating a plot that both intrigues and fascinates the viewer . Phantom Lady focuses on Scott Henderson ; a man married to a woman he does n't like . He picks up a lady in a big hat in a bar one night , and the two agree to a ' no strings attached ' night of fun . However , he then returns home to find his apartment infested by police officers and soon finds out that the reason they are there is because his wife has been strangled with one of his neck ties ! He 's dismayed to find that no one he saw while with the mysterious woman can remember her , and naturally the jury sends him down for the murder of his wife . However , luckily for him his beautiful female employee gets on the case ... <br /><br />The plot moves along nicely throughout , and unlike many of the better known noirs , this one features a few murders which make the proceedings more interesting . In fact , if it was n't for the fact that it was made in the forties and shot in black and white , I would swear Phantom Lady was an Italian Giallo ! The central characters are all interesting enough , with Alan Curtis providing a good portrayal of the unfortunate victim , and Ella Raines being effective as the female impromptu detective . The real standout of the film , however , is Franchot Tone , who provides a memorable performance as the insane villain of the piece . The film also features a role for supporting actor extraordinaire Elisha Cook Jr , who features playing the drums in the film 's most memorable segment . If I was to criticise this film , I would say that the identity of the murderer is revealed a little too early - although Phantom Lady does deserve some credit on that front for the original way it goes about it . The conclusion is satisfying and everything makes sense ( which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line ) and overall , Phantom Lady is surely one of the greatest and most under - seen noirs ever made !
1 Other reviewers have summarized this film noir well . I just wanted to add to the " Whew ! " comment one reviewer made regarding Elisha Cook 's obviously coke - fuelled drumming episode . This WAS a doozy , I must say . Cook deserved some acclaim for his frenzied performance.<br /><br />A bit of trivia that I am surmising about : Cook appeared as a waiter in the 1941 Barbara Stanwyck film , " Ball of Fire . " He was a waiter in the nightclub where Barbara was singing and legendary drummer Gene Krupa was drumming , most energetically . Is it too much to suggest that Cook 's spazzy drumming in the later film , " Phantom Lady , " was very much inspired by Krupa 's work , as witnessed by Cook 3 years earlier ? < br /><br />If you watch Krupa in " Ball of Fire , " I think you 'll note some clearly similar body movements . One hopes , of course , that HE was not influenced by any drugs at the time !
1 This is a " B Series " Film Noir , and my vote reflects its membership in that genre . I saw this film last night at a left - bank cinema in Paris , where it opened a two - week film noir run . The film has some flaws , yes , but far too many delicious elements to ignore.<br /><br />As the previous reviewer remarked , the drumming scene is incredible ! ( B - movies could tread where A - movies were forbidden to enter ! ) And the plot is intriguing . Regarding Franchot Tone , however , I beg to disagree : to me , he 's suitably mysterious ; just the right shade of creepy . One must bear in mind that there 's a sort of German expressionism happening here ( the director , Robert Siodmark , was a German who came to Hollywood during the war ) , and so an air of exaggeration fits into the whole of this film . At least it does for me.<br /><br />However , it 's the gorgeous Ella Raines who , in only her third credited performance , held this viewer entranced throughout the film . A " Girl Friday " type with a strong resemblance to Gene Tierney , it 's a wonder that she did n't become a household name . But she 's so good here that I 've just ordered another film of hers ( ' Impact ' ) off the Internet , and I ca n't wait to see it as well .
1 Alan Curtis has a loud , violent sounding argument with his wife , slams out of his apartment , has a night of drinking with a mysterious lady with a large hat in a bar ( run by Andrew Tombes , in a nice villainous part for a change ) , and returns to find his wife dead and the police , led by Thomas Gomez waiting for him . His attempts to prove his alibi - that he was with that mysterious lady - fall because everyone that he can think of ( Tombes , Elisha Cook ) claims there was never any such person . He ends up with no alibi , although his secretary ( who secretly loves him ) Ellen Raines believes him . Convicted after a trial , he is awaiting his death sentence . Raines starts going out after the truth , discovering that Gomez has some doubts of his own . She also finds an ally in a friend of Curtis , Franchot Tone , who was apparently out of town the night of the crime . Will she clear Curtis in time ? THE PHANTOM LADY is based on a novel by William Irish ( the great noir writer Cornell Woolrich ) . As movie fans know from other works by Woolrich ( LEOPARD MAN , THE NIGHT HAS A THOUSAND EYES , REAR WINDOW , NO MAN OF HER OWN ) one can not assume what is true on the surface anywhere . The missing wife of a salesman may not actually be upstate , sending him messages that she arrived , if he still has her jewelry . The mentalist may really be able to predict tragedy - or was he plotting the murder of his old partner , now an oil millionaire ? Did a leopard kill the young women , or is the wealthy recluse in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge ? Is the young woman , claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck , actually an impostor ? Here it is Raines and Gomez ( with an assist by Tone ) trying to prove Curtis did see a woman nobody will admit seeing - and if he did see her , why is nobody else able to recall seeing her ? The problem with the story really is Curtis 's personality - he gives in too easily when found guilty of the crime he did not commit . In reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed . However , in defense of Curtis 's collapse , it also happens to other people in various films : Gary Cooper , in MR . DEEDS GOES TO TOWN , gets so disgusted about the framing he gets as delusional and mad by Douglas Dumbrille and his minions that he does not defend himself at first , until the people who would depend on his help cry out their fears in the courtroom and reawaken his sense of responsibility . But Curtis just seems to give up . In normal circumstances Raines , Gomez , and everyone else would not care if Curtis didn't.<br /><br />But the film survives this weakness . The slow unraveling of lies by witnesses bribed by the real killer allows two set pieces for Raines with Tombes on a deserted elevated platform and Elisha Cook at a jazz session . Gomez turns out to be more perceptive than the villain expects in double checking his alibi again . And the villain manages to keep slightly ahead of Raines and Gomez until the concluding minutes of the film . If it is not as great a film as DOUBLE INDEMNITY or THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE or THE MALTESE FALCON , it holds up pretty well until the moment Curtis and Raines are reunited at the end .
1 Drum scene is wild ! Cook , Jr. is unsung hero of this and many movies . Fantastic actor , great flick . A few twists that keep you moving . A must - see .
1 This is a film which had eluded me thus far but , now that I 've watched it , emerges as one of the major entries in the noir style . As usual with the DivX format , the viewing was far from ideal  marred by the occasional video and ( mostly ) audio glitches  but , given that the film is still unavailable on R1 DVD , this will have to do for the moment . Since the film 's reputation is quite high within the genre itself , I assume that the reason behind this oversight is because it does not have a well - known actor in the lead.<br /><br />Anyway , the belated entrance of the film 's nominal star  Franchot Tone  packs quite a wallop ( especially as he is shown to be the villain from the first ) ! Tone was a underrated actor  he was rarely given meaty roles , and this may well be his best ( making his paranoiac both fascinating and believably dangerous ) . The female lead  Ella Raines , who would later feature in BRUTE FORCE ( 1947 ) as well as Siodmak 's own THE SUSPECT ( 1944 ) and THE STRANGE AFFAIR OF UNCLE HARRY ( 1945 )  is quite lovely and capably takes on the role of the distraught secretary out to prove her convicted boss ( Alan Baxter ) innocent of his wife 's brutal murder . Other key supporting parts are essayed by Thomas Gomez as the initially bullying but ultimately sympathetic police investigator , and Elisha Cook Jr.  the genre 's quintessential fall guy  as an ill - fated " ladies ' man " of a percussionist.<br /><br />Like BRUTE FORCE 's Jules Dassin , Siodmak was on a noir roll at this point in his career and this film definitely benefits from his superb direction  all tilted angles and terrific set - pieces , including the justly celebrated jazz sequence in which Cook manically beats on his drums in a sexual frenzy brought on by the sluttishly - attired Raines ( who is putting on an act to get his attention and eventually drive him to confess that he withheld evidence at the inquest which could spring her resigned lover from jail ) . Another great , lengthy sequence is the one in which Raines follows a bartender ( another uncooperative witness ) around the streets of New York  which results in his being mowed down by a car ! < br /><br />Notable , too , is the trial sequence  which is entirely depicted through the audience 's reaction so that judge , jury , witnesses and D.A. are never actually seen ( although the judge 's voice is recognizably that of veteran character actor Samuel S. Hinds ) . The centerpiece of the film is the scene in which Gomez and Tone discuss the nature of the criminal involved , with the inspector 's put down of the latter as mentally insane giving the initially smug Tone " dizzy spells " . The suspenseful climax finds Raines alone with Tone in his apartment , where she discovers evidence of his guilt  and he confesses to having had an affair with Baxter 's wife , but killed her when she would n't desert her husband for him.<br /><br />By the way , I hit upon a little goof in the film : while the story is clearly set in 1943 , I noticed that during the taxi cab ride towards the beginning of the film  in which Alan Curtis escorts the titular lady to the theater  the establishing shot of New York ( comprising clearly of stock footage ) features a marquee promoting Laurel and Hardy 's 1938 musical comedy , SWISS MISS ! Incidentally , famed mystery writer Cornell Woolrich wrote the original novel on which this was based using a pseudonym .
1 Ella was excellent , Franchot was unavoidably over - the - top ( But he played similar parts in other films such as " The Man on the Eiffel Tower " ) and Alan was nearly non - existent but the film certainly " thrilled".<br /><br />*mild spoiler ahead * : I wonder how many times Elisha Cook got strangled in his films but I seem to recall various other examples . I will avoid naming the murderer but I think it 's necessarily obvious because of the plot " thriller " demands.<br /><br />A very well - done but dated film noire ( for example : everyone smoked like crazy and the police were really stock characters . And no dead bodies were ever shown , unlike today 's gore fests . ) done in the familiar short - scene tableaux format of the period.<br /><br />8 out of 10 .
1 Pretty good picture about a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time . If the murderer wanted to whack the dame , why not just off her and let the cops try to figure out whodunnit ? Involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous , not to mention all the mouths you 'd have to worry about staying shut . Why did the depressed lady go out to the bar when she could barely sit up in a chair or say a word ? Are there really cops out there who are wise cracking , gum popping , grinning apes who approach a suspect in such a glib manner ? This probably played well back before the wheel was invented , but it is so corny and unbelievable today . Catch the manic drum break by Elisha Cook ; his frenetic hammering never once matched the recording . His mad facial expressions made up for the off kilter stick sync .
1 The premise is a bit better than the execution , but that does n't mean the film is worth a look . Splendid supporting cast makes this a fun mystery to unravel . Raines is great as the resourceful woman determined to solve this puzzlement . I always enjoy Thomas Gomez .
1 Actor Herman José plays the role of a football of a soccer entrepreneur that acquires the pass of two African players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of the Benfica ( club of its heart),FC Porto , therefore these players did not play well , and it wanted that the FC Port was wronged with this . But what happens is that these two players after all are good and FC Porto sell them for much money to a foreign club , making a good business . The film , for a small country as Portugal , without great antecedents in great films , is a very good and funny comedy , showing all the rivalry that exists between North / South of Portugal ( FC Porto / Benfica ) . Highly recommended
1 I felt a great joy , after seeing this film , not because it is a master piece , but because it convinced me of , that the Portuguese cinema became really very good . We can see here the best Portuguese actores in this field .
1 Along with Fernando Fragata , João Mário Grilo , Abi Feijó , Leonel Vieira , étc ... (other commercial directors ) , Diamantino Costa is one of the best Portuguese Directors ; " O Lampião da Estrela " was his ( Diamantino Costa ) First movie , before he made several successful commercials . This title is starred by one of the best Portuguese comedians of all times , Herman José and José Pedro Gomes are great . Its a very funny movie ! ! ( 28/07/2000)<br /><br />BOA SORTE DIAMANTINO ...
1 True fans of film will love this authentic movie.<br /><br />I disagree with the trolls who are rating this movie a one - star and calling it unrealistic . While I do n't have the background or come from the environment of the protagonists , I 've spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feel the acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave . I do n't know what the basis is for others ' comments that the film is " unrealistic " . The dialog is great.<br /><br />The low budget production value did n't bother me a bit . I felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film . The focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy Hollywood propping or melodrama.<br /><br />I completely bought into the character 's motivations and reactions . The acting was believable and impressive for new and non - actors.<br /><br />If your idea of good film is Transformers or Fast & Furious , then skip it . If you enjoy good character driven dramas , then see it.<br /><br />(Regarding the negative commenters being " trolls " : click on their names and you will see most have no other reviews or only negative reviews . )
1 I saw this film a while back and it 's still at the top of my ' favorite movies ' list . It is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bits ( such as the ' Cafe Bustelo ' coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandsons hair ) that people are n't seeing because YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU ARE HISPANIC . This is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular . Please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it 's being built upon . I completely see what the writer / director was going for , and he hit the target perfectly ! This film is highly deserving of a better rating .
1 Incredibly intriguing and captivating , I found it impossible to turn away once I began to watch . I am usually one of the harshest critics but to me this film was just brilliant , strange as this may sound I could almost smell the air and feel the textures of the locations . < br /><br />From a cinematographic I thought there was great use of light and texture . From the orange glow of the summer light , down to the plastic wrapped couch all had a distinct air of realism to me.<br /><br />From a character perspective I thought the notion of Victor Vargas as almost the glue that connects the story was quite inspired , each of the other members of the family having a more complete background simply caused greater intrigue in the main character himself.<br /><br />Beyond that , having known someone just like the grandmother and having been on the receiving end of just such a situation , I can say the situation felt particularly realistic . The awkwardness , the accent , the cooking and even down to the comments made felt so authentic to me.<br /><br />I think this film worked for me because I began to watch it with no expectations and found it completely immersing and brought back memories of teenage emotion , well worth a watch .
1 " Victor does n't have much , but that 's not stopping him from trying to go out with Judy , the prettiest girl on the block . All he 's got is hope and a one - bedroom apartment he shares with his family . His grandmother does n't trust him , his brother worships him , and his half - sister just declared war . But Victor thinks love really can conquer all in this warm , genuine , and touching romantic comedy about life in the part of the city most people never see , " according to the DVD sleeve 's synopsis.<br /><br />Peter Sollett ' " Raising Victor Vargas " elicits engaging " debut " performances from lead actor Victor Rasuk ( as Victor Vargas ) and the cast . Mr. Rasuk and juicy Judy Marte ( as Judy Gonzalez ) are sexy and endearing as " Lower East Side Kids " discovering the joy of sexual attraction . Considering how attractive they look in this picture , it 's not hard to predict they hook up - and , although you may wonder how " innocent " they really are , their characterizations seem true.<br /><br />Victor 's brother " Nino " is played by Victor 's real - life brother Silvestre Rasuk , who looks the part his older brother is playing . Sometimes , it 's nice to see movie brothers who actually look alike ; and , hopefully they will work together again . " Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs " sister Krystal Rodriguez ( as Vicki ) and old world Altagracia Guzman ( as Grandma ) round out the sex - starved Dominican immigrant family . So , are hand - held - camera coming - of - age films in vogue , or what ? < br /><br / > * * * * * * * Raising Victor Vargas ( 5/16/02 ) Peter Sollett ~ Victor Rasuk , July Marte , Silvestre Rasuk
1 Peter Sollett has created an endearing portrait about real people living in poverty in the Lower East Side of New York , or Loisaida , as it 's known by the locals.<br /><br />Mr . Sollett 's heart is in the right place as he examines this dysfunctional family , that is typical of the different ' inner cities ' of the country . Mr. Sollett accentuates the positive in the story he presents . These are basically good kids , the children of parents that have left them and whose grandmother has taken under her wing . < br /><br />Instead of presenting his characters as losers , Mr. Sollett shows a positive side they all have . These kids are not into drugs , or are stealing because they are poor . Had this story been done by Hollywood we would have seen a parade of stereotypes , instead of children that are struggling , but deep down inside , they are not defeated.<br /><br />Victor Rasuk , as Victor Vargas , was a revelation . He is a natural . So is July Marte . Her character shows us a no nonsense girl who will not be fooled or driven to do anything she does n't want to do . Altagracia Guzman , as the grandmother is excellent . She conveys her frustration at not being able to steer her grandchildren into the things she believes in and that are so important to her . < br /><br />All in all , this was an excellent picture thanks to Peter Sollett .
1 I have no idea how IMDb sorts reviews but I do know that , as happens often on Amazon.com , there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same , somewhat obscure talking points , almost verbatim . A campaign ? Only IMDb knows.<br /><br />As for this movie : it 's fine . It 's a funny , cute and very straightforward movie.<br /><br />It 's been over a decade since I worked in Brooklyn , lived in Queens and visited relatives in the South Bronx . But I found nothing inauthentic or exploitative about these kids . Is the grandmother a bizarre character ? Yup . Do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this ? Yes , thankfully , they do . Are other movies set in the LES and featuring Dominican / Puerto Rican kids possible ? You betcha . Does that make this movie a crime  as some of the ( to my eyes , astroturf ) comments would suggest ? Hardly . Let a thousand plastic flowers bloom.<br /><br />This is better than any episode of Degrassi JR . High or Degrassi High . Scoff at the comparison but _ we 've never had that _ and I 'm touched , to the core , by this movie 's humility of purpose and tender spirit.<br /><br />That said , I 'd love to know the backstory behind all this backbiting ! :-D
1 This movie feels like a film project . As though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with no experience and got to work . Characters are kind of uninvolved and naive though . Despite this amateurish feel , the movie is effective . It 's like a cross - section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or nurture their honest sexual feelings . Being raised by a grand - parent , of course from that generation there is shame associated with sexuality . This provides for some predictable but well done conflict . Probably most enjoyable was the way the main character grew a little bit in his Romantic relationship realizing a greater depth to sexual feelings . A good watch but nothing stirring ....
1 If you still remember that summer when you had your first kiss , first boy / girlfriend , or first puppy love fling ... this film is for you ! OK so this movie would and will never win an Oscar BUT as a Dominican I loved it ... there are some things in the movie that might just go right over your head if you are not part of the culture ... the kids being raised by a grandma who 's both mother and father , the youngest son being babied and bathed with a Cafe Bustelo tin ( sooo Dominican ! ) , Judy being harassed by the neighborhood men , going to church and lighting a prayer candle ... the film 's brilliance was in those small details . Granted , it was not a pull out all the works cinematic extravaganza but it was n't meant to be NOR was it meant to be an educational tool for those wanting to learn about Latin culture ( tip : make new friends instead ) . More of a bitter - sweet , faux - cumentery , this film kept it real without taking itself too seriously . As in the tradition of " Y Tu Mama Tambien " this was simply one boy 's coming of age tale . I recommend it ( especialmente si eres Dominicano ! ) = o )
1 Wow ! I loved this movie and LOVE Judy Marte ! ! This girl is n't just an awesome pretty face , she 's funny and really really talented ! ! She made me laugh many times just by being very naturally rough with Victor who was desperately hitting on her ! We 'll be seeing her a lot in the next coming years ... and probably also from director Peter Sollett and co - star Victor Rasuk!<br /><br />Raising Victor Vargas is one of the best film I saw in a long time ! Very refreshing ! It 's true , nice , funny , well filmed , it got it all : good story , good actors , good film direction!<br /><br />If you like simple , slow paced , real life , urban movies , like maybe Jersey Girl from Kevin Smith , you 'll love Victor Vargas ! It 's better !
1 One of the best films I have seen in the past five years ! The cast is universally spectacular in a tale of young love and bravado on the Lower East Side of New York City with the two leads being superstars in the making . Funny , charming , sad and inspiring , this is a totally refreshing take on urban youth that puts Larry Clark 's often - nauseating shtick in the gutter where it belongs ... although I have to admit that Bully was a cut above his normal fare . Raising Victor Vargas is one film you will kick yourself for missing ... so do n't miss it !
1 This movie works because it feels so genuine . The story is simple and realistic , perfectly capturing the joys and anxieties of adolescent love and sexuality that most / all of us experienced during our teen years.<br /><br />The actors are as natural as figures in a documentary but are as convincing and as charismatic as seasoned performers . The dialogue is fresh and honest ... and thankfully not filled to the brim with cutesy pop culture references . Also , the cinematography is at once gritty and beautiful , bringing the Lower East Side setting to life in a very tangible way.<br /><br />On an artistic level , I love this movie because it reminds me of great Italian neo - realism films like The Bicycle Thief and La Strada . Movies rarely feel as " real " as this does ... or as Bicycle Thief did . And the only other movie I 've seen that treats teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is Elia Kazan 's Splendor in the Grass . Writer / director Peter Sollett deserves tremendous praise . This film is quite an achievement.<br /><br />On a personal level , I am always glad to see a movie that treats members of ethnic America with love and respect . As an Italian - American , I hate the way my own people come off in the cinema ( as racist , womanizing , criminal geniuses in irritatingly popular epics ) , and my aggravation on this count makes me acutely sensitive to other groups and their awful silver screen representations . Hispanics and Asians in particular seem cursed to playing villains in Westerns and action movies . ( Good thing Gong Li did n't try to become famous in America!)<br /><br />Of course , thanks largely to the rise of indie pictures , and the influence of Miramax , we are seeing a few more pictures about ethnic characters here and there ... but Raising Victor Vargas is easily one of the best . While I do really like My Big Fat Greek Wedding , it is a refreshing change that Raising Victor Vargas is played straight ( with less exaggerated and broadly - drawn characters ) while still being very funny in its own right . Finally ! Latino characters worthy of note . I have a feeling that this is a film that will be remembered.<br /><br />Of course , now that he has made this wonderful picture about a family from the Dominican Republic , I hope Peter Sollett gets around to making a movie about Italians soon ! :) - Marc DiPaolo
1 Raising Victor Vargas is a movie you definitely need to see . It was very heart felt and had a lot of humor that gets you sucked right in . It is so much like real life with what teenagers have to go through . Victor , a cocky teen , but with a good heart at the end deals with love in all the right places dealing with girls and family . At the end Victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with a old fashioned grandmother and a girl who he wants to use is actually using him too . I recommend people to watch this movie because it will be like you are watching a real family . That s how much feeling this movie has . One heart felt moment was when Victor 's grandmother throws victor out over something simple . Victor was really heart and could n't believe that she would do something like that . It made me feel real sorry for him like it was real . Overall I give this movie a B+
1 There are plenty of reviews on this page that will explain this movie 's details far more eloquently than I could ; but I would like to offer a simple review for those who occasionally go to the movies for more than entertainment . Raising Victor Vargas is so true you will believe it . This flick gets inside your head .
1 One more of those brilliant young men who went all out and dared to make a teen romance film ( can i actually call it that?- it would invoke the devil out of its fans)on a micro budget but packed with such taste , sensitiveness and maturity . Peter Sollett- you deserve more admiration and respect . Thanks once again for demonstrating to the powers that be in the " industry " that stereotypes can be flushed down the toilet . One location , a handful of rich characters , low budget , good acting(and that too amateurs),decent lighting - worshippers of true indie cinema should watch more of this and STOP watching ... well ... you know what .
1 I 'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars.<br /><br />But they just do n't understand the movie.<br /><br />The story is about growing up in a difficult situation.<br /><br />There is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren.<br /><br />And there 's good reason why so many critics like this movie.<br /><br />And the reason is because they understand the movie.<br /><br />I feel sorry for the low scores given by some people.<br /><br />I wish I could just write a brief summary of a movie but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines.<br /><br />I frankly do n't have anything else to say .
1 This film captures the true struggle with identity that is ongoing in our teenage years . It is really moving and it feels strangely like a documentary - not contrived but very real . It is very interesting and unsettling
1 For what it is , " Raising Victor Vargas " is about as close to perfection as a film can get . Either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked ( probably some of each ) , this simple little slice - of - urban - life ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds . The film begins with a strong flavor of " street " but works its way into a Latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another . In my experience , never has so much been done with so little ( cast of tyros , novice director , etc . ) . Praised by the critics but not for everyone , " Raising Victor Vargas " is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness . ( A )
1 This film is underrated . I loved it . It was truly sweet and heartfelt . A family who struggles but is n't made into a dysfunctional family which is so typical of films today . The film did n't make it an issue that they have little money or are Dominican Republican the way Hollywood have.<br /><br />Instead the issue is Victor is immature and needs to grow up . He does , slowly , by the film 's end . He has a ways to go , but it was a heartfelt attempt to move forward . His grandmother is very cute and the scene where the little boy throws up had me laughing for the longest time . A truly heartfelt indie
1 Not as bad a film as i thought it would be.<br /><br />It has a good cast . Nice to see Roger Moore back on screen as well as the use of other British actors.<br /><br />Would like to see more of Olivia D`Abo in future projects . Maybe starring opposite her cousin the sexy Maryam D`Abo.<br /><br />Also a good use of unseen locations such as Luxembourg.<br /><br />Hopefully we will see more UK - European co - productions like this .
1 The cast is excellent , the acting good , the plot interesting , the evolvement full of suspense ... but it is hard to cram all those elements into a film that is barely 80 minutes long . If more time was taken to develop the plot and subplots , it would have a much better effect . Another 30 minutes of substance would have made this a very good film rather then just a good one .
1 This movie was pretty good . The acting was great , and there were some really great actors in it like , Buchholz and Roger Moore . This film is full of surprises . Confusing at times ... yes , but the twists and turns of the plot always keeps you in suspense . The only thing that this movie had too much of was exploding cars .
1 I love this movie . It was one of my favorite movies . The action never stops . The whole movie was done very well . The ending is really good . Ontop of it being action filled , they even have a surprised put in there for you . When i saw what the movie was about on the internet i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie , but sense i am such a big Luke perry fan i decided to give it a chance . I am glad that i did give it a chance because this was a very well though out movie . It was very original . Whoever thought up this movie gets a standing ovation from me . The acting was great . Luke Perry did an excellent job once again . I give this movie the highest rating .
1 WWE was in need of a saviour as Wrestlemania 14 rolled around . The departure of Bret Hart and subsequent evaporation of the Hart Foundation had left the Vile D - Generation X stable unchallenged in the WWE . Their despicable leader Shawn Michaels had stolen the title from Hart thanks to the interference of Vince McMahon and , with help from his cohorts Triple H and Chyna had systematically taken out anyone who challenged his supremacy . But at the Royal Rumble a new contender had emerged . Stone Cold Steve Austin . Hated by McMahonagement , Austin had DX worried . So worried in fact that they 'd enlisted the help of " The Baddest Man on the Planet " Mike Tyson as a special enforcer . Austin would have the odds firmly against him in his title match with Shawn Michaels.<br /><br />But first , there was an undercard to get through which kicked off with the Legion of Doom winning a forgettable 15 team battle Royal to become NO.1 contenders for the tag titles . I 'd actually forgotten this match existed until I rewatched the PPV . No very good and really highlighted the lack of depth in the tag division at that period in time.<br /><br />Next match saw the Light Heavyweight title defended by Champion Taka Michonoku against Aguila . The WWE had established the Light Heavyweight Title to compete with the strong Cruiserweight Division in WCW . It was not successful and this was the only time the title was ever defended at Wrestlemania . Short match , going about five minutes , and in fact too short for much to be achieved . What little they did was exciting and this was a nice little match which saw Taka retaining his title.<br /><br />OK , our next match saw DX member Triple H defending the WWE European title , which he 'd won in farcical fashion from Shawn Michaels on RAW in December and had n't defended on PPV , against Owen Hart , the Sole Survivor . Triple H got a big entrance with the DX band there to perform his theme song . Chyna accompanied Triple H to ringside , but was then handcuffed to WWE Commissioner Sgt Slaughter . Triple H and Owen have a nice little match , before Chyna interfered causing a low blow on Hart which leads to Triple H retaining the title . Good match , could have been great had it gone slightly longer.<br /><br />But of course we would n't want to take time away from our next match which saw real life husband and wife Marc Mero and Sable defeat Goldust and Luna Vachon in the first mixed tag match at Wrestlemania in 8 years . And , in all honesty , it was n't worth the wait . While not terrible , the match was in no way memorable either . This was the nearing the end of Mero 's only run in the WWE and the main purpose was to continue the disintegration of his relationship with Sable.<br /><br />Next up we saw Ken Shamrock flip out and cost himself the Intercontinental Championship as he destroyed IC Champion The Rock , but then refused to let go of his ankle lock submission hold , resulting in the referee reversing his decision . This was a short match , but decent for what it was.<br /><br />Next saw the first good match of the night as WWE Tag Team Champions the New Age Outlaws lost their titles to Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie in a fun dumpster match . The decision was overturned the following night as Cactus and chainsaw had thrown the Outlaws into a dumpster backstage , rather than the one being used in the match , but this was still a fun match.<br /><br />NOw it was time for the highly anticipated first ever meeting between Kane and his brother the Undertaker . Kane had cost Undertaker the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble and then " killed " him when he helped Shawn Michaels lock Undertaker in a casket and set him on fire as revenge for the Undertaker burning down their parents house and leaving him horribly disfigured years before . This was a decent match and told a nice story as the Underataker absorbed everything Kane could throw at him and then knocked him out with three tombstones to end the match.<br /><br />This left only the main event which saw WWE Champion face Steve Austin with Mike Tyson as the guest enforcer . Michaels had suffered a debilitating back injury in his match with the Undertaker at the Royal Rumble and was remarkable in this match despite his physical limitations . Triple H and Chyna were banished to the back in the early going after interfering from the outside . The match ended with Austin ducking an attempt at Sweet Chin Music and hitting the Stone Cold Stunner with the ref down . TYson then came into the ring to count the three , celebrating the win with Austin and then knocking out Michaels after the match . It turned out Tyson and Austin were together and the cat had been playing with the mouse all along.<br /><br />That was the final PPV match for Shawn Michaels for four and a half years . It helped establish Austin as the biggest star in the wrestling business and the mainstream publicity garnered by Tyson 's appearance proved a crucial turning point in the WWE 's battle with WCW . Austin would go on to become the biggest star in WWE History , and along with the Rock , Mick Foley , the Undertaker and Triple H lead the WWE through the period where they would gain their highest level of cultural relevance . And it all started here at Wrestlemania 14 .
1 Wrestlemania 14 is not often looked as one of the great Wrestlemania 's but I would personally put it , in my top 5 , if not the top 3 . It has so many great things , and it truly signified the birth of The Attitude Era , which was WWE 's best era , in my opinion . HBK has the heart of a lion , and him putting over Austin like he did , on his way out , was pure class on his part . It has one of the hottest crowds you will ever see , and it has J.R and The King at their announcing best!. < br /><br />Matches.<br /><br />15  team battle royal LOUD pop for L.O.D 's return . I 'm not a fan of battle royal 's , and this is yet another average one . Very predictable , even when you 1st see it , it 's obvious L.O.D would win . Looking at Sunny for 8 or so minutes though , definitely helps . < br /><br />2/5<br /><br />WWF Light Heavyweight Championship < br /><br />Taka Michinoku|C| Vs Aguila.<br /><br />Taka gets a surprising pop , with his entrance . Fast , high - flying , and very exciting . If these two had more time , they would have surely tore the roof off , with their stuff . Taka wins with the Michinoku driver.<br /><br />3 1/2 /5<br /><br />WWF European Championship.<br /><br />Triple H|C| Vs Owen Hart Stipulation here , is Chyna is handcuffed to Slaughter . Nice pop for Owen , mixed reaction for Trips . A really , really underrated match , that ranks among one of my favorites for Wrestlemania , actually . The two mixed together very well , and Owen can go with anybody . Trips wins , with Chyna interference.<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />Mixed Tag match . Marc Mero&Sable Vs Goldust&Luna . Defining pop for Sable , unheard of that time , for woman . Sable actually looks hot , and the crowd is just eating her up!. Constant Sable chants , and them erupting almost every time she gets in the ring . Not bad for a Mixed tag match , it had entertaining antics , and passed the time well . Sable 's team wins , when Sable hits the TKO.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />WWF Intercontinental Championship . Ken Shamrock Vs The Rock|C| . Before I review the match , I 'd like to note The Rock showed off his immense potential , with his interview with Jennifer Flowers , before his match . Nice pop for Shamrock , big time heat for The Rock . Too disappointingly short , and I thought the ending was kinda stupid , though Shamrock 's snapping antics were awesome to see , and the crowd went nuts for it . Rock keeps the title , when The Ref reverses the decision.<br /><br />2/5<br /><br />Dumpster match , for The WWF Tag Team Championship < br /><br />Catcus Jack&Terry Funk Vs The New Age Outlaws . The Outlaws are not as over , as they were gon na be at this time . Crowd is actually somewhat dead for this , but I thought it had some great Hardcore bits , with some sick looking bumps . Cactus and Terry win the titles in the end.<br /><br />3/5<br /><br />The Undertaker vs Kane . Big time ovation , for The Undertaker . Much better than there outing at Wrestlemania 20 , and for a big man vs big man match , this was really good . It was a great all out brawl , with The Undertaker taking a sick looking bump , through the table . WWE was smart , by making Kane looking strong , even through defeat . After 2 tombstone kick out 's , Taker finally puts him away , with a 3rd one.<br /><br />3 1/2 /5<br /><br />WWF Championship . < br /><br />Special Guest Enforcer " Mike Tyson" < br /><br />HBK|C| Vs Steve Austin . Big heat for Tyson . Crowd goes ape sh*t for Austin , definitely one of the biggest pops I have heard . Mixed reaction , for HBK . This is truly a special match up , one of the greatest wrestlemania main events in history , you can tell when J.R is even out of breath . HBK gives it his all , in what was supposed to be his last match , and Austin has rarely been better . The animosity and electricity from the crowd is amazing , and it 's as exciting as it gets . Austin wins with the stunner , with Tyson joining 3:16 by knocking out Michaels . Austin 's celebratory victory , is a wonder to behold , with one of the nosiest crowd 's you will ever see , King said it right , they were going nuts.<br /><br />5/5<br /><br />Bottom line . Wrestlemania 14 is one of the greatest for real . It has everything you want in a Wrestlemania , and truly kick started the Attitude Era . This is very special to me , because it was the 1st Wrestlemania I ever saw , back in 98 . " The Austin Era , has begun!" < br /><br />9 1/2 /10
1 Any true wrestling fan would have to consider this Wrestlemania to be one of , if not the best of all time . It was packed with excitement and surprises . One of the greatest matches of all time was between Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin with special guest ref Mike Tyson . The show that Michaels put on was unbelievable , especially considering the shape that his back was in and that this was his last match .
1 This Wrestlemania just did n't do it for me . While some things , such as the battle royal and involvement of celebrities were a throwback to the good old days , so to speak , it seemed to be more of a highbrow " In Your House " than anything else . Above average ... worth it for several matches such as the tag team title match , although worthy of note is that the title change meant nothing , as it was reversed the next night .
1 This is just the best movie of all times ! Sorry , Hollywood ! I 've seen it in early 70 's , as soon as it appeared on the Bulgarian TV , and I loved it immediately ( I was 14 then ) . 25 years later I bought it on a video tape , and a few months ago it finally appeared on a DVD here in Bulgaria . I live with this movie 35 years already , and so do all my friends and my family . My son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time , and he loved it immediately , too ( and this is the generation that grew up watching practically only Hollywood movies and not speaking or understanding Russian at all ! ) . What makes this masterpiece of Danelia so special ? It 's difficult to say , as it is difficult to describe what the beauty is ... But the fact is that you can watch this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as it was the first time . I ca n't remember any other such movie , no matter how many millions it cost or how great the cast was ... Chapeau , Maestro Danelia ! Bulgaria loves you !
1 Although the film is the adaptation of the French play ( forgot the name - sorry ) , it is a wonderful portrayal of the cheerful side of Georgian character . This film will make you to burst into laughter and will fill your heart with warm sadness . It will display the overwhelming love of life along with human eccentricities .
1 This is my first comment on IMDb website , and the reason I 'm writing it is that we 're talking about ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER ! ' Ne goryuy ! ' will make you laugh and cry at the same time , you will fall in love ( if you 're not a fan yet ! ) with Georgian choir singing tradition , and possibly you will accept the hardships of your own existence and just feel good after watching it : ) What I like a lot about this film is that actors in the non - leading roles create vivid and memorable characters and are just as interesting and important as the central character . The film is starring Vahtang Kikabidze ( who is great ) , but you will remember every single face around him in the film . You will find yourself quoting their lines , that have become household names for so many Russian - speaking people . A film to live with . Simple , yet deep , you will want to watch it again and again .
1 The quintessential Georgian film of Georgi Danelia , Ne goryuy ( 1969 ) aka Do n't Grieve is loosely based on the novel by French writer Claude Tillier ( 1801 - 1844 ) " Mon oncle Benjamin " The novel takes place in the country side of the 18th Century France . The Great French Revolution is still ahead but some of its stormy signs are present in society . Benjamin , the local doctor is a soul of a local society , the educated , friendly , democratic person who often treats the poor for free . It makes him very popular with the locals but most certainly does not help with his bank account . He is in love with a beautiful Manette who is also crazy about him but is being watched closely by her father who called his daughter " his small capital " and is determined to protect her virginity until the moment the marriage contract has been signed ... I never read the book , and from description it sounds like a charming very French novel but I am fascinated with the results of moving the characters and some plot elements from 18th Century France to the beginning of 20th century Georgia - Grusiya . I would think that it was Danelia who came up with all the colorful memorable characters that feel so much at home in his native Georgia - Grusiya , the land of long and wonderful traditions , including Art of making and drinking wine , rare music talent that all Georgians seem to possess , very unique humor , and high code of honor . When we watched the film last night together with my husband , he said , what a great example of an Art film , and I so agree with him . Do n't Grieve is a perfect Art movie , visually beautiful , deep but funny , at times sad and philosophical but never in a preachy arrogant way but optimistic , celebrating life with all its beauty and sadness , full of interest , loving irony and understanding for its slightly eccentric but very human characters . What is the most important , the film is warm and gentle , it does not look down at its viewers as some of the Art pictures do . You do n't have to be a movie buff to love it , to live with it , to smile and sigh at it , to follow the good - hearted young Doctor Benjamin ( first role in a Danelia film of famous singer and actor Wachtang Kikabidze with whom Danelia would go on to make two more films including one of my all time favorites , Mimino ) on his journey through the roads and mountains of Georgia . Or to be a guest on one of a kind party where the friends gather to celebrate life of the old doctor Levan who wanted to be a guest on his own wake , to hear what his friends have to say about him when he dies while he is still alive , and who gets to choose which color he prefers for his coffin . When I watched the film I thought that it is a sort of movie that Federico Fellini might have liked . I was not surprised at all to find the article about Danelia where he names Fellini his number one director . I also found out that according Danelia , the famous Soviet directors , Leonid Gaiday ( the creator of many beloved comedies ) and Sergei Paraszhanov ( the visionary whom I do n't have to introduce loved another Danelia 's film , fairy tale about American boy Huck Finn , Sovsem propashchiy ) felt and spoke negatively about Do n't Grieve while Fellini praised it highly . I dare go a little further and just guess that perhaps Maestro Fellini kept in mind some images and the very aura and atmosphere of Do n't Grieve when he was making Amrarcord in 1973 . Just a thought , because there is something essential that connects both films . Both Artists came back to their roots , to the places that they love deeply , to the people they remembered , loved and wanted to honor . Both films have a lot of smiles through the tears . Both are Art movies that would get directly to the hearts of the viewers . Both are masterworks.<br /><br />I think I am going to add Georgi Danelia to the list of my favorite directors . He has made some of the brilliant pictures in my most favorite genre of dramedy , even tragicomedies that are funny and bitter sweet , poignant and subtle , earthy and uplifting , gentle and shining . When I looked up the list of the movies he has written / directed , I was amazed at the fact that he has not made a single bad film since he started back in 1960 with the Award winning story of a young boy , Seryozha . Many of Danelia 's films are among my favorites , as I am sure they are among his legions of fans . The man behind ' Seryozha , Sovsem propashchiy ( 1972 ) which is an adaptation of Mark Twain The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn , 33 , Ya shagayu po Moskve ( 1964 ) aka Walking the Streets of Moscow , Ne goryuy ( 1969 ) aka Do n't grieve , Afonya ( 1975 ) , Mimino ( 1977 ) , Osenniy marafon ( 1979 ) aka Autumn Marathon or Sad Comedy which is a very fitting title for this movie as well as for the whole genre that Danelia practically invented , and the cult favorite for over 20 years Kin - Dza - Dza ( 1986 ) , is brilliant and deserves our true love and genuine gratitude for the unforgettable moments of cinematic happiness .
1 this is best comedy i ever seen ! but not all can understand this you must be from Georgia to understand this amazing movie ! :) overall one of best film i ever seen ......... Vachtangi(Benjamin ) and all supporting actors playing very very good but acting of Kote Daoshvili ( Father Germogel ) is for my opinion best acting in supporting role in history of films :)) in this movie playing many georgian stars like ipolite xvichia , sergo Zakariadze , sofiko chiaureli , verikoan djafaridze , Sesilia Takaishvili , Dodo Abashidze .... they all are Stars in Georgian cinematography :) plus in this movie is playing great Russian star Evgeni Leonov and of course Director of the film Georgy Danelia is one of the best ...... i recommending this movie for everyone but remember you must know good Russian language to watch this movie
1 This show started out with great mystery episodes . I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes . After that , the show started playing short episodes with Shaggy , Scooby doo , and Scrappy doo.<br /><br />I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to change 20 minutes episodes into short episodes . Some of the voice actors became unavailable . After 15 or 16 episodes , Frank Welker ( who played Fred ) became unavailable . I think the voice of Velma changes after first 12 episodes , because the first voice actress who played Velma was unavailable.<br /><br />And the network ordered the Hanna Barbera studio to make more shorts with Shaggy , Scooby doo , and Scrappy doo , because the ratings were high . So they had to make more shorts . I wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes . Still it is a good show .
1 This was actually my favorite series of Scooby Doo when I was younger . I thought each episode had more of an edge to it and the villains had a lot of creative thought put into them ( and even very scary and believable as well ) . Some of the best episodes were " I Left My Neck In San Francisco " , " Twenty Thousand Screams Under The Sea " , " The Ghoul , The Bat And The Ugly " and " When You Wish Upon A Star Creature " . If you have never seen these episodes please do . This series was a bit of a mixed bag though as there were other episodes which did n't seem to have the same kind of edge to them such as " Rocky Mountain YIIII ! " and " The Ransom Of Scooby Chief " . As like the series before it , it was very well put together , interesting storyline and brilliantly drawn . As everyone says though , it would have been so much better without Scrappy Doo . The character was tiresome and distracting to the story that was being told .
1 some people think that the second series was where scooby was ruined .. i disagree totally.the shows quality did not go up or down and scrappy , win my opinion , as a very good chrecter.i looked at a poll on jumpedtheshark.com and 72 % of people said scrappys second series was scoobys downfall . OK so loads said yes but 28%still ca nt be wrong . I do like the way most of the episodes focused on comedy.i believe the show would have gone rubbish if it was the same 5 people / dog solving mystery in same formula.scrappy was a breath of fresh air to the show.sure,some people tuned out but when scrappy was introduced viewing figures DOUBLED.Back to the show . All the episodes and segments were very funny.i was Intriguded by the yabba shorts and .But at the end of the day its a matter of opinion if you like scrappy or not is a matter of opinion , there is certainly no fact involved . But in my OPINION this was a superb series that gave a beginning to tire show a new formula and lease of life . Nuff said .
1 Let 's cut to the chase : If you 're a baby - boomer , you inevitably spent some time wondering at the fact that , in 1976 , McCartney had the gumption to drop in on John 's city hermit life and spend the day with him . You also certainly wondered how things went . I heard the exact same reports that the writer of this film heard , from John 's and Paul 's perspective , and I admit that I reconstructed the meeting in pretty much the same way this film does . But none of my imaginings could have bought tears to my eyes the way this incredible piece of work and acting does . I found it amazingly lifelike , perfectly plausible and 100 % saccharin - free . Now , can anyone explain why I did n't hear of this masterpiece before it was shown by the CBC last night ? I mean it 's already three years old , for goodness sake ! And yes , if you 're a Beatles fan , this is a must - see performance ! Even the subtle paraphrasing of Beatles ' melodies in the background is inspired .
1 Being the Beatlemaniac that I am , I approached Two Of Us with a combination of fear and fascination . Having seen ' In His Life : The John Lennon Story ' , I was quite concerned that Two Of Us will turn out no better . The fact that Aidan Quinn and Jared Harris look absolutely nothing like John Lennon and Paul McCartney  even with some make - up and proper hairdos  did n't help one bit.<br /><br />But I was more than a bit pleasantly surprised . It 's probably thanks to the involvement of Michael Lindsay - Hogg , who directed Let It Be in 1970 and consequently probably knew John and Paul quite well , that the characters and the dialogue came across as convincing as they did . ( The writing credit for Two Of Us is given to a man named Mark Stanfield , of whom I know absolutely nothing ; I feel confident that director Lindsay - Hogg had more than a bit to do with the script . ) Two Of Us is not a biography of the Beatles ; it has very little plot , in fact , and takes place all in one day in New York City . What it does is imagine a meeting between John and Paul in 1976 , while John lived in New York . That meeting is entirely fictitious , of course  though it ca n't truly be disproved that such a meeting actually took place . But through that imagined conversation it gives us a glimpse into the personalities of these two great musicians  their intelligence , their sense of humor , their different reaction to stardom , and most of all their relationship ; what made them such a great team , and what broke them up.<br /><br />Since it 's a talk movie , nothing much except for dialogue between two characters for an hour and a half , it 's likely to bore all but true fans of the Beatles ; but it 's a fantastic piece of writing and storytelling , and is both informative and touching . For those interested in these two musical giants , very quickly you 'll get over the shock of how different the actors look from their counterparts and feel like John and Paul had come to life  so intimate and convincing is the script , and so committed are the actors . Two Of Us gives you priceless insight into the lives of two geniuses , and a tale that is both sad and funny . Most certainly recommended .
1 This film is worth seeing alone for Jared Harris ' outstanding portrayal of John Lennon . It does n't matter that Harris does n't exactly resemble Lennon ; his mannerisms , expressions , posture , accent and attitude are pure Lennon . Best scene : Lennon in a local cafe verbally sparring with a stuttering fan as to whether Paul McCartney & Wings ' " Silly Love Songs " is worthy of # 1 status in America .
1 I admit I had some trepidation when I first saw the previews for this film . Was VH-1 treading on hollow ground here ? I mean , Harris and Quinn do n't really look or even sound like John or Paul . But I have to admit , this film really surprised me . It 's far from the exploitation film I expected . Instead , it 's a character study , a low - key , whimsical , and ultimately bittersweet look at friendship , and the ultimate lesson we all learn : it 's hard , if not impossible , to capture what we once had , and what has passed us by .
1 Very Slight Spoiler < br /><br / > This movie ( despite being only on TV ) is absolutely excellent . I didn`t really pay attention to the differences in looks or accents , so I can`t really comment on that . The acting in this was so good I had to pinch myself and say " Remember , it`s only a movie , this DIDN`T REALLY HAPPEN " . As I sat and listened to Harris and Quinn talk , I knew that it was exactly what John and Paul would be talking about had they actually had this meeting . The offhanded comments and burns from John were right on with his character(especially in the restaurant ! ) , as was his depression while Paul was very easy going and laid back . Both actors did and excellent job and I was thrilled to have seen this movie . It`s a wicked experience for any Beatles fan . And prepare for a few surprises !
1 Recently shown on cable tv the movie opens with a disclaimer distancing itself from any co - operation of real life persons ; that in itself is an eye catcher . Yet the script and acting from the main characters is superb and I found myself engrossed throughout . Due in no small way to the crisp , thoughtful and interesting dialogue . The film is about a meeting on one day between two real life musical " legends " who formerly composed together then seperated . The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies , in a story which proffers an explanation for their initial " split " . What is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they play , faults and all , that this viewer at least was left believing I was witnessing a true event in almost every detail . The great skill of this play is that with astute writing and fine acting a movie basically about " two of us " talking can make an excellent picture . Worthy of at least an 8 out of 10 .
1 Even though I 'm quite young , The Beatles are my ABSOLUTELY FAVOURITE band ! I never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since I can remember.<br /><br />It 's the sort of film that is worth trying the once . I can see why it was n't released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the TV . I was flicking through my TV guide and happened to see this film , it did n't much details except something like , ' John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after The Beatles have broken up , Jared Harris Stars ' . I 'd never heard of him ( he played John ) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul . However they are certainly underestimated actors!<br /><br />The film had a slow start but as it developed , I could see how well Quinn but especially Harris played their characters . As a huge fan , I sort of know what the real Lennon and McCartney are like . The script was brilliant and Harris got Lennon 's accent , personality and mannerisms spot on ! Quinn played McCartney quite well but sometimes went into his Irish accent . THe make - up artists made them look excellent.<br /><br />THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE COUNTED AS A * SPOILER*:<br /><br />As I mentioned before , it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film . I found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians . As for Lennon 's rude line in the Italian restaurant , totally unnecessary . The ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever I watch it.<br /><br />It is quite different from the other biographical films I 've seen where it 's about how The Beatles got together and became famous , and those never really did the characters that well . E.g. ' Backbeat'.<br /><br />In conclusion , I would say , if you 're a Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan , give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise . At only about 95 minutes long , it 's worth waiting for the film to develop.<br /><br />If anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the ' comments page ' for this film , I 'd be very interested .
1 This is one of the few movies released about a " what if " type of situation that made me think . It was amazing to hear them speak to each other , and reminisce about all the wonderful ( and not so wonderful ) things that happened between them . I actually think that there is a very good possibility this occurred like the movie implies , and they actually made peace with each other . Those are good memories for every fan to hang onto , and to ask what actually happened between them would be selfish . What an AMAZING movie this was . The comedic aspects of the movie were wonderful . To think that they were together to patch things up between them in such a way is a comforting thought to people who wish they had a chance to clear the air with someone they did n't get to . To see John as such a caring , laid back character was refreshing from hearing all of the trash that was spoken about him ...
1 I absolutely loved this film ! I was hesitant to watch it at first because I thought it would be too painful . I remember how hard it was when John was shot . However , watching the " Two of Us " took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility . I think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what " might have been . " Aidan Quinn was adorable as Paul and met the challenge head on . I was impressed with his accent and mannerisms . Jared Harris is also very talented and was quite believable as John . My favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene - which was so poignant . The film left me with both sadness and satisfaction , both of which I feel are appropriate , given the circumstances .
1 I still wonder why I watched this movie . Admittedly , before I viewed this film , I knew practicly nothing about the beatles . I did n't even know all their names ! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans , they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever , they broke up , John married Yoko Ono , and John was murdered.<br /><br />Also , VH1 is n't even my favorite music station , MTV is . Still , for some reason or another I decided to watch it , not expecting much . Surprisingly , I enjoyed it very much ! The dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up . This is very important , because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film , allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities , and to keep you watching . Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give good performaces , overall.<br /><br />The ending was also very smart . I enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performace , and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go , and end it on a good note . My favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene.<br /><br />Overall , I recommend this film to almost everyone . It is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul just showed up on John 's doorstep . Which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film , settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup .
1 this was a real guilt pleasure ... i saw the trailer and all the advertising , so i figured ' why not check out this vh1 movie ? ' and , as they used to say on t.v . , ' i ca n't believe i watched the whole thing ! ' quinn and harris were believable beatle boys , and , although the accents were sort of over - the - top and difficult to decipher at times , i found the dialogue believable as well . the film touched upon the tenuous relationship of len / mc and showed how , deep down , they were simply two guys who grew up close together and shared a passion for music - coming at it , though , with different sets of issues and personal needs . you find yourself wishing they 'd hopped in the cab to snl for an impromptu reunion that would have knocked the world 's socks off , but you also gain a greater appreciation for why they did n't
1 I sat down to watch this film with much trepidation and little hope . I did n't think it would be possible for this film to live up to its subject matter . But it absolutely did , and then some . First , I must say that Jared Harris did an extraordinary job as John Lennon . At times it seemed that Harris was channeling Lennon . The resemblance was often uncanny , and he clearly studied Lennon 's mannerisms and vocal inflections . Aiden Quinn was quite good as McCartney , also bearing a striking resemblance to Macca , although he did occasionally trip over his Scouse accent.<br /><br />This work of fiction was well - written and well - directed . It was pure fantasy , of course , but sometimes I felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole at this reunion . The rooftop scene was especially moving , as McCartney told Lennon what he had never heard as a child -- that he was worthy and important , and it could never be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents . I also enjoyed the scene in the park where the pair of them danced with absolute abandon to the reggae band!<br /><br />My one complaint would be this : I am not so sure that John was as caustic as he was portrayed in the film at this stage in his life . He had settled in to his domestic situation quite nicely , and he was actually known to be quite friendly when approached by fans . Only a few years later , he was very friendly when he was first approached by his assassin for an autograph on the day he was murdered.<br /><br />Mostly this film served to stir up those feelings again about what might have been had John lived a bit longer . I am quite sure the Beatles would have come back together at some stage . And I am quite certain that Lennon and McCartney would still be friends today.<br /><br />Well done , VH1 . I will watch it again and again.<br /><br / >
1 * WARNING * Spoilers ahead ... The writers of this story knew these men very well . The actors , likewise , portrayed them very well . The result is that by the end of the film you feel like you 're actually watching John Lennon and Paul McCartney . The expected tensions are there , especially in the awkward first moments . But as the two begin to loosen up , the old camaraderie that made the Beatles work so well begins to show through . The bitterness is still there , and interrupts at times , but by the time John gets the idea to take Lorne Michaels up on his offer to pay the Beatles the gag sum of $ 3000 to appear on " Saturday Night Live " , the two could be the same boyish pranksters that terrorized Liverpool together as teens , and survived playing the rough nightclubs of Hamburg to rise to Superstardom . But in the end , this wonderful fantasy grounds us gently . We are reminded why a Beatles reunion was most likely never possible even before Lennon 's assassination : The two driving forces of the group outgrew each other .
1 I am a big Beatles fan . My favorite Beatle is Paul and my least favorite is John . I already knew quite a bit about the Beatles music and the truth behind the breakup , as well as things like John Lennon 's family and Paul 's band Wings . I was curious to see how this movie would handle the relationship between John and Paul so many years after the breakup.<br /><br />I was not disappointed by this movie . Although the story itself is fiction , many of the references that the two musicians used were very accurate . These included how Yoko Ono would always be with John wherever he went , the Wings song " Silly Love Songs " being the number one hit that year and the concert on the roof of Apple Studios playing music from the album " Let It Be." < br /><br />The actors did a very good job in playing John and Paul . The accents could had used maybe a bit more work , but they seemed to act a lot like I 've read the two former - Beatles used to act like . I also liked the dialogue between them , which was basically what the entire movie was.<br /><br />The ending at first disappointed me , but the more you think about it the more you will appreciate it , especially since this was how it really went in real life . They also show the fantastic skit from " Saturday Night Live " in which the Beatles are offered $ 3,000 to perform on the show . ( as compared to the $ 220 million others were offering them ) Overall , I was not disappointed with this movie . It does really give you more of a feel for why the Beatles broke up and why they never got back together .
1 This was the first televised episode of the Columbo series ( although it was filmed after " Death Lends a Hand")and it heralded one of the most successful TV series in history.<br /><br />Jack Cassidy ( who played the murderer in the series three times ) enthuses smugness , arrogance and self - assuredness in equal measure here , as Ken Franklin , one half of a mystery writing team who hatches an elaborate plot to kill off his partner , Jim Ferris ( played by Martin Milner ) who decides to terminate their professional relationship , leaving Franklin exposed as merely a good publicist rather than a prolific writer.<br /><br />The initial murder set - up is fantastic and Cassidy 's performance facilitates an arguable accolade that he was the best Columbo murderer in the series.<br /><br />Peter Falk is wonderfully understated in his role as Columbo and the character 's inherent traits and oddities , which are underlined by a seeming slowness and absent - mindedness , contrast particularly well with Cassidy 's character 's extreme smugness : one of their early scenes together where Ken Franklin fabricates a motive for the killing through Jim Ferris 's non - existent expo - see of identifying hit - men operating in the underworld exemplifies this very well . Franklin hints to Columbo this potential motive and Columbo ( purposely or ignorantly ) fails to latch on , forcing Franklin to express his disappointment in a markedly patronising manner and compare him unfavourably with the detective in the books , Mrs. Melville.<br /><br />Also , noteworthy is the early directorial contribution of 24 year old Steven Spielberg . Notwithstanding , some elementary inclusions of cameras shadowing the actors and actresses , he adds some stylish and elaborate touches to uphold the general professionalism of the episode . One particularly stark image is of Jim Feriss 's dead body lying on the settee , almost dark in the foreground , as Ken Franklin raises a glass to him in the background after he finishes answering a phone call to Ferris 's distraught wife . I have no doubt that working to a restrictive 10 - 14 day schedule , Spieberg 's efforts should not be underestimated.<br /><br />Unfortunately , the event of the second murder , necessitated by a blackmailing scheme which is plotted by a female friend of Franklin 's ( and ironically referred to as " sloppy " by Columbo in his climatic summing up ) takes the steam out of the whole thing . The cutting edge of the plot is compromised and the screen - time between Falk and Cassidy inexcusably lessens at this point to perhaps help the script - writer ( Stephen Bocho ) out of a tight corner , since he can not singularly develop the story without another murder.<br /><br />The climax is the most disappointing aspect of this episode . The initial banter and exchange of words between Falk and Cassidy is strongly and effectively executed , but it merely advertises the fact that it should have happened more in the episode . The main aggravation lies with the sealing clue ( if it can be called a clue ) : Cassidy 's character 's hitherto smugness and arrogance is amazingly expelled by a clue that really does little to imply his guilt ; and once this is mentioned , he capitulates in a rather unspectacular and uncharacteristic fashion.<br /><br />All in all , a bold opening to the series , which inevitably advertises and foretells all that is good about Columbo , and , conversely , the problems associated with such ingenuity , i.e maintaining the high standards and particularly , creating a credible and suitably intelligent ending .
1 This Columbo episode is probably noted more for the director , Steven Spielberg , as one of his early films . It should be looked at for Jack Cassidy 's role as the murderer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle . Jack Cassidy would appear in a later Columbo . After all , Columbo meets his match in Jack Cassidy 's character . He is a mystery writer who plots to perform the perfect murder . After his first murder , his next victim would be the annoying general store owner / widow who would blackmail him for money . Rather than losing more money , he kills her . It is very entertaining to watch Cassidy and Falk as always . Falk 's familiarity as Columbo makes him watchable after viewing this episode repeatedly over the years . What television today forgets about the success of years is that people will want to watch the shows again and again if they like the characters . It 's not about who does it , how and why , it the familiarness of Columbo and his likability which scores high with viewers like myself .
1 The story for the first - aired television installment of " Columbo " is simple : one - half of successful mystery - writing team does away with the other , frames an unseen Mafia group , is blackmailed by an admirer , does away with the admirer , and is tricked up by the stalwart Columbo.<br /><br />With that said , this is still one of the most entertaining in the show 's history , benefiting tremendously by the work of the late Jack Cassidy and star Peter Falk.<br /><br />Besides the notability of being directed by a young Steven Spielberg , the episode also has a air of the macabre because of the future of two of its stars : Cassidy and Barbara Colby . The two share several scenes together and it is poignant that both would die tragically within a decade of this filming , Cassidy in an apartment fire and Colby at the hands of assailants , yet to be found after over three decades.<br /><br />Now , both demises are true - life MYSTERIES !
1 Along with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp , Jack Cassidy was an iconic Columbo villain . The very first " proper " episode of Columbo , following two standalone pilots , " Murder By The Book " is not far off classic status.<br /><br />Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin , one half of a murder mystery writing partnership . His partner Jim is the talented one , whereas Ken has no talent other than the gift of the gab and a skill for promoting the books . As soon as Jim has decided he no longer requires Ken 's marketing skills , Ken hatches a plot to kill Jim . Except it 's not a new plot , it 's actually the implementation in real life of a murder storyline originally intended for one of their books.<br /><br />It does n't take Columbo long to work out that Ken is the murderer , although unfortunately another murder has to take place ( Ken romances and then kills a key witness ) before Columbo has enough evidence to secure a conviction.<br /><br />Nothing whatsoever wrong with " Murder By The Book " , but it 's not quite top - notch . I would just give " Publish Or Perish " the edge over this : both episodes feature Jack Cassidy and the world of publishing , but " Publish Or Perish " is a fraction more tense and unpredictable . But this is still a great episode .
1 Casting Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was sheer brilliance . Cassidy personified arrogance , confidence , charm and wit - all with a condescending , evil little smirk on his face . In my opinion , Jack Cassidy is by far the best murderer ( having appeared three times ) in the Columbo series . This particular ( and first ) performance , is my favorite Columbo episode ever - hands down . A fresh faced Steven Spielberg did amazing camera work ( yes , there were a couple of camera shadows on the actors at times)capturing the nuances and banter at different and intriguing angles between Columbo and Franklin . Also , the panoramic and tight in shots at Big Bear Lake , CA ( Franklin 's cabin home ) were very impressive.<br /><br />If you have not yet seen this episode , then you owe it to yourself to do so - it 's a true masterpiece.<br /><br />Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer . His charismatic personality was highly infectious . His death in 1976 , at age 49 was very sad and indeed very tragic - he surely had his best years ahead of him . Rest in Peace Jack , you will live on for eternity through your great work .
1 This is the Columbo that got directed by Steven Spielberg at an early point in his career . It 's nothing sensational but some small hint of great things to come for Spielberg can be seen in this movie . The movie is basically in the same style as most of Spierlberg 's ' 70 's movies and TV works . So that means that some characters tend to show some quirkiness 's and no I 'm not just talking about the Columbo character alone . The kind of character quirkiness which perhaps can be best seen in the 1975 Spielberg movie " Jaws " . But other than some small hints of typical early Spielberg elements , you ca n't call this movie the work of- and fine example of a rising director star . Not that its bad , of course it is n't but as I said earlier , it also is n't anything too sensational.<br /><br />This movie began really well and very promising but after it 's fine opening , in which as always the murder occurred , the movie became sort of more slow and also dull to watch . Dull because it 's mostly a Columbo movie by the book that does n't have real memorable moments in it , not dull because it 's a boring movie to watch.<br /><br />The murder itself was quite ingenious and the concept of having a crime story writer murdering his writing partner showed some great and interesting potential . The story however did n't really explored all of its possibilities . At least that 's the feeling this movie left me with.<br /><br />The movie was still a good one to watch nevertheless thanks to the character of Jack Cassidy , who thinks he 's smarter then Columbo , due to his mystery / crime writing experience and tries to give him all kinds of possible hints , leading away from himself . But of course Columbo knows better and he is his number one suspect from the first moment on but he as usual plays the game along.<br /><br />The movie does have a good overall style and uses some fine camera position and editing . Funny to see that also most of this was all mostly consistent with Spielberg 's later work , especially some of the camera - angles.<br /><br />A fine and perfectly watchable Columbo movie but do n't let the name of Spielberg attached to it rise your expectations for it too highly.<br /><br />7/10
1 There is no such a thing as perfect murder . Lieutenant Columbo knows that . Ken Franklin , who is the other half of the writing team of detective stories does n't know that . He kills his partner Jim Ferris who had plans on going solo . Now Columbo steps into the picture and asks all sorts of questions from Mr. Franklin . And returns for one more question . Columbo : Murder by the Book ( 1971 ) is directed by the young Steven Spielberg before his days of fame . Steven Bochco wrote it . Columbo is a fantastic character with his shabby look . It 's hard to believe this man could solve any crime . But he could . Each and every one of them ! Peter Falk is the one and only person in the world that could portray this character . So no remakes , please . This part is a very good example of how Columbo worked . Jack Cassidy plays the murderer and Martin Milner plays the victim . Rosemary Forsyth plays the victim 's wife Joanna Ferris . There 's something endearing in the scenes between Columbo and her . How he makes the omelet and everything . Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka . She actually met a tragic fate when she died after a homicide like she does here . I've been a fan of Columbo since childhood and I still enjoy watching them . There was a break for many years that they were n't showing Columbo stories at all but now he 's back . Back for one more question .
1 " The Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I 've ever done ! "  Robert Altman < br /><br />In 1955 Charles Laughton directed " The Night of the Hunter " , a spooky slice of Southern Gothic in which Robert Mitchum plays a scary serial killer . One of the film 's more famous sequences consists of two kids escaping from Mitchum on a rowboat , the kids frantically paddling whilst Mitchum wades after them like a monster . < br /><br />Seven years later Mitchum played an equally spooky killer in " Cape Fear " , another film set in the American South . That film featured a local attorney trying to protect his family and likewise ended with Mitchum terrorising folks on a boat . In 1991 Martin Scorsese , trying to branch out and tackle something more mainstream , remade " Cape Fear " , boat scene and all.<br /><br />Now we have Robert Altman 's " The Gingerbread Man " , another slice of small town Southern Gothic . Altman says he consulted " The Night of the Hunter " for inspiration and tackled such a mainstream film purely because he wanted to " spread his wings and try a popcorn picture " , but what he 's secretly attempting to do here is deconstruct the canonical films of the Southern Gothic genre.<br /><br />So instead of a showdown on small boat , we get a showdown on a giant ship . Instead of two kids being kidnapped , we get two kids being safely returned to the police . Instead of money being hidden , we have money being readily given via a last will and testament . Instead of the righteous attorney of the 1961 film and the deplorable attorney of the 1991 remake , we get a rather three - dimensional lawyer in Kenneth Branagh . Instead of the monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the bad guys . Instead of the monster breaking into the family 's house boat , we have the hero hunting the monster on board the monster 's " house ship " . Similarly , instead of a murderous serial killer we get an innocent weirdo played by Robert Duvall . . .etc etc etc.<br /><br />Altman goes on and on , reversing everything just a little slightly , pulling at the edges and doing his own thing . His touch is most apparent during the film 's first half - hour , the film existing in an uneasy space between conventional plot - driven movie storytelling and Altman 's fondness for overlapping dialogue , casual narratives , prowling camera movement and the way that characters are n't so much introduced as they are simply part of what 's going on.<br /><br />Still , despite Altman 's best intentions , the film never rises above mediocrity . Altman 's too bound to the conventions of the " thriller format " to do much damage , his style is too lethargic to generate tension and the film is simply not radical enough to counterpoint other canonical films in the genre . " Gingerbread Man " is thus too mainstream to work as a more pure Altman film and too Altman to work as a mainstream thriller.<br /><br />The film 's not a complete waste , though . Robert Downey Junior , Kenneth Branagh and the usually intolerable Daryl Hannah , all turn in juicy performances . The film also has a nice atmosphere , set against a approaching hurricane , and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns . While it 's not the complete disaster that Scorsese 's " Cape Fear " was , the film still never amounts to anything special.<br /><br />7/10  In the late 90s Altman made 3 successive films set in the American South : " Kansas City " , " Gingerbread Man " and " Cookie 's Fortune " . Unlike " Gingerbread Man " , both " Kansas City " and " Cookie 's Fortune " tackle the genre on the broader , more looser canvases that Altman was most comfortable with . < br /><br />"Kansas City " is the more important of these two films , its hierarchies of class , politics and crime , and its desire to break radically away from typical gangster genre frameworks , would prove influential on all serious 21st century film crime writers ( see , for example , " The Wire " ) . That said , " Cookie 's Fortune " , while a much slighter tale , is perhaps the better picture.<br /><br />Note : Altman claims that this is his first thriller , but he directed " Images " , an art house thriller , in 1972.<br /><br />Worth one viewing .
1 Robert Altman is my favorite American director . I must admit that I have enjoyed the films that are usually scorned : " Quintet " , if only for giving me the pleasure of seeing a grown - up and beautiful Brigitte Fossey , who was unforgettable as the little girl in " Forbidden Games " ; " HealtH " , for having Lauren Bacall , Carol Burnett , Alfre Woodard and Glenda Jackson , all in the same cast ; " Popeye " , for that splendid and surreal world , Shelley Duvall 's Olive Oyl and the wonderful Malta locations ; " O.C. & Stiggs " , for its proposal of an anti-"adolescents flick " ; " Beyond Therapy " , for all its lunacy and for the presence of Genèvieve Page , who for all her effort to look Parisian chic is taken for a travestite ... I have even enjoyed his one - act TV movies , like " The Dumb Waiter " and " The Laundromat " . When there is not much plot to develop in his films , you have wonderful performances , from Burnett , John Travolta , Kim Basinger or Jane Curtin . I perceive and enjoy the different approach and description he makes of the many different cultures of the United States . It is a pity that his genius is seldom appreciated , and that he is always forgotten when the time comes for giving out American prizes and awards . He is not your typical mainstream purveyor of fantasies . He is more of a maverick . So it is not surprising for me to find so many bad comments posted here about " The Gingerbread Man " , his most ' mainstream ' effort to date and to my knowledge . I did not know there were so many people who thought like Leonard Maltin , who does not like Altman at all . In this case , one may dislike " The Gingerbread Man " , but for me the reason has more to do with Grisham than with the director - screenwriter . Some of Altman 's trademarks are here : improvised dialogue , great performances , a funny lawyers ' office with typical irreverent receptionist and secretary . While some people find it boring , I found the first act fascinating , thanks also for the great cinematography by Changwei Gu , the man who shot " Red Sorghum " , " Ju Dou " and " Farewell My Concubine " . He has a way of showing us the same things we see in other American movies , but under a different light . Through his " foreigner 's gaze " , almost everything seems new and different . In this first act , things were so logical and true ! Wait until you get older . You may get in trouble if you fall under the spell of someone younger and beautiful as Embeth Davidtz . I know for myself what I have done fascinated by someone who is younger than I am ! Then you have Robert Duvall 's repellent , menacing and mysterious character , while that Geraldo storm is threatening Savannah . The second act gets a little phony and even funny , because Altman may have conducted it with a grin . I remember laughing aloud in several instances with his ironic remarks . I think he was applying a bit of Brecht , distancing us , preparing us for the third act , which is plain Hollywood pastiche . Altman does it with expertise . Being a wise man , and an intelligent director , luckily he did not fall into the traps of today 's action movies . He was directing a tale of lust , greed and death . I was not disappointed a bit with the movie . If I give it a nine instead of 10 , it is because of Grisham . The American reader has turned him into a best - selling author . So why complain ? Maybe we should thank Altman for showing us the seams in his stories , the dullness , the flatness and the silliness of them all . However , he does it with so much gusto and humor , that I can not but disagree with the negative comments . For me , these persons saw another movie ... And vice versa .
1 Any screen adaptation of a John Grisham story deserves a mainstream Hollywood approach , and Robert Altman is about the last director I would go to for a mainstream take on anything . But this southern - fried pot - boiler is pretty good . While it 's not among Altman 's best , it certainly is n't among the films he 's made that leave you scratching your head and wondering what he was thinking.<br /><br />Altman had tipped his hat to the mystery thriller with noir overtones before , in his 1973 film " The Long Goodbye . " " The Gingerbread Man " is nowhere near as good as that film , but it holds up fairly well on its own . Kenneth Branagh is a cocky attorney who finds himself framed for murder after he gets involved with a client ( Embeth Davidtz ) who has enlisted his help in protecting her from her cuckoo father ( Robert Duvall ) . The film is set in Savannah , Georgia during the approach of a tropical storm , which lends the film an oppressive atmosphere that I very much liked . The twists and turns toward the film 's end become clunkier and clunkier , and Altman proves himself to be not all that adept at staging shootouts , but overall the film is not a bad addition to Altman 's canon.<br /><br />Also starring Robert Downey , Jr. , Daryl Hannah , Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen.<br /><br />Grade : B
1 A lawyer is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse when he becomes involved with a femme fatale in this adaptation of a Grisham novel . Altman creates a suspenseful , Gothic atmosphere but the script is weak . Sporting a Southern drawl , Branagh is convincing as the lawyer , and Davidtz is alluring as the object of his desire . Downey is likable as a private detective . Duvall has a small role , which does not allow him to do much with his weird character . Hannah and Berenger round out the impressive cast . After an interesting setup , the film bogs down and does not really deliver on its initial promise , but Altman is always worth a look .
1 I found myself at sixes and sevens while watching this one . Altman 's touch with zooms in and out were there , and I expected those devices to comment on characters and situations . Unfortunately , as far as I could see , they sometimes were gratuitous , sometimes witty , often barren for failing to point out some ironic or other connection . In particular , two zoom - outs from the gilt dome in savannah merely perplexed . To be fair , though , a few zooms ( outs and ins ) to Branagh heightened his character 's increasing bewilderment , a la Pudgy McCabe 's or Philip Marlow 's . On the whole , the zooms were , well , inconsistent , and sometimes even trite.<br /><br />Other Almanesque devices , such as multiple panes of glass between camera and subject , succeeded in suggesting characters ' sollipsism or narcissism or opaque states of knowledge . Car windshields , house windows , and other screens were used effectively and fairly consistently , I felt , harking back to THE PLAYER and even THE LONG GOODBYE . A few catchy jump - cuts , especially to a suggestive tv commercial , reminded me of such usage in SHORT CUTS , to sardonic effect.<br /><br />But finally , the mismatch between Altman 's very personal style and the sheer weight of the Grisham - genre momentum , failed to excite me . This director 's 1970s masterpieces revised and deconstructed various classic genres , including the chandler detective film which this resembled in some ways ; this time around , the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic quiver to strike any meaningful blow to the soft underbelly of this beastly genre . Was he muzzled in by mammonist producers , perhaps ? Or am I missing something , due to my feeble knowledge of the genre he takes on here?<br /><br />Nonetheless , the casting was excellent all around : Tom Berenger ( for his terrifying ferality ) , Branagh for his ( deflated ) hubris , Robert Downey Jr 's pheromonal haze , Robert Duvall 's method of trash , and Davidtz 's lurking femme - fatality were near perfect choices all . And except for a few slips out of Georgia into Chicago on the part of ( brunette ? ) Daryl Hannah , accents were convincingly southern.<br /><br />Suspense and mood were engrossing , even if the story did n't quite rivet viewers . The moodiness of a coastal pre - hurricane barometric plunge was exquisitely , painstakingly rendered -- I felt like yelling at the usher to turn on the swamp cooler pronto.<br /><br />Torn , in the end I judged it a 7.<br /><br / >
1 The biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of Daryl Hannah . Rather than playing the stereotypical ditzy blonde roles that she usually does she plays a street - smart , intelligent , world - weary character . She does n't have a huge role but she does a great job portraying Lois Harlan as a woman tired of , although used to , covering up for her boss ' indiscretions .
1 I do n't understand the low 5.7 rating on this film . It 's a delight for people who like a strong suspense plot and dark atmospherics . The tone is reminiscent of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil , down to the locale ( Savannah ) . The acting is strong , and I was amazed at the verisimilitude of Kenneth Branagh 's southern accent . Famke Jansen is great , Robert Duval is effective in a small part , and Embeth Davitz is the BOMB . Great full nude scene of her , too.<br /><br />The plot is fairly standard but effectively executed .
1 Generally , it 's difficult to rate these cut-&-paste films . Some of the segments can be quite good while others bring down the rating of the overall product . In this one , for instance , the all - girl scene in the Doctor 's office was quite exciting ... one of the best in this viewer 's ( limited ) viewing history . Then there 's Asia 's segment ... the lady is always entertaining . And the story that binds the whole together was an interesting concept . The swap scene that closes out the offering ai n't bad either . Technically , the production values are fairly high . Recommended .
1 Ok , so it 's an adult movie . But it really is very tastefully done . It 's obvious that the producers spent a lot of time and money into making a classy sort of movie . I was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was . Even the acting was fairly decent . The plot was more solid than most adult films I 've seen . The camera work was above average . It 's just a good flick ! !
1 Although Cameron Grant was clearly hired to replace Andrew Blake over at Ultimate Pictures when the latter started his own company ( Studio A ) , he practically outdid the " Master " right out of the gate when it came to setting up steamy sex scenes . So , while all the window dressing Blake had pioneered ( starlets in fetish lingerie and sun glasses , coiffed and made up as if they 're about to hit the catwalk ) remained very much present and accounted for , Grant added his own personal spin to the carnal content . In doing so , he raised the heat to a level that had eluded Big A ever since his first  and IMHO best  film NIGHT TRIPS . Cam 's maiden effort , ELEMENTS OF DESIRE , might still have been handicapped by an overly slavish adherence to the Blake aesthetic ( with a surfeit of girl on girl gropes ) , but his subsequent DINNER PARTY already shows him at the top of his form in what must surely rank as his masterpiece.<br /><br />The title spells out the premise as a group of well to do friends and acquaintances gather over dinner to swap sexy stories , with an extended orgy at the conclusion . Scrumptious Juli Ashton and Tammy Parks smear food stuff all over each other 's flawless physiques in their kitchen sequence that is sure to delight those with a taste towards combining pleasures of the palette with those of the flesh . Busty Crystal Gold ( here : " Catalina " ) was rarely more than a reliable second - stringer , adding spice to several Ona Zee bargain basement noirs , yet looks absolutely stunning here in a romantic four poster frolic with Fabio lookalike Vince Voyeur . Beautiful blondes Kylie Ireland and Yvonne , making out with Marc Davis ( for the record , the latter two were an item at the time ) under a waterfall , complete the eye candy section of the movie.<br /><br />Time to get cooking ! Early Jenna Jameson ( " Daisy " back then ) foreshadows the greatness to come as she drains Frank Towers ( " Mark Slade " on his subsequent shift to the gay side of the industry ) of all vital juices , albeit with a little help from brunette Diva for effective contrast , the scene 's stylish industrial setting providing an atmospheric backdrop to the full tilt sex taking place . Impossibly hunky construction worker Gerry Pike seeks to cool off on a sweltering summer day by hosing down , a prospect too tantalizing for prim ' n ' proper business woman Asia Carrera ( at her all time most achingly pretty ) to pass up . Best of show must be the imaginative sequence that has nasty Norma Jeane and handsome Sean Michaels teasing the pants off each other  for starters !  while separated by a glass partition right until the predictably splashy conclusion.<br /><br />With sex that proves either artsy or hot , and more often than not both , Grant has concocted a veritable smörgåsbord of fleshy wares to continue the film 's gastronomic analogy the title implies . Couples may be the prime intended audience , but an alternation between naughty ' n ' nice should rightfully include that " something for everything " recipe so many adult features are aiming for . Acting as his own DoP , the director shows great eye for detail , like the shot of Asia Carrera 's pristine white shoes being spattered with mud , enriching his vision . This marks him out as a great filmmaker rather than a merely serviceable one , as was the case with Nick Steele who stepped up to take his place at Ultimate  effectively making him a replacement 's replacement ?  when he packed up for greener pastures .
1 The Dinner Party could quite possibly be in my opinion the greatest adult cinema production of all time . It is produced in such an exquisite manner and the actors portray their roles excellently . The kitchen scene starring Yvonne and Juli Ashton is magnificent . The use of the butter and milk really makes the scene . Additionally , the doctor 's office scene is well done . The campfire scene is filled with enjoyable action , though the choice of actors in this scene is questionable . Asia Carrera 's performance in the junkyard scene is incredible , but who would expect anything less from her . The closing scene is somewhat over used in adult films , but is classic none the less . I would highly recommend this film to all fans of adult films and those casual viewers . Run out to your video store and pick it up today .
1 Cameron Grant is one of the best directors doing adult films . His only rival is Andrew Blake . Celeste is dynamite all thru the movie but the DR 's office sequence with her & two other ladies is just incredible . Nearly as good is Asia Carrera 's performance with the construction worker . I highly recommend this movie & gave it a 9 . It 's almost as good as Cameron Grant 's ELEMENTS OF DESIRE which I gave a 10 .
1 " Who Loves The Sun " works its way through some prickly subject matter with enough wit and grace to keep the story not only engaging , but often hilarious . It 's been a while since I 've found such a thoroughly touching , thoroughly enjoyable film . < br /><br />The film is gorgeous , drawing the eye with beautiful scenery and tranquil landscapes . The peaceful imagery contrasts wonderfully with the tension between the very human , very flawed , and yet very likable characters . Due to the excellent cast all five of the major players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic . < br /><br />I recommend " Who Loves The Sun . " It 's a really funny movie that takes a poignant look at the hurts that we can inflict on each other , and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness .
1 I had no idea what this movie was until I read about it in the L.A. Weekly . I generally agree with the reviews in the LA Weekly and decided to get a ticket for this film . the film stars molly parker ( from my favorite television show Deadwood ) and Lukas haas -- who I suspect we will be seeing more of in the very near future . The film is funny , heartwarming , features great acting , and beautiful photography . i do n't know if the film has distribution , but I hope it does - or will - soon . this is destined to be a real indie gem . it even has music by my favorite band the silver jews ! the only disappointment was that molly parker was n't there at the screening . even without her there ... this was hands down the best film i saw at the festival .
1 I caught this movie on the Sundance Channel on cable one late afternoon . You might say " Who Loves the Sun " is a perfect leisurely pastime of a story , why ever not . You get to hang out with the trio : Lukas Haas is Will ( returning after abruptly leaving everyone years ago ) , Molly Parker is Maggie ( we learn she 's very much part of the family Bloom ) , and Adam Scott is Daniel ( is he friend or foe or fiancé ) , by the scenic Falcon Lake , Manitoba , Canada , captured in graphic compositions juxtaposed in vivid summer colors against sunshine and shadows . And supporting the trio are two more family members in the revealing mix : Wendy Crewson is Mom Mary Bloom , and R.H. Thomson is Dad Arthur Bloom . Writer - director Matt Bissonnette has delivered an ingenious unfolding of story - line and its various tentacle links - worry not , Haas may have a ' listless ' face , but humor will come as Parker and Scott enter the circle of friends reunited , wry smiles will break and knowing delights stir . Dialogs may be terse or even nil , yet we 'd get the flavor of what 's cooking , bemused or wondering.<br /><br />Yes , " Who Loves the Sun " can very well be categorized as a sleeper gem . The chemistry between all five principals sure gels and ' combusts ' , giving an energetic ensemble performance . After all , it 's all in the family , and the film sure does n't take itself too seriously.<br /><br />Looks like the official site is still available at " wholovesthesun.com " and there are information on the soundtrack by Mac McCaughan ( Portastatic with guitar tunes and strings ) where score excerpts are being played , and behind the scenes production notes , interview with writer - director - producer Bissonnette on how the movie and concept came about , the casting and more . Have always appreciate Molly Parker since her spare yet mesmerizing performance in 1996 Lynne Stopkewich 's ' Kissed ' , and she 's married to Bissonnette , who " wrote the Maggie part for Molly . "
1 Although I live in Minnesota , I have been studying in France lately and came across this bizarre gem of a film.<br /><br />This movie was amazing , to say the least . A creative and unique film , the different directors each lent something different to their interpretation of love in the City of Light . The first instinct is to attempt to fit each one of these little stories into an overall storyline , much as can be done with 2003 's Love Actually . This attempt , however , renders the magic of each individual segment obsolete . When taken at face value , with each of the short segments taken as its own individual film , the love stories together tell a beautiful message.<br /><br />The film is strikingly bizarre at times -- often to the point of confusion -- and each individual segment can be hard to follow . Still , to a watcher who pays close attention to each of the segments , the short plot lines become clear after a short time . The confusion is almost intriguing ; it keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next . It leaves the viewer wondering " Did that really just happen ? " yet also leaves them satisfied that it did , indeed , occur . It 's the kind of movie where the viewer , upon leaving the theater , ca n't actually decide whether they loved it or they hated it . The initial reaction is to go and watch it again and again , just to see these individual lives blend together into a cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />The interesting decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate . It adds to the reality of the film -- here , the American tourists speak English , the Parisians French , and so on . The number of people that the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of love.<br /><br />From sickness to the supernatural , the love of parents to the love of husbands , this film covers all the bases of romantic storytelling . In its beautiful and quirky way , each unique event somehow falls into place to tell a story : that of all types , sizes , nationalities , and shapes of love .
1 I was lucky enough to attend a screening in Stockholm for this elegantly expressed , enjoyable , and thought - provoking film . With romance as the heaviest weapon in its arsenal , Paris je t'aime boldly plunges into love in Paris , navigating the different forms in eighteen separate " quartiers " but without pouting Parisiennes and saccharine formulas . Its goldmine undoubtedly stems from frustration on the directors ' parts  frustration over only having 5 - 10 minutes of screen time  thereby you are only presented with the best and most assured direction from each party.<br /><br />Debating whether or not I should review all 18 segments , I reached the conclusion that it would be merely redundant and long - winded . Instead simply rest assured that each director graces the film with their eccentric styles and skills , and certainly you 'll find your favourite . Although Gus Van Sant can not resist the temptation to be introspective , his LES MARAIS is one of the better contributions , even sneaking in a well - placed Kurt Cobain reference . The Coen brothers recreate one of the more accessible segments in Paris , a scene with a muted but emotionally transparent Steve Buscemi , deadpan humour and clever camera angles that surely generated the most laughter in my theatre , and perhaps rightly so . < br /><br />In this way , all story lines are exquisitely unique  filtered through the minds of different directors  but the one that deviates the most from the rest is Vincenzo Natali 's QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE , a dark horror - Gothic love starring Elijah Wood as a lost tourist in the backstreets of Paris in the night who meets a vampiress . With a black - and - white format but blood - red colour contrast that seems to incongruously bleed off screen , it nearly becomes a pastiche of Sin City  a refreshing eerie and visual turn in an otherwise fairly grounded film . < br /><br />Yet my single favourite segment was FAUBOURG SAINT - DENIS by Tom Tykwer but I think I was conditioned to think so , given that I went in the theatre with him as my favourite and nudged my friend in the side saying " finally , that 's my favourite director here " . Nevertheless , it can not be denied that Tykwer delivers a lovely segment in which a blind boy picks up the phone , and hears from his girlfriend ( Portman - for once not annoying ) that she breaks up with him , and he reflects on their relationship . As is Tywker 's style , the story is dizzyingly fast - paced , kinetic and repetitive , featuring screaming and running ( Lola Rennt ) making it the most adrenaline - pumping segment in Paris je t'aime and possibly also the most touching once Tywker starts wielding his most powerful tool  music.<br /><br />To fill the negative account , clearly not all directors manage as touching as Tywker , Van Sant , Cohens , Coixet and Dépardieu . Sylvain Chomet scrapes the bottom of the pile by carving out a truly disposable segment in which a little boy retells the story of how his parents met . They are two lonely mimes . This part is so in - your - face French and desperately quirky that it is insulting to international viewers . Suwa also directs a poor and fluffy segment with an unusually haggard - looking Juliette Binoche whom mourns the loss of her son . Nothing else happens . Finally , the wrap - up and interweaving of the 18 stories in the end feels somewhat rushed and half - hearted.<br /><br />Yet Paris je t'aime truly spoils you with quality , for all the other stories are well - crafted with crisp acting and amusing writing . It is certainly one of the highlights of 2006 ( not saying much , I suppose ) and a very personal film in the sense that it is unavoidable to pick a favourite and a least favourite . Highly recommended both to mainstream of " pretentious " ( heh ) audiences.<br /><br />8 out 10
1 Was n't sure what to expect from this movie considering its amazing collection of stars and directors but in the end it did n't disappoint.<br /><br />For me one of the highlights was the final episode with the American tourist speaking with a dreadful French accent ( which made me feel better about mine ) which was actually quite touching and a great way to wrap up the movie.<br /><br />The story of the paramedic and the stabbing victim was also very moving and for pure comedy the Coen Brothers and Steve Buscemi take the award . The Tom Tykwer clip was also impressive although rather ambitious in its scope.<br /><br />However , the Bob Hoskins segment was totally cringeworthy and the vampire story was completely farcical . The dialogue in Wes Craven 's section also felt very forced and the Chinatown story was completely incomprehensible.<br /><br />On the whole this film is worth watching for the good bits and has a strong finish . It 's not too painful to sit through the bad sections - they only last 5 minutes anyway.<br /><br />Ca vaut la peine ! ! !
1 It 's not easy making a movie with 18 different stories in it . Although 18 different international directors took the challenge , not everyone of them is good , some of them even boring . But in his entity , " Paris , je t'aime " is breathtaking , showing that , as " Love Actually " put it , ' love is all around ' , especially in the city of love . Here 's a resumé ( I 'll try to make at as spoiler - free as possible ) of the 18 different stories.<br /><br />MONTMARTRE - kind of a dull opening sequence , nothing really special about it . A man finds a parking spot , and sees a lot of odd couples walking by , wondering why he ca n't find a girl . And than , suddenly , a woman faints next to his car ... <br /><br />QUAIS DE SEINE - another dull sequence , about three teenage boys who are searching for some ' piece of ass ' , when suddenly a Muslim girl trips right in front of them , receiving help from one of the boys . Really basic , but with a sweet heart to it.<br /><br />LES MARAIS - this was a huge disappointment ! Although a love story between two boys with an artsy background could have been interesting by the great Van Sant . Eventually , everything that comes AFTER the monologue by Ulliel is good , everything before it is just annoying.<br /><br />TUILERIES - an entertaining sequence by the Coen brothers . Buscemi - without even saying one word - is mesmerizing and the whole sequence is just hilarious . This one kept me hooked until the very end , and this one also gets you truly hooked to the movie.<br /><br />LOIN DU 16IEME - a beautiful story too , even if the execution is poor , the heart is there . It 's the story of an Hispanic woman who drops her child off , early in the morning , to take care of another suburban baby . Beautiful.<br /><br />PORTE DE CHOISY - this segment has got to be the strangest and weirdest from the whole movie . Some kind of shampoo salesman arrives in a Chinatown - lookalike place in Paris . If I understood it correctly , the story is about inner beauty , but I think I 'm wrong.<br /><br />BASTILLE - a truly wonderful sequence . A man meets with his wife at a restaurant , to break up with her , so that he can run off with his mistress . But the wife has some devastating news . Pretty basic , but truly sad and beautiful ! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - a sad sequence as well . Juliette Binoche plays a grieving mother . One night , she wakes up hearing her dead child . When she arrives at the location , a cowboy tells her she can give one last good - bye to her child . One of the best segments ! TOUR EIFFEL - two mimes who fall in love could have been great , but , even though it has some nice cinematic tricks , the story is n't intriguing and not funny at all.<br /><br />PARC MONCEAU - a truly original and great sequence , one of the best of the movie ! A young girl and an older man discuss their future and her fear for a certain man ... Cuaron does a great directing job , and the actors are amazing ! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - an American actress ( Gyllenhaal ) falls in love with her drug dealer . a beautiful segment again , with a very sad ending PLACE DES FETES - a woman comes to a homeless man , he starts talking romantic to her ... because she is the love of his life . Beautiful , sad , shocking , romantic , ... Place des Fêtes will make everyone cry.<br /><br />PIGALLE - a boring sequence between Ardant and Hoskins , who are looking for new thrills in their relationship ... very unfunny and unromantic , Pigalle is a let - down.<br /><br />QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE - bringing some diversity in the movie , QdlM is a relief . A young guy ( Wood ) finds a vampire killing a victim ... The tourist and the vampire ... fall in love ! Dark , scary and oddly romantic , Madeleine is superb.<br /><br />PERE - LACHAISE - another let - down segment . Directed by Wes Craven and with stars as Mortimer and Sewell , it could have been great , but Père - Lachaise is just ordinary , not original at all.<br /><br />FAUBOURG SAINT - DENIS - the rumors are TRUE , Twyker 's short film is beautiful , stunning and well done . A blind man picks up the phone , and hears from his girlfriend ( Portman - truly stunning ) that she breaks up with him . He reflects on their relationship.<br /><br />QUARTIER Latin - even though this segment has been co - directed by Depardieu and has such stars as Rowlands , Gazzara and Depardieu , this segment is a let - down too . Nothing happens , lack of chemistry between the actors.<br /><br />14TH ARRONDISSEMENT - the last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time . An American tells in her French class about her trip to Paris . Her French is truly terrible , but at the end of the segment , she realizes that Paris is so much more than meets the eye.<br /><br />With Feist on the background , " Paris , je t'aime " ends in a sweet tone , not letting me down at all , even though some segments bored the hell out of me , the entity of the movie is great ! A true cinematic experience for young and old . Paris , je t'aime vraiment !
1 I watched this movie a couple of days ago in a small independent cinema in Paris . It was my last evening in the French capital and the best good - bye I could have chosen . These twenty episodes made me relive the impressions I had collected in Paris in a heart - warming manner without drifting off into kitsch or sentimental schmaltz . Each episode is full of surprise , strong emotions and suggestive pictures and each short - film is directed according to the rules of a good short story . To me this kind of movie demands a lot more talent and qualities of a director and a story board writer than any epic two hours drama and all of them succeeded in their task excellently ! The stories were chosen carefully with regard to their matching Arrondissement and express the respective flair perfectly . Each episode was seen from a different ankle , had a different topic , a different style and still the twenty stories result in a harmonic orchestra of films . The most outstanding advantage with the concept of an episode movie in my opinion is based in the fact that you can switch in between a large variety of feelings and moods without the danger of overload , just the other way round : the melange of sadness , melancholy , pure joy , despair , wrath , anxiety , curiosity or passion gives this movie a unique freshness and harmony . And not to forget the all over topic of love ! Love between the characters , love between the characters and Paris and also the love of the directors and actors / actresses for this project . I do n't want to go into the details of the episodes since there are so many , but I must highlight the range of world famous actors and actresses from all over the world and their approach to this project . Some played with their image , some broke it completely and some interpreted the stereotypes connected with their home country or the roles they had played before , so intertextuality was given all through the movie . All in all I can absolutely recommend this great collage and will be looking forward to its release on DVD .
1 The whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts . No problem . This film features a line - up of some of the most diversely creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast . The segments are devised around the same theme , " Love in Paris " , but the resemblance ends there . Actually , considering that the approach to the theme from all these different directors takes so many forms , it is amazing that we can even feel we are still watching the same film . No great effort has been made to turn it into a comprehensive whole . This buffet has so many great ingredients , I am glad nobody tried to put them all in a single dish .
1 Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God gave to all people the ability to love the whole world , but given that a human heart is very small in size , every human has that special place that he loves more than any other . It seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent directors of today when they set out to profess the eternal love for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its denizens and visitors . The result is a wonderful collection of short films , Paris je t'aime , in which our guides , Van Sant , Coixet , Cuaron , Payne and others take us on a breathtaking stroll through Parisian arrondissements , human feelings , yearnings and expectations.<br /><br />Always some other quarter , always some utterly moving story about ordinary people in search for love , be it in a parking lot , art studio , tube station . And Paris je t'aime is about vast array of loves- love for one 's partner , child , parent , for those who meant the world to us but are no longer around , love that needs rekindling , serendipitous love for that stranger as your eyes meet , or love that just is not meant to be ... today , but tomorrow- who knows?<br /><br />Nevertheless , this film is not solely about love , but life itself , joy , pain , loneliness , confusion , everyday ups and downs . And its most important quality is the fact that it is not soppy at all , but rather warm and full of hope.<br /><br />I give this film a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might further develop , but not all of them and that is the thing that I find missing , and by " further development " I do not mean some specific reference to the characters ' future . As far as everything else is concerned I can only say- captivating . Makes you want to leave everything behind you , flee to Paris and live those little romances yourself .
1 Just saw this tonight at a seminar on digital projection ( shot on 35 mm , and first feature film fully scanned in 6k mastered in 4k , and projected with 2k projector at ETC / USC theater in Hwd) .. so much for tech stuff . 18 directors ( including Alexander Payne , Wes Cravens , Joel and Ethan Coen , Gus Van Sant , Walter Salles and Gerard Depardieu , among several good French/ international directors ) were each given 5 minutes to make a love story . They come in all shapes and forms , with known actors(Elijah Wood , Natalie Portman , Steve Buscemi .. totally hilarious ... , Maggie Glyllenhall , Nick Nolte , Geena Rowlands .. soo good .. and she actually wrote the piece she was in , Msr Depardieu and many good international actors as well . The stories vary from all out romance to quirky comedy to Alex Payne 's touching study of a woman discovering herself to Van Sant and one of those things that happens anywhere .. maybe ? Nothing really off putting by having French spoken in most sequences ( with English subtitles ) and a small amount of actual English spoken , though that will probably relegate it to art houses ( a la Diva . ) Also only one piece that might be considered " experimental " but colorful and funny as well , the rest simple studies of sometimes complex relationships . All easy to follow ( unless the " experimental " one irritates your desire for a formulaic story . Several brought up some emotions for me ... I admit I am affected by love in cinema ... when it is presented in something other than sentimentality . I even laughed at a mime piece , like no other I have seen ( thank you for that ! ) The film hit its peak , for me , somewhere around a little more than half way through , then the last two sequences picked up again . Some beautiful shots of Paris at night , lush romantic kind of music , usually used to good effect , not just schmaltz for " emotions " in sound , generally good cinematography , though some shots seemed soft focus when it could n't have meant to have been ( main character in shot / scene ) . Pacing of each film was good , and overall structure , though a bit long ( they left out two of what was to be 20 films , but said all would be on the DVD ) seemed to vary between tones of the films to keep a good balance . Not sure when it comes out , but a good study of how to make a 5 min film work .. and sometimes , what does n't work ( if it covers too much time , emotionally , for a short film . ) Should be in region one when released , but they did n't know when .
1 Delightful film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today . The film is also casting some of the great actors of our time , not just from France but from everywhere.<br /><br />My favorite segments:<br /><br />14th arrondissement : Carol ( Margo Martindale ) , from Denver , comes to Paris to learn French and also to make a sense of her life.<br /><br />Montmartre : there was probably not a better way to start this movie than with this segment on romantic Paris.<br /><br />Loin du 16ème : an image of Paris that we are better aware of since the riots in the Cités . Ana ( Catalina Sandino Moreno ) spends more time taking care of somebody else 's kid ( she 's a nanny ) than of her own.<br /><br />Quartier Latin : so much fun to see Gérard Depardieu as the " tenancier de bar " with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing their divorce.<br /><br />Tour Eiffel : do n't tell me you did n't like those mimes!<br /><br />Tuileries : such a treat to see Steve Buscemi as the tourist who 's making high - contact ( a no- no ) with a girl in the Metro.<br /><br />Parc Monceau : Nick Nolte is great . Ludivine Sagnier also.<br /><br />I've spend 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to go back!<br /><br />Seen in Barcelona ( another great city ) , at the Verdi , on March 18th , 2007.<br /><br />84/100 ( * * * )
1 Greetings again from the darkness . 18 directors of 18 seemingly unrelated vignettes about love in the city of lights . A very unusual format that takes a couple of segments to adjust to as a viewer . We are so accustomed to character development over a 2 hour movie , it is a bit disarming for that to occur in an 8 minute segment.<br /><br />The idea is 18 love / relationship stories in 18 different neighborhoods of this magnificent city . Of course , some stand up better than others and some go for comedy , while others focus on dramatic emotion . Some very known directors are involved , including : The Coen Brothers , Wes Craven , Alfonso Cuaron , Alexander Payne , Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha . Many familiar faces make appearances as well : Steve Buscemi , Barbet Schroeder , Catalina Sandino Moreno , Ben Gazzara , Gena Rowlands , Gerard Depardieu , Juliette Binoche , Willem Dafoe , Nick Nolte , Maggie Gyllenhaal and Bob Hoskins.<br /><br />One of the best segments involves a mime , and then another mime and the nerdy , yet happy young son of the two mimes . Also playing key roles are a red trench coat , cancer , divorce , sexual fantasy , the death of a child and many other topics . Do n't miss Alexander Payne ( director of " Sideways " ) as Oscar Wilde.<br /><br />The diversity of the segments make this interesting to watch , but as a film , it can not be termed great . Still it is very watchable and a nice change of pace for the frequent movie goer .
1 Diane and I saw this fabulous film today in Fremantle and we both agreed that of the pastiche movies it was head and shoulders above the rest . I say that because we were entranced by the brief , five to ten minute segments that composed the film and the fact that this film had a theme around which each piece was composed and of course that theme was love in its many forms.<br /><br />Ostensibly the film took place in the various Parisian arrondisments thus giving a particular flavour to each segment . Having only been in Paris several times , I was not knowledgeable enough to readily recognize the locations but I am sure Europeans and particularly French people could easily recognize the city 's locations . In any event , the viewer is immediately pulled into each story because of their production excellence so these city locations fade into in - consequence.<br /><br />The film moves quickly and the viewer is left absorbing one scenario while the new one is on the screen . The stories themselves are not graphic like some pulp Hollywood nonsense , they are subtle and thought provoking and gentle as with most of life without the media swath that buries so much of life 's beauty under the nearest dung heap just to sell , sell . sell ... < br /><br />Go with someone you care for and allow this magical little film to bathe you like a spa treatment and when you leave my guess is you will feel renewed .
1 It 's just such a joy to have watched this intriguing project . So refreshing and educating . Not only to a filmmaker , who can learn what can be achieved in 5 minutes of screen time , but also as audience , who may not be so ready for so much love in such short time.<br /><br />20 short films about love in Paris are all unique , but some of them , as expected , stand out . I thought the Tom Tykwer ( Natalie Portman ) segment was the best , although the mimes made me smile inside just the same.<br /><br />I clicked on " spoilers " option for this review bus alas ... what you read is a spoiler enough . Just watch it . Do n't read what I write , but watch the movie instead.<br /><br />And smile .
1 ... for Paris is a moveable feast . " Ernest Hemingway < br /><br />It is impossible to count how many great talents have immortalized Paris in paintings , novels , songs , poems , short but unforgettable quotes , and yes - movies . The celebrated film director Max Ophüls said about Paris , < br /><br />"It offered the shining wet boulevards under the street lights , breakfast in Montmartre with cognac in your glass , coffee and lukewarm brioche , gigolos and prostitutes at night . Everyone in the world has two fatherlands : his own and Paris . " < br /><br />Paris is always associated with love and romance , and " Paris , Je T'Aime " which is subtitled " Petite romances , " is a collection of short films , often sketches from 18 talented directors from all over the world . In each , we become familiar with one of the City of Light 20 arrondissements and with the Parisians of all ages , genders , colors , and backgrounds who all deal in love in its many variations and stages . In some of the " petite romances " we are the witnesses of the unexpected encounters of the strangers that lead to instant interest , closeness , and perhaps relationship : like for Podalydès and Florence Muller in the street of Montmartre in the opening film or for Cyril Descours and Leïla Bekhti as a white boy and a Muslim girl whose cross - cultural romance directed by Gurinder Chadha begins on Quais de Seine . I would include into this category the humorous short film by Gus Van Sant . In " Le Marais " one boy pours his heart out to another boy confessing of sudden unexpected closeness , asking permission to call - never realizing that the object of his interest does not understand French.<br /><br />Some of the vignettes are poignant and even dark . In Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas ' Loin du 16ème , Catalina Sandino Mareno ( amazing Oscar nominated debut for Maria full of Grace ) is single , working - class mother who has to work as a nanny in a wealthy neighborhood to pay for daycare where she drops her baby every morning before she goes to work . One of most memorable and truly heartbreaking films is " Place des Fêtes " by Oliver Schmitz . Aïssa Maïga and Seydou Boro co - star as two young people for who love could have happened . There were the promises of it but it was cut short due to hatred and intolerance that are present everywhere , and the City of Love and Light is no exception . Another one that really got to me was " Bastille " , written and directed by Isabel Coixet , starring Sergio Castellitto , Miranda Richardson , and Leonor Watling . Castellitto has fallen out of love with his wife , Richardson but when he is ready to leave with the beautiful mistress , the devastating news from his wife 's doctor arrives ... <br /><br />I can go on reflecting on all 18 small gems . I like some of them very much . The others felt weak and perhaps will be forgotten soon but overall , I am very glad that I bought the DVD and I know that I will return to my favorite films again and again . They are " Place des Fêtes " that I 've mentioned already , " Père - Lachaise " directed by Wes Craven that involves the ghost of one of the wittiest and cleverest men ever , Oscar Wilde ( Alexander Payne , the director of " Sideways " ) who would save one troubled relationship . Payne also directed " 14th Arrondissement " in which a lonely middle - aged post - worker from Denver , CO explores the city on her own providing the voice over in French with the heavy accent . Payne 's entry is one of the most moving and along with hilarious " Tuileries " by Joel and Ethan Coen with ( who else ? :)) Steve Buschemi is my absolute favorite . In both shorts , American tourists sit on the benches ( Margo in the park , and Steve in Paris Metro after visiting Louvers ) observing the life around them with the different results . While Margo may say , " My feeling 's sad and light ; my sorrow is bright ... " Steve 's character will find out that sometimes , even the most comprehensive and useful tourist guide would not help a tourist avoiding doing the wrong things in a foreign country .
1 18 directors had the same task : tell stories of love set in Paris . Naturally , some of them turned out better than others , but the whole mosaic is pretty charming - besides , would n't it be boring if all of them had the same vision of love ? Here 's how I rank the segments ( that might change on a second viewing):<br /><br />1 . " Quartier Latin " , by Gérard Depardieu < br /><br />One of the greatest French actors ever directed my favourite segment , featuring the always stunning Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara . Witty and delightful.<br /><br />2 . " Tour Eiffel " , by Sylvain Chomet < br /><br />Cute , visually stunning ( thanks to the director of " The Triplets of Belleville " ) story of a little boy whose parents are mimes;<br /><br />3 . " Tuileries " , by Ethan and Joel Coen < br /><br />The Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Hilarious < br /><br />4 . " Parc Monceau " , by Alfonso Cuarón ( " Y Tu Mamá También " , " Children of Men " ) , feat . Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier ( funny);<br /><br />5 . " Place des Fêtes " , by Oliver Schmitz , feat . Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga ( touching);<br /><br />6 . " 14th Arrondissement " , Alexander Payne 's ( " Election " , " About Schmidt " ) wonderful look for the pathetic side of life is present here , feat . the underrated character actress Margo Martindale ( Hilary Swank 's mother in " Million Dollar Baby " ) as a lonely , middle - aged American woman on vacation;<br /><br />7 . " Faubourg Saint - Denis " , Tom Tykwer 's ( " Run Lola Run " ) frantic style works in the story of a young actress ( Natalie Portman ) and a blind guy ( Melchior Beslon ) who fall in love;<br /><br />8 . " Père - Lachaise " , by Wes Craven , feat . Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell ( plus a curious cameo by Alexander Payne as ... Oscar Wilde!);<br /><br />9 . " Loin du 16ème " , by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas ( simple but moving story from the talented Brazilian directors , feat . Catalina Sandino Moreno);<br /><br />10 . " Quartier des Enfants Rouges " , by Olivier Assayas ( " Clean " ) , a sad story feat . the always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal;<br /><br />11 . " Le Marais " , by Gus Van Sant , feat . Gaspard Ulliel , Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful ( simple , but funny);<br /><br />12 . " Quartier de la Madeleine " , by Vincenzo Natali , feat . Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko;<br /><br />13 . " Quais de Seine " , by Gurinder Chadha;<br /><br />14 . " Place des Victoires " , by Nobuhiro Suwa , feat . Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe;<br /><br />15 . " Bastille " , by Isabel Coixet ( fabulous director of the underrated " My Life Without Me " ) , feat . Miranda Richardson , Sergio Castellitto , Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling;<br /><br />16 . " Pigalle " , by Richard LaGravenese , feat . Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant;<br /><br />17 . " Montmartre " , by and with Bruno Podalydès;<br /><br />18 . " Porte de Choisy " , by Christopher Doyle , with Barbet Schroeder ( mostly known as the director of " Barfly " , " Reversal of Fortune " and " Single White Female").<br /><br />I could classify some segments as brilliant and others as average ( or even slightly boring ) , but not a single of them is plain bad . On the whole , I give " Paris , Je t'Aime " an 8.5/10 and recommend it for what it is : a lovely mosaic about love and other things in between .
1 Oftentimes , films of this nature come across as a mixed bag of great work along with slight drivel to fill the runtime . Whether it be the big name support or the project itself , Paris je t'aime never falls into this realm . I believe I can truly say that the movie as a whole is better than its parts . Between the wonderful transitions and the fantastic ending sequence , merging characters together in one last view of love in Paris , I think the film would have suffered if any cog was removed . True , there are definitely a few standouts that overshadow the rest , but in the end I have a lasting image , even if just a split second of each short vignette . Love takes many forms , and the talent here rises to the occasion , to surprise and move the audience through shear poetry and elegance of the emotion 's many facets.<br /><br />Quartier des Enfants Rouges : Maggie Gyllenhaal surprises as a drug - addled actress shooting in Paris and meeting with her dealer . The reveal at its conclusion leaves you a bit off balance as the infatuation between the two changes hands.<br /><br />Quatier Latin : Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands ( recreating a relationship from an old Cassavettes film ? ) bring some great sharp wit and sarcasm as they meet to discuss their impending divorce . What of their conversation is true and what is just to anger the other , it is all enjoyable , leaving a smile on your face.<br /><br />Quais de Seine : Director Gurinder Chadha gives us a touching portrait of love existing beyond religious and racial differences . It is a sweet little story of shy love between two people obviously feeling a connection , but unable to quite vocalize it.<br /><br />Tour Eiffel : I will admit to being disappointed that Sylvain Chomet did not get an animated sequence together , however , this live action tale of mimes falling in love at a Paris jail has the same quirky nature as his film Les Triplettes de Belleville.<br /><br />Tuileries : The Coen Brothers stick to their strange sense of humor and deliver some fine laughs . Steve Buscemi really shines and sells the performance without speaking a word . His facial reactions to the verbal abuse of a disgruntled Frenchman are priceless.<br /><br />Bastille : Here is a heartbreaking portrait of a couple about out of love only to have it come back in the face of tragedy . Sergio Castellitto and Miranda Richardson a moving as the couple dealing with trouble and finding how strong the bond of true love is.<br /><br />Pére - Lachaise : A surprisingly funny little tale from horror master Wes Craven . A little Oscar Wilde humor can add levity to any relationship.<br /><br />Parc Monceau : Alfonso Cuarón looks to be practicing the amazing long - takes he perfects in Children of Men with this tale of two people in love , walking down the street . As Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier eventually come into close - up view , we also find the true context of their conversation of " forbidden love." < br /><br />Porte de Choisy : A very surreal look into the glamour of Paris . This is probably the most odd entry , but so intriguing that you ca n't look away from the craziness that ensues . Do not anger your Asian beautician , whatever you do.<br /><br />Pigalle : An interesting look at a relationship undergoing a role - play that seems to have been stagnant for years . A little variety from Bob Hoskins is necessary to fire kindled.<br /><br />Quartier de la Madeleine : Even vampires in Paris can find love amongst the feeding hours . I do n't know whether to be happy for Elijah Wood as a result or not . Beautifully shot and muted to allow the vibrancy of the blood red , this short is strange , but then so is love.<br /><br />14th arrondissement : Leave it to Alexander Payne 's odd sense of humor to really add some depth to this voice - over story told of an American in Paris to find what love is . Her harsh , uneducated French is a very stark contrast to the authentic accents we 've been listening to until this pointjust off - kilter enough to be both funny and totally true to the story.<br /><br />Montmartre : An interesting introduction into the proceedings . Paris can be a city reviled for everyday activities like finding a parking spot , yet when love is discovered , it will take its prisoner anywhere to continue the journey.<br /><br />Loin du 16éme : Catalina Sandino Moreno brilliantly shows what love for a child is through her subtle performance as the tale is bookended by her singing to a young child , yet totally different each time.<br /><br />Place des Fetes : My favorite tale of the bunch . Seydou Boro and Aïssa Maïga are simply fantastic . The cyclical nature of the story and how fate brings the two characters together twice in order for Boro to finally ask her for coffee is tough to watch . Sometimes love at your final moment is enough to accept one 's leaving of this earth.<br /><br />Place des Victoires : One of the best stories about a mother trying to cope with the death of her young son . Juliette Binoche is devastating as the mother , desperate for one last glimpse of her son , and Willem Dafoe is oddly perfect as the cowboy who allows her the chance.<br /><br />Faubourg Saint - Denis : Sometimes one needs to think he has lost love to accept that he has not been fully invested in the relationship . Melchior Beslon reminisces , trying to find where they went wrong through a series of sharp , quick cuts from his meeting Natalie Portman to eventually " seeing " how much he needs her.<br /><br />Le Marais : Leave it to Gus Van Sant to show us a story about the gap in communication and understanding as his films almost always deal with some form of alienation . His photographer from Elephant is an American working in Paris who is the catalyst for Gaspard Ulliel 's artist ramblings of love and soul mates . Sometimes one does n't need to know what is being said to understand what is going on in the pauses .
1 Paris Je T ' aime is a movie that explores the different kinds and aspects of love and all the emotions that it provokes . This movie reunites some of the best directors from around the world such as Gus Van Sant , Joel and Ethan Coen , Walter Salles a ... (read more)nd Alfonso Cuaron to tell short stories about love located in Paris , each one with their particular way of directing . In this film we also have one of the best cast ever seen in a movie including such great actors like Willem Dafoe , Steve Buscemi , Natalie Portman , Elijah Wood , Gerard Depardieu and many more each one with great performances . In conclusion , this movie is a compilation of stories of happiness , separation , unexpected encounters and love .
1 Paris , je t'aime ( 2006 ) is a film made up of 18 segments . You can do the math--18 segments in 120 minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story . The movie is based on the premise that you can , indeed , tell a story in that short amount of time . The premise works . Almost all of the segments are powerful , complete , and satisfying . Each presents a different aspect of the Parisian experience , and almost every director draws forth outstanding performances from a cast of great and near - great actors.<br /><br />There were so many powerful portrayals in this film that it 's hard to pick one or two favorites . Probably the most memorable to me were Juliette Binoche as a grieving mother in the segment " Place des Victoires , " Gena Rowlands as an aging beauty in " Quartier Latin , " Catalina Sandino Moreno as a maid in the segment " Loin du 16ème " and Margo Martindale as a Colorado mail carrier who has learned to speak French so she can visit Paris ( " 14ème Arrondissement " segment ) . < br /><br />Special mention must be given to Gulliver Hecq , probably the meanest little boy to ever harass an American tourist in a Parisian Metro Station ( segment " Tuileries").<br /><br />This is an outstanding movie . My wife and I decided to rent it in a few months so we can catch some of the subtle points we surely missed . However , Paris is photographed so beautifully that I would suggest that you try to see it on a large screen . In any case , do n't miss it !
1 I just viewed the film two days ago , and I was filled with anticipation , being that Paris is my second favorite city in Europe and I spent a very romantic 18 months there in the ' 80 's . I was somewhat disappointed that most of this group of vignettes , while original and artistically done , did not capture the " light " and beauty of the city very well . Nor enough of the romance ! We saw none of the tree - lined boulevards ... There was too much darkness , not only literally but figuratively . Some of the plots manipulated the viewer it seemed , and let him / her down " flat " ( the Marais sequence , the coiffure salesman sequence , to give two examples ) . The uplifting , good ones : The Mime sequence , the cemetery , the Montmartre ( though it left too much to the viewer to comprehend ) , the " Cowboy " vignette , and the Sacre Coeur-- seemed few and far between , and I would have liked to have seen such a wonderful actor as Orlando Bloom be in something that would have showcased his originality more .
1 it 's a very nice movie and i would definitely recommend it to everyone . but there are 2 minus points : - the level of the stories has a large spectrum . some of the scenes are very great and some are just boring . - a lot of stories are not self - contained ( if you compare to f.e . coffee and cigarettes , where each story has a point , a message , a punchline or however you wanna call it ) but well , most stories are really good , some are great and overall it 's one of the best movies this year for sure!<br /><br />annoying , that i have to fill 10 lines at minimum , i have n't got more to say and i do n't want to start analyzing the single sequences ... <br /><br />well , i think that 's it !
1 Thankfully saw this on a plane to Singapore recently ( thought I 'd missed it at the Cinemalaya filmfest ) . Paris , je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films ( about 5 mins each ) by 20 directors showing love in various pockets of contemporary Paris.<br /><br />One of my fave segments is ' Parc Monceau ' by Alfonso Cuarn ( Great Expectations , Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ) , which was done in one continuous shot and features Nick Nolte.<br /><br />The Coen brothers ' ' Tuileries ' starring Steve Buscemi as a tourist in the metro was hilarious ! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in ' Place des Victoires ' was haunting.<br /><br />For Maggie Gyllenhaal as an American actress / druggie in ' Quartier des Enfants Rouges ' to have portrayed anticipation and heartbreak in such a short period of time was just brilliant.<br /><br />Elijah Wood as a vampire victim in ' Quartier de la Madeleine ' was pretty surreal , while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a cute couple in Wes Craven 's ' Pre - Lachaise'.<br /><br />Natalie Portman was beautiful as usual as the actress girlfriend of a visually impaired French boy in ' Faubourg Saint - Denis ' . But despite the many portrayals of young love , a more mature execution by Gena Rowlands in ' Quartier Latin ' was equally aww - inducing.<br /><br />This movie is perfect for those with ADHD because each sequence is driven and carefully thought of.<br /><br />There are also a number of memorable quotes . One in particular is this one from a cheating husband who eventually leaves his mistress to stay with his dying wife in her last days : " In pretending to be a man in love , he became a man in love . "
1 I took my 19 year old daughter with me to see this interesting exercise in movie making . I always find it intriguing to get views and opinions from a different generation on movies , especially as I 'm such a cynic myself . It 's good to get an unjaded opinion from someone who has n't yet reached the " been there , done that " approach to every movie she sees . I 'm pleased to say that we both really enjoyed it and regarded it as a successful mother / daughter evening out . Far , far better than going to see some brain dead " chick flick " , which I gather is what we are supposed to enjoy , according to the demographics ? < br /><br />Eighteen directors were asked to produce a short piece about each of the arrondissements of Paris , a city I have n't visited in 20 years . But I wish I had . They are loosely linked by joining shots , and represent different approaches to love in the city regarded in popular culture as the quintessential romantic capital of the world . Some of the films work better than others but , as other reviewers have said , it never descends too far into kitsch . Some are funny , some are sad , some intriguing and some just plain puzzling ( I 'm still trying to discern some deep inner truth to the " Flying Tiger , Hidden Dragon " hairdressing salon . ) Some are just fun and perhaps should n't be assigned too much meaning ( the vampire and the tourist for example . ) Possibly my only criticism of the whole film , is that it makes Paris look too good . It can also be cold , wet , foggy , indifferent and miserable , or , in summer , baking hot and packed with so many tourists that you feel like a sardine in a can queuing up for hours to see every attraction . But I 'm nit picking . < br /><br />My personal favourite by far was the Coen brothers film shot on the Tuileries Metro station , and starring a perfectly cast Steve Buscemi as a confused tourist who inadvertently finds himself caught up in a lovers ' tiff . Absolutely perfect , and very , very funny , without Buscemi having to say a word . I also perversely enjoyed the piece about the two mime artists , which was probably the closest the movie got to being cutesy - that certainly teetered on the edge of kitsch , but it just stayed on the right side . Rufus Sewell and Emily Mortimer gaining insight from an encounter with Oscar Wilde 's tomb left me pretty indifferent , and Juliette Binoche trying to cope with the death of her small son made me very , very uncomfortable . I thought both the Bob Hoskins / Fanny Ardent piece , and Ben Gazzara / Gena Rowlands fell a bit flat , but Maggie Gyllenhaal was good ( has she cornered the market in junkies ? I watched Sherry Baby last week . ) < br /><br />But I felt the two " social justice " pieces ( for want of a better way of putting it ) , worked very well . By that , I mean first of all the film about the young mother leaving her own child in a day care to go and look after someone else 's baby across town . And then the film about the African migrant , struggling to exist on the margins of an indifferent society , who is stabbed and dies in the street in front of a young , new paramedic . Yet another murder statistic , in a world which sees thousands of migrants dying in the struggle to reach what they see as a better life , every year . I thought both pieces very well observed.<br /><br />The final film , 14th Arrondissement , in which Margo Martindale plays a postal worker from Colorado recounting the story of her first trip to Paris  in very badly accented French  to her night school French class , moved me . A perfect ending , to a good , intriguing if not quite great , movie . < br /><br />Paris je t'aime was an ambitious idea , but it works pretty well .
1 Paris , JE T'AIME is a wondrous cinematic homage to the city of light and the city of love , a film so complex that it almost defies summarization and reviewing . Ask a large group of people their impressions of life in Paris and the result would be something akin to this film . Tied together by each of the sectors or Arrondissement of the city , the film examines love in all forms , native folk in their Parisian modes , and tourists interacting with the great city . Approximately twenty writers and directors , each with about five minutes of screen time , include Olivier Assayas , the Coen Brothers , Sylvain Chomet , Isabel Coixet , Wes Craven , ALfonso Cuarón , Gérard Depardieu , Christopher Doyle , Vincenzo Natali , Alexander Payne , Walter Salles , Nobuhiro Suwa , and Gus Van Sant among others less well known . The stories vary from hilarious , to humorous , to touching , to tragic , to banal , to tender.<br /><br />In one story a young Frenchman ( Gaspard Ulliel ) is attracted to a young lithographer ( Elias McConnell ) , pouring out his heart in French to a lad who speaks only English . In another a separated husband and wife ( Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara ) meet in the Latin Quarter to finalize divorce proceedings while another couple in Père - Lachaise ( Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell ) approach marriage without connection until the spirit of departed Oscar Wilde intervenes . Steve Buscemi in Tuileries confronts superstition in a subway with his bag of tourist collections , in Bastille Sergio Castellitto ( in love with mistress Leonor Watling ) is ready to divorce his wife Miranda Richardson until she confides she has terminal leukemia , Juliette Binouche confronts agony about her son 's fantasies and loss in Place des Victoires with the help of a mythical cowboy Willem Defoe , Sara Martins and Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier display a keen tale of mistaken ideas in Parc Monceau , Fanny Ardant and Bob Hoskins ' play out ' a strange relationship in Pigalle , Melchior Beslon plays a young blind man to actress Natalie Portman in learning how to see in Faubourg Saint - Denis , vampire love between Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko in Quartier de la Madeleine , Maggie Gyllenhaal is an ex - patriot actress stung out on drugs in Quartier des Enfants Rouges , and Margo Martindale is a visiting tourist letter carrier trying desperately to speak the French she has studied for her life 's trip in a tenderly hilarious 14ème Arrondissement.<br /><br />The final few minutes of the film tries to tie together as many of the stories as feasible , but this only works on superficial levels . The film is long and there are no bridges between the many stories , a factor that can tire the audience due to lack of time to assimilate all of the action . But it is in the end a richly detailed homage to a great city and supplies the viewer with many vignettes to re - visit like a scrapbook of a time in Paris . It is a film worth seeing multiple times ! Grady Harp
1 With the sun shining brilliantly on a quiet Sunday that is just about to fully wake up , love can be felt in the soft breeze that sweeps past my feet and can be seen in the smiles of the people I walk alongside . It is the perfect day to stop off for croissants and a café - o - lait before heading off to the city of lights and love . Of course , a flight to Paris is not reasonably in this humble film critic 's budget so I had to opt for the next best thing , Paris , JE T'AIME , a collection of 18 short films by a variety of international directors . Each piece is named after a different Parisian neighborhood and is a reflection on love . Careful not to over glorify the most powerful and persuasive of all human emotions , Paris , JE T'AIME explores love at the many stages of its own game . The results are spontaneously romantic and surprisingly consistent . And truly , what better way to express the fleeting nature of love and how a moment can change your life than with a collection of filmed moments . < br /><br />The beautifully poetic quote above is taken from Tom Tykwer 's Faubourg Saint Denis . True to form , Tykwer ( RUN , LOLA , RUN ) uses time - lapse photography and repetition to demonstrate the entire cycle of love , from inception to dissolution . Originally shot in 2004 and paired down for this anthology , Faubourg stars Natalie Portman as Francine , an American actress in Paris for a part in a film , and Melchior Beslon as Thomas , a blind man she falls in love with . Here , the blind leads the blind through the most unstable of terrain , where two people consume each other to a point where their lives nearly lose their own existences . As love seems to go from dazzling to dizzying , Tykwer reminds us of the tricks it can play on our minds and the illusions it can create when we stray towards doubt.<br /><br />Perhaps the most giddily romantic offering comes from Sylvain Chomet 's Tour Eiffel . Choosing the city 's most identifiable attraction for its title , Chomet ( LES TRIPLETTES DE BELLEVILLE ) gives us a little boy who tells the story of how his parents met and fell in love . His father , a mime ( Paul Putner ) , finds himself falling into one surreal scenario after another and eventually lands himself in jail . This is where he meets the woman who will become the love of his life ( Yolande Moreau ) . Miming has become something of a dying art , if it is n't already dead . Yet by nature , it is dreamy and untroubled . Miming points its silent finger at the ridiculousness of human behaviour and what but love can make people act more absurd ? We might find someone special in the least likely of circumstances if we could just take ourselves a little less seriously.<br /><br />Paris , JE T'AIME keeps the flow lively by not always focusing on love between lovers . Three memorable shorts focus on the love between a parent and a child . Walter Salles ( MOTORCYCLE DIARIES ) has Catalina Sandino Moreno singing lovingly to her child before she leaves him to sing the same song with a distant longing to the child she watches over for her living . Nobuhiro Suwa ( UN COUPLE PARFAIT ) has Juliette Binoche trying desperately to overcome the emptiness she feels after losing her son . Binoche says very little yet , not surprisingly given her immense talent , her struggle is evident in her face as she learns that love sometimes means letting go . And Alfonso Cuaron ( CHILDREN OF MEN ) weighs in with one continuous shot of a father ( Nick Nolte ) and his grown daughter ( Sara Martins ) walking together for what must be the first time in a long while . We see them only from across the street and we only get close to them as the distance between the two characters narrows to a place of comfort and accepting.<br /><br />The last short to screen is Alexander Payne 's 14ieme Arrondissement . As usual , Payne ( SIDEWAYS ) takes an ordinary person and shows us what makes them extraordinary . Carol ( Margo Martindale ) is another American in Paris . She is there alone and for less time than she would have liked as she has dogs waiting for her at home . She is a plain person with an uneventful life who finds herself in a city that is rich and lush . In beautifully delivered Americanized French , she muses about the sights and how being there makes her feel . This woman spends so much time trying to be happy despite life 's numerous disappointments and as she sits in a city made for lovers , she realizes that she is in fact happy and loves herself more than she knew . She falls in love , if only for perhaps a moment , with life and love itself.<br /><br />The characters that appear but fleetingly in Paris , JE T'AIME find themselves at the romantic center of the universe . The moments they share with each other , be it helping someone up after a hard fall or reaching out your hand to another person without touching them or without their knowledge , are the moments that give love its flare and flourish . Outside the city of lovers , it can be easy to miss moments such as these but we must remind ourselves of their significance . It takes but a moment for love to shine through a cloudy sky . You just have to keep your heart open to see it . And if one city can be so abundant with love , one has to believe it can find its way one day to your door .
1 Back in 2004 I saw " True " , Tom Tykwer 's contribution to Paris Je T'aime . When I saw it I loved it and became thrilled . It became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much . Of course I wanted to watch the whole film , and I would even check who was attached , etc.<br /><br />Yesterday I finally saw it , courtesy of the internet.<br /><br />First of all I must say that it looks AWESOME . The photography is BEAUTIFUL in every short and shot , at the worst being nothing special - but still brilliant and clear . Later I read the trivia here , and maybe it 's how scanning in 6 K gives more justice to all the DP 's work . My special favorites are the " Quais de Seine " first scene ( that sunlight ! ) , the Sin City - esquire ( but better for me ) " Quartier de la Madeleine " , and " 14th Arrondisement " - but you know , what the hell I like them all : " True " or " Faubourg Saint - Denis " still makes me nervous with those brilliant colours ( my eyes , they tremble ! ) and " Quartier Latin " is gold imprisoned on silver . Beautiful.<br /><br />Yes , these are some BEAUTIFUL short films.<br /><br />Now let 's get onto the content . I very much ( and I mean VERY MUCH ) like the eclecticism that is so successfully felt . You never have have the same themes or treatment between two shorts , and I think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and deepening things inside the shorts . I loved coming from a simple love story into a crazy - Chinese - musical - in - Paris - with - Barbet - Schroeder into a social commentary into a terror comedy into a humble monologue . I love surprises ! And this film has them ! It 's great they took a chance to let all these director 's flesh out things that are not usual in mainstream cinema ( which I have come to heavily despise ) . It 's not heavily experimental , but I can breath the breathing space these people had.<br /><br />I like the small time and I love the acting . I love the simplicity and I love the love . I like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general it 's a film that is very very very nice to see , alone or with someone . To simply feel . It left me feeling very good.<br /><br />There is something about the earnestness in it ... it 's so frank ... <br /><br />What I did n't like ? Well , for me there are two shorts that are n't exactly the best - " Quais de Seine " ( which is good natured , sure , and maybe even necessary , but feels too much like a commercial ? ) and " Père - Lachaise " that even though I love the acting , I felt it 's themes were forced . But that of course , is just me . " Tour Eiffel " I also did n't love but I think is probably because of my very different sensibility from that of Sylvain Chomet ? I do n't know if this film has a special interest for people who already know the actor 's and directors , and so they can delight in their interaction , in the surprises ( look out for Alexander Payne in a funny role ) and basically in " what will this director do with this ? " great question . I enjoyed it very much in that way.<br /><br />I repeat now : Most shorts I loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix . I definitely recommend it . Definitely ! ! ! So , watch it if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love !
1 A mock documentary about a pair of Canadian producers , Bobby Myers ( Matthew Modine ) and Paul Linder ( Saul Rubinek ) , trying to make their first film in the late 1970s . Hollywood North is the comic tale of their struggle to pull everything together , despite a number of conflicting threads.<br /><br />Hollywood North works as a film in a way very similar to why This Is Spinal Tap ( 1984 ) works so well . Namely , although exaggerated in some ways , it is very close to the truth , and the truth consists of " behind the scenes " facts that are very different than the public face of the industry . It is n't easy to make a film , and it must have been especially difficult in Canada in the late 1970s . Films involve tens , if not hundreds , of people . Many have incompatible desires , motivations and personalities . Especially crucial are the financiers and the on - screen talent , as if either drops out or becomes undependable at any stage while the film is in production , it could jeopardize the whole affair , either necessitating extensive reshoots or abandoning the film altogether.<br /><br />So it 's not surprising that Hollywood North focuses on those kinds of relationships . The result is an excellent film that is both hilarious and tragic at the same time . The script is flawless and the performances are top notch . This is a must - see for any budding filmmaker and anyone with a serious interest in the craft of film - making . It should also be more than entertaining for any viewer with a modicum of intelligence and a sense of humor.<br /><br />A 10 out of 10 from me .
1 " Hollywood North " is an euphemism from the movie industry as they went to Canada to make movies because of tax breaks and cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto , in this case , later in Vancouver . Peter O'Brian , the director , probably saw a lot of the invaders from California that this movie seems to be the right way to deal with the arriving personalities trying to capitalize on the economics that Canada presented.<br /><br />Needless to say , " Moon Lantern " , the successful novel written by a Canadian author is turned into " Flight to Bogota " , which has nothing to do with the original film . A great egotistical has - been , Michael Baytes , who is obsessed with what is happening in Iran , is offered the lead part , which turns to be a disaster.<br /><br />The film seems to be saying that too many cooks have spoiled the broth , which seems to be the case with the ultimate product , which is saved by its producer , Bobby Myers . With the help of Sandy Ryan , who has been around making a documentary of the film being shot in Toronto , parts of the film are transformed into a cohesive movie at last.<br /><br />The filming process is hilarious , and the acting , in general , is good .
1 I rented this movie on DVD without knowing what to expect - and as I am about to study film - making in Canada of all places , I most certainly will bring this up in class.<br /><br />The story , centered around the probably most unlucky film team in the history of film itself , is brilliantly written and the very talented actors manage to deliver every single pun on time.<br /><br />If you simply could n't laugh during " Hollywood North " I suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away - you might have serious issues.<br /><br />Besides the wonderful script I also noticed the great chemistry between actors Deborah Kara Unger and Matthew Modine - where they really just acting ? Jennifer Tilly ( playing a hilariously bad actress ) and Martin Landau , also delivered a very edgy , yet funny performance.<br /><br />Great film , even better cast .
1 This movie captures the absurd essence of an overbearing American patriot actor -- one that believes his work ( and politics ) are as crucial to the American people as the opinions of the President himself . Alan Bates captures this mindset perfectly as Michael Baytes , and I will immortally remember Bates as this character . This is a movie for Canadians and Americans alike . It is a valuable piece of cinema , that which is able to take its audience through the magic of making a film and reveal just how easy it is for the producer and director to lose complete control to the will of the actors and innumerable outside forces . Wonderfully , " Hollywood North " does not suffer from the subject that it portrays : Peter O'Brian directs with precision and complete control , and commands both the serious ' behind - the - scenes ' portion of the movie , and the movie - within - the - movie , " Flight to Bogota " with clarity and insight . If you are at all interested in the wit and strength of Canadian cinema , " Hollywood North " is a great place to start .
1 I recently saw this film and enjoyed it very much . it gives a insight to indie movie making and how much work is really involved when you have a low budget yet need a name actor / actress to get people , any people to come see it and give the movie exposure . Bobby Myeres played by Modine and his partner Saul - Paul Linder make an excellent combination finding eccentric Miachel Bates , a " NAME " actor played by Alan Bates was a perfect casting decision in the movie and for the movie . My favorite cast member was Sandy Ryan played by the magnificent and underrated Debra Kara Unger with her own special performance again in the movie within the movie . If you enjoy thinking when watching a comedy then this one is for you . Low budget meets lower budget with High laugh content .
1 Hollywood North is a satirical look at the time in Canadian film history when the Canadian government offered huge tax breaks for films made in Canada . Most of the time it was treated as a tax shelter or a cheap way to get American films made . For example , Porky 's came out of it . Anyways Matthew Modine plays a novice producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved Canadian novel . However , in order to get the money he needs a American name star . He gets a loose cannon and learns he has to compromise to the point where the film no longer resembles the book it was originally based on . It plays well in Canada but may not be understood outside of the Great White North . Americans will think we 're satirizing ourselves but will miss the point that we 're actually satirizing them . For Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10 .
1 As essential a part of British pop culture as the Monty Python and James Bond , Doctor Who was a massive hit for 26 years ( 1963 - 1989 ) , making it one of the longest running TV shows in the world ( most serials are lucky to have ten seasons ) . Plans to reboot the series were always on the BBC 's agenda , and after a miscalculated ( not to mention Americanized ) TV movie produced by Fox failed to capture the magic of the original version , another nine years ( Comic Relief spoof and animated mini - series notwithstanding ) were required before the ultimate Time Lord could return properly , courtesy of acclaimed writer Russell T. Davies.<br /><br />Davies ' brilliance in reintroducing the character lies in his decision to do so through the eyes of an outsider : Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) , a London - based girl who leads a very normal life until one night she is attacked by creatures made out of living plastic . She is rescued by an elusive stranger who introduces himself simply as the Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) and then disappears after quipping : " Nice to meet you , Rose . Run for your life ! " . As she gets more and more curious about this " man " , she soon finds herself in a whole new world : aliens , invasions , travel through time and space , and of course , the omnipresent Police Box - shaped TARDIS.<br /><br />The first 45 minutes of the new Doctor Who are almost perfect ( the special effects could have used a bit more polishing ) because Davies nails two things : the show 's unique humor and the two protagonists . The original series ' most endearing trait was its blend of spectacular sci - fi and pure British comedy , a hybrid that 's hard , if not impossible , to export . Here the laughs are all linked to the conversations between Rose and the Doctor , who come off as fully rounded characters after just one episode . Okay , so technically Eccleston 's Doctor is the Ninth to use that name , but he distances himself from the previous eight incarnations by speaking with a Northern accent ( the one he uses on a daily basis ) and justifying it with a terrific line : " Lots of planets have a North ! " . < br /><br />The real triumph of this episode , though , is Piper 's performance : in theory , Rose is in her late teens , therefore nearly the same age as thousands of young viewers who had never heard of the Doctor before . Her portrayal of an ordinary girl lost in a new , exciting universe , represents the new generation 's reaction to the return of a TV icon , and the chemistry that instantly forms between her and Eccleston is a sign indicating the new Doctor Who is just as good as the old one.<br /><br />First , fifth , ninth , it makes no difference : there may have been others before Eccleston ( and Piper , for that matter ) but together he , William Hartnell , Peter Davison and the rest of the bunch are one single character , one so cool he does n't even need a name : he 's THE Doctor .
1 They did it . And , boy , did they do it fantastically or what ! The BBC finally brought the Doctor back to our screens on a Saturday evening where he belongs ! And they did it with style ! < br /><br />EPISODE ONE : " Rose " - One of the strengths of the new series is Russel T Davies as a writer and executive producer . He 's a fan of the show and knows what the other fans want , but also is an experienced writer in his own right , so knows what other people want . Another strength , as perfectly shown here in this first episode , is Billie Piper and her character of Rose Tyler . Finally the Doctor 's companion gets a credible back story and a strong character . Also nice to see the return of the Autons - a nice nod to the Classic Series there.<br /><br />EPISODE TWO : " The End Of The World " - In the start of this double bill to show off the TARDIS ' strengths , we end up in a story where special effects is everything ! They now have the technology to create real , believable environments and monsters - no more rubber suits of sorts ! Also the hints at the end of this episode regarding the new Doctor 's past - very intriguing to kill off all the Time Lords and make him the only one.<br /><br />EPISODE THREE : " The Unquiet Dead " - We 've had the future , now lets have the past . The first non - Davies written episode is a little flat in some places , but this is made up for by Simon Callow 's Charles Dickens and the sudden twist in the plot when it is revealed the pitiful Gelf are not so pitiful after all ... <br /><br />EPISODE FOUR : " Aliens Of London " - The consequences of the Doctor 's actions are fully explored in this series , not least with the repercussions of Rose running off with him . Also , we have our first cliffhanger ; not the best of ones admittedly . The Slitheen are an interesting villain , though they can look too CGI for their own good.<br /><br />EPISODE FIVE : " World War Three " - The second part of this story about the Slitheen suffers mainly from the same problems of the first . Also , the clips from the next episode coming up at the end of the current episode are annoying and spoil it for people.<br /><br />EPISODE SIX : " Dalek " - Yes ! We 've had the future , the past , and the present(ish ) , but now we get to the good stuff - the return of the Doctor 's arch - nemesis . Here I think we can complement Christopher Ecclestone - he was brilliant as the Doctor , and no more so then in this episode , where we see the pain on his face as he recollects the Time War and the alien nature of him as he almost turns into a Dalek himself.<br /><br />EPISODE SEVEN : " The Long Game " - really only a story to act as a prologue for the series finale . Saved by Simon Pegg as the smarmy Editor and Tamsin Grieg in an amusing cameo . The media are controlling us - that 's never been done before , has it ... <br /><br />EPISODE EIGHT : " Father 's Day " - this is a great episode . Full of human emotion and heartache for Rose , and the true consequences of what happens when you really muck up history . Full marks to Billie Piper here.<br /><br />EPISODE NINE : " The Empty Child " - I do n't find this kid very scary . Sorry , but I do n't . It 's a good episode though , but the cliffhanger still could have been better - it 's those " Next Time " bits that spoil them . John Barrowman is introduced here as Captain Jack , the dashing conman - he 's a good actor who 's been around for a while but only seemingly noticed now.<br /><br />EPISODE TEN : " The Doctor Dances " - Part two of this WW2 story - very well made in historical context terms . A nice upbeat ending , though a little confusing perhaps for younger viewers when the " Mummy " is revealed ? < br /><br />EPISODE ELEVEN : " Boom Town"- probably the weakest of the series , but that does n't mean its bad . A nice return for the Slitheen and also an interesting character study of the Doctor and Rose.<br /><br />EPISODE TWELVE : " Bad Wolf " - this starts off quite silly , with some good - hearted humour and cheeky fun making at popular TV shows over her in Blighty . Things turn deadly serious quickly , though , and the revelation at the end is the best cliffhanger in the series ! < br /><br />EPISODE THRITEEN : " Parting Of The Ways " - Goodbye Christopher Ecclestone . A fantastic Doctor in so many ways , David Tennant is having to really work his socks off to be as good as him . The regeneration scene at the end is beautifully played . Oh , and the Daleks are back - in the extreme ! God bless CGI , because they 'd never be able to pull this off normally ! < br /><br />Overall - brilliant ! 9/10
1 Picture the scene : a mountainous alien landscape . Twin moons illuminate the blood red sky . The Tardis lands , and out steps the Doctor , a middle - aged man in a Victorian frock coat , and Rose , his companion from Earth . A flicker of recognition crosses his face . " Well , I never ! Its the planet Saurious-7 . Where I fought the warlike Kraggartians . They tried to use giant Skinkons to take over the planet . " . The girl sniffs the air . " Ca n't we go , Doctor . I do n't like the look of this place . I keep thinking we 're being watched . " . The Doctor wags a disapproving finger . " Do n't be silly , girl . I wonder if the King and Queen of Cordaraby City remember me from my last visit . Come along , Rose , come along ! " . He strides off , the girl struggles to keep up . High on a hill , sinister red eyes regard them with hatred ... < br /><br />That was not how ' Rose ' began back in 2005 , and thank heavens for that say I. Unfairly derided at the time of its original U.K. broadcast , ' Rose ' can now safely be regarded as a landmark episode , putting ' Dr . Who ' back where it belonged , as one of the B.B.C. 's flagship programmes . The mistakes made by the McGann T.V. movie were well learnt . Instead of trying to shoehorn the new ' Who ' into existing chronology , it represented a fresh start for the series , beginning with shop girl Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) going about her daily routine . One day she goes to the basement to find a man named Wilson , and then the trouble begins . Mannequins come to life and attack her . It is only through the intervention of a mysterious stranger ( Christopher Eccleston ) that she is saved . < br /><br />The story , slight though it may be , is more than adequate as a starting - point for the series . The Autons are , of course , an old villain ( this was their first appearance since 1971 ) , but no references are made to their past appearances - another wise move . The finale effectively recreated the famous scene in ' Spearhead From Space ' when shop window dummies sprang to life . As the Doctor , Christopher Eccleston lacked the eccentricity of his predecessors , preferring a modern leather jacket to the Doctor 's traditional period clothes , but this made him more accessible to the show 's hoped - for new audience . Billie Piper confounded her critics by making a big impression as ' Rose ' . Also good was Noel Clarke as her boyfriend ' Mickey'.<br /><br />Yes , there was an added emphasis on special effects , but then there needed to be - the wobbly sets and unconvincing monsters of the past have no place on 21st century television . What is more important is how good a script this is . Ten million people tuned in to see the new Doctor.<br /><br />'Dr . Who ' was back - and back with a bang !
1 Perhaps the last film you would expect to come from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini ( who wrote the novel on which this film is based ) . It 's a neorealist fantasy , kind of an oxymoron , really . An old woman finds a baby in her cabbage patch and raises him as her own son . After a few years , the baby is a young boy ( named Toto ) and the adoptive mother is dying . He goes to an orphanage and , when he finally turns 18 , he leaves . Immediately , he finds that he has no home . Toto is optimistic , though , and wo n't let anything get him down . A man steals his valise , and instead of getting angry over it , Toto becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small shantytown . Toto takes some initiative and organizes the many homeless living in the area and they build a better shantytown . Soon , the landowner is trying to sell this plot of land , and the citizens of the shantytown have to protect themselves . After many attempts , the owner mounts a force of police to get rid of the homeless . At this point , the film becomes full - fledged fantasy ( before this it was more comedic / fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin ) . This stuff is so weird and shocking that it 's probably best for others to see it for themselves . It 's quite amazing , and very funny . There are objections you could raise about the plot of Miracle in Milan , most certainly . Fellini and Visconti were greatly criticized when they started to stray from Neorealism . I think I read this was widely criticized at the time of its release . At this point , though , it 's so enjoyable - I loved it very much . It might be my favorite of Vittorio de Sica 's films , although Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves come very , very close . 10/10 .
1 This is a really strange film -- and that is NOT a bad thing . It is a combination of a neo - realistic film about the homeless AND a fairy tale . I 'm sure that some may find this movie a bit too strange , but I loved it . Once again , this director brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people ( not actors ) and gets a great ensemble - type performance . Although not nearly as sad as Umberto D , both movies have a very similar point to make -- this one just does it in a very absurdist way . Ignore the cheesy special effects -- after all , it was made in the early 1950s and special effects are n't terribly important anyway ( or at least they should n't be in films ) . Instead , just sit back and enjoy the very strange and silly ride . Unless you are a total curmudgeon , you 'll have a ball.<br /><br />By the way , since I first reviewed this film , I have seen another DeSica directed film that is an absolute must - see and that is THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US . While not a fantasy or light in spirit like MIRACLE IN MILAN , a great film nevertheless .
1 The snobs and pseudo experts consider it " a far cry from De Sica 's best " The ones suffering from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem connecting to this masterpiece . De Sica spoke in a very direct way . His Italianness does n't have the convoluted self examination of modern Italian filmmakers , or the bitter self parody of Pietro Germi , the pungent bittersweetness of Mario Monicelli , the solemnity of Visconti or the cold observation of Antonioni . De Sica told us the stories like a father sitting at the edge of his children 's bed before they went to sleep . There is no attempt to intellectualize . Miracolo A Milano and in a lesser degree Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales , or what today we call magic realism . The film is a gem from beginning to end and Toto is the sort of character that you accept with an open heart but that , naturally , requires for you to have a heart . Cinema in its purest form . Magnificent .
1 This obscure de Sica delivers the goods . And it is said " the meek shall inherit the earth . " This tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war . They are homeless but cheerful , in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them , footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers . de Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale , a Cinderella story . I have not read the book it is based on so I can not foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio . It begins with the words , " Once upon a time ... " to exemplify the timelessness of its tale , for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere . Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone , whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a Spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all . De Sica 's most accessible picture is also one of his best . Abandoning neo - realism , he always dallied between that and pure good old film - making , he creates a movie that breaks the heart and at the same time fills it with the yearning of hope that one needs to continue leaving in this world . Gracias Vittorio ! Gracias ! Gracias ! ! ! Gracias ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1 This movie was my first touch with Mr Sica so I really did n't know what to expect . But what I saw just broke all my expectations - in a good way.<br /><br />The storyline is not complex and shows us a life of found boy- orphan and particularly his connection into the community of poor people who together built themselves a hood of simple metal plate houses . This little city in another city lives own life and things are going fine . But one day there is a water resource found and a rich nobles man is getting interested in the buying the place . But as the title of the movie hints - there is a miracle taking place . Our character gets a wonder dove from his dead mother . What is he going to do to protect his friends and all built city as well?<br /><br />It was just a masterpiece of natural comedy . There is shown the behavior of poor people and how money and property can talk and play with people . Also many funny moments and scenes are included - at the beginning with the spot where sun is shining and many more.<br /><br />So according to the fact that I m not a comedy lover you should see this movie because I liked it much < br /><br />I
1 This film is like an allegory of the gospel . It has such direct honesty and innocence you can not possibly believe it was made after the world war when Italy was ravaged and devastated , and was filled with a huge homeless , impoverished population . It is a monument to the best qualities of the human spirit , as well as to the endless creative resources of that land of inspiration . < br /><br />Toto is a character like Doestoevisky 's " Idiot " , a modern Christ finding his way in a big city . He is goodness and purity fortified by love , and his acts change the people he encounters , as much as the miracle working dove . The story is told in a natural manner and simple style , yet imbued with a magic that is almost a premonition of Fellini 's surrealist fantasies . It is one of the most inspiring , uplifting movies ever made .
1 This film is like a 1950-version of Ettore Scola 's Brutti sporchi e cattivi . Less sex and less realism , but a tale with great humanism and warmth . I would n't call this a neo - realistic picture . It 's very sentimental and more like a fairy tale , and should probably be classed as a comedy , although it deals with serious matters ( a little like Chaplin or 1930-comedy ) . Typical Italian though , very emotional , and hard to resist except for a stone cold person . The sentimentalism is a letdown , although this picture was not meant to be a realistic drama . It 's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief . But it is a lovable and hilarious comedy , with good music.<br /><br />7/10
1 If you have trouble suspending disbelief then this is n't for you . Consider : a woman already in late middle age finds a newborn baby in a cabbage patch and raises it as her own . Think about it ; she makes no attempt to locate the mother , who may well be a confused teenager in need of medical treatment and seemingly no one from the Italian equivalent of Social Services makes any attempt to put the baby into ' care ' ( no Social Services ? now I KNOW it 's a fantasy ) . Before you know it young Toto is ten or so and his adoptive mother dies leaving him to the orphanage from which he emerges a HAPPY man who loves everybody . In nothing flat he has not only given his suitcase to the man who stole it from him but organised the local homeless into bona fide Shantytown residents and for an encore he leads them in a fight against capitalism in the shape of the businessman who buys the land on which the Shantytown stands when oil is discovered there . This wants some swallowing without the subsequent ' miracles ' beginning with Toto 's dead mother ( the old lady who raised him rather than his biological one ) appearing to him and handing him a dove which doubles as a magic wand allowing him to grant modest wishes and a finale in which the hobos fly away to a better place located presumably somewhere over the rainbow.<br /><br />On the other hand the film is up to here with Charm and is easy to surrender to . On balance a small masterpiece .
1 De Sica is becoming one of my favorite directors , but this one was a hit - and - miss for me . A grinning idiot youth becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside Milano . It is a detailed and sparkling story of the innocent poor masses , complete with evil capitalists and trigger - happy police forces , but slowly it evolves into a magic fantasy tale , as the boy wonder Toto develops unlimited superhero powers . I had it up to here with the ever - smiling Toto after 10 minutes , and when the magic took over , I was left in the dust . There were so many wonderfully orchestrated shots , so many good characters among the settlers , that I kept thinking it was a waste the movie was n't more serious with its material . The coupling of neorealism and fantasy comes out more as an experiment of the " look - what - we - can - also - do - mum " sort than as a fully developed piece of work / art .
1 Forget the jaded comments that come before these . This is an action packed but sensitive movie about people who overcome real problems in a beautiful setting . Well - acted , even by Elizabeth Berkley . Recommended for anyone who wants to feel something and experience change .
1 Why a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley stars in this commonplace movie ? ? ? ! ! ! The cast gives some good performance ( Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl , Ele Keats as a girl without mother and Justin Whalin , a guy eternally lessened by his bother ) , but the direction is extremely boring and the story is NOT so interesting and original . I can NOT believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen ! Julie Corman ( the producer ) : are you CRAZY ? ? ? ! ! !
1 I began watching a replay of this TV movie on a Sunday afternoon , thinking it was just another dumb airplane disaster flick . I was wrong.<br /><br />"Pandora 's Clock " is an intelligent political thriller that is far beyond the quality of most TV movies . It could just as easily have made its debut on the big screen.<br /><br />The cast is excellent , including veteran actors Richard Dean Anderson , Edward Herrmann , Robert Guillaume , and Robert Loggia . Daphne Zuniga turns in one of her best performances as a medical specialist working for the CIA , and Frasier 's Jane Leeves is also very good . < br /><br />The dialogue is well - written and the story is compelling throughout . In fact , the final hour is so filled with plot twists and suspense that you ca n't leave your seat for a second . If you get a chance to see this movie , invest the time -- nearly four hours . You will be richly rewarded !
1 Pandora 's Clock is among the best thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you will ever see . A highly faithful adaptation of John J. Nance 's novel , which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel , is made even more so here . < br /><br />Despite being made for TV , this is first rate entertainment . The cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel . Richard Dean Anderson steps way outside the shadow of Macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to date . Jane Leeves is great her role as an ambassador 's assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic actor . Daphne Zuniga is great as Dr. Sanders and despite the character being a man in the book , it works incredibly well . Robert Loggia , Edward Herrmann , Robert Guillaume , and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and fit their novel counterparts tot he letter.<br /><br />There are changes to the story of course ( including and a slight change in the ending ) but those changes are for the better when compared with the novel . The plot is realistic and very see to believe in the way its presented making this the best airplane set movie since the original Airport movie . The production values are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago , they work fine . Sets are great , especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time to make this work.<br /><br />It does n't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa . Just do both and you wo n't regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel . This will leave you breathless .
1 Sometimes , Lady Luck smiles on me . I had originally made -- and copied over -- a VHS tape of this wonderful TV presentation . I was heartbroken when I realized what I had done since I had been unable to obtain a copy of it anywhere else.<br /><br />Recently , I subscribed to digital cable , and while searching through upcoming movies , there to my surprise was a scheduled broadcast of the movie . This time , however , I made a copy of it to DVD so there 's no chance of repeating my mistake.<br /><br />I finally got to watch it again after eight years , and it was just as exciting and tense as when I first saw it . There is a little bit of prelude to this story in that my first contact with " Pandora 's Clock " came with a live reading of the book on public radio . I just happened to tune in to the broadcasting station on my way home for lunch , and from the first installment , I was hooked . Each day , I waited with anticipation for the next chapter to be read.<br /><br />When I learned a few months later that the book was going to be broadcast on TV as a movie , I made sure to clear my schedule for that event.<br /><br />First of all , I 'd like to say that the movie was very true to the book , contrary to what another reviewer had said . That , in itself , is a rare achievement for TV movies.<br /><br />Secondly , I agree with others about the casting . I could not imagine a better choice for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson . Literally , the movie could have crashed and burned without a proper cast for this pivotal role . Anderson has never been better , and it is a shame that we have not seen more of him . In fact , all of the cast members did a superb job.<br /><br />My only complaint with the movie -- and the book -- was the interjection of the " terrorist plot " to arm a private business jet with air - to - air missiles and have its pilot stalk and shoot down the stricken plane . Basically , we are talking about less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this one , and folks , that is just not realistic at all given all the players involved . Also not realistic was how little the airliner was affected by having first one , then two of its engines blown off.<br /><br />That beef aside , I enjoyed the building suspense and found to be very believable how the reactions of foreign governments were portrayed in the film , as well as our own.<br /><br />If you have an opportunity to see this movie , do so by all means .
1 I 've seen a lot of TV movies in my time as a student , the majority the normal waste of time that US television throws out . This one , however , was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end . Having only seen Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate I was surprised with his excellent performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from A - B that he normally gives . It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after quite a long time dating back to The Fly II . Also nice to see Robert Guillaumme in a leading role again . I ca n't say that I ever take Jane Leeves seriously after her Benny Hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role . All in all a highly recommended film .
1 " Pandora 's Clock " is a gripping suspense / thriller that 's a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film . This movie , which aired in two parts on NBC in its debut showing in 1996 , is about an airplane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to be carrying this disease . The U.S. Government debates on whether the plane should be destroyed or not , while the pilot ( Richard Dean Anderson ) and a virus expert ( Daphne Zuniga ) try to figure something out to avoid disaster . I 'm not really a big fan of TV movies and miniseries , but I liked " Pandora 's Clock " . It 's one heck of a thrill ride . Jane Leeves ( TV 's " Frasier " ) , Robert Loggia , and Edward Herrmann ( as the President ) also star.<br /><br / > * * * ( out of four )
1 I love it when they actually do a sports story well . So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch . Not this one . It 's just a genuinely nice movie , an old - fashioned type of story - and based on a real - life guy to did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film . He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out , late in life athletically - speaking , to become a pitcher in professional baseball . Eventually , he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues , even if it was a very brief stint.<br /><br />All the characters in here are nice people , the kind you root for , from Quaid to the players on his high school team , to his little boy ( Angus T. Jones , now somewhat of a star on television.)<br /><br />Quaid is believable in playing Jim Morris because , unlike actors in the past in sports films , he knows how to throw a baseball . He looks like a pitcher , a guy who could fire it 90-plus miles per hour . And , most of this film is true , as testified by the real - life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD.<br /><br />So , if you 're looking for a nice , inspirational true life sports film , you ca n't wrong with this one .
1 Walt Disney 's " The Rookie " is based on the story of Jim Morris , a former minor league picher who made one of the most amazing comebacks in sports history , ending an almost 10 year retirement and making his Major League debut in 1999 at the age of 35.<br /><br />The film opens with a brief synopsis of Morris ' childhood , which included a series of re - locations - his father was a military man . And even when his family settled for good in football crazed Texas , Morris ' passion for baseball remained strong.<br /><br />The childhood segment then jumps ahead about 23 years to the adult Morris ( played by Dennis Quaid ) who is now a baseball coach and chemistry teacher at Big Lake High School ( in real life it was Reagan County High School in Big Lake , Texas ) . It is mentioned that he attempted a career as a baseball player but that it did n't work out.<br /><br />Morris 's team is struggling and he lectures them about giving up on their dreams . They turn the table on him , telling him that he should try out for a Major League team . At several times when he pitches to them in practice , they express amazement at the speed with which he throws . Morris seems unconvinced but agrees to a deal with his players in which if they win district , he will try out for a Major League team.<br /><br />Big Lake does win district and , adhering to his end of the deal , Morris attends a Tampa Bay Devil Rays try out . Phenomenally , he throws 98 miles an hour - faster than he threw during his minor league career and an outstanding speed even for a Major League pitcher . After another try out with the team , Morris is offered a contract with the Devil Rays.<br /><br />This leaves him with a tough decision - stay in his comfortable life or once again pursue his Major League dream by going through the minor league grind of making little money and spending months at a time away from home . And the decision is even more agonizing than during his first minor league stint because he now has a wife and three children.<br /><br />Morris signs with the Devil Rays , begins at the AA level and moves up quickly to the AAA level , one level below Major League Baseball . But as the season winds down , the chances of him getting " called up " grow increasingly slim.<br /><br />For the most part , I love this movie . There are lots of great performances and likable characters and it 's easy to find yourself really pulling for Morris . Also , the movie does a great job portraying professional baseball at both the major and minor league levels . And most of all , it teaches the timeless message of holding tight to your dreams even when they seem distant and almost impossible to achieve.<br /><br />Still , the movie has some flaws . While generally accurate , it exaggerates and even fabricates a few things . Check out http://espn.go.com/page2/s/closer/020410.html for some examples . Also , except for one scene in which he prays with his players , the movie completely ignores Morris ' Christian faith . But considering Disney 's left wing zeal , that 's not surprising.<br /><br />Presumably , a lot of the exaggerations / fabrications were done to make the story more dramatic . Yet the 20 minute documentary on Morris that is included on the DVD features some information that makes his story more dramatic but is excluded from the movie.<br /><br />For example , from birth until his family settled in Texas for good when he was 12 , Morris re - located 14 times . And his initial minor league career ended after four surgeries through which he lost half of the muscle in his left ( pitching ) shoulder , thus making his throwing 98 mph even more inexplicable.<br /><br />To fully appreciate and understand the story of Jim Morris , it 's good to not only watch " The Rookie " but to watch the DVD 's documentary , check out the aforementioned link to the movie 's inaccuracies and probably also to read Morris ' biography , also titled " The Rookie . " I have n't read the book but I hope to one of these days.<br /><br />But overall , " The Rookie " is a very good portrayal of a miraculous story and is a powerful testament to the power of dreams and the triumph of the common man . 8/10
1 A fine story about following your dreams and actually taking a stab at Doing something about them when the chance strikes . Nothing was easy for Morris either - he had a family , job , job opps elsewheres , a mortgage , etc - it was n't like he could just drop what he was doing and blithely hop on the greyhound to play AAA ball for 4 months . It took guts . I am glad that they showed his indecision , almost up ' til he got the callup to the majors.<br /><br />I can remember seeing him pitch against the Red Sox(I think ... ) , it was a great story . Though Morris actually looks more like John Kruk or a Mills Watson than Quaid - that 's okay . < br /><br />Quaid does a very good job playing the man , the teacher , coach and ' oldest rookie ' .... As someone who is in the the same age group , I certainly can ID with his plight . You 're not Quite too old to do what you had dreamed of as a kid , but it 's getting there . You have to do it sooner than lator.<br /><br />Believably told , nicely edited , paced , acted , good to see the familiar faces of the late Royce Applegate , Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here.<br /><br />Good job all around , glad to see it hit.<br /><br / > * * * outta * * * * ... who woulda thought that the Tampa Devil Rays woulda been the subject of such a good movie early on ?
1 The Rookie is based on the true story of a 40 + year old school teacher in Big Lake , Texas reaching the majors . Jimmy Morris ( Dennis Quaid ) is a small - town high school science teacher and baseball coach . His team is losing terribly until the team discovers that their coach played in minor leagues and can throw a pitch 98 mph . < br /><br />After throwing batting practice and a wager is made , Jim agrees that if his team wins regional 's , he 'll try out for the Major Leagues . The movie tells the story from Jimmy being boy to playing in his first game in the majors . It is a great underdog story and a very friendly family movie . Dennis Quaid makes the movie worth while , giving an emotional performance and is supported by an excellent supporting cast which includes : Brian Cox , Rachel Griffiths , and Angus T. Jones . < br /><br />The story takes a little while to develop and some scenes are a bit slow but it all works in well by the end . The baseball scenes are fun , well - filmed , and portrayed excellently . The movie really is n't about baseball but about one man 's quest to reach his dream . It 's inspiring , it 's emotional , and it 's funny . I liked it , I hope you do.<br /><br />The Rookie . Starring : Dennis Quaid , Brian Cox , Rachel Griffiths , and Angus T. Jones.<br /><br />4 out of 5 Stars .
1 An end of an era was released here in the States in Spring 2002 with " The Rookie , " a Disney live action film that seemed to be the " best for last ! ! ! ! ! " It took place right here in Texas ! Actually , the story began in West Texas , as evidenced by an area code found on a sign over there . It was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high class baseball team that he decided to go professional!!!!!<br /><br />What I liked about this movie : It was sooo nice ! ! ! ! ! It was a very good sports movie , ala " The Mighty Ducks " trilogy . It had also taken moviegoers across Texas , from somewhere between the Panhandle and El Paso all the way to the Metroplex ( where I live ) . I can tell because I recognize that ballpark ( was " The Ballpark in Arlington ; " now it 's " Ameriquest Field " ) ! It was nice to see Disney 's " Golden Age " end here in my area!!!!!<br /><br />R.I.P.<br /><br />Golden Age of Disney < br /><br />1920s - Spring 2002<br /><br />"It all started with a mouse ... and it ended with baseball . " ( sobs)<br /><br />10/10
1 I first saw this movie 3 years ago , and it was introduced by then Disney chief Eisner and the real Jim Morris.<br /><br />About a month ago , it came back on TV , and this time I taped it . Since then I must 've watched it at least three times.<br /><br />This is a wonderful , inspirational , feel good movie that is intelligently written and believably acted by everyone concerned . It resists going for every sentimental trick in the book , as well as all of the other clichés.<br /><br />It is refreshing to see a movie where the kids are n't jerks and have a whole slew of behavioral issues , and the jocks are n't portrayed as testosterone driven muscleheads.<br /><br />These are just normal people who have dreams like you and I.<br /><br />In my opinion , Hollywood as gone the other extreme to what they term " gritty realism " , making movies where everyone curses , and has problems with aggression.<br /><br />This movie is about a man who has a dream , and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream . The people in Big Lake TX seem so personable that I want to move there.<br /><br />As I said b4 , the film does n't try to go overboard with sentimentality . Dennis Quaid , as usual , never disappoints . I 've watched him from the late 70 's , and he is so underrated.<br /><br />But this movie has excellent performances from EVERYONE concerned , and kudos to the writers.<br /><br />A gem in the movie is near the end when Jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game , and his wife calls out to him from the stands . He rushes over and reaches out to his family . The look on the faces of the three other pitchers sitting on the bench in the dugout is priceless.<br /><br />If you 're looking for a change of pace , then pick this movie up .
1 This movie has several things going for it . It is a " feel good " story . The characters and actors are likable , realistic and present fine performances . Most important , I believe , is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball . Robert Redford looked good both throwing and swinging a bat in " The Natural , and so did Kevin Costner in " For Love of the Game " and " Bull Durham . " In " Major League , " Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen looked like they knew what they were doing , but many of the others did not , and that picture was pure silliness - and not very funny . < br /><br />So many earlier baseball movies , even where the stories might be interesting , presented such a lack of baseball ability on the part of the leads , they were ludicrous in this respect . In " The Stratton Story " and " Strategic Air Command , " Jimmy Stewart looked about as believable as a professional baseball player , as your overweight , non - athletic , elderly uncle in the softball game at the family reunion . Other virile and physically robust stars ( e.g. , Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig ; Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander ; and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean ) also exhibited a degree of baseball ability that would put them in the late rounds while " choosing - up " for a game at the Sunday picnic ( even if coed , and even if your uncle were involved ) . < br /><br />The scenes of Quaid 's high school team he coached , the ones where he attends his tryout with the Devil Rays , and those with him playing in two minor leagues and in the American League , all ring true . The participants are believable and capable . In addition , he is an engaging actor who always delivers a talented and appropriate characterization ( except , to a degree , some of his " over - the - top " scenes , and his forced accent , in his portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis ) . But he 's definitely on - target here , and this movie is a " 9 , " as good , or better , as any others of this genre , except for " The Natural . "
1 This is one of my favorite sports movies . Dennis Quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm gave out on him . As a high school coach , he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them he 'll try out for a baseball team if they do . They win ( partly because of all the batting practice they take with a coach who can pitch over 90 miles an hour ) , and he keeps his side of the bargain -- and is signed ! < br /><br />If you have ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult , Jim Morris 's story will resonate with you . It is moving and inspiring , and the man 's relationships ring true . < br /><br />Inspiration is not the only reason I rent this one , though . Dennis Quaid is just downright purdy in the part , and a baseball movie with a good - looking man changing a diaper is my idea of heaven . Ladies , if you feel the way I do , check this one out .
1 This movie , to me , is about family . Jimmy Morris lived his dream not just for himself , but for his family . I ca n't begin to tell you how I would be able to tell my little girl that daddy was going to Kansas City to cover Priest Holmes and the Kansas City Chiefs . She 'd think it was the coolest thing , like Morris ' son did . Living dreams with the family is what this one is about . I think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can truly appreciate what Jimmy Morris did .
1 Once upon a time Hollywood produced live - action , G - rated movies without foul language , immorality , and gore - splattered violence . These movies neither insulted your intelligence no manipulated your emotions . The heroes differed little from the crowd . They shared the same feelings and bore the same burdens . Since the 1970s , the film industry has pretty much written off G - rated movies for adults . Basically , modern mature audiences demand large doses of embellished realism for their cinematic diet , laced heavily with vile profanity , mattress - thumping sex , and knuckle - bruising fisticuffs . These ingredients constitute the difference between G - rated movies and those rated either PG or PG-13.<br /><br />Miraculously , director John Lee Hancock , who penned scripts for Clint Eastwood 's " A Perfect World " ( 1993 ) and " Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil " ( 1997 ) , hits a home run with this G - rated , feel - good , four - bagger of a baseball epic that not only celebrates America 's favorite summer time sport , but also extols the competitive spirit of the game . Essentially , " The Rookie " resembles the 1984 Robert Redford saga " The Natural " about an old - time slugger who makes a comeback . Unlike " The Natural , " " The Rookie " shuns swearing , sex , and violence.<br /><br />Moreover , rugged Dennis Quaid plays a real - life individual . Jim Morris ' autobiography , " The Oldest Rookie : Big - League Dreams from a Small - Town Guy , " served as the basis for Mike " Finding Forrester " ) Rich 's unpretentious , Norman Rockwell - style screenplay about white , middle - class aspirations . Morris attained his dream when he debuted on the mound as a relief pitcher in 1999 . Although it does n't belong in the same league with the inspirational James Stewart classic " The Stratton Story " ( 1949 ) , " The Rookie " qualifies as the kind of movie that Hollywood rarely makes anymore because audiences find them antiquated.<br /><br />Hancock and Rich encapsulate their entertaining oddball biography in a halo of mysticism . A wildcat oil prospector convinces two Catholic nuns back in the 1920s to bankroll a West Texas well . Fearing they have blown their bucks on an ill - advised fantasy , the sisters blanket the arid terrain with rose petals and entreat St. Rita 's patron saint of hopeless causes ' to intervene . The well gushes ! The Town of Big Lake emerges , and roughnecks swat at baseballs when they are n't drilling holes in the terrain . The spirit of baseball oozes from the earth like petroleum . Meanwhile , years later , the U.S. Navy does n't keep Jim Morris , Sr . , ( Brian Cos of " Manhunter " ) and his family in one place long before uprooting them . The constant moving takes a toll on Jim Junior . Jim 's dad shows little sympathy and berates baseball.<br /><br />Nevertheless , Jim has baseball in his blood , enough so that when he accepts a high school chemistry teacher 's job in his Texas hometown , he organizes a baseball team . Like the foul - mouthed " Bad News Bears , " " The Rookie " chronicles Jim 's triumph at turning losers into winners . Morris promises the team if they reach the divisional playoffs , he will try out for a professional baseball team . Predictably , Morris ' students maintain their end of the bargain . At age 35 , Jim stuns the big league scouts when he hurls fastballs at 98 miles - per - hour ! " The Rookie " never fouls out .
1 This was truly a great movie . I loved Dennis Quaid and the entire baseball team . Jay Hernandez is also a very likable actor that is very enjoyable to watch . The chemistry the team had once they got things together was spectacular , it just goes to show what you what can accomplish when minds unite as one with one goal . This team came back from the brink , having multiple losing seasons to winning just about everything . I love movies like this as they really are very inspirational.<br /><br />On top of that , Dennis Quaid 's character getting a place in the major leagues . You ca n't do anything , but root for this guy . It just seems like when someone is supposed to do something , they are going to do that . Things just happen to fall into place and makes everything click.<br /><br />Based on a true story , this film will really make you think about the fact that " nothing is impossible . "
1 This is a feel good film , about one person 's dreams and the drive or push to realize them . It is a beautiful and inspirational film . Why do some people have to try and find fault with every film that comes out , especially the good ones . Dennis Quaid gives a good solid performance in this true story of Jim Morris , a science teacher and high school baseball coach who is pushed by his team to take one more shot at a professional baseball career . With excellent supporting cast , including Brian Cox , as the crusty old ex navy officer who has let so much of his son 's achievements go by without his support . It was good to see him as something other than a villain in a film . If I have one complaint with this film it is this : Do n't ever let Royce Applegate sign the national anthem again . < br /><br />Seriously , this film belongs to that handful of great baseball films like " Field of Dreams " and " The Natural . " It rates two thumbs up and a big " well done . "
1 this a great Disney flick.it is the story of an aging high school baseball coach(Dennis Quaid),who was once on his way to the big leagues as a pitcher , but suffered a career ending injury.but through series of events , Jimmy Morris(Quaid)gets a try out with a major league team and even makes the roster.this is a great family film.it is inspirational , but does n't pour it on too thick.it's fun and entertaining.adults will enjoy this movie as well as kids.it is based upon a true story , though i 'm sure the filmmakers took some liberties in telling the story . Quaid is sensational as the title character , very convincing.if you 're looking for a film the whole family can enjoy , look no further.9/10
1 I had low expectations for this movie , but I was looking for something unchallenging for an evening . I walked out of the theatre totally delighted and somewhat surprised . This is a very fine baseball tribute film , and a nice lesson about pursuing your dreams . Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role , and I was touched by his performance . Definitely worth a full price ticket and a couple hours of your time !
1 I was impressed that I could take my 5 year old son to this movie without having to cover his ears or eyes . No sex scenes , no profanity , and not even any violence . Just good entertainment , enjoyable from beginning to end . Dennis Quaid pulls off this movie very well .
1 As predictable as a Hallmark card , but not without merit , The Rookie makes for a solid outing . Dennis Quaid , the most reasonable jock actor working today , is absolutely perfect as the science teacher turned baseball player Jimmy Morris . The film is never dumbed down for the children , as would be expected from a G rated film . As a sports film , The Rookie is one of the best I have seen since Any Given Sunday .
1 The movie actually has a fairly good story , but gets bogged down in several key places . It 's almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film . Dennis Quaid does a fairly decent job in his role ... but something is clearly missing from several key scenes.<br /><br />This 2.5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie . And probably would have been a much better film had it not had the feel as if it was thrown together.<br /><br / >
1 As a huge baseball fan , my scrutiny of this film is how realistic it appears . Dennis Quaid had all of the right moves and stances of a major league pitcher . It is a fantastic true story told with just a little too much " Disney " for my taste .
1 ' The Rookie ' was a wonderful movie about the second chances life holds for us and also puts an emotional thought over the audience , making them realize that your dreams can come true . If you loved ' Remember the Titans ' , ' The Rookie ' is the movie for you ! ! It 's the feel good movie of the year and it is the perfect movie for all ages . ' The Rookie ' hits a major home run !
1 The film had many fundamental values of family and love . It expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story . The script was clear ( it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children)and was enjoyable and humorous at times . There were a few charged symbols to look for . The cinematography was acceptable . There was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today(which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out ) . It was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it . Although editing could have been done better I thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy . And the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something I did n't like either but in all it was a good movie .
1 What a fun movie experience ! I was expecting a sappy kids movie and found that I enjoyed it more than my teens . Take a tissue , it 's not sad , just ' moving ' in parts . Finally , its a ' feel good ' flick for the whole family . Note : It 's 2 + hours , so consider leaving the littlest ' squirmers ' home for this one . AP
1 This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris , a high school science teacher / baseball coach , who is inspired by his players to try out for the pros and fulfill his life - long dream of playing in the majors . Dennis Quaid , no stranger to sports films , plays Morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job of recreating the real - world events that led to Morris brief stint as a relief pitcher for the woefull Tampa Bay Devil Rays . The first half of the film , dealing with his rag tag bunch of High School Baseball players ( all of whom look way too old to actualy be in High School ) is less effective and probably a bit too long . Overall the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without . However , it is still a fairly involving movie with an inspirational theme that proves once again that baseball is the national pastime for a reason . GRADE : B-
1 This is the best picture about baseball since Redford whacked The Natural our way . Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths light up the screen with a great story and a cast that seemed real enough to pull you into their lives . < br /><br />Laced with dreams - dripping in reality , the American Dream reignites after 9.11 with a true story about the Devil Ray 's mid - life rookie , Jimmy Morris . Australian born actress , Rachel Griffiths , plays a native West Texan better than a lot of Texans I know ; and Dennis Quaid was perfection   cast as the wannabe , gonnabe and humble winner with as much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience . It 's real . The on - screen chemistry works . If you like baseball heart - warmers , you 're going to love this film . The ingredients for Americana and apple pie were all in there . My popcorn became the a la mode ' . < br /><br />And hey : buy the CD ! The music rocks and carries the story magnificently ! Syncing words and music pushes the story forward exactly the way it should , an area that disappoints me more often than not.<br /><br />Criticisms : I 'd have given the baseball to somebody else . But Quaid has something to teach us all about character ' and heart . St. Rita and the nuns were a nice decoration , but they never really found their place in the story to open and close around them . A little long . Worth every minute in the last analysis . 8 / 10 . < br /><br / >
1 The Rookie kept me smiling from beginning to end . Dennis Quaid played the role to perfection . The little boy that plays his son was fantastic . He made this a father - son movie to remember . The messages are good ones . Follow your dreams . Failing at the pursuit is alright as long as you try . The excitement is palpable . I believe this movie will be a classic .
1 Disney might just be on to something here . First , they had " Remember the Titans " with Denzel , a story based on truth involving sports and a small town in middle America . Now , with Quaid and The Rookie ... yet another sports story based on truth.<br /><br />Both movies move you to tears at times , and both make you smile and feel all warm after seeing them . My wife and I took in The Rookie and we expected it to be a great feel good type movie . We were not let down , when asked if we 'd be buying this on DVD when it comes out , it was a no - brainer . Most definately .
1 I knew I was going to see this when I saw the first preview . Dennis Quaid was one reason , but the theme of holding on to your dreams speaks to me . People talk about this as a movie for kids , but I think it 's a movie for baby boomers who are coming to terms with aging , infirm parents , our own mortality , our kids growing up and leaving us , and all the other things we never thought would happen to us . < br /><br />The movie does n't fall into the trap of tragedy ; it 's about what living your dreams means when you have a real life . < br /><br />Quaid is too small for a pitcher but he makes it look good , and Rachel Griffiths makes a small part as the wife into a thoughtful , layered performance . The camera - work is slow and sweet . When they put this movie together , they left out anything that was n't necessary . Very nice .
1 This is a movie that plays to everyone 's emotions . We all want a second chance at things . Jim Morris got one , followed his heart and got a chance to live his dream . What a great message and what a great delivery by this movie .
1 I just saw this movie tonight , opening night . It was great ! ! I 'm a big fan of sports movies , and this was right up there as one of my favorites . Dennis Quaid was great . ( Oh , by the way , Mr. Quaid , if you read this ... my sister lives in Austin , where you live ..... and she was supposed to buy you a drink once ... well ... she kinda stood you up ... but she did n't mean to ! : C ) [ not that anyone 's going to believe that ... ] ) ANYWAY , it 's a great movie . Everyone who likes a good sports movie , should go out and see it ! : C )
1 Despite Disney 's best efforts , this is a rather enjoyable movie about following your dreams . I was surprised that it did n't strike me as over - sentimental ; this movie played fair . Dennis Quaid was very , very good in the role , which is saying something for a sports movie . I ca n't recall how many sports movies have had little quirks that bother me ; here , everybody looks the part . This movie is surprisingly good , and I predict that it will do surprising business as it is a G - rated movie that does n't require the viewer to stop thinking . Ebert to the contrary , this movie is a success .
1 The first step to getting off of that road that leads to nowhere is recognizing that you 're on it in the first place ; then it becomes a matter of being assertive and taking positive steps to overcome the negative influences in your life that may have put you on that road to begin with . Which is exactly what a young Latino girl does in ` Girlfight , ' written and directed by Karyn Kusama . Diana ( Michelle Rodriguez ) is an eighteen - year - old High School senior from the projects in Brooklyn , facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester . She affects a ` whatever ' attitude which masks a deep - seated anger that threatens to take her into places she 'd rather not go . She lives with her father , Sandro ( Paul Calderon ) , with whom she has a very tentative relationship , and her younger brother , Tiny ( Ray Santiago ) . With her life teetering on the brink of dissolution , she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her . And one day she finds it , without even looking for it , when she stops by the gym where Tiny trains . Ironically , Tiny wants nothing to do with boxing ; he wants to go to art school , but Sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets , and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons . When Diana convinces Tiny 's trainer , Hector ( Jaime Tirelli ) , to take her on , and approaches her father for the money , under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance ( she does n't want him to know what she wants the money for ) , Sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money . Ultimately , with Tiny 's help she finds a way , and the ring soon becomes her second home . It 's an environment to which she readily adapts , and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better . And the fact that she will have to fight men , not women , in ` gender blind ' competitions , does not faze her in the least . Diana has found her element.<br /><br / > 	 First time writer / director Karyn Kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story , presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead - end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere . And there 's no candy coating on it , either ; as Hector tells Diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is , ` I was a fighter once . I lost . ' Then , looking around the busy gym , ` Like most of these guys , they 're going to lose , too . But it 's all they know-- ' And it 's that honesty of attitude , as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed , that makes this movie as good as it is . It 's a bleak world , underscored by the dimly lit , run - down gym-- you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers-- and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall , blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have , all that they know.<br /><br / > 	 Making her screen debut , Michelle Rodriguez is perfectly cast as Diana , infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves . She is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really Rodriguez ; exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin ? Whatever it is , it works . It 's a powerful , memorable performance , by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation . She certainly makes Diana a positive role model , one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life , at least to those who would seek them out.<br /><br / > 	 As positive as this film is , however , it ends on something of an ambiguous note ; though Diana obviously has her feet on the ground , there 's no indication of where she 's headed . Is this a short term fix for her , or is she destined to become the female counterpart of Hector ? After all , realistically ( and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film ) , professional boxing is n't exactly a profession that lends itself to , nor opens it 's arms to women . And in keeping with the subject matter of the film , and the approach of the filmmaker , an affirmation of the results of Diana 's assertiveness would have been appropriate.<br /><br / > 	 The supporting cast includes Santiago Douglas ( Adrian ) , Elisa Bocanegra ( Marisol ) , Alicia Ashley ( Ricki ) and Thomas Barbour ( Ira ) . Though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify , there are certain aspects of ` Girlfight , ' that stretch credibility a bit , regarding some of what happens in the ring . That aside , it 's a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience . I rate this one 7/10 . < br /><br / > < br /><br / >
1 " Girlfight " follows a project dwelling New York high school girl from a sense of futility into the world of amateur boxing where she finds self esteem , purpose , and much more . Although the film is not about boxing , boxing is all about the film . So much so you can almost smell the sweat . Technically and artistically a good shoot with an sense of honesty and reality about it , " Girlfight " is no chick flick and no " Rocky " . It is , rather , a very human drama which even viewers who do n't know boxing will be able to connect with .
1 Casting unknown Michelle Rodriguez as Diana was a stroke of genius . She 's perfect . Her acting inexperience actually works in her favor . We 've never seen her before so it really feels like her story . She also brings across genuine toughness . This works against her though , because we never doubt her . You never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against any fighter we do n't think she can beat . So as a boxing movie , it fails.<br /><br />Then again , this is n't really a boxing movie . How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer that is n't a boxing movie ? You do n't . But Karyn Kusama has anyway . Like many indie films , " Girlfight " defies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore that could darn near happen in real life.<br /><br />Diana is doing poorly in school . She beats up people she does n't like ( all the other girls in her school for example ) . She does n't fit in . Her father is forcing her kid brother Tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough . He gives Tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives Diana nothing , as if she has no need to defend herself , nor anything worthwhile to make of her life . Tiny wants to go to art school ( cliche ' , yuck ) , so he gives up his boxing allowance to Diana , who actually wants to box . Things get complicated when Diana falls for another boxer , Adrian ( Santiago Douglas ) , who 's looking to turn pro . From there the story winds down toward the inevitable ... the two meet in the amateur title fight.<br /><br />What left me cold was that I never found any of this all that interesting . It 's all just a bit too believable . Kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports . A lot of professional boxers have risen from these circumstances . The mental and physical toughness this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing , where anger is your friend . So this time it 's a girl . Big deal.<br /><br />Or there 's another position to take : finally , a boxing movie about a girl . Women 's boxing has been around a long time . The brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions of people 's their lives and their feelings . The whole fighting thing is used as a platform from which to paint a larger picture . Respect . Overcoming adversity . Self - discovery.<br /><br />I recommend " Girlfight " because it has a good spirit and is an example of some great work by a first time director . The dialogue never rises above soap opera quality , but the story itself actually changed my view on some things . Yes , the world now seems like a better place . A film did that.<br /><br />Grade : B-
1 I was not expecting the powerful filmmaking experience of " Girlfight " . It 's an Indie ; low - budget , no big - name actors , freshman director . I had heard it was good , but not this good.<br /><br />Placed in a contemporary , ethnic , working - class Brooklyn , Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the day - do - day struggles of urban Latinos . Diana , the protagonist , is seething with anger and lashes out at her high school peers , getting in trouble with the school and her friends . She is being raised by her single father , who appears to love her and her brother , but applies a strict , sex - based double standard on his children . The father 's double standard is illustrated by the fact that Tiny , the brother , is taking boxing lessons at the local gym , but Diana is denied similar pursuits . On an errand to the gym to meet Tiny , Diana is captivated by boxing . Tiny does n't like boxing , so he and Diana trade places ; he gets the money from Dad then gives it to Diana to take the lessons in his place.<br /><br />This is actually a feel - good movie , as Diana grows and learns about herself through boxing , meets a guy , and addresses some very serious issues head - on . There 's no giggly , ' everything that can go right does go right ' resolution a la " Bend It Like Beckham " . The reality and attendant personal issues are too big for pat resolutions , but in my opinion , " Girlfight " is a better and more satisfying film for it .
1 Girlfight is like your grandmother 's cooking : same old recipe you 've tried a million times before , yet somehow transformed into something fresh and new . Try and explain the story to people who have n't seen it before : a young women from the wrong side of the tracks attempts to improve her situation by taking up boxing whilst dealing with a bitter , obstructive father and her growing attraction to a male rival . Watch them roll their eyes at the string of clichés , and they 're right : it * is * clichéd . Yet I was hypnotized by how well this film works , due to the frequently superb acting and dialogue , and sensitive direction that makes it ' new ' . I avoided this at the cinema because it looked like complete crap but do n't make the same mistake I did . Definiately worth a look .
1 When " Girlfight " came out , the reviews praised it , but I did n't get around to seeing it . I finally saw it when it got released on video , and understand the glowing reviews.<br /><br />The movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto . We quickly get introduced to student Diana Guzman ( Michelle Rodriguez ) . She has a bad - ass expression on her face , and any idea about Diana that we might derive from this expression soon gets corroborated when she gets in a fight . As Diana gets in trouble for this , we then meet her father , an aggressive type in his own right ; clearly we ca n't totally blame Diana for her attitude.<br /><br />But then the movie really picks up , as a new thought germinates in Diana 's mind : boxing as a way to escape this grim existence . Her older brother has already gotten into boxing , but her father most likely wo n't approve . Only Diana herself can decide what to do.<br /><br />Just the first few minutes alone identified that I was in for a very gritty , non - Hollywood movie , but the brief appearance of John Sayles in a supporting role truly affirmed that . Even before they get to any boxing scenes , you feel like you 're getting pounded in the face at seeing the ugly life that Diana lives . And when they finally arrive at the film 's main story , there 's no turning back.<br /><br />All in all , I definitely recommend this movie . I will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himself / herself has been sort of a cliché in cinema for many years ( " Rocky " , " Million Dollar Baby " ) , but I still think that they did a great job with it here . In fact , this may have brought the genre to its apex . Really good . Too bad that Michelle Rodriguez wasted herself in Hollywood movies after this one .
1 Michelle Rodriguez is a well - built high - school senior who discovers that she has a powerful punch and begins amateur training at a Brooklyn gym . Santiago Douglas is a a handsome young man , barely older than she , who also trains there . They meet after class , so to speak , and feel attracted to each other . No sex . Santiago has been instructed to save it for his next bout.<br /><br />Both are participants in a " gender - blind " athletic program that makes no distinctions between males and females , a misguided attempt to level the athletic playing field.<br /><br />A conservative radio commentator recently announced -- and I swear I 'm not making this up -- " Let 's face it ; the president is black . " I 'm here to make an equally perspicacious observation -- " Men and women are different . " Now , in 99 cases out of 100 , this need n't make any difference in physical performance . But in the top one percent -- trained athletes whose skills have been honed to a fine edge -- men generally have the advantage . With their narrow hips they can run faster . And they have greater muscle mass and upper torso strength . These differences in body build make it possible for women to give birth and raise children and for men to catch and kill food for them . This sexual bifurcation is the result of the perfectly normal process of natural selection . Without it , there might not be any humans at all . And that , boys and girls , is why they have men 's events and women 's events at the Olympics . I speak to you as your anthropologist . That will be ten cents , PayPal preferred.<br /><br />That 's why I called this gender - blind program misguided . As talented a boxer as Rodrigues is , as she approaches the zenith of the game , she will eventually lose to a male.<br /><br />That 's where the complication arises in this movie . Rodrigues is finally matched against her boy friend , Douglas . Neither wants to loose any anger on the other , not to mention roundhouse rights , but the pride of both is at stake , and the pride is both personal and gender related . Douglas refuses to fight a woman in the ring . And Rodriguez is offended by what she sees as his patronizing attitude . It ends happily.<br /><br />I was n't really expecting much from the film . I thought it would be a rip off of Clint Eastwood 's " Million Dollar Baby " until I discovered that this was released years earlier . And I 'd never heard of the director or of any of the performers . That sort of obscurity generally augers ill -- made - for - television weepers and so forth.<br /><br />But I was surprised at how neatly this is put together . The total absence of bathos left me open mouthed . So did the minimal use of boxing clichés -- the frayed ropes , the blood , the cutting of the swollen eye , the battered post - bout faces , the fat and sweaty onlooker shouting " Kill him ! " , the slow motion landing of glove on nose , the spray of sweat from the mauled head , the heroic music signaling the long - awaited apotheosis of the victor . None of that here -- well , almost none . The whole plot could be considered formulaic . Tough kid finds outlet in the ring , etc.<br /><br />The feeling you 're left with is that this is probably pretty much what these amateur contests are like . Different from those we see on TV and in ordinary movies . No bells ring , for instance , Instead a dancing and observant referee yells " Stop ! " And " Box ! " The contestants wear head gear . The gym is populated not by a crowd of cheering spectators , but only by a handful of people who have some particular interest in the goings on . It 's a clean movie , despite the rather grim setting and the unhappy family dynamics.<br /><br />Michelle Rodriguez can look pretty mean , what with her muscular bulk and her eyes glowing under her lowered brow , but once you get used to the idea that this is a girl who can beat you to a pulp anytime she wants , and once you hear the feminine contours of her supersegmentals , she ai n't bad . ( A scene in which she battles her father to the floor is overdoing it . ) It was a little hard to understand Douglas 's restraint when Rodriguez crawls all over him in bed . The director , Karyn Kusama , has chosen her talent carefully.<br /><br />Shows what you can do with some talent , imagination , and a modicum of money . There ought to be more films like it . Take one of those multi - billion dollar blockbusters full of dinosaurs or space ships and spread the generosity around a little .
1 I saw this movie after i saw Blue Crush and other of Michelle 's movies , i thought she had a bleak future in this business . I was extremely wrong after watching her performance in " Girlfight " i was amazed in the way she captures the emotion of one a fighter , but also a warrior . In this movie the way she confronts her father about the treatment of her and her brother , the way she conveys anger when getting hit . Her characters learning curve in the movie of she ca nt always put up a wall and hide from love , or that just because she has power she wo nt win . I believe this role was fit perfectly for Michelle even though she had no prior experience , the director saw talent , I criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her .
1 Girlfight is a story about a troubled teen named Diana Guzman ( Michelle Rodriguez ) . Diana is burdened by her mothers suicide and a sexist father living in a sexist community . A short temper and plenty of things to spark a fire , she s about to get kicked out of school for fighting . Her brother , Tiny ( Ray Santiago ) , is training with Hector ( Jaime Tirelli ) in boxing . Diana is told by her dad , Sandro ( Paul Calderon ) , to deliver that weeks payment for Tiny 's training . While Diana is walking through the gym , she realizes that s what she wants to do . She wants to box . Diana asks her dad for money to train but he refuses because she s a girl and should do more ' girly ' things . All Diana wants is to be treated like any other guy . Not looked down upon because she is a woman . She steals money from her father to begin training.<br /><br />Great movie . Genius , pure ' effing ' genius . Recommend to anybody who needs to see a good clean movie with no ' monkey business ' .
1 Went to Wal - Mart and found this film on DVD and had no idea whether I made a bad purchase or a good one . It is the later outcome to my viewing the entire film from beginning to end . Michelle Rodriquez,(Diana Guzman),"BloodRayne",'05 , gave a great performance and her looks are beautiful , sexy , and at the same time a real study in the art of how acting is really performed . Diana did not like her home life and especially her own father for the abuse he gave her mother . She decides to get boxing training in a local Brooklyn Gym and is not really well accepted by the male boxers . In her high school there is plenty of friction between her female classmates and guys . There is lots of action in the ladies bathroom and references as to private parts of guys . If you like boxing , and seeing a hot sexy gal do wonders in the ring and knock the boys on their you Know What , this is the film for you .
1 Sports movies have never been my thing , but a small handful of them work for me . The best are the those which focus less on the sport and more on the character , such as Raging Bull , the Wrestler and Girlfight . This is a great directorial debut for Karyn Kusama , and an outstanding first performance for Michelle Rodriguez . Girlfight feels is both realistic and involving , that is enough so to make it a memorable film.<br /><br />The plot is strait forward enough . Diana Guzman , is in her fourth year of high school , but due to her picking fights in the hallway she is close to expulsion . As a possible means of unleashing her anger , she signs up for Boxing lessons at the club where her brother is training ( at the wishes of there father).<br /><br />In the course of ninety minutes , we the viewers see something extraordinary . Diana almost literally changes from a girl to a woman . We see it in her body as well as her behaviour , especially when one of the boys at the club finds himself drawn to her , and she gets into it . There is not a bad scene or a lame / contrived moment in the film . The only error that I would say could be corrected is that one of the subplots ends on what feels like an unfinished note . Aside from that , Girlfight is a great movie .
1 So I flipped on the digital subscriber channels one night a couple of years ago and thought I 'd pass a half hour watching " Girlfight " while waiting for " Hart 's War " to start . With a title like that I figured it was some exploitation ' B ' flic about inner city girl gangs.<br /><br />Much to my surprise it was n't about that at all . Instead it is a well acted , well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing . She is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while observing his bouts . As he does n't really want to be a boxer ( only following through on their father 's wishes ) she convinces his coach to take her on in his stead . < br /><br />The story unfolds in an intelligent and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest . For starters , her brother 's coach does n't want to take on a female boxer . After grudgingly doing so there is the problem of lining up matches for her . Then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on . Yes , a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot , coming across more of an interesting inter - human reaction with its own fight related consequences.<br /><br />All in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of . Some time later when I saw the much advertised and acclaimed " Million Dollar Baby " I thought " wait a minute , this seems kind of familiar " . Needless to say , I did n't watch " Hart 's War " that night .
1 I really enjoyed Girl Fight . It something I could watch over and over again . The acting was Fantastic and i thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the film . Very convincing might I say . The movie is showing how women should stand up for what they want to do in life . She had so much compassion and yet so much hate at the same time . Dealing with a ignorant dad did n't really help her much . Even though he loved her he was really hateful . Her mother died when she was younger and that also put some sadness in the role . The love story was a part that i really enjoyed in the movie also . I felt the passion the y had for one another . Then again drama sets in and then its like she is choosing between her boyfriend and her life long dream . I thought it ended just right . It was the kind of ending where you have to decide what happened in the future for them . For all you people who likes a movie based on a sport with a good plot i 'd suggest that you check this one out
1 girlfight is using a well - known formula as someone pointed out , however , i have seen plenty of movies that do n't do it this well or that are not this credible . i believe it is in the end easier for a woman to empathize the character and that way feel more touched by the movie.<br /><br />the movie is encouraging both mentally and physically even if your life and environment were completely different and , i think the viewer can still gain a lot by seeing this . although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sports in general , this is the movie that gave me the spark.<br /><br />so the plot is familiar / common . actors are good . but the thoughts that it can spark are what make it above average in my opinion . it made a big impression on me and i know i 'm not the only one .
1 I Think It 's a great movie . because you get to see how Diana 's life at home is . she got so much aggression , and she wants to prove that girls can fight too . I think she and Adrian were great actors . Because of this movie I Am Boxing too . It really impressed me . the only negative part I think . Is the end . because It 's alright between Diana and Adrian . But you do n't get to see how it is at home . And I Did n't really like it that you also do n't get to see how her father is doing , and her brother . but i Think it was A great movie and I Think I 'm going to watch it a lot more : ) I recommend it to anyone , even when you do n't like boxing , you get to see a lot more than only boxing . I had a great time watching it .
1 " Girlfight " is much more of a coming - of - age - story than it is a fight flick . And what a relief to have one in an urban school , with naturalistic , realistic Latinos and believable use of Brooklyn project settings . < br /><br />It made me realize that virtually all Hollywood high school movies are set in luxurious suburbia or small towns . ( Even the somewhat comparable " Love and Basketball " which focused on teen African - Americans was set in suburbia . ) While these kids share some of the same peer problems , those issues shrink compared to the other struggles of these kids , where high school graduation could be the major accomplishment of their lives.<br /><br />The feminist element here is riveting in its originality , as you hold your breath to see if she can have a relationship -- and a victory-- on her terms . A lots of audience sympathy goes to the guy who is challenged to rise to a gender - bending - expectations situation.<br /><br />The movie does drag a bit here and there , but this is no cheap thrills " Rocky " fight movie , as the practices and fights have complex outcomes , and all the relationships -- especially with fathers and father - figures-- take more center stage than the center ring . < br /><br />There were lots of interesting music credits listed at the end , but I had n't really noticed the songs.<br /><br />(originally written 10/7/2000 )
1 While the story of a troubled kid turning to boxing for self - respect and anger management is hardly a new thing , the story is given a fresh twist here when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy.<br /><br />Diana has trouble at school . She just ca n't stay away from fighting . At home her father is constantly putting her down . Her brother trains boxing at a gym and one day when she picks him up she decides she also wants to train.<br /><br />It would be easy to call this movie a " Rocky with girls " i guess . But that is not at all what this is about . The story actually benefits very much from the main character being a girl rather than a boy . That way you can deal with more problems at once . First the problem of her not being accepted because she 's not a girlie - girl , and then when she comes to the boxing gym because she 's a girl at all . It 's also a story about how a purpose can change someones life . How positive things can make you grow . I do n't want this to sound pretentious , because the movie does n't feel pretentious at all , but what i 'm saying is true.<br /><br />Also Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the lead . It 's a shame really that she has become stuck in the " tough girl " typecasting now , because that 's really not what her part in " Girlfight " is all about . Sure she 's a female boxer , but rather it 's the more sensitive moments that really makes her shine.<br /><br />So maybe this is basically your average underdog story with a twist , but it 's lifted way above the crowd by Rodriguez ' performance . I rate this 7/10 .
1 Michelle Rodriguez is the defining actress who could be the charging force for other actresses to look out for . She has the audacity to place herself in a rarely seen tough - girl role very early in her career ( and pull it off ) , which is a feat that should be recognized . Although her later films pigeonhole her to that same role , this film was made for her ruggedness.<br /><br />Her character is a romanticized student / fighter / lover , struggling to overcome her disenchanted existence in the projects , which is a little overdone in film ... but not by a girl . That aspect of this film is n't very original , but the story goes in depth when the heated relationships that this girl has to deal with come to a boil and her primal rage takes over.<br /><br />I have n't seen an actress take such an aggressive stance in movie - making yet , and I 'm glad that she 's getting that original twist out there in Hollywood . This film got a 7 from me because of the average story of ghetto youth , but it has such a great actress portraying a rarely - seen role in a minimal budget movie . Great work .
1 At first glance I expected this film to be crappy because I thought the plot would be so excessively feminist . But I was wrong . As you maybe have read in earlier published comments , I agree in that the feminist part in this film does not bother . I never had the idea that the main character was exaggerating her position as a woman . It 's like Guzman is presented as somebody with a spine , this in contrast to her classmates . So I was surprised by the story , in fact , I thought it was quite good , except for the predictable end . Maybe it would 've been a better idea to give the plot a radical twist , so that the viewer is somewhat more surprised.<br /><br />In addition , I 'd like to say that Rodriguez earned her respect by the way she put away her character . I ca n't really explain why , but especially in the love scenes she convinced me . It just looked real I think.<br /><br />I gave it a 7 out of 10 , merely because of the dull last half hour .
1 This movie is a real gem . The arc of the the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes , the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn , their motives completely believable . The dialogue is fresh , and oh so real . The situations are unique to the characters and not at all cliched or hackneyed . Until the climax , that is . Then it 's as if the movie went off the rails a bit and it got a bit hokey and unbelievable . But I do n't want to discourage people from watching this film . The first 3/4 's of it are truly remarkable . I gave it an 8 . There are some remarkable performances here . Check out this movie .
1 Being a person who does not usually enjoy boxing movies , feeling they only focus on the boxing and not the characters themselves , this movie truly moved me . I loved being able to see the main character Diana(Michelle Rodriguez ) go through so many things in such a short while , it was amazing to me . Michelle ( Rodriguez ) did such a wonderful job playing Diana especially since this was her first acting experience , she showed true emotion and portrayed Diana wonderfully . All actors had chemistry on screen and made this movie even more amazing . I highly recommend this movie even to those who do not usually watch boxing movies . 10/10
1 ( spoilers)<br /><br />I was blown away by this movie . I 've been renting on movielink for a bit , and decided to check this movie out . Alot of boxing movies seem to overblow the blood . In this movie , it shows it at the amature level . Though I do wish that perhaps more attention would have been brought to perhaps her improving her grades . The movie points out the problems some families face with gender.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned with the ending . But the ending was n't a disappointment either.<br /><br />I think it was pretty clear by the title that she 'd win . What was unexpected was that the two of them got back together sort of at the end.<br /><br />Loved the score for some of the scenes . Highly recommended.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />Quality : 9/10<br /><br />Entertainment : 10/10<br /><br />Replayable : 10/10
1 I finally sat down and saw this film the whole way through , and I must say , I was very impressed . Michelle Rodriguez is probably one of my new favorite actresses --- it 's not only the fact that she * can * act , but that she chooses the roles best suited to her that are more meaningful and important than what would first seem . I 've read a few comments expressing their relief that this was not some awful feminist thing as they thought beforehand , but I certainly disagree . Diana is a feminist . She follows her dreams and believes in herself contrary to what practically everyone around her thinks ( with the exception of her caring brother Tiny and her trainer and manager , Hector , who proves to be more a father figure than her real parent ) , which is what the word " Feminism " is all about . It 's good to see films like this showcasing the true side of feminism -- that they 're not a bunch of manhating losers -- but that they have dreams and can do anything . Diana is true to herself while still falling prey to love , and she and Adrian have a more realistic , complicated relationship rather than just something that magically works out . Girlfight is a true taste of reality and it put some faith back into my perception of people . Thanks , Michelle.<br /><br />8/10 - A very important movie that 's relatable to not just young women , but everyone wanting to go far in their lives .
1 This movie has made me want to become a director , and Michelle Rodriguez is brilliant . How the hell was n't she on mtv 's top 25 under 25 , she beats them all . This film definitely deserved the grand jury prize at sundance , best film i have ever seen .
1 Michelle Rodrigez was made for this movie , when I first saw her in Fast and the Furious . You could tell that she was a tough woman . With this movie , she has not only proven her acting , but shows no fear and is tough like she should be in this movie . She is more a bad girl and that 's what I like about her . This movie is about a troubled girl , living the life as a tom boy and getting in constant trouble with school and family . As she gets interested in her brothers training to be a boxer , she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her brothers trainer to train her . Even though they do n't think she has the potential , they get to be shown proven wrong.<br /><br / > I think this movie was a little slow at the ending , but was well done . It shows , that people can do anything even if they do n't think you have the potential . I recommend it to be seen .
1 Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana , a high school girl with an insolent scowl and 2 x 4 on her shoulder . She 's ready to battle anyone , especially her father who is paying for her brother 's boxing lessons . Diana decides boxing would be a good way of focusing her anger.<br /><br />I liked the relationship between Diana and Adrian . Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent . Watch how their emotions towards each other are shaped by the squared circle .
1 Another powerful chick flick . This time , it revolves around Diana Gusman who is always getting into fights at school . Instead of getting expelled , she takes her anger elsewhere , to the boxing ring . She trains to be a boxer and there she meets featherweight Adrian and begins to fall in love with him . This movie has a powerful message of taking your dreams and going with them even if someone does n't believe in you ( in this case , her dad does n't believe in her ) . That alone makes the movie worth the price . Enjoy
1 I never bothered to see this movie in theaters although I remember hearing the name over and over . I finally watched it this week and what a delight . For some reason , I was expecting it to not be very good so I was completely surprised when I sat down and stuck with it and then found myself completely pulled in . I read a lot of the other user comments and it impressed me how much people talk about her fighting in the ring , but what was wonderful about Diana is that she 's a true fighter in life . All she needs to do is find her place where she be who she is and the ring helps her to get there . A very intelligent story and I 'm amazed that this is the first time up for Michelle Rodriguez - what an excellent job she did . Adrian and her coach were also quite good.<br /><br />This film is a little rough around the edges , but it does n't matter in the slightest . The story , the will , and the performances completely outweigh any flaws ( that usually come with indie filmmaking anyway ) . A compelling portrayal of a girl finding herself and triumphing over her circumstances and a K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez !
1 I just saw this movie the other day when I rented it , and I thought this was going to be just another movie with a girl trying to prove a point , but Diane joined boxing because she wanted to . I thought this movie was good . I gave it a 8/10 . That 's how good it is . Plus a movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good . Even is she 's been in only six .
1 I enjoyed this movie , and after watching it , it made me wonder just how many ' Caitlin Rose 's ' exist in the world . How many other girls have been subjected to this sort of sexual abuse , and torment by classmates and have been too frightened to open their mouth about it ? Just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another , because as this film demonstrates , who 's right is not foremost important , its who is popular , and feared which manipulates the minds of youths , and influences them to allow this sort of immorality to happen . Tiffani Amber Thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim , and Brian Austin Green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved , and his best friend . This is the kind of film that does n't get the exposure it deserves . Remarkable , and brilliant , too good to be just a film made for TV .
1 When I saw this movie , I was amazed that it was only a TV movie . I think this movie should have been in theaters . I have seen many movies that are about rape , but this one stands out . This movie has a kind of realism that is very rarely found in movies today , let alone TV movies . It tells a story that I 'm sure is very realistic to many rape victims in small towns today , and I found it to be very believable(which is something hard to find in other rape centered movies ) . I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were awesome in the parts that they played . I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that have a bit of a harsh reality to them . I enjoyed it very much .
1 I really like this film ... when I started to watch it I thought I would get bored pretty soon , but it surprised me ... I thought it was a great film and have seen it a few times now . The characters are believable and I have to say that I fell in love with Brian Austin Green all over again ( the first time being Beverly Hills 90210 ) . I would recommend this film if you are a fan of his , but I do agree with another comment made earlier , that the ending is sort of disappointing . I would have loved it to turn out a little different ! Never mind though , good gripping story .
1 I first saw this when it premiered more than ten years ago . I saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me . She Fought Alone is about a girl , Caitlin ( played by Tiffani Thiessen ) , who is raped by Jace ( played by David Lipper ) , a classmate who enjoys hurting girls . Caitlin is in a popular high school clique , but when she reveals she is raped the clique turns against her , led by Ethan ( played by Brian Austin Green).<br /><br />This movie chronicles Caitlin 's struggle against an entire town , including a high school that essentially lets athletes determine the social environment , allowing them to get away with whatever they wish.<br /><br />Thiessen and Green are the top performers , and there is real chemistry between the two of the them throughout the entire film . All of the actors in this film , which was inspired by actual events , did a great job . She Fought Alone really captures the essence of what it is like to be in high school ( at least in 1995 ) , and having one 's self - esteem and reputation at stake . Recommended . 10/10
1 Excellent story about teenagers , leaders , high school football " stars " . How far will you go to protect your friends ? Lie , kill ? How much can You lose if you stud by an innocent girl ? Can love beat the odds ? Can you defeat narrow - minded small town people ? When your friend scores and you " lose " , will you do everything in your power to make her pay for it , or will you be a man about it , and respect her right to chose ? Will you rape her and show it as your victory over a " problem " girl ? Can you stand by the one who 's only sin is to have an opinion of her own , to be able to make her own decisions , to chose for herself ? It made me think twice before giving my judgment about who was right and who was wrong , but one is for sure - very disturbing movie and theme in general . Thumb up !
1 my name is Heather and i am the girl whose story this movie was based on . I want to thank all of you who saw this movie and enjoyed it . as crude and harsh as some of the things that were depicted in this movie were , it did n't really even come close to describing how bad things actually were . not to mention the affect everything had on my mother and little sister . thanks once again for the great comments that everyone had , i truly appreciate them < br /><br />Hi everyone!<br /><br />This is Heather 's mom . It 's hard to believe that so many years have gone by since this movie was made . Harder even to believe that people were still watching it a year ago . For any of you out there who have gone thru the same or similar kind of situation , please know that there are people out here in cyberspace that do understand completely how you feel . Our thoughts and prayers are with each and every one of you .
1 Most people know Paul Verhoeven as the director of many good ( and bad ) sci - fi movies in Hollywood . But long before that he was churning out generic thrillers in his native land . The story is a basic femme fatale premise , nothing new or enthralling . Verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding in a series of dream sequences , which instead of defining our main character and his situation , are just used as a way to drive forward the predictable plot . The screenplay was solid , the dialogue helping to pad the effects of the bland story . What really made the movie at at least good was some terrific acting . Jereone Krabbe was amazing as the " tortured artist " , and the supporters were very good as well . Also , Jan De Bont 's cinematography adds at least some life to the film , helping to make Verhoeven look at least capable as a director.<br /><br />6.5/10<br /><br / > * * 1/2 / * * * *
1 THE FOURTH MAN ( Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983).<br /><br />A film based on a novella by Gerard Reve , that works best as a thriller . That 's quite surprising , considering Reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work.<br /><br />"The Fourth Man " is top - heavy on symbolism . Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and I 'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove . He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way , he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline , and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out . In " The Fourth Man " he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity ( of which there 's plenty ) but , as in most of his films , he seems afraid the audience would n't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes . There 's hardly a scene without sex or full - frontal nudity , most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face , it undermines an otherwise good story . < br /><br />Nevertheless , when you can cope with Verhoeven 's pretty obvious satiric approach , it 's quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round , Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabbé in particular.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 7/10
1 Back in the forties , when movies touched on matters not yet admissible in " polite " society , they resorted to codes which supposedly floated over the heads of most of the audience while alerting those in the know to just what was up . Probably no film of the decade was so freighted with innuendo as the oddly obscure Desert Fury , set in a small gambling oasis called Chuckawalla somewhere in the California desert . Proprietress of the Purple Sage saloon and casino is the astonishing Mary Astor , in slacks and sporting a cigarette holder ; into town drives her handful - of - a - daughter , Lizabeth Scott , looking , in Technicolor , like 20-million bucks . But listen to the dialogue between them , which suggests an older Lesbian and her young , restless companion ( one can only wonder if A.I. Bezzerides ' original script made this relationship explicit ) . Even more blatant are John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey as his insanely jealous torpedo . Add Burt Lancaster as the town sheriff , stir , and sit back . Both Lancaster and ( surprisingly ) Hodiak fall for Scott . It seems , however , that Hodiak not only has a past with Astor , but had a wife who died under suspicious circumstances . The desert sun heats these ingredients up to a hard boil , with face - slappings aplenty and empurpled exchanges . Do n't pass up this hothouse melodrama , chock full of creepily exotic blooms , if it comes your way ; it 's a remarkable movie .
1 Extremely interesting and intriguing movie . The similarities to David Lynch ( who is even quoted literally by the presence of red curtains in the film ) and the novels of Franz Kafka ( the house keeper in this film is called Mrs. Grubach , as is the one in Der Prozess ... ) are clearly present but in this case are accompanied by clear references to the colonial past of Belgium in Africa . The exact content of the movie I can not clearly describe : this colonialism is an important part , as is the inability to cope with such a past , but the personal memories of the main character are a central issue as well , and his quest for social contact and love . These are the symbolic themes I deduced from the movie , but in fact they 're no more than impressions.<br /><br />But even if you just try to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds , you still will discover an extremely fascinating movie filled with splendid imagery ( beautiful close ups of beatles , larvas and other nasty insects are alternated with great dream sequences and also the dark atmosphere lends the film extra style ) . Maybe you can say that I did n't quite ' get ' the film , but I have been watching like hypnothised for 1.5 hour , deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mysteriosity .
1 This film is amazing - it 's just like a nightmare . The bizarre story , the dark decors , the swarming insects everywhere , the idea jumps and the surrealistic dreams ... Really great ! People who love cult movies or very dark thrillers will find this fantastic . It seems a little to the films of David Lynch : the strange story , the bizarre dreams , the red curtains . Nuit Noire contains almost no plot . It 's rather a succession of surrealistic happenings , nightmares and meetings . That 's a drawback . If the film had a really fascinating plot full of tension with a captivating denouement , I would give it a 10 out of 10 . But that 's missing , and that 's why I gave the movie an 8 . Nuit Noire is a film worth watching . Search that DVD and you 'll be rewarded !
1 A great film ! Slow : YES.<br /><br /> ... but original , deeply atmospheric , dark and horrifying , perfectly SURREAL ( feels like a nightmare).<br /><br />I'd compare it to David Lynch ( Eraserhead , Inland Empire , Blue Velvet ) style maybe with mixed with a little bit of Barton Fink and Naked Lunch ( Insects ! ) . Also a bit of Jodorowsky ( Fando y Lis) .... <br /><br />Add some Night on Earth , Angel Heart and a bit of Begotten , Pi , ( would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo ? ) Jacob 's Ladder , Barker 's The Forbidden and Salome - that should form together at least the concept of a dark night ... NUIT NOIRE.<br /><br />If you 're out for avantegardistic and/or surrealistic cinema ( like I am ) you 're gon na like this one . If you 're expecting anything else like a movie full of action with some average plot - try your luck with something else.<br /><br />Final words : The plot is very , very strange and unusual and that 's probably the # 1 reason why most people who do n't appreciate this film hate it .
1 I ca n't believe others took such a serious view of all this . God , it was a lot of fun rooting for Hop - a - long Cassidy . It was a great tribute to the Western serials of years ago . It was n't meant to be a great cinema experience , except it was . So what if there was n't a big special effects bonanza . It was a fun , tongue in cheek , look at old Western 's . Man , relax and enjoy .
1 Late one night on a desolate road , in an empty saloon Martin Sheen spins a yarn for Robert Carradine of Hopalong Cassidy and friends tracking a group of murderous cattle rustlers , who 've killed a few men and kidnapped Cassidy 's girl.<br /><br />Writer / director Christopher Coppola May have incurred the wrath of William Boyd purists by daring to make a modern low budget film featuring their beloved Hoppy , but I 'm glad he did it ! No character should be so tied to an an actor that no one else ever be allowed to play him or her again!<br /><br />I thought it was good fun and an interesting updating of the classic programmers of the thirties and forties . Though guilty of some bad acting , this is earnest enough and unpretentious , making it hard for me to dislike.<br /><br />The whole production is a bit odd though , but I really enjoyed the scenes between Sheen and Carridine . The fact that we 're watching a story within a story makes the oddness and exaggerations more palatable .
1 This an free adaptation of the novels of Clarence Mulford ; fans of the Willaim Boyd films will probably feel a little at sea here ( and the reviews here so far reflect that ) . But I knew of Hopalong from the novels first , and never cared much for the Boyd films once I got around to them.<br /><br />Christopher Coppola has made a wise choice - he has not made a nostalgic " Western " ; instead , he has approached the Cassidy story as a slice of what we used to call ' Americana ' ; or what older critics once called ' homespun ' . As the film unraveled , I found myself more and more reminded of the great " Hallmark Theater " version of Mark Twain 's " Roughing It " , with James Garner narrating.<br /><br />Both these films remind us that , although films about the ' old west ' are probably always to be mythic for Americans , they need not be ' westerns ' ; they can very well be just films about what it meant to be American in that time , in that place.<br /><br />I never feel pandered to , watching this film ; there 's no effort to shove the Boyd - Cassidy legacy down our throats , no irony , no camp . Consequently , I get a sense of these characters as having walked - or ridden horseback - across some real western America I too could have walked a hundred years ago.<br /><br />Given that , the plainness of the film - it positively avoids anything we have come to call " style " - is all to its favor ; and the plain acting of the performers fits neatly in with this ; gosh , it really does feel like some story told around a campfire on a cattle drive - no visual dressing , just the quirks and good humor - and sudden violence - that we expect from the good narration of an adventure yarn . I was very pleasantly surprised by this film , and if the viewer sets aside encultured expectations , he or she will find considerable pleasure in it.<br /><br />I would have given this film 9-stars , but I 'll give it a ten just because most reviewers here have missed the point completely ; and I urge them to set their memories of Boyd aside and give this film another chance.<br /><br />Note 1 : A reviewer complained that Hopalong shoots people dead in this film , rather than shooting the guns out of their hands ( ala Boyd 's Cassidy ) ; first , Cassidy DOES shoot people dead in the novels ; second , if Cassidy were a real cowboy he would have shot people dead - the problem with shooting guns out of people 's hands is that they can always get another gun - which happens to be part of the subtext of this very film.<br /><br />Note 2 : I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family , that they have the Director of " The Godfather " among them who can get them all opportunities to make movies that I ca n't ; but a good movie is a good movie ; and this is a good movie . If it 's by somebody by the name " Coppola " , well , that 's just is as it is . America is the land of opportunity ( or was , until Bush got into office ) - that 's what the great American novels are all about .
1 The first time my best friend and I sat down to watch this movie , we were watching it for Alex Winter of " Bill & Ted 's " fame . We did n't know what to expect other than who and what it was about.<br /><br />By the time the movie was over , we knew that it was love at first sight . This movie , while not completely historically accurate , was and is the best one of its genre . I have seen other movies depicting the history of this famous summer and in my opinion , none of the others can compare . It fibbed a little at certain details , but those parts did not take away from the sheer elegance and romance of the story . I have seen the other movies about this summer and I find most of them to be good , but none as captivating as this one.<br /><br />"Haunted Summer " has the qualities of a painting . The colors and settings seem to be something one would find on a canvas , framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric 's home . The costumes were gorgeous and , despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world , made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself . The whole movie was set on the picturesque Lake Geneva ( where I hope to one day go because of seeing this movie ) and the serenity that these historical figures found there.<br /><br />This movie shows , besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of England 's harsh judgements , the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well . Yes , there were drugs . It was a fairly common practice during that time , a time when drugs were not illegal . And the taking of laudanum ( the liquid form of opium ) was medicinal as well as recreational . Shelley suffered from consumption . Lord Byron suffered the pains of a clubbed foot . It was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer . And they were poets during a time when experience was the key . There was no time for prudish caution . Passion and experience were a big part of the Romantic Era . And out of the thoughts and discussions of science , religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend : " Frankenstein." < br /><br />Yes , in this movie , we see the beautiful and liberated Mary Godwin ( not married to Shelley at that time ) played by beautiful and talented Alice Krige . She is the control factor to all that goes on until she , too , gives in to experience . But she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms . As was the strength that she inherited from her mother and father.<br /><br />The actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played . The music fitting . The direction captured the essence of the summer , as I 've read about it . This movie was based on a wonderful book " Haunted Summer " by Anne Edwards . If you like this movie , read the book . The author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of Mary Godwin Shelley and the other participants of this story.<br /><br />If you are a person who loves history ( even the little inaccuracies from time to time ) and romance and the gothic , then this is a movie for you . It shows the birth of the birth of the monster , which even today teaches us about the morals of " playing God." < br /><br />A definite must see movie !
1 In this glorious telling of a weekend shared among literary greats . Mary and Percy Shelly , Lord Byron and others created a entrancing group . Showing their quests for sexual enlightenment . Personal freedoms from political to moral . Liberal drug use for both stimulations and as addiction . Their creative views of life and writing . Describing without boring the viewer how each writer seeks to find their muse . Along with the distractions and affections each share . With breathtaking scenery that does not detract but very much enhances the story . Well created characters from grim to loving then angry to peaceful . With some of the most lovely and scene enhancing costuming to be had .
1 I would love to comment on this film . Alas , my search has always endeth in vain . If any good citizen could help a desperate inhabitant of this ailing planet and restore his confidence in humanity by offering the whereabouts of either a UK VHS or loan him a DVD copy of the VHS ; he would , without reservation , be eternally grateful ..... < br /><br />Blake wrote " The road to excess is the path to wisdom " , one hopes my weary road of excess will offer the path to fruition .... If not , I will have to replay the excellent Mr Russel 's Gothic in the knowledge that those who have seen Haunted Summer ( for better or for worse ) have enriched their viewing pleasure of the events of July 1816 whilst I , a fellow member of this melodious plot , rests his lonely case in solitude ...
1 I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about- this was a wonderful movie , and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel . The characters are truly young , Mary is a strong match for Byron , Claire is juvenile and a tad annoying , Polidori is a convincing beaten - down sycophant ... all are beautiful , curious , and decadent ... not the frightening wrecks they are in Gothic.<br /><br />Gothic works as an independent piece of shock film , and I loved it for different reasons , but this works like a Merchant and Ivory film , and was from my readings the best capture of what the summer must have felt like . Romantic , yes , but completely rekindles my interest in the lives of Shelley and Byron every time I think about the film . One of my all - time favorites .
1 I love Korean films because they have the ability to really ( quiet eerily really ) capture real life . I tend to watch Korean movies just for that reason alone . I 've seen this directors other movies before . The one that comes closest to the feelings I got from this is Oasis and another awesome film called This Charming Girl.<br /><br />However , my title summary is supposed to be from a Chrstian perspective so I 'll just start doing that instead of just showering it with praise.<br /><br />For a non Christian perspective Director Chang - dong Lee has captured an unbiased and almost eerily real portrayal of a modern Protestant church ( regardless of denomination ) warts and all . I 've always been waiting for a Christian film that truly portrays the darker recesses of church life . Because Christian films tend to speak in a language that is different to those they want to share their faith to . Many films with religious undertones , though having good motives , tend to just have the resonance of a Disney film or after school special . They need to show life as it is . Real people curse , real people lust , real people fall . And though Christians believe that salvation is available to those that seek it , we are still challenged by the everyday horrors of this life . And Do - yeon Jeon 's character is a totally honest and almost brutal portrayal of a woman that found God , but because of life 's bitter realities , loses that love for Him she once had . She does n't deny God exists . It is just that she refuses to accept to live with the idea that He is an all loving and forgiving God.<br /><br />In her decent to the edges of morality and madness , her character asks questions that are in the mind of every one , religious or not.<br /><br />"If God is Love , why does He allow such terrible things to happen ? " This film does n't answer that , rightly so . And I believe the last 10 minutes of the film , though open to interpretation , leaves us with a hopeful future for our main character and brings the idea of " secret sunshine " full circle.<br /><br />I do n't believe for a second that this film tried to be religious or had in any way tried and set out to be that . There in lies the reason why it worked even more . It 's real , it 's honest . And because of that , it is by far the best summation of a real Christian life I have seen on film .
1 A young woman comes to the home town of his husband after he passed away in an accident . She barely settles down in this small town , but shortly after , loses her little son in a kidnapping and all her hopes ... This could lead to all kinds following plots in a normal movie : find a new partner and being happy finally ; or depressed enough to struggle and finally kill herself ... She does try to kill herself , but not after a series of severe fights , with God . She trusts in God , only to find that God seems to forgive everyone , even the killer . Well , I should be careful here about God , the movie does n't mean a thing against God . The way the movie deals the issue is quite interesting : not in the woman 's point of view or from God 's perspective ( in this way , there would be lots of grass growing , clouds flying views , I suppose ) . Rather , it 's from a third party 's eye , the movie let us to perceive and does n't explain a thing.<br /><br />The movie would n't be so interesting were there only the woman . There 's this man who 's everywhere around the woman and obviously in love with her , but in his own way . He 's a funny guy , like a clown I should say , who shamelessly hangs around our heroine . The combination of these two , the woman full of tension , crying and throwing up always , and the man , smiling and talking stupidly , ends up in a good balance of emotions : nothing absurdly wrong or too tedious.<br /><br />Highly recommend .
1 I did not intend to write this review , but having read the default review that shows up on this movie 's URL , I felt compelled to write a rebuttal . The movie in a word is superlative . It does not deserve the slanderous review that the writer has written . I think the writer has totally missed the point of the movie to a large extent . In fact , I too was turned off by the excessive show of Evangelist devotions that occupied the middle of the movie to a large extent . However , I must beg to differ with the reviewer in that , this movie in the end is not a propaganda piece for evangelist action . I think , what the director has shown is that how religion is not enough to find all the answers , how religion is to a large extent incapable of providing answers to basic , simple questions that one may ask and all that religion has to offer is sometimes just banal platitudes of one kind or another . This does not demonstrate a value judgment on religion as we have to remember that religion is transmuted and expressed by ordinary , mostly well meaning , basically good people and they usually have no monopoly on truth and thus religion can not in the end provide the ultimate answers to some questions in life . Ultimately , it is a matter of faith . You have to take it on faith and that 's all . And if you are given to faith , then you can appreciate any show of faith . And if you are not given to faith then any show of faith is tiresome . It is thus at the same time , instructive to note the reviewer reaction to the movie . In any case , the director shows us that one can choose not to accept the religious interpretation of events and answers to questions and in spite of that life goes on and there are ' secret sunshine ' in this world that awaits all wounded souls , regardless of their religious orientation . And that 's just the core message of the film ! Please note the last scene of the movie , if you do n't get this ! In the end , the movie is a great one and very thought provoking and confronts you - the viewer with questions that you have to answer for yourself . Thus it is a work of art that is challenging to you personally . I do agree with the reviewer in that , the Evangelical stuff was a bit too much . However , given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie , I think the director was trying to balance the act whereby he might not be called an Evangelist  basher ! The actor Kang - ho Song was great as always . He 's so balanced and just perfect that he 's just amazing . He 's my favorite Korean actor no doubt . I know the actress Do - yeon Jeon got the Cannes award for best actress for this movie . However , I did not find any specialty in her acting . It seems that to get awards you just have to act really convincingly in crying and hysterical scenes and all   All in all a great movie . If you do n't like it  please watch it again and see if you get it ! If it leaves you dissatisfied or uncomfortable or asking questions then think , if that was not what the director was actually aiming at through this movie in the first place !
1 I saw this film in the worst possible circumstance . I 'd already missed 15 minutes when I woke up to it on an international flight between Sydney and Seoul . I did n't know what I was watching , I thought maybe it was a movie of the week , but quickly became riveted by the performance of the lead actress playing a young woman who 's child had been kidnapped . The premise started taking twist and turns I did n't see coming and by the end credits I was scrambling through the the in - flight guide to figure out what I had just watched . Turns out I was belatedly discovering Do - yeon Jeon who 'd won Best Actress at Cannes for the role . I do n't know if Secret Sunshine is typical of Korean cinema but I 'm off to the DVD store to discover more .
1 Lee Chang - dong 's exceptional " Secret Sunshine " is the single most emotionally ravaging experience of the year . It is an instantly sobering , brutally honest character piece on the reverberations of loss and a graceful memento mori that resonates with a striking density of thought , yet remains as inscrutable as the emotions it observes . Through its layered naturalism and stunningly trenchant view of small - town dynamics , Lee implicitly deconstructs the traditional Korean melodrama by pulling apart the cinematics of excess and ripping to shreds the arcs that shape its characters and grounds the proceedings into a crushing grind of stoic realism.<br /><br />"Secret Sunshine " remains an immensely compelling , fluid work throughout its 142-minute runtime . Its bravura first hour is filled to the brim with subtextual insinuations , remarkable foreshadowing and adroit reversals of tone brought about by humanistic capriciousness . Adapted from a short story , Lee infuses the film with his sensitivity for the sublime paradoxes of life , last seen in his transgressively comic and irreverent " Oasis " . Understanding how personal revolutions are forged when views of our universe are changed , Lee not only sees the emotional cataclysm of a widow 's sorrow through an inquiring scope but also feels the tumultuous existential currents that underpin the film when religion becomes a narrative scapegoat in comprehending the heinousness of the human experience.<br /><br />Do - yeon Jeon 's ( " You Are My Sunshine " ) Best Actress accolade at Cannes in 2007 is well deserved . Her performance as the widow Shin - ae remains an unrelenting enigma . As a character pulled apart by forces beyond her control , the sheer magnificence of this performance is central to the film 's turbulent nature . With Jeon essaying one cyclonic upheaval after another , there 's a tremulous sense of collapse that the film , to its credit , never approaches . Instead it finds a delicate balance that saps the charged theatricality and subsequent banality from ordinary tragedies and its fallouts . She becomes the centre of the film 's universe as well as ours . Filmed in glorious hand - held CinemaScope , the film demolishes the cinematicism of frames and compositions by becoming visually acute just as it is quietly harrowing when the camera never relinquishes its gaze from Shin - ae through times of happiness , guilt and remorse.<br /><br />Lee captures the details of life in the small , suspicious town of Miryang  the awkwardness of communal situations , its uncomfortable silences and its devastations spun out of personal dramas . Shin - ae 's interactions with the townsfolk rarely inspires dividends , especially when they are merely done out of obligation to fit in for the sake of her son , Jun ( Seon Jung - yeop ) . The one recurring acquaintance is Jong - chan ( Song Kang - ho ) , a bachelor mechanic of uncertain intentions who helps her en route to Miryang in the film 's enchanting open sequence set to a captivating stream of sunlight . Song has situated himself as a comedic anti - hero in South Korea 's biggest films but his nuanced , low - key delivery here purports the director 's thought process of never having to reveal more than plainly necessary.<br /><br />If pain is ephemeral , then grief can never truly dissipate . And Lee finds complexity in subsistence . When Shin - ae attempts to head down the path of reconciliation only to be faced again with unimaginable heartbreak , she unsuccessfully employs the fellowship of evangelical Christianity as a foil to her sorrow . But Lee knows better than that when he understands that religion , in the context of the human canvas of strife and misery , is never a simple solution . But Lee never rebukes the essence of religion as he realises the value of salvation for some through a higher power even if it serves a form of denial in others . The scenes in its latter half which deal with religion does n't allow itself to become aggressively scornful , which is a feat in itself considering how many filmmakers let the momentum of the material take over from what they need to say to be true to its story and characters.<br /><br />Lee 's first film since his call to office as his country 's Minister of Culture and Tourism is an uncompromising dissertation on human suffering . In a film so artless and genuine , it arduously reveals that there 's nothing as simple as emotional catharsis , just the suppression and abatement of agony . " Secret Sunshine " leaves us with tender mercies pulled out of evanescence , and points towards a profound understanding of despair and faith .
1 Secret Sunshine ( 2007 ) is famous for its awards at the Festival de Cannes in 2007 and other film festivals . Jeon - Do Yeon , who played the newly widowed Shin - ae , won the best actress trophy at the 60th Cannes festival . Secret Sunshine was also a winner of best feature film and Jeon - Do Yeon received a best actress nod from Asia Pacific Screen Awards . In addition , this movie won the best film awards in virtually all Korean film festivals . Masterfully written and directed , and uniquely photographed , Secret Sunshine expressed the hope and salvation that can be found when life is painful because of continuous tragedy . This film also talked about the forgiveness of God and people . Lee Chang Dong , director and writer of this movie , said in an interview , " In a vast sense , I wanted to express what love is and this movie could be a melodrama in a sense . Without love , we ca n't talk about hope and salvation . " Lee acknowledged that Secret Sunshine had no apparent genre . This movie is not a movie about religion , but it drew attention from many Christians in Korea because there were a lot of Christian elements in the movie.<br /><br />The turning point in Secret Sunshine comes when Jun , Shin - ae 's son , is kidnapped and killed . The kidnapper asks for money because he presumes that since she can buy land , she must be rich . Her lie causes much sorrow.<br /><br />Shin - ae becomes a church - goer and wants to forgive the murderer . She decides to visit her son 's murderer in prison and forgive him . Jong - chan , Shin - ae 's guy friend , says , " Just forgive in your heart . Do you have to go to the prison ? " Her church fellows cheer for her and say they will pray for her . Her pastor agrees with what she wants to do . That is a sad moment because it is too early for her to do an action . The result of the meeting with the murderer is another turning point in Shin - ae 's life . The murderer says with a peaceful smile that he has already been forgiven by God . This sparks anger in her toward God . She says , " How could You forgive the man before I forgive ? " < br /><br />She begins to fight against God . She looks up to the sky and proclaims , " I wo n't lose to You . " She becomes a snare , her heart is a trap , and her hands are chains . It is more bitter than death . She becomes crazier and crazier and is sent to a mental hospital . On the day Shin - ae is discharged from the hospital , she goes to a beauty shop and sees a familiar face . The daughter of her son 's murderer works in the shop and cuts her hair . The murderer 's daughter has helped kidnapped Shin - ae 's son . While she cuts Shin - ae 's hair , the protagonist ca n't understand what 's going on and gets out of the shop quickly.<br /><br />It is difficult not to talk about Jong - chan in the movie . Jong - chan does his best to be by Shin - ae 's side . Although Shin - ae does n't care about him at all , he is beside her all the time . Shin - ae leaves church quickly , but Jong - chan , who started attending church because of Shin - ae , stays there because he feels peace with God . Lee Chang - dong , the director of Secret Sunshine , says that Jong - chan is like Milyang ( secret sunshine ) , the rural city or vice versa . He seems to " be too secular and frivolous , but he is always two steps behind her and takes care of her . Milyang is like him . " Mr. Lee adds , " Someone joked that Jong - chan could be an angel . I think that he could be the angel . Who knows ? We ca n't say for sure that there is no angel . " If there is a person like Jong - chan who forever accompanies his lover 's twists and turns , we can defend ourselves against the overpowered . The life of Shin - ae is full of meaninglessness . Her husband died after he cheated on her , and her only son was killed cruelly by a murderer after she moved to her husband 's hometown . And her soul was damaged because she learned Christianity in a wrong wayand that makes her crazy , literally . It is too easy to say that her life is filled with meaninglessness . Does she still have hope in her life ? Can she find meaning in her life ? The final scene gives us hope . Shin - ae tries to cut her hair by herself : we walk our life 's journey by ourselves . She , however , realizes that it is hard to do it by herself , and we know that we ca n't do everything by ourselves . We see Jong - chan holding the mirror for her while she cuts her hair . That 's her hope . She has Jong - chan beside her and he is willing to help her in whatever situation she is . As I mentioned earlier , Jong - chan is like an angel for her . If we feel that an angel is always beside and behind us , we can find joy in life even though we face adversity in our lives . < br /><br />Secret Sunshine was a hot topic of conversation in Korea . It is like Da Vinci Code . While Da Vinci Code helps us discuss the early church history , Secret Sunshine prompts us to deal with life 's messiness and find meaning when life seems unbearable . With a shallow interpretation of the movie , people misunderstand Christianity and its theology . With a deeper interpretation , this movie will help us see beneath the surface . Some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched Secret Sunshine , and Lee Chang - dong responds by saying , " They were already anti - Christ before they watched this movie . Secret Sunshine is a life story of a woman and we can interpret our life through Shin - ae 's life .
1 This is a story about Shin - ae , who moves to Milyang from Seoul with her young son Jun to start over after the accidental death of her husband . Her husband was born here , and she is opening up a piano school , but also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from the death . If that is what the film was about , it probably would have been like a Hollywood film , with her falling for some local guy and being happy with her son in their new home . But , this is not Hollywood . Her son gets kidnapped and murdered , ostensibly because it is known she has cash from the settlement . The grief process , attempts at moving on , attempts to clear her conscience of guilt , are all done admirably , and the lead actress is superb . The only caveat , and it has to be stated , is that this is a depressing film . You have to know that going in . You want Shin - ae to go through her grief and find some measure of happiness . Again , this is not Hollywood , it is Korea and in Korean cinema , especially drama , they pull no punches . Life is what happens to you . Great acting , but sometimes a tough film to watch , due to the goings on . If you stay , you 'll be rewarded . Do that .
1 I 've waited to see this movie for a long time and at last I could manage to see it in Istanbul Film Festival . Maybe because I expected too much from this film and that 's why i was slightly disappointed . I was not the best movie from Korea but still it is really worth watching.<br /><br />The subject was nice and the film makes you keep watching without getting bored though it is long . But there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another . However , the acting of Jeon Do - Yeon is incredibly beautiful . It was was one of the best performances in the early cinema history and I think this movie would n't be that nice if she was not in the leading role .
1 Secret Sunshine marks the return of director Lee Changdong to the film - making world after a multi - year absence . Having three critically acclaimed films already under his belt , he recruits now veteran thespian Jeon Doyeon and her considerable ( Cannes - winning ) talents for the primary role of Lee Shinae . What follows is a journey through one woman 's tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanisms.<br /><br />One of the things that becomes apparent while watching Secret Sunshine is that it does n't really care to follow any specific genre , but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what it 's trying to convey . The story itself follows Lee Shinae as she moves with her son to the city of Milyang ( whose Sino - Corean translates to Secret Sunshine ) . She moves to Milyang in the aftermath of the death of her husband as it was his hometown , so the film is born from tragedy . And you think things might just get better as she opens up a piano shop and encounters a bit of a bumbling nice - guy mechanic Jongchan ( played by Song Kangho ) . But this is n't a romantic comedy.<br /><br />As we ( and Jongchan , doggedly ) follow Shinae as she encounters Milyang and the fate that it has in store for her , the cracks in her armor quickly become apparent . She is a troubled woman trying to grasp onto her own strength to overcome tragedy and we watch as she finds that it 's not enough . Secret Sunshine still manages to follow a mostly Aristotelian dramatic arc , but pulls back on the catharsis , which might confound some viewers , especially the ending , but the novelistic symbolism present in the name of Milyang , the discussions of sunshine and the imagery used in the film very well left me satisfied , once I started to think over the film some more.<br /><br />Ms . Jeon is rather impressive throughout , especially considering that if the role were any less well played , it would 've quickly turned into a rather painful melodrama , but she captures the nuances of Shinae 's attempts to deal with her losses with a layer of subtlety . Mr. Song has a much smaller role in this film than other films , but he performs adequately , appropriately giving stage to Ms. Jeon . Technically , the film is well done in a classical sense . No flashy aesthetics are employed here -- the director is clearly trying to let the story tell itself . I think my only real complaint , and one that might not be able to be fixed , is that despite all the time we spend with Shinae , there is a bit of distance between Shinae and the audience ( or at least , me ) . I think some of this stems from the nature of the work , because if total empathy were pushed , then we would n't be able to see the problems that Shinae has objectively . On the other hand , I never felt moved along with Shinae 's plight , despite her many tears and increasingly erratic behavior.<br /><br />All the same , the film still stands quite impressive , especially in that it stimulated me to think about it , the further meanings present in it and its ruminations on tragedy , coping , self - deception , isolation and faith stuck with me well after the credits had finished running . Propelled by a strong lead performance , I honestly did n't notice its 2.25 hour runtime . And that says something . Well done . 8/10 .
1 If you 've had drama in your life , either your own or by someone close to you , the stages of pain this woman ( but , in my opinion , it could easily have been a man too)goes through are very very real . It is a movie about not being able to cope with your pain , about not knowing what to do to help yourself get through it . Obviously it then also is a movie about not knowing how to help someone close to you get through their pain . It is a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering . It is a movie that might push someone over the edge ... which hardly sounds like a recommendation . I 'm not sure I would recommend someone to go see this film , especially someone close , but for me ... it is a movie that puts things into perspective , that shows real pain , and is therefore much relevant to being alive . It makes you realize that hey , you or the person close to you have lived through pain , that hey , all the things you worry about now are of so little importance
1 " Secret Sunshine " reminded me of " The Rapture " ( 1991 ) , with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny , but this Korean production is a better film . It portrays super - religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city , and the main character 's experiences interacting with them in the wake of a horrible personal tragedy . Shin - ae is a widowed single mother who moves to the city of Milyang ( ' Secret Sunshine ' in Chinese ) from Seoul with her young son . She has chosen Milyang because her late husband ( killed in an auto accident ) was born there , and she feels she needs to make a new start in life in a new place . She does not react well to the overtures of the local Christian zealots , one of whose members tries to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings . Shin - ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people off as politely as she can . In fact , she brushes just about everyone in Milyang off to begin with , but some of them are persistent in trying to invade her world , and the consequences are often hilarious . To say more would be to give the film away , but it should be noted that the performance of the woman in the lead role ( Jeon Do - yeon ) is stupendous . Having read that she won the Best Actress award at Cannes in 2007 , I expected her to a decent job . But Ms. Jeon is captivating and it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she is on screen . The movie is a sort of harrowing Evelyn Waugh - esquire piece of work , showing how Fate can feel insane as much as strangely inevitable .
1 Corean cinema can be quite surprising for an occidental audience , because of the multiplicity of the tones and genres you can find in the same movie . In a Coreen drama such as this " Secret Sunshine " , you 'll also find some comical parts , thriller scenes and romantic times . " There 's not only tragedy in life , there 's also tragic - comedy " says at one point of the movie the character interpreted by Song Kang - ho , summing up the mixture of the picture . But do n't get me wrong , this heterogeneity of the genres the movie deals with , adds veracity to the experience this rich movie offers to its spectators . That does n't mean that it lacks unity : on the contrary , it 's rare to see such a dense and profound portrait of a woman in pain.<br /><br />Shin - ae , who 's in quest for a quiet life with her son in the native town of her late husband , really gives , by all the different faces of suffering she 's going through , unity to this movie . It 's realistic part is erased by the psychological descriptions of all the phases the poor mother is going through . Denial , lost , anger , faith , pert of reality : the movie fallows all the steps the character crosses , and looks like a psychological catalog of all the suffering phases a woman can experience.<br /><br />The only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience ( the woman wears the mask of tragedy , the man represents the comical interludes ) and to let the artifices of the movie touch you . I must say that some parts of the movie really did move me ( especialy in the beginning ) , particularly those concerning the unability of Chang Joan to truly help the one he loves , but also that the accumulation of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end . Nevertheless , some cinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising ( the scene where a body is discovered in a large shot is for instance amazing ) . This kind of scenes makes " Secret Sunshine " the melo equivalent of " The Host " for horror movies or " Memories of murder " for thrillers . These movies are indeed surprising , most original , aesthetically incredible , and manage to give another dimension to the genres they deal with . The only thing that " Secret Sunshine " forgets , as " The host " forgot to be scary , is to make its audience cry : bad point for a melodrama , but good point for a good film .
1 The most interesting thing about Miryang ( Secret Sunshine ) is the actors . Jeon Do - yeon , as Lee Shin - ae , the main character , is a woman with a young son whose husband has died in a tragic accident , and who leaves Seoul to live in Miryang , which was his home town , with her young son . Jeon 's face is very changeable . She is girlish , flirtatious , elegant , aged and sad , desperate and joyous , with it and terribly isolated by turns , and it 's all in her face . The film also stars Song Kang - ho as Kim , a man who meets her when her car breaks down coming into Miryang , who happens to run a garage in town , and who follows her around all the time thereafter , despite her apparent lack of interest in his attentions . Song is the biggest star in Korea right now , renowned for his work with Park Chan - wook and Bong Joon - ho ( Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance ; Memories of Murder and The Host ) . And yet here he plays a throwaway character , almost a forgotten man . But of course he makes him interesting and curiously appealing . He is the essential ballast to keep Jeon 's character from floating away.<br /><br />Lee Shin - ae is a piano teacher . She comes to the new town , which is a neutral place , a kind of poor - man 's Seoul , a town " just like anywhere else , " as Kim says ( just as he is in a way just like anyone else ) . Her little boy is sprightly , as little boys are , but plainly damaged and withdrawn at times too . His father used to snore , and when he misses him he lies awake , pretending to snore . He goes to school , and Shin - ae meets parents and students and shopkeepers . There is a sense of place in the film , even though the place is in a sense " anywhere . " People speak in the local dialect , and everyone knows everything , and Shin - ae 's Seoul origin is immediately noticed . Is life really harsher here , away from the big city and its sophistication ? Shin - ae seems not to realize the danger she is in.<br /><br />Something terrible happens . And Shin - ae does n't necessarily deal with it in the best possible way . But it happens and she must face the consequences . But she ca n't . She goes to pieces . A perpetrator is caught , but that 's no consolation . Eventually she becomes so despairing , she relents and goes to a born - again Christian meeting an acquaintance has been pressing her to attend . She finds peace and release with this . But when she decides not only to forgive the perpetrator but to go to the prison to tell him so , that experience is full of ironies and it destroys her all over again . She becomes embittered and desperate and she no longer finds solace in religion . And it gets worse than that.<br /><br />Jeon Do - yeon gives her all in this extremely demanding and protean role . Lee Chang - dong may be a very good director . If an actor of the stature of Song Kang - ho expresses enormous admiration for him , that is convincing . According to Scott Foundas of LA Weekly , Lee 's first three films , Green Fish ( 1997 ) , Peppermint Candy ( 2000 ) and Oasis ( 2002 ) have marked him out as " one of the leading figures of his country 's recent cinematic renaissance . " But this is not as successful a film as those of other Korean directors whose work I 've seen , such as Yong Sang - Soo , Bong Joon - ho , and the prodigiously , almost perversely gifted Park Chan - wook . It may indeed begin as Foundas says as a kind of " Asiatic Alice Does n't Live Here Anymore " and then " abruptly and without warning " turns into " something of a thriller , and some time after that a nearly Bressonian study in human suffering . " But that progression not only seems random and indigestible ; the film sags and loses its momentum toward the end and then simply fizzles out , with no sense of an ending . There are also weaknesses in the action . Shin - ae takes foolish chances with her son , and makes bad choices all along . If she is destined for madness like Betty in Jean - Jacques Beineix 's Betty Blue , which might explain her peculiar and mistaken choices , that is n't something that is properly developed . This is an interesting film , certainly a disturbing one , but one that leaves one doubtful and dissatisfied , after putting one through an emotional wringer.<br /><br />An official selection of the New York Film Festival presented at Lincoln Center , 2007an event that has done right by Korean filmmakers in the recent past .
1 Initially , I would have thought that Secret Sunshine had something critical to say of religion ( and here being Christianity ) , and wondered if it would be something of a rant against the ills of blind faith , or the manipulative power of those who are supposedly holier than thou . Surprisingly , it was none of the sort and was largely non - judgemental , putting in place events as a matter of fact , and allowing the audience to draw their own judgement and conclusion.<br /><br />And I ca n't help but to chuckle at the role of Song Kang - ho , a man who 's taken a liking for widower Shin - ae ( Jeong Do - yeon ) , and starts going to church when she does . The reasons for church going are many I suppose , either to find inner peace , to seek help , being afraid of eternal damnation in the fires of Hell , to reaffirm faith , or even things like wanting to get married in a church , or to skirt chase ( I kid you not ) . But to each his own reasons for turning up in church every Sunday and participating in prayer groups for fellowship , what is indeed dangerous , is when the underlying ulterior motives , do not get satisfied , and that 's when frustration sets in . Or when you discover how hypocritical man can be , portraying one face inside the house of God , and displaying yet another outside.<br /><br />Shin - ae and her son Jun moves to the town of Miryang , which is the birthplace of her deceased husband . Wanting to start life anew , she opens up a piano shop to give lessons , though in discovering her new found freedom and in a moment 's lack of good judgement , has another tragedy befall her . And that takes one hour to get to . Secret Sunshine really took its time to get to this point , where things then begin to get slightly more interesting with Shin - ae now taking to embracing religion to deal with and accept her current state , reveling in the comfort that religion , and fellow believers , can offer.<br /><br />What began as crying out for sympathy turns into acceptance and belief that religion offers that silver bullet to solve the ills of all mankind , and sometimes you wonder if it 's because of your personal myopic view of what the almighty is doing for you , that you begin to adopt a somewhat selfish opinion that everything 's good going your way , and in Shin - ae 's case , her magnanimous attitude in wanting to forgive others who had trespassed against her , forgetting something very fundamental that it the feeling can cut both ways too.<br /><br />The last act is probably the most fun of the lot as it says plenty , where most of us can identify with - why me , and why not someone else , as we rage against our faith and start questioning , unfortunately , with no hard and fast answers available . It is then either we fall by the wayside , or continue with destructive deeds so rebelliously . But somehow the plug gets carefully pulled in Secret Sunshine so as not to offend , and what could have been an ugly character mouthpiece , got muted.<br /><br />If you bite into the hype this movie is generating , then perhaps you 'll realize only Jeong Do- yeon 's excellent portrayal is worth mentioning , as she totally owns her role as the widow Shin - ae who is probably the most unluckiest person on Earth in having to deal with that many tragedies over a short period of time , and if you look at it carefully , most of which are of her own doing . Watching her transformation , is worth the ticket price , and despite having my personal favourite Korean actor Song Kang - ho in the movie , this is something he just breezed right through .
1 This is a real eye candy . A world made of floating islands and flying ancient cities . Huge monsters whose preferred method of attack is hurling cathedrals at their opponents ... Who can resist that ? An ancient prophecy , a bunch of underdog heroes and a cute princess in search of her hero ... sounds familiar ... ? Yes we heard that song before . But You will forget that while looking at the spectacular scenery.<br /><br />This movie is fun to watch while it lasts . But after leaving the cinema You 'll be longing for a little bit more story.<br /><br />What is behind the 30-years - circle ? What drove the knight crazy ? Who built all these fabulous monuments , castles and cities ... and why are they falling apart ? And apart from that one bunch of farmers , where are the people ? Really , this picture looks so intriguing , but it 's no Lord of the Rings .
1 For a long time i have n't seen so beautiful animated feature . Having healthy respect for Pixar , i must say that Ratatouille or any other movie made by 'em can not be compared to this . Animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here . The graphics is amazing , the background surroundings are mind - blowing , almost every object in every frame is drawn perfectly . Sometimes i felt tingles down my spine - so much i loved what i 've seen.<br /><br />The plot is absolutely romantic . As romantic as the animated film plot can possibly be . The characters are lovable , especially Hector , the blue rabbit , he owns , pawns , rocks and rules ! The other char - s are very nice also . The humor is top - notch.<br /><br />Generally it seemed that creators did n't invest much effort into this . I mean it looked like it did n't take em too much in difference from people of Pixar&Dreamworks who try hard every time to think on something new . And i 'm very glad that a product of European animation studio turned out to be SO great . They 've made a magnificent , touching movie , a candy for eye and heart.<br /><br />The only minus is stupid beginning and that 's why it 's 9of10 not 10/10
1 this is my first review on IMDb , i did n't really want to write one but since there are only 2 for this great movie right now , i feel compelled to add my perspective ... and no , i 'm not associated to the movie makers in any way ( yeah yeah how often did you here that before ;-) ) FYI i 'm in my late 20s < br /><br />1st of all i have to admit i really like animated movies , because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were pretty imaginative on this one . Not so much in terms of story but in achieving a very unique and imo fresh visual style . The characters look good but far from real and it works well for the movie , after all it 's a fairytale - like world . But the backgrounds and the world in general is filled with awesome visuals that my jaw dropped several times while watching this . The blue , bunny - like mini - dragon steels the show and has easily some of the funniest moments of the movie , he is already an instant classic , much as Scrat from Ice Age . The story is not too surprising ( a bunch of anti - heroes have to go out and slay the biggest dragon you can imagine ) but who cares if the movie looks and sounds THAT good ;-) 1 thing i have to point out , imo the movie is not suited for VERY young children because it has some darker scenes in it and maybe frightening for kids under 6 - 8 i would say , these are only very few scenes but worth mentioning imo . Anyway i had a great time watching this and ca n't wait for it to hit the stores in high def to watch it over and over again just for the sheer beauty of it.<br /><br />8,5 for me
1 Have you heard the story about the reluctant heroes who were hired by a King to slay a dragon ? Oh , you have ? Was it set in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above clouds , and did the heroes have to make dangerous leaps from one island to the next on their journey ? Did water flow upwards and remnants of great cities levitate on the horizon ? I did n't think so.<br /><br />I stumbled onto this movie by accident and I 'm really glad that I did ! It 's one of the most beautiful movies I 've ever seen . Much like the Pixar movies , it 's a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today 's world . The animators have invested thought into almost everything that appears on the screen , and this attention to detail is staggering ( the scene where the mushrooms in the foreground belch green smoke whilst the characters walk obliviously in the background is one of my favourites ) . The monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action.<br /><br />Although the plot may not be entirely unique , the movie has enough charm to make sure you keep watching . Our protagonists are likable and interesting , ensuring the audience is behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon which might otherwise devour everything in its path . Of course , Hector is the character most will fall in love with . A small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and English , Hector provides comedy relief in a way Jar Jar Binks could only dream of.<br /><br />In summary , I 'd recommend watching The Dragon Hunters if you get the opportunity . Watch it for the incredible animation , the breath - taking battle scenes and for a glimpse into a world that 's unlike anything else you 've seen on a cinema or television screen . At the very least , it 's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - no matter if you 're nine or twenty - nine ( which , in fact , I am ) !
1 I voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story I have been able to see in quite some time . The animation is stunning . The artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful . From the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry . I was amazed . Moving beyond the beauty on the screen , you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh . Character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand . I 'm impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family .
1 My first impression would be this is Beowulf only with all the good bits of fighting Grendel and dragons intact , making it one thrill ride from start to end . Written by Frederic Lanoir and Arthur Qwak , the two of them had created a fantastical landscape that becomes a character in itself within their story , with its ever changing environment made up of small spheres of land floating around , which can either be wastelands , or globes of greenery.<br /><br />The story 's a simple one , which tells of a land which is cowering in the expectation of a mighty dragon 's unwanted visit to plunder and destroy , and the resident knights have all but been annihilated . Enter the king 's granddaughter Zoe ( Marie Drion ) who gathers Lian - Chu ( Vincent Lindon ) , a huge brute with immense strength but truly a gentle giant , and his partner - in - arms Gwizdo ( Patrick Timsit ) , who balances the partnership with his cunning brain . Lian - Chu and Gwizdo ( together with their pet creature which too proudly spews incipient fires ) share a common dream of owning a farm land and spending idyllic days tending to their farm animals in retirement , but in order to do that comes the requirement of being financially free , hence their career in monster - extermination which does n't exactly pay off.<br /><br />That 's basically the whole gist of it , but what makes this film a spectacle , is its CG graphics , which is solidly rich , detailed , and an eye - popping marvel to behold . It has some wonderfully crafted set action pieces that were painstakingly designed to draw you into the thick of the action , , and during those fight sequences , there 's nary a boring moment . Photo - realistic moments of non - existent landscapes make you put aside the fantasy of make - belief , and it 's easy to be in awe of the landscape which goes beyond the usual three - suns and a kaleidoscope of flying thingamajigs ( here 's having at you George ! ) And I could n't get enough of the finale battle as well , though the usual brick - bats will find some fault at the indestructibility of the principle characters.<br /><br />I guess this film had opened my eyes that there are many more computer - animated companies out there around the world that have quality in their product to match that of Pixar 's . And this is definitely a movie that the local filmmakers of Zodiac : The Race Begins and Legend of the Sea can learn from  to keep the story effectively simple , and let your moving artwork do all the talking . Definitely highly recommended !
1 This movie took my breath away at some points , I simply loved it ! < br /><br />I admit that the character dialogs and storyline could have been done a bit better , but hey , this is just a simple ( short ) story of a couple of guys trying to slain a dragon , there 's nothing more to it!<br /><br />The overall design , atmosphere , the beautiful landscapes ... it 's all just magical ! < br /><br />They've put a lot of love in this movie . Character designs were great and funny . A bit Tim Burton - ish if you like . I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in great design , displayed in a simple small , but lovely story .
1 After watching the trailer I was surprised this movie never made it into theaters , so I ordered the BluRay . I had a great time watching it and have to say that this movie is better than some major animation movies out there . Of course , it has its flaws but I can still really recommend it . The animation is well done , very entertaining and unique and the story kept me watching it all the way to the end . Some of the backdrops are just drop - dead gorgeous and you can see the French talent behind it . I thought that Forest Whitaker 's performance feels a bit lifeless but that is how the character Lian - Chu is depicted in this movie . So overall , thumbs up , I liked it a lot and I hope it is successful enough for all the studios involved to continue making great movies like this . I would recommend to give it a chance and be surprised how great a movie can be with such a small budget . Hektor alone is worth watching the movie since some of his moments are Stitch - like hilarious .
1 My 3 year old loved it . I loved it , my wife loved it . So 10 out of 10 from our family . As for violence level ? Not really that violent , mostly of the slap stick variety . Nobody truly dies , no gore , no blood , no torture , so it certainly is appropriate for children , much more so than many Saturday morning cartoons.<br /><br />This movie really takes the idea of CG movies where it should go.<br /><br />First of all beautiful graphics , textures wonderfully done , with true depth , not trying to be realistic , but forming an artistic whole . The moss on the stones , the rust on metal , the reliefs on the wood and the stone , everything adds to the whole.<br /><br />Character modeling , unlike many contemporary CG movies , is quirky , not cute , again within an artistic whole . The faces may look less malleable than in some other movies , but the characters are more puppet - like than human - like . I think that is a good thing , it lends veracity , how strangely it may sound , it is easier to suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />Hair , fur , clothing , on par , at least with the likes of Pixar . Just note in the opening scenes when Lian - Chu is fighting the giant slug ; Gwizdo is in front of some farmers , and all of them have detailed clothing which caused me to pause the movie just to admire it.<br /><br />The setting . Far beyond the likes of Cars , and even WallE. Space has been done many times , but the fantasy environs of Dragon Hunters are only comparable with some scenes in Never Ending Story and Lord of the Rings , but again it is an artistic whole , and with lots of good ideas thrown about effortlessly . Magnificent vistas like the scene in Monsters Inc. where they ride all the doorways through its storage facility , or WallE where we see the immense trash towers he made , abound in this movie , everything is grand , yet never dwelt upon ; it is just the background the whole way ! The interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic falls . The Chinese wall , the islands floating in the sky . The Broccoli in the sky ? That is truly where I believe CG should go , make something which takes your breath away , and do it again and again.<br /><br />The sound is good , the music is varied and not only epic , and thankfully without any vocals , and purely original for the movie.<br /><br />Animation is quite good . Lending its inspiration to cartoons , especially some good use of stretch and squeeze . Sometimes not that realistic , but the 3d models are not realistic either.<br /><br />Characterization is well done too . Lian - Chu the gentle and uncertain giant is gradually growing in confidence basking in the attention of little Zoé.<br /><br />Gwizdo the wily manager of Lian - Chu redeems himself in the end , while Zoé is n't really changed at all , but who wants that cute child to change anyway ? I at least loved Lian - Chu more than any other recent character since Sulley in Monsters Inc.<br /><br />The internal strife in the group gets ironed out by the external pressures , just as it should in a proper fantasy story.<br /><br />The story is mostly reminiscent of the Never Ending Story , especially how the world brakes apart . The monsters are pretty standard fare , except the flocking one . It lacks the emotional impact of WallE , which is the really strong point of that movie , but it is a much more fun ride , and lacks the annoying musical scene replaying in the former one , and has action from the first scene . This movie is what you want to watch for a fun and exciting time.<br /><br />The whole movie has , as I 've mentioned a whole vision , which seems to have been followed rigorously throughout.<br /><br />It seems , that the setting is ready for more adventures , and I for one would hope so.<br /><br />One side note , the French actor doing Lian - Chu sounded a bit like Jean Reno at first , but I 'm happy it was n't him , though he is one of my favorites . Nice to hear a new , to me , voice.<br /><br />I give it a max rating , a bit surprised at the mediocre and low ratings by some ; I have tried to address some of the concerns made by two of the reviews with the lowest vote . Approach this movie as an adventure , and as a European movie , not opposed to Hollywood , but different .
1 What people fail to understand about this movie is that it is n't a beginning , middle , and end , it is just the conclusion of a 26 episode long TV series . So remember that when you all talk about how the world was n't explored enough . That was all done in the TV show.<br /><br />As great and stunning as the visuals are , I think the * * * SPOILERS * * * argument between Lian - Chu and Gwizdo near the end of the film was what really made me love this movie . Seeing characters I had followed through 26 episodes fight like that was agonizing , and seeing Gwizdo walking sadly off by himself amidst the floating ruins while Lian - Chu sharpened his blade was almost tear - jerking . < br /><br />Then we got a total contrast with Lian - Chu fighting these insanely awesome dragons ( Which had been featured before in the series ) while Gwizdo is babbling insanely and indirectly threatening to kill Zoe . * Shudder * I 'm surprised that this particular scene has n't been mentioned more in the warnings . Any kid that has a lick of sense will be able to see that Gwizdo was n't himself and was fully intent on strangling that little girl . It was enough to bother me , and I 'm 15.<br /><br />The world is amazing , the plot is a lot better than most multi - million blockbusters , and it was a nice way to see some of my favorite characters go . Check it out . :)
1 Dragon Hunters has to be the best - looking animated film I 've ever seen . It was jaw - dropping . The film is about a couple rogues in search for some cash , their weird furry blue dog that pees fire , and a girl who dreams about becoming a knight , and they are sent on a quest to go to the ends of the earth to kill the world gobbler , an impossibly immense dragon . But honestly , it does n't even matter what the film is about . Because , it is jaw - droppingly gorgeous . The gravity in this fantasy world is different , so blocks of architecture and spheres of land float around amidst cathedrals and castles and villages alike , and there are forests of floating lily pads . The world is so creative , so uniquely beautiful , with a sort of muted storybook look to it . The world looks like a set of gorgeous paintings . The monsters are visually stunning as well , like a fire dragon comprised of a swarm of evil red bats . Some of the plot is n't too original , like the main protagonists wanting their farm a la Of Mice and Men and never seem to be able to make it in the world ; but the gorgeous graphics , some seriously sinister scenes , and emotion - evoking dialog makes this film spectacular .
1 This is a CGI animated film based upon a French 2D animated series . The series ran briefly on Cartoon Network , but its run was so brief that its inclusion as one of the potential Oscar nominees for best animated film for this year left most people I know going " Huh ? " This is the story of Lian - Chu , the kind heart muscle , and Gwizdo , the brains of the operation , who along with Hector their fire farting dragon , he 's more like a dog . Travel the world offering up their services as dragon hunters but never getting paid . Into their lives comes Zoe , the fairy tale loving niece of a king who is going blind . It seems the world is being devoured by a huge monster and all of the knights the king has sent out have never returned or if the do return they come back as ashes . In desperation the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater . Zoe of course tags along ... <br /><br />What can I say other then why is this film hiding under a rock ? This is a really good little film that is completely off the radar except as unlikely Oscar contender . Its a beautifully designed , fantastic looking film ( The world it takes place has floating lands and crazy creatures ) that constantly had me going " Wow " at it . The English Voice cast with Forrest Whitaker as Lian - Chu ( one of the best vocal performances I 've ever heard ) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo ( think Steve Bucsemi ) is first rate . Equally great is the script which does n't talk down to its audience , using some real expressions not normally heard in animated films ( not Disney nor Pixar ) . Its all really well done.<br /><br />Is it perfect ? No , some of the bits go on too long , but at the same time its is damn entertaining.<br /><br />If you get the chance see this . Its one of the better animated films from 2008 , and is going on my nice surprise list for 2009 .
1 The world of the Dragon Hunters is a 3D gravity challenged world . Planetoids , bits of buildings and strange flat plants float around in the atmosphere while the ground towards most of the characters are falling is nowhere to be seen . It is a world reminiscent of Neverending Story , when the Nothing came to eat the world away.<br /><br />Funny enough , the villain here is the World Gobbler , as well . This time it is a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes . The heroes are a big yet taciturn warrior , an annoying and greedy sidekick managing the entrepreneurial side of the duo and a strange useless animal . They are joined by the most talkative little girl in the world who , to my chagrin , did not die a horrible painful and hopefully early death.<br /><br />The animation is great . The voices and the sounds are top notch . Too bad the story is as simple as one can possibly imagine . They go to stop the World Gobbler , they reach him almost immediately , they defeat him . The end . No real character development or story twists . Not even the ones I would expect from a movie with such a plot.<br /><br />Bottom line : it 's a cute thing to watch , kids would probably enjoy it , but that 's about it . No depth to this world ( pun intended ) .
1 When you start watching this animation - masterpiece , you quickly notice , that it 's a European production . Although the Europeans have ( sadly ) integrated some of the clichés you would normally find in an American production of this kind , most are missing . One of these is that there is an overwhelming evil that only our ( very few and very unlikely ) heroes can vanquish . Another is that one of the group is only in the business for the money , is greedy , runs away when the heat is up but somehow gives in to his better nature . This movie would have been better off without both.<br /><br />The movie is based upon a TV - Series that was out four years before the movie . Unlike the movie , the TV - Series is a cartoon and not a computer animation . At first I thought the computer would kill the charm and character of the plot but I was quickliy convinced : Whoever did the animation knew his or her stuff ! Although the characters are obviously fictional ( in stills they do n't even look real ) , they seem as alive and sentient as the audience following their quest . Making characters who by " normal " standards could be considered deformed ( those micro - legs could never carry that giant body let alone make it jump ) so alive and lovable is more than " just a highlight " ! The creation of the world is another masterpiece . Not so much because of its looks but because of the inventiveness of it . The world our heroes travel is not solid like our own but is made of many pieces of land varying in shape and size that seem to be floating in mid air . When a person steps on a smaller fragment of ground , it nods a little bit as if feathering from the weight . In some cases up and down no longer apply but our heroes still manage to get a foothold somewhere . Although the world of floating islands is completely surreal , in this movie it is absolutely believable and after a short time it does n't seem any weirder than running into a car somewhere in New York.<br /><br />I wrote that the looks of the world are n't as breathtaking as the idea . As true as that might be to my mind , the quality of the world , the characters and the attention to details is staggering . Although the faces of the characters have relatively few attributes , emotions can be read as clearly as in Sean Connery 's or Dustin Hoffman 's face . The world around the characters is wonderfully colourful and no two settings are alike . The background is always in motion , something is always going on which makes the world seem even more alive . If you stop the movie and look at the background you will be surprised how many details you can find.<br /><br />The existence of Hector actually puts the cherry on top . Hector is a furry little " thing " ( possibly the equivalent of a dog in our world ) who is totally lovable and extremely funny . Although he is n't really important for the main plot , he would be missed like Scrat would be in Ice Age . The really cool thing about Hector is that you need to speak Gibberish to understand him.<br /><br />If the movie is so great , why did n't I give it 10 stars ? Well , the plot in itself was rather thin . Two hunters are sent out to rescue the world from a really bad dragon who wants to swallow the world , is n't really original . That in itself would n't be much of a problem . What I missed was the background information . What kind of a dragon was this and why did it look that way ? I love mythical stories but if they get too thin then they seem to be written after the movie is finished in a feeble attempt to give the whole thing some depth.<br /><br />Another thing I did n't like was Zoé . Although a little girl like her could be considered adorable , she was somewhat of a pain in this movie . She seemed pretty resistant to all types of learning about reality , kept dreaming of some hero from a story book and basically slowed the others down . She would have been OK if she had developed a little more and a little earlier in the movie - or had been less of a girly to start with . To me the idea of this girl who was there to twist the story a little backfired on the writers.<br /><br />All in all , this is a really good movie for just about all ages .
1 " Some day , we 'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun . Some day , when the world is much brighter"- The 5 Stairsteps " O - o - h Child" < br /><br />Movies about Black teenagers usually involve inner city gangs dealing drugs or committing violence to a hip - hop soundtrack . Films about the everyday problems of ordinary inner city teens are hard to find , yet there is an undiscovered gem that I would like to recommend . Our Song , by Jim McKay is about three girls in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn who learn that their high school will be closed for asbestos removal and must decide on their future direction , one that may involve going their separate ways . The story is told from the point of view of a 15-year old , not from an adult reminiscing about the past as in most coming of age movies . Avoiding the mandatory street slang and excessive use of F - words , it delivers an honest and loving portrait of three friends at a crossroads in their life . The girls : Lanisha ( Kerry Washington ) , Joycelyn ( Anna Simpson ) , and Maria ( Melissa Martinez ) are in their sophomore year at the local high school . They are active members of the Jackie Robinson Steppers , a real - life marching band whose rehearsals for a Labor Day parade provide discipline and purpose to their lives . < br /><br />Similar to David Gordon Green 's George Washington but less stylized , the film showcases non - professional black and Latino actors with Kerry Washington as the standout . While the performances have some amateurish moments , I became so involved with the story that I forgot the girls were even acting . Maria , whose father is in jail , has learned that she is pregnant by Terrell , a local student . She wants to have the baby in spite of the fact that she is only 15 and knows that Terrell is probably not going to be of much help . Joycelyn works in an up - scale dress shop but dreams about becoming a singer . In a very poignant scene in her bedroom , she pretends to be talking to her fans , then lies down in bed to recite one of her poems . She is close to Lanisha and Maria at the beginning but drifts off to make friends outside of the neighborhood . None of the girls receive much support at home and Maria is too afraid to even tell her mother about her baby . Yet , the single moms are not typical movie deadbeats or alcoholics . They are warm and loving parents whose time with their children is limited because of the pressure of supporting the family . < br /><br />Lanisha 's parents are divorced but she is able to visit her father , a doorman in a luxury apartment building and talk about music . Her mother is comforting when Lanisha learns that a friend in the neighborhood has committed suicide , a somewhat melodramatic plot point in an otherwise realistic film . As the summer winds down , the girls drift apart and each decides on a different course . There are no big dramatic moments , however , only the sad recognition of the inevitability of change . Though we do not have blinders on about the frustrations that may await them , we identify with their hopes and dreams without dwelling on the negative . Our Song is an emotionally satisfying film about growing up in the projects that refuses to see life in any terms other than possibility .
1 I reflect back to the days when I held my boyfriends hat to smell him into existence in my time alone when I was 16 . The little moments of this film are so accurate and right on pace with what is going on in the minds and hearts of young girls during those coming of age teenage years . Now at my age I want to preach to them about their decisions and how life during those times are not as important as it all seems in those moments . That if they can be patient in their youth and wait to experience the hardships of life both external and internal that life would be so much sweeter . But then again young people today are faced with some variables that I never had to deal with a youth . < br /><br />The three main characters well played by all three actors ( Kerry Wahington - Lanisha , Anna Simpson - Joycelyn and Melissa Martinez- Maria ) give us the very believable depiction of a piece of reality for young girls living in impoverished situations . They have impoverished family lives all being raised by single mothers with expectation of Lanisha whose father is present but not actively supporting her day to day . The have impoverished educational systems and lack direct contact with achieving role models . These situations powerfully affect them and is their reality but all this is of no great depressive concern to these young women in their day to day . They except their plight and focus on the same things young girls all over the world are concerned with . Finding true love in a male , having good friends that you can depend on , gaining some respect / love and responsibility from parents and enjoying life . This is were this film cross the race , age and gender gap imposed upon it by its characters and the setting in which it is stamped . < br /><br />The Director and writer McKay explains on the DVD how each of scenes got into his head , by just observing young people of that age that lived in those types of neighborhoods . Plus you add three up and coming actresses who are not so far removed from that time in their own lives that you get a real good synergy of reality and acting at its best . The one thing I know about ( African Americans and Hispanics ) is that there is always a spiritual family member or neighbor that is in the foreground or near ground believing in a better day and better life and future in spite of the present situation and is role modeling that to some extent . This was never touched in the movie in order not to preach and I understand that but it also narrows the culture to having no hope in anything other than themselves . < br /><br />The HOPE FACTOR : I now think about my future and where I have come from and say as Lanisha did ` Today is a good day . ' Yes poverty still exists , racism , sexism , and any other ism that we can added . Yes some of each of these young girls actions perpetuate the isms and are self - destructive , everything around them is impoverished but NONE of those actions past or neither present nor their environment leaves them without hope for a bright future . I was left with saddened hope of each of the characters and a deeper desire to be a role model in the life of some young girl on the edge of making a destructive decision . I suppose that is the value of film it should not only entertain but cause each of us to think , reflect and then act in some positive way to make this world a better place.<br /><br / >
1 Jim McKay has made one of the best films you will see all year . The quiet simplicity of this film draws you in from the opening shot and never lets go . There is not one false note in the entire film . Not one . Everything works . The hand - held camera is never distracting and always where it should be . The three young ladies whose lives we follow are always real . There is n't a single beat where the audience is reminded we are looking at actresses performing a role . These are just real girls trying to find themselves . There is no political agenda , hidden or otherwise . This is cinema at its most basic , and although it will probably only be seen by a handful of movie - goers , it deserves a much wider release . A special hats off to Hugh Hefner for providing the film - makers with the grant money needed to get this important film made . I ca n't wait to see what Mr. McKay does next .
1 After seeing this film at the SF Independent Film Festival , I could n't wait to hear about how to get a copy . Jim McKay gave a talk ( Q&A ) about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation : how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities ( women , non - whites ) working on resolving controversial issues ( teen pregnancy , teen motherhood , racial identity , single - mother households ) , and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid - thirties white male . The multi - racial , multi - gendered audience of mostly - adults raved about the film 's fantastic storyline , detailed characters , and fantastic portrayal of " real teen life . " Most of the teens , however , had left the building -- leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids , as a starting point for discussion rather than , as many adults there felt , " a film teens should see because it 's about them . " Hence , distribution questions -- how do we get our hands on it ? The Internet ( retail ) would be a great path -- this is a film that will be buried , like " Pups " or other radical modern teen films -- and McKay seemed responsive . As for his credits as a writer / director , McKay was _ extremeley _ sensitive and detailed in his work -- allying himself to the Crown Heights neighborhood in which the film is set , working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be -- with the results being disarmingly realistic .
1 ` Our Song ' gives us the lives of the three teenagers Lanisha , Maria and Joycelyn - best girlfriends hanging at the end of summer . Adolescent summer - even if we do n't know the signals and landmarks of this particular terrain , Crown Heights , Brooklyn - is / was the same for us all . A lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of school . Welcome heat and idleness.<br /><br />But if this experience of adolescence is universal , the inner city of the 90s is a different place than most of us know - maybe as foreign a country as any . Young bodies carving new silhouettes ... beckoning new territory ... the maze towards adulthood . The young mind coming into itself , speaking for itself , saying this is who I am , this is who I want to try to be . It is / was always thus . But this is how it plays out in Brooklyn in the late 90s.<br /><br />Jim McKay is the writer / director of this film project but he acknowledges all who have shouted suggestions at him . The opening title slide ` A film by ' seems to list everyone in the universe . It 's a gesture but by the end of the film , we know it to be a genuine one . [ The closing titles also have some of the most on - the - money and appreciative credits I 've read . ] The vivid sound recording by Jan McLaughlin deserves to be especially noted . McKay 's a modest leader who knows who is telling this story - it 's his three graces Lanisha , Maria and Joycelyn . They 're the real thing , their interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus of reality . This ai n't no music video shorthand telling of teenage life . It has the seriousness of the long unblinking stare.<br /><br />Hanging out with them , we do n't quite feel included but we do feel privileged to be listening in . These are real voices speaking with plainness about the crises and dullness of daily life . We are witness to the modern math of teenage life - how its problems are interpreted , calculated and summed and solved . Small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout . Lanisha hangs with her dad at his security job - it 's the only way she gets to spend time with him . We see the love that exists between them but also the failures of family and fatherhood . In a connected scene , Lanisha defends her dad to her mom , and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and for them to love her in return . Later , the three friends lay in the dark sharing visions and dreams - and we remember how crazy / funny kids are and more tragically , how realism hammers idealism these days . And at the end , Maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself . We see her gather up the courage to hold all her fears and doubts at bay . She demonstrates for us the strength one needs to have to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life livable.<br /><br />`Our Song 's greatest gift is that we really feel deeply the terribly ephemeral nature of friendship - how , one day , alive and enlivening , that intimacy can , in the next , just turn and drift away . It 's awful , but that 's just the way it is , is n't it ?
1 This is the first American film to successfully adopt the naturalistic style used by Europeans , particularly the French and Belgians , for at least a decade , and is n't it about time ? Following three high school girls in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn during the last days of their summer break between freshman and sophomore years , it does what all good art should : it discovers the universal in the particular . Even though the girls ' preoccupations are outwardly conventional -- boys , sex , popularity , money , freedom , and clothes -- we glimpse how their whole lives are being shaped , the universal interface between character and destiny.<br /><br />The naturalism is whole , complete . The film breathes , stays in the moment , inhabits real time . The story tells itself . The medium and its artifacts , for once , are not the message . The film unwaveringly , truthfully conveys the childhood perspective of its characters ; it does not impose its own adult meanings or morals . Details emerge of their own , are never pushed , and thus seem all the more real and powerful for their understatement . Even though great pains have been taken to capture the authentic social reality of Crown Heights , part of the largest Black ghetto in New York City and one of the most dangerous violent places in the US , the subject is childhood in the ghetto , not the ghetto itself.<br /><br />Documentary footage of the practice sessions of a marching band , the Jackie Robinson Steppers , punctuate the film at regular intervals with an explosion of color , movement , and sound . Otherwise , the camera stays very close , very intimate , a patient , sly , and unobtrusive observer . The language is rich , spontaneous , the acting transparent . Some scenes standout , such as the girls lolling about , each revealing her deepest fantasies . Lanisha 's confession of her acceptance of a death by random violence is the most shocking , one of the deepest scars of the ghetto . Her sharing with her mother her confusion and fear before the stark challenges of adult life is equally moving , and beautifully , unsentimentally affirmative.<br /><br />Social realities are respected , not propagandized : All three girls are being raised by single moms , only one , Lanisha , has a father active in her life ( and , not coincidentally , of the three she is the most emotionally stable and empathetic to others , and the one with the most self - respect ) . Two of them suffer from asthma , a disease disproportionately prevalent in the inner city . Gunfire , an accepted daily occurrence , only momentarily interrupts their conversation . Only one of the girls , Joy , feels hope for , feels she has control over the future , while the other two to varying degrees have already accepted despair.<br /><br />This is by far the best dramatic American film I 've seen in years . See it , see it , see it .
1 I saw this film earlier today , and I was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters . It did n't feel like a film - it felt more like a documentary ( the part I liked best ) . The leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen year - old girls I know.<br /><br />All in all , a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films .
1 Our Song is a marvelous example of passionate , movie making at its aesthetic best . It is , in fact , a genuine wonder of a movie ; a penetrating and insightful work of art that chronicles the lives of three young inner city ( Crown Heights , Brooklyn ) girls during a particular summer in their lives when the perplexities of their approaching adulthood will compel each of them to make a number of difficult , life altering choices that will likely re - define who each of them is , as well as how they will continue to relate to one another in years to come.<br /><br />Jim McKay 's writing / direction is graceful and uncluttered . There is no sappy , gratuitous sentimentality nor are there cliché ridden solutions in this film . What we see here seems , at times , to be heart breakingly real . There is a naturalism - a credibility , if you will - in Our Song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre , including American Graffiti and Cooley High.<br /><br />Much of the credit for the film 's spirit goes to its principle actors . The combined presence of Melisa Martinez ( Maria ) , Kerry Washington ( Lanisha ) , and Anna Simpson ( Joycelyn ) is dazzlingly powerful . It would be easy - and , of course , blatantly obtuse - to dismiss , as some apparently have , the performances of these three as apathetic or unemotional . In fact , their quiet charm , their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw , sometimes unconventional intelligence , throughout the film , are absolutely riveting . One would have to be completely " out of touch " with , or completely indifferent to , the behavior of teenagers to miss the resounding authenticity in what these three young ladies bring to the screen . Likewise , the supporting cast , particularly Marlene Forte as Lanisha 's mother , compliments the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film.<br /><br />Our Song is a film not to be missed - by anyone of any age .
1 I tuned into this by accident on the independent film channel and was riveted . I 'm a professional actor and I was flabbergasted by the performances . They felt totally improvisatory , absolutely without affectation . I could not tell if it was scripted or how it was shot and waited until the very end to see credits and then spent a half an hour on the IMDb to find this film . Do not miss it . I see that the writer - director also did a very fine film called Everyday People which I enjoyed a lot . The shame of the film business is that projects this excellent do not get the distribution and advertising that they deserve and live under the radar . This film deserves to be flown high and proudly . I urge people to look it up and watch it .
1 Bravo to Czechs , their once - powerful movie industry seems to awaken from post - Communist slumber.<br /><br />The Loners is a comedy done with all the elements you would expect to see in a modern " hollywood " production minus the garbage that seems to get attached to the genre over the past several years . Superb soundtrack , excellent visual editing , beautiful Prague cityscape , to mention but a few.<br /><br />The story is actually comprised of several sub - stories that frequently intertwain and overlap , an is in essence a collage of destinies , fates , desires ... It follows a group of urban youth - to - mid - thirties people through a variety of situations ranging from daily life and leisure activities to careers and obsessions . And it IS hillarious . There 's actually a point in the movie where the entire theatre I was in ( about a 100 people in a small art gallery ) laughed non - stop for about 40 - 50 seconds . How often do you experience that with modern hollywood productions?<br /><br />Although the entire main cast is excellent ( especially the upcoming Macedonian star Labina Mitevska in the role of an immigrant facing the all - too - familiar hardships ) I have to single out Jiri Machacek for his superbly believeable portrayal of Jakub , a constantly stoned bohemian whose brain is severely affected by the stuff he smokes landing him in a plethora of funny situations.<br /><br />Conclusion : do n't miss this one ! It 's got a lot to offer .
1 This movie is gorgeous . It 's real and down to heart , but at the same time totally crazy . The characters are easy to fall in love with , because they have so many different minds , but each of us could refer to at least on . In Canada , we do n't have many movies from Eastern Europe , and for the few I have seen , Loners is one of the best . It 's very funny , and magic . If you want to see something new and refreshing , go see Loners .
1 Saw it as critic at the 49 . Internationales Filmfestival Mannheim Heidelberg.<br /><br />As every film that I know and Zelenka is involved in it is simply genious.<br /><br />I love his way of combining different stories and characters.<br /><br />His * Knoflikari * and the truly magic * Powers * ( part of Regina Zieglers * Erotic Tales IV * ) are definitely worth being checked out . Go and get it , folks !
1 Ying , a Chinese girl who speaks Czech , invited us to screening of a Czech movie ( with English subtitles ) in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies ( VES ) . It was the first time I saw Samotá&#345;i ( Loners , 2000 ) and it was pretty good.<br /><br />Much like in many other Czech movies , the seven central characters seem to have a pretty difficult , dirty life ; the web indicates that this theme was popular among the U.S. movies in the early 1990s . Their relationships are breaking up , combining , and recombining . Another typical feature of the Czech movies is that neither of the characters is designed to be a universally negative one and neither of them is a permanently positive character either . Also , you can see how the characters judge the features of others depending on the context ; that 's a very realistic feature of the movie 's psychological analysis.<br /><br />Ond&#345;ej is a talented and married young surgeon who has two daughters . Nevertheless , you learn that he has only studied neurobiology to prove how much he loved another woman , Hanka . He is so obsessed that he repeatedly dresses up as a plumber to get into Hanka 's parents ' house - a house that he repeatedly burns.<br /><br />Meanwhile , Hanka has a very mixed relationship with her parents . She just decides - by tossing up a coin - to break up with Petr who works in a private radio station . Hanka does not view her parents ' bourgeois life as a good example but seems rather unsuccessful in creating a better environment . But she is a very flexible figure , as far as the type of her boyfriends go.<br /><br />For a while , Hanka seems to have serious plans with Jakub , an innocent drug addict whose memory seems to be rather devastated by the drugs . However , the friends from his band inform Jakub that he already has another girlfriend . Hanka is disappointed and returns to her parents.<br /><br />When Hanka and Petr break up , it is organized by Robert , a matchmaker who also works for a travel agency where his job is to show the life of ordinary Czech people to Japanese tourists . Robert - who also provides Jakub with marijuana - is never serious about anything and he usually sleeps with many different women ; eventually , his mother dies in a hospital and he has his own ways to deal with the depression.<br /><br />Vesna ( a Slavic word for " Spring " ) who came to Prague from Macedonia works as a barmaid - and you wo n't learn whether she came to Czechia in order to see her dad or UFOs . She seems pretty confused but sometimes helps the other characters from their problems.<br /><br />Petr works in the radio station and he is the only one who likes his job - a job that he eventually loses . He announces to his audience that he broke up with Hanka - which is how Ond&#345;ej learns about the news that make him very happy.<br /><br />Finally , Ond&#345;ej 's wife Lenka is always ready to forgive him and stabilize their marriage - even after Ond&#345;ej asks a magician to make him disappear so that Ond&#345;ej can try to capture Hanka again . ( The magician pays his debt because he is a brother of a victim of an important car accident - Jakub and Hanka bring the victim to the hospital and Ond&#345;ej saves his life . ) Lenka also works for the travel agency - as a translator - and eventually she has to translate some hysterical scenes for 20 or so Japanese tourists who are shooting their movies during Hanka parents ' dinner.<br /><br />The seven characters interact in interesting and exciting ways that would be natural if Prague were smaller by four orders of magnitude . Given the actual size of the Czech capital , it looks a bit unlikely that all these events would take place among seven people , but it is fun .
1 This movie is very underrated . It 's highly imaginative , creative and clever . It 's just plain fun and in my opinion this film tops the first one . But the film was forgotten when it first came out , and became even more overlooked as the years passed . " Bill & Ted 's Bogus Journey " also bombed at the box office , whereas the first one was a pretty good hit and very popular . < br /><br />I think the problem may be that this film was just released a couple years too late . In 1991 , Bill and Ted already seemed " so ' 80s " . Even though the ' 80s were only a couple years ago back at that time , the landscape of the music and style for kids had changed so radically with gangsta rap , hip hop , Pearl Jam , Nirvana , grunge and the Seattle sound . Bill and Ted with their Ozzy Osbourne , Van Halen and Guns N ' Roses music along with their ' 80s style seemed so out of place and very outdated in ' 91 , and I think that 's one BIG reason the film bombed at the box office . Nobody but surfers were still saying stuff like " excellent ! " and " bogus ! " in 1991 . " Gremlins 2 " which also came out in the early ' 90s suffered a similar fate of being a good film that bombed at the box office because it was too associated with the ' 80s . The transition from the ' 80s to the ' 90s was a much faster change then now with the ' 90s and ' 00s . 1991 was nothing like 1988 or 1989 , whereas right now , 2002 and last year 2001 still looks / looked like 1995 or 1996.<br /><br />If only " Excellent Adventure " which was made in 1988 , was released THAT YEAR instead of 1989 , and " Bogus Journey " was made quickly and released in 1989 , then it too would have probably been just as wildly received as the first .
1 One of the most underrated movies I 've seen in a long time , Bill & Ted 's Bogus Journey is the second hilarious adventure of Bill S. Preston Esq . and Ted Theodore Logan , aka Wyld Stallyns . There are two ways to look at this film : First , you see dumb dialogue , far fetched plot , juvenile idea . OR .. You see brilliantly downplayed idiots who yet again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains . Throw a Bruce Willis or a Arnold Schwarzeneggar into this plot and it becomes a big blockbuster movie . Bill and Ted go into the story with the same level of sincerity , only it 's Bill and Ted . This is a tricky fence to balance on , but when you watch the movie not as a throwaway screwball comedy , but as an adventure featuring two guys who have no business being in an adventure , it becomes so much more .
1 I admit it 's very silly , but I 've practically memorized the damn thing ! It holds a lot of good childhood memories for me ( my brother and I saw it opening day ) and I have respect for any movie with FNM on the soundtrack .
1 When I was a kid , I totally loved both Bill & Ted Movies . The other night , Bogus Journey was on and since it was at least 5 years since I last saw it , I decided to tune in . AND I LOVED IT ALL OVER AGAIN ! This film is still funny after all those years . ' Excellent Adventure ' is better , but this one rocks just the same . Sure , some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy , but hey , this entire film is cheesy in a cool way . Plus it features the coolest personation of Death ever in a movie ! Concluding : Totally like non bogus movie dude ! Way Excellent ! STATION ! ! !
1 I would n't dare say this film is better than the original , but it is very good in it 's own right . The comedy in this film is just as good as the original though , there are so many scenes that get me laughing just thinking about them.<br /><br />The story in this film is even more bizarre than the original , but that 's what makes it so great . Peter Hewitt does a great job directing this film with a great cast . The core cast from the original film returns to their characters in this film and all do a fantastic job with their roles . I do n't care what anyone says , I think Keanu Reeves is a great actor ! I really enjoyed his portrayal of Ted in both of these films as I did Alex Winter 's Bill . I was very happy to see George Carlin returning to the role of Rufus , very cool ! Hal London Jr , who plays the part of Ted Logan 's father does a really good job . The scene where Ted possesses his fathers body and Hal London Jr begins acting like Ted is a great scene , and he pulls it off impressively well . I ca n't forget to mention William Sadler as Death , he completely made the movie for me . The rest of the cast is quite good as well.<br /><br />If you liked the first installment of the Bill and Ted series , then I would hope you would like this film as well . But , do n't expect it to be as good as the original . I really hope you enjoy the film , thanks for reading,<br /><br />-Chris
1 It was only on my second viewing , years later , that I realized two things about this movie : 1 ) I enjoyed it immensely , and 2 ) that because its execution is decidedly sharper than the premise itself warrants . I had laughed my way through the movie before it occurred to me to renew my initial protests -- valleyspeak and loogies and airheadedness ( even * good*-natured airheadedness ) just are n't inherently funny , especially when drawn out to feature length . But though the movie 's momentum does begin to sputter out towards the end , Reeves and Winter and Sadler ( and Hal Landon Jr. in an unforgettable scene ) display such a remarkable sense of comic timing throughout that even the more clumsily - scripted jokes ( e.g. Ted failing to recognize a certain inhabitant of Hell ) work as effortlessly as the witter ones ( e.g. the challenge ) . And the teaming of Winter and Reeves clicks so well that the teaming of Bill and Ted ( who spend only one scene separated in the entire movie , disaster if they 're not well - matched ) appears utterly unstrained.<br /><br />(Side note : I found the first movie to be only sporadically entertaining -- sightly different comic sensibilities there , it seems.)<br /><br />I give it a 7.75 . Surprisingly good fun .
1 I got the first Bill and Ted movie for christmas and I had to get the second when I saw it in a store . This one was ( I think ) just as funny as the first but a much wierder story . It was funny how they had their own personnal hell and how they had to play death . The funny thing was that they played him in stupid little games like clue . The only thing I 'd change is Station and Death being in the band but other than that it was great .
1 The first film had little ambition so nothing sticks to the screen . It was a bad version of ' Back to the Future ' with zero charm . Once accepted that Bill & Ted are nitwits , the joke can only get hammered at the audience for so long before it breaks.<br /><br />This is a surprise . This is your only spoiler warning ... <br /><br />By today 's standards , this is more fun . This was shunned upon release , sad considering that more talent is involved than the first time . We get the photographer of ' Face / Off ' , the editor of ' Fugitive ' , a production designer from Burton 's early work , and the sound designer of ' Matrix'.<br /><br />The writers made up for their shallow first outing with something deep . Since this was shunned by the fanbase and public , the director probably decided the style was too extreme . It 's not , it fits the material . Like ' Death Becomes Her ' and ' Catch-22 ' , this dares to be smart , but we like our movies " simple " so we do n't buy it . Probably since this dared to be different is why it took 12 producers to pull it off . What 's so good?<br /><br />--Nice self - reference towards Keanu ; from airhead to Messiah . See also Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br /><br />--Joss hates his creations as much as he hates their counterparts , he makes his own hatred . The Evil B&T and the " good robot usses " have the same vocabulary as their originals : lesser copies and depreciation of language.<br /><br />--The " duality " motif . Nowhere else is this evident than in the photography styles , lots of high and low angles . They even use Roy Brocksmith from ' Total Recall ' to emphasize the point.<br /><br />--The " choices " motif . I do n't know where this started in the genre ( maybe ' Ghostbusters ' ) , but it 's used pretty well here . It even boils down to the 7 games against death -- Battleship and Club.<br /><br />--Film self - reference , even present in the game against Death ( Clue ) . This is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks . Notice the Premier magazine cover at the end : " Bill and Ted : The Movie . " Ironic also how Death and Nomolos were villains in the ' Die Hard ' and ' Lethal Weapon ' sequels.<br /><br />I still have some minor nits , but nothing compared to the original . Music and film are different mediums so it makes no sense why many scripts revolve around the former -- particularly in the teen market . Carlin is a great comedian , but in these movies he 's wasted . Also , for all the daring this effort shows , even cracking gay jokes , they ca n't kill a cat?<br /><br />So , despite looking like a Nickelodeon production , this is incredibly interesting . From this movie we got Beavis and Butt - Head . " We 're in Heaven and we just mugged three people . " < br /><br />Final Analysis = = Midrange Material
1 Anyone who does n't think Bill and Ted 's Bogus Journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs their head checked . It somehow manages to be both completely inane and no - brainer , but also terrifying knowing and clever at the same time . One of those rare films that actually improves upon it predecessor , Bogus Journey can be enjoyed again and again . Notable highlights include the duel with Death and the ending , which is highly " emotional " . Keanu wants to forget all that Matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best , Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted : The Return .
1 What can I say ? I know this movie from start to finish . It 's hilarious . It 's an strong link to my past and will change the way I view film in the future . Hypothetically speaking :) The down - fall ? There 's no Socrates Johnson !
1 My Take : A goofy , yet imaginative mess . < br /><br />Keanu Reeves ( Yes ! That Keanu Reeves ) and Alex Winter return as the two punk - rock idiots in this sequel to the time - trotting adventure comedy BILL AND TED 'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE , now a cult classic . In this sequel , Bill and Ted are given much more to do than travel through time . They might as well travel Heaven and Hell too ! During the beginning of this sequel , Bill and Ted are preparing for a " Battle of the Bands " competition which may make them more famous than ever . Meanwhile , many years in a futuristic civilization , the time - wizard from the first film ( the always watchable George Carlin ) is running a university praising Bill and Ted 's names . There , an evil tyrant ( Joss Ackland , from THE HUNT FOR RED October ) plots to get rid of the two idiot rock - stars once and for all . So he sends two identical android replicas ( In the words of Bill and Ted : Robot Us 's ) to do the dirty job.<br /><br />There after , Bill and Ted experience death and must find their way through Hell , with inhabitants that happens to include the duo 's worst memories , and then through Heaven in an attempt to get back to earth to save their girlfriends ... and their show . Along this whacked - out voyage , they play board games with none other than Death ( William Sadler , from DIE HARD 2 ) , reminiscent to a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film classic THE SEVENTH SEAL , aid help from a couple of intelligent alien beings and more.<br /><br />BOGUS JOURNEY 's array of exuberant special effects gimmicks are n't up to to - date standards , and even some of the humor and the for - the - time look and feel are somewhat dated ( to be honest , the film also feels like it was released on the wrong year , even for the 90 's ) . But with it 's no little lack of imagination and a lively turn by both the performances and direction , BILL AND TED 'S BOGUS JOURNEY is fun , imaginative , and yes , bogus.<br /><br />Rating : * * * 1/2 out of 5 .
1 In the sequel to the brilliant Bill and Ted 's excellent adventure , Bill and Ted are under threat from the future , as the evil Chuck De Nomolos sends two evil robots , disguised as Bill and Ted to earth to kill human Bill and Ted , in order to change the future.<br /><br />In a great comedy pairing , Winter and Reeves excel to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel . Though lacking the sharpness of the first , Bogus Journey still has the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair , not to mention an hilarious performance by William Sadler , who brings a humorous side to the figure of depth , the grim reaper . Watch for the games sequences , the best moment in the entire film , but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre.<br /><br />Though still packed with humour , this film has a more dramatic film towards it , with stakes being more serious and situations more risky . < br /><br />This gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature . The creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism , with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present in the plot . The fantasy genre is again spot on with the use of that amazing time travelling machine , though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing , and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present , as is evident in the final couple of scenes.<br /><br />The first watch I hated this sequel , but the second time was a real joy as I appreciated the jokes and story more , and though the jokes and plot are n't as strong as its predecessor , Bogus Journey has enough feel good motives , jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film .
1 Bill and Ted are back , only this time an evil dude from the future has sent back an evil Bill and Ted to destroy them , thus destroying ' Wyld Stallions ' and the basis for human society in the future . This time Bill and Ted have to travel through the afterlife ' Totally Bogus ' and save humanity ' Excellent'<br /><br />With much of the same zany humour and some wonderful new characters like the grim reaper , station and robot Bill and Ted ( stations creation ) Bogus Journey once again entertains , and is worth watching for its soundtrack alone.<br /><br />7/10 < br /><br />A most triumphant sequel < br /><br />Party on Dudes ! Hehe
1 Bill and Ted 's bogus journey is possible the most excellent film I have ever watched . Though the acting and scenery etc is poor , who cares . The story line is brilliant and the jokes and words they come up with are most excellent , the ideas are great as well . I recommend anyone to see this classic . The best part is obviously when they ' melvin ' death , i was cracking up for 10 minutes and missed the next part of the film . This is so much better then the first one , which was great as well . Possibly the funniest movie of all time ! ! ! ! ! I think the best parts of the film however , are when Bill and Ted shout excellent and play the guitar solo , it was hilarious . Rock on Bill , Ted and Eddie Van Halen , bring out a 3rd film ! !
1 1991 saw the release of the two best sequels of all time : TERMINATOR 2 : JUDGMENT DAY and BILL & TED 'S BOGUS JOURNEY . Out of the two , I 've always liked BILL & TED 'S BOGUS JOURNEY a bit better . TERMINATOR 2 : JUDGMENT DAY is the better made , but there 's just nothing like Bill and Ted . Besides Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY , it 's hard to think of a greater comedic duo than Bill and Ted . They are one of a kind.<br /><br />Seemingly influenced by National Lampoon 's O.C. and Stiggs , Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson , two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while performing at a local theater in L.A. back in the 1980s . The two quickly began writing a screenplay about two and before long BILL & TED 'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was born . The film , shot in 1987 and released in 1989 , became a big box office success and an instant cult classic . It was n't long before work began on the sequel . Stephen Herek , the director of ' EXCELLENT ADVENTURE ' was n't keen on working on the sequel since he considered it to be too mean - spirited and unlike the first one so Peter Hewitt , making his feature film debut , was brought in to direct the sequel . There could n't have been a better director for the job . BILL & TED 'S BOGUS JOURNEY is marvelously directed . It 's filled with its own unique style and energy that ca n't be matched.<br /><br />What makes ' BOGUS JOURNEY ' one of the best sequels ever is that it while it is darker than the original , it is just as fun . It does n't change the characters like most sequels do . Bill and Ted are the same lovable characters that they were in the first film . This is because it was written by the original writers . Most sequels are not written by the same writers as the first one , but since ' BOGUS JOURNEY ' had the same screenwriters , it ended up being just as good as ' EXCELLENT ADVENTURE ' if not even better . Just like the first one , ' BOGUS JOURNEY ' is absolutely hilarious , well written , fun , and above all , original . It 's filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comedic performances from Alex Winter , Keanu Reeves , and William Sadler . It 's an unforgettable ' journey ' . 10/10
1 When will people learn that some movies are made for fun and are not necessarily out to change the world ? If you realise this then expect to have heaps of fun while watching " Bill and Ted 's bogus journey . " This is a movie that is heaps of fun to watch , Keanu and Alex make a great on screen team reprising their characters from " Bill and Ted 's excellent adventure " with even more ' style ' then they had in 1st movie . It 's not rocket science but it 's great for a laugh , the characters being extremely like - able and the story - line being so radical you have to laugh . Do n't expect ' deep - and - meaningfulls ' just expect pure fun !
1 Oh , come on , learn to have a little fun . When I was a kid , oh , this movie was Oscar - worthy to me . I thought it was absolutely hysterical . One of the best movies I had seen.<br /><br />Now , it 's a little stupid , but come on . If you enjoyed " Excellent Adventure " , you should most likely have fun with " Bogus Journey " . This was the movie before " Dude , where 's my car ? " . Only this one is actually funny . Like I said , it 's just a good time . It should n't be taken seriously and if you enjoyed the first one , you should like " Bogus Journey " . It 's just a funny movie with some memorable characters . For your enjoyment only , watch it , let go , and remember that it 's a silly comedy . That 's all.<br /><br />7/10
1 I realize that alot of people hate this movie , but i must admit that it is one of my favorites . I happen to like it better then its predeccesor and happy to like it better than alot of movies.<br /><br />First off , I think that people never give the story any credit , much like Back to the Future , Time Travel is hard to write , and in this movie they included Time Travel and a Spiritual Journey.<br /><br />I also feel that Keanu and Alex were on there best performances in this movie , they looked cooler , acted cooler , and said cooler things.<br /><br />The set design of this movie is awsome as well , The sets are quite detailed and massive at times and it can be hard to believe that these sets were made for a movie about two teenage buds who can hardly spell ... but is nt that the genius of the whole franchise , making these two idiots bigger than life characters that are responsible for the entire utopian future of earth.<br /><br />The costume design was awsome as well . Bill and Ted actually look cool in Bogus Journey , where as in Excellent Adventure they look rather like , well as they would put it , FAGS!!!<br /><br />Even the music in this movie is awsome , the score especially . There so much i could say about this film , cause i love it . But this is one of those movies i grew up watching and everytime i did i liked it more , so i can understand why people hate or just think its Bogus compared to Excellent adventure ( which i also love by the way).<br /><br />GET DOWN WITH YOUR BAD SELF ! ! ! !
1 Go way back to page ten of this review section , and work your way back up . Go ahead ; I 'll wait.<br /><br />Done ? Well , then you 've probably noticed the same trend that I have . You could nitpick all day long about the lame jokes , dated timing and obviously derivative plot points and shtick in ' Bogus ' , but this movie seems to be one of those ' hate me now , love me later " flicks.<br /><br />Bill and Ted 's biggest problem was that the original appealed to those 80 's kids who followed the tends and considered themselves on the cutting edge of fashion . That worked fine for the original , but obviously bombed in 1991 , when no self - unrespecting slacker would be caught dead wearing anything but flannel or admitting he liked anything about the 80 's . As Ted would put it : " Dude , this is a totally deep hole . Wanna play 20 questions ? " < br /><br />They say nostalgia goes in 20 year cycles , and that certainly seems to be the case here . Here in 2010 , those of use who grew up with Cindi Lauper and Megadeth are beginning to look back to appreciate some of those pivotal films that ( like it or not ) made us who we are . If you 're one of those who look at ' Bogus ' as if it were an outdated ( " Fa gs ! " ) ripoff , then you 're missing the point and probably spent six years growing facial hair , wearing flannel and looking like you just crawled out of bed.<br /><br />In self - referencing its own origins ( the Star Trek episode " and and time traveling with a phone booth ) , B&T makes no attempt to hide its creators ' love for homage . Quentin Tarantino , anyone ? I 'm not saying ' Bogus ' is ' True Love , ' but I do think it needs to be appreciated for what it is : a fun snap - shot of our society at a time before child psychology , Ritalin , anti - smoking ads , terrorist paranoia and the proliferation of media fear - mongering . < br /><br />So , for all of you B&T haters out there ... turn off your Screaming Trees CD , get that hair out of your face , go to the beach and lighten up . Narcissistic depression and intellectual ennui are SO corporate .
1 Visual creative epic of inimitable style.<br /><br />This film may neither have the most alternative dramaturgy nor the most artistic acting . But who dares to say this film is no art ? I 'm not a supporter of the idea , that an important film must be serious , non - commercial or bothering me with questions . Even there are a lot of films , apposite to this attributes , that I like.<br /><br />Bogus Journey , for sure , is not one of this films . What you get is pure , excessive creativity with a very positive charged , childlike energy . This film does n't reflect reality . Its friendly - naive and utopian . Imagine the world of the future described by Rufus - for me it would be a pretty nice time - place combination to live in ! Except of that music ; - ) < br /><br />Technically , Bogus Jorney is very well made . I always liked the cinematography and the sceneries of this movie . Especially in this point Bogus Journey tops its prequel by far . Also the effects are good , and I think most of them very made without cgi . I generally prefer the good old effects in big budget movies . Sure its ' just another Hollywood movie ' out of some peoples view . But I think it is this in a very charismatic way.<br /><br />A short word to the soundtrack : all the band and orchestral music fits very well into the film . Also the sound design has no lack . I am not a big fan of rock music , but I had to get this track by Winger from the scene ' station ' builds the bill and ted robots in the van . I love the unorthodox camera work at its beginning.<br /><br />Let me conclude saying this:<br /><br />This film is very naive and very imaginative ! It is way better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin , The Godfather , Eraserhead or Aguirre - the wrath of god . It is absolutely superior to citizen kane , apocalypse now or chris markers sans soleil ... ... it is even better than Total Recall ... No way ! ? Yes way!<br /><br />Bill and Ted 's Bogus Journey is simply the best movie ever made.<br /><br />Who dares to disagree makes himself guilty of " artsie - fartsy behavior " or likes Terminator Salvation ( what is the bigger self - defamation)<br /><br />PS : part 1 is not the better movie . So Bogus Jorney is a superior sequel . Not even Terminator 2 is a superior sequel ! Its NOT !
1 Will and Ted 's Bodacious journey is an existential trip through themes of mortality , religion , time , Heaven and Hell , man 's quest for fame and his fears of the body being overcome by a soulless machine . It is the most intelligent work of fiction since Paradise Lost and references many great past works of art- Dante , Iron Maiden , Virgil , Shakespeare . This time the dudes are a famous rock band having travelled through time collecting icons from the past- Napolean , Joan Of Ark ( Noah 's wife ) , Oscar Wilde , and Charles Darwin . They took the skills they learned from each of these people , abducted a couple of Princesses , and finally learned to play their guitars and write hit songs . These songs teach the world to love again and war , hunger , evil are vanquished for eternity . We fast forward into the distant future where an evil dictator who despises good music called Simon Cow - Al wants to rule the world . He eats Rooshus ( the cool guy from the first film who helps Bill Playboy Esquire and Ted Theodore Alvin ) and gains the power to send two cyborgs back in time . The cyborgs are living tissue over metal exoskeleton and coated in mimetic poly alloy allowing them the survive the turmoil of time travel , and they can imitate anything they sample by physical contact . It is their job to Kill the good Biff and Fred and take over their lives by making terrible music that no - one could like . By doing this they will change the world forever- Gryll and Jed 's music will never be made leaving a world of war , famine , and hatred , and more annoyingly , bland boy / girl group pop music . There is a startling twist as the good guys actually are killed and they have to work out a way to save the world , themselves , and their wives from the evil Dopplebangers inhabiting their bodies.<br /><br />Penelope Spheerhead shows her knowledge of both youth culture and real culture by mixing modern day music and phrases with post modern sets and artistic references , and seeks to teach us all something by delving into our very psyche to show us ourselves . She presents the nightmares which faced the late 80s teen in a society which had abandoned them and beckons us to dissect the post structuralist jingoism , self love , and malaise of the time . Charging us with a belief that we can indeed change the world it is an inspiring message , but in order to achieve such dreams we must traverse and indeed face our nightmares . To overcome is to succeed , to defeat Death is the first step in truly living and not merely surviving . In the words of Kenneth Reeves- ' Wow ! ' Best Scene : For a fun game- see how many songs , bands , and albums cover references you can spot throughout the film . There are at least 6 .
1 Okay , I 'll admit it -- I am a goof - ball and I occasionally love a really silly comedy . While I have seen more films by Kurosawa , Bergman and Truffaut than practically anyone on the planet , I still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that does n't try to be sophisticated but is simply funny . A few such films that immediately come to mind are MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL , UHF , START THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME , STRANGE BREW and the Bill and Ted movies . They all lack snob appeal but only a zombie or professional film critic could dislike them.<br /><br />While BILL & TED 'S BOGUS JOURNEY is n't as wonderful as the original Bill and Ted film , it still is great fun . Also , unlike the original , it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing . I remember not loving the film the first time I saw it -- possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs . But , every time I see it again I am amazed at all the great moments -- particularly those involving the Grim Reaper . And , by the way , this reaper is about as different from Bergman 's in THE SEVENTH SEAL as you can get ! ! In addition to a lot of laughs , this film features some excellent music -- one way that it 's actually better than the first film . The Kiss anthem at the end is great but so are the rest of the hard rock tunes -- provided you are n't an old killjoy like De Nomolos . Great viewing for kids and adults alike .
1 Now this is more like it ! The first movie had some iffy dialogue and some weaker acting , but it seems like the team behind this got their stuff together for the sequel and put out a solid , thoroughly enjoyable , hilarious and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats the whole way through.<br /><br />Seriously , this is just full of great stuff , brimming with creativity , and it 's less of a spoof on 80s movies at the same time . The scenes in Hell are great , and so are the ones in Heaven . There 's really no shortage to the mad - cap adventurous romp that this one promises , and you will never see another movie like this . Even the hammy final act of the movie is n't as bad as the first one , being generally heartwarming and enjoyable in its extremely cliché repertoire of family fun movie bliss . And even Keanu Reeves , despite looking about 30 , is n't that bad here.<br /><br />Sounds like a good deal to me .
1 Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as the two dopes from San Dimas who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite the way it was presented in the first movie.<br /><br />The only difference is that their trip is " somewhere " between Heaven and Hell and ends up being both . When they meet the Grim Reaper , they get the chance of an after - lifetime to play him for a chance to return and stop two evil robots from ruining what future they were supposed to have . Besides playing roles they have ... er ... perfected , they also play ( and revive a couple of extra sales in the process ) some classic games ( I even have my original copy of Battleship in the closet).<br /><br />The reason I liked this movie better than the original is because it deals with " what it might be like " instead of " what was . " Without spoiling the movie , I ca n't give you anymore information about this ( I guess you 'll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself ! 8 out of 10 stars .
1 Bill and Ted 's Bogus Journey is the sequel to Bill and Ted 's excellent adventure . Their bogus journey follower almost directly after the first movie , and does just as good of a job if not better to entertain the viewer.<br /><br />The plot is an evil person from the future is trying to kill Bill and Ted using evil robots that look exactly like Bill and Ted . Once the robots kill Bill and Ted , they must compete with the grim reaper ( death ) and return their lives to normal.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is top notch , and even thought it is a little weird at times , especially Bill and Ted 's conversations , it is a great movie . The wannabe rockers sure have made another great movie . Pick this up the next time your at blockbuster !
1 It may have not been up for academy awards and admittedly , it 's pretty cheesy , but it 's just so much fun ! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted . Lovable , optimistic , and hilarious , Bill and Ted are a great way to unwind.<br /><br />Although I love Excellent Adventure , Bogus Journey is funnier to me . Death is flippin hilarious and Bill and Ted are even more endearing . People give me grief about loving this movie , but only really pretentious movie - watchers will say it 's not even a bit entertaining .

Cyborgs are sent to the past present and they actually murder the real Bill & Ted . Now , Both guys are spirits and they have to travel through Heaven and Hell to save themselves and their future.<br /><br />Directed by Peter Hewitt ( Tom and Huck , The Borrowers ) made a clever sequel with terrific visual effects . Much more funny and entertaining than the original . William Sadler ( The Shawshank Redemption ) steals the show as The Grim Reaper.<br /><br />DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen ( 1.85:1 ) transfer and an fine - Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound . DVD has the theatrical trailer and an amusing behind the scenes featurette . This sequel was a Box Office hit like the original but it is also ( Believe it or not ) , one of the best sequels ever made ( depending on your point of view ) . George Carlin reprises his role from the original briefly . Pam Grier also appears in a bit role . It 's a enjoyable fantasy comedy . ( * * * * / * * * * * ) .
1 This movie is awesome . If you take it too seriously , of course you will hate it ; however , it 's quantity of " dudes " and " right ons " brings laughs and faint memories of about 15 years ago . I like its ability to make me simply chuckle at obvious jokes and silliness , and its ability to make me want to watch its precursor , " Bill and Ted 's Excellent Adventure " ( 1989 ) . If you are looking for a film full of multifaceted jokes , and totally mature humor , do n't watch it ; however , if you want a film that is humorous and silly , yet intelligent and engaging , you will enjoy it . I actually wish more of this sort of picture showed up in today 's theatres . And hey , it 's Keanu Reeves acting the way everyone parodies him as acting ... right ... doesn't get much better than that :)
1 As with a bunch of guys at school we must give this a thumbs up . Even the Grim Ripper made us smile . Those two alien things made me laugh , Bill and Ted were the stupidest yet the funnest in the entire movie . This is a lot better than the first one . And yet for some reason I feel that it misses something . Something big . Something important . Made a better house and girlfriends . No , I 'd say better villains . Use clones instead of robots . I gave this a 7 out of 10 because of those two robotic doinks.<br /><br />The Grim Ripper , do n't be scared he 's not the deathy kind , is funny . When he fell from the sky I split a gut . Splat , I 'm not sure about those aliens . What where they ? Scientists ? No way .
1 Made only ten years after the actual events , and set in the Bunker under the Reichstag , Pabst 's film is wholly gripping . It reeks of sulfurous death awaiting the perpetrators of world war . Have n't seen this in over three decades , but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory . The characters seem to be waiting to be walled up in their cave . Searing bit of dialog between two Generals : " Does God exist ? " " If He did , we would n't . " Shame this is not more readily available for exhibition or purchase because it would be interesting to view and compare this film with the documentary about Traudl Junge , " I m Toten Winkel " { aka " Blind Spot : Hitler 's Secretary " ) and " Downfall " with Bruno Ganz .
1 I remember this film from many years ago . Certainly the best film on the subject in my experience . The fact that I vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact . < br /><br />It is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language barrier . But they were nonetheless very powerful.<br /><br />This subject continues to fascinate us even with the passing of years . And it was most effectively treated here , with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticism.<br /><br />I wish it would be shown on TV at least once . Or at least be available on tape or DVD . Or is it ? Is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it ? ?
1 I remember watching this film on Saturday afternoon TV in the 1950s or 60s . It was well presented but I do remember there was a message of hope broadcast from transmitters secreted in lamposts in one of the last maniacal executions for impending liberation . I 'm not sure that squares with the facts.<br /><br />Still the film is well done . The German High Command reports wryly without emotion " The Russians are advancing down The Fredrich Strasse " as if all went according to plan.<br /><br />it was my impression that this film and a later American made for TV knock - off was based on the British historian Trevor - Roper 's account by a similar title Last Days of Hitler . I was surprised to see no credit to Trevor - Roper.<br /><br />I agree the newest German film on the subject DOWNFALL was as well done as the classic . The American knock - off was a little flat.<br /><br />Few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as Adolph . Yet I find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever speak of Hitler 's double alluded to in passing in John Toland 's magnificent historical piece.<br /><br />Was gibs ?
1 This short film that inspired the soon - to - be full length feature - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers . The short film stars Edward the Spatula who after being fired from his job , joins in the fight against the evil spoons . This premise allows for some funny content near the beginning , but is barely present for the remainder of the feature . This film 's 15-minute running time is absorbed by some odd - ball comedy and a small musical number . Unfortunately not much else lies below it . The plot that is set up does n't really have time to show . But it 's surely follows it plot better than many high - budget Hollywood films . This film is worth watching at least a few times . Take it for what it is , and do n't expect a deep story .
1 This film is unusual and bizarre , and it is nearly unusual and bizarre in a very good way . I give this short a 7 just because it is so unique and off - the - wall , but much of the time it seems as though it is being bizarre just for the sake of being bizarre . If the film had managed to integrate its more bizarre moments into some semblance of a plot then it would have been really fantastic.<br /><br />The main problem here is that it looks as though the creators just jumbled together a bunch of crap about spatulas , then threw in a whole bunch more crap that sounded as though it would sound funny coming from the mouth of a spatula.<br /><br />This is definitely worth checking out , but it is not top rate by any stretch of the creators wild imaginations .
1 I know that you 've already entered this in film festivals ( or at least I think you have , I may just be making that up ) but I think this should get " best animated short film " in every one . Bravo . I ca n't wait for the full film . I realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations , but hear it now and accept it as the truth . Kudos , my friend . Okay , now I 'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... Though I still mean it . And here comes yet another -SHOE!- and I can not stop here yet . This is extremely annoying and yet at the same time I have nothing better to do . In fact , I 'll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic " Jason Steele Marathon . " I do have a lot of those.<br /><br />-R
1 This is a great short . i think every voice is done by jason steele . ( you can only just barely tell if you 've heard his normal voice though , so do n't worry about them sounding the same . they do n't . ) its about 15 minutes long.<br /><br />edward the spatula is fighting the war against spoons and he meets some weird people . in fact , everyone he knows seem pretty crazy . < br /><br />"edward ! " " general peterson , we have to get you to a medical unit ! " " no , I 'm not gon na make it edward . " " do nt talk like that , I 'm sure you 'll be fine . " " i m a goner edward , and you know it . before i go- " " yes ? " " can i just have ... one kiss ? " " umm , no . " " come on , just one , small , peck on the lips ? " " i m walking away now sir." < br /><br />there 's gon na be movie pretty soon . the date for that is in September , but its probably gon na get pushed back .
1 I laughed a lot while watching this . It 's an amusing short with a fun musical act and a lot of wackiness . The characters are simple , but their simplicity adds to the humor stylization . The dialog is funny and often unexpected , and from the first line to the last everything just seems to flow wonderfully . There 's Max , who has apparently led a horrible life . And there 's Edward , who is n't sure what life he wants to lead . My favorite character was Tom , Edward 's insane boss . Tom has a short role but a memorable one . Highly recommended for anyone who likes silly humor . And you can find it online now , which is a bonus ! I am a fan of all of Jason 's cartoons and ca n't wait to see what he comes out with next .
1 I 've watched it plenty of times and I 'm planning on buying the full feature . I love all of Jason Steele 's comedy . It 's very different and unique and is very enjoyable . I love indie films and this one is just great . The plot is strange but very funny . This short film is about a talking Spatula named Edward . The order of the events are a bit jumbled , making this film very interesting to watch . At first you see Edward fighting the spoons , but then the focus changes to earlier in his life . This is a silly movie , but of course , it 's still great . I highly recommend that you watch this film at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com . It 's very funny . The humour may not match everybody 's taste but watch anyway . It 'll only take 16 minutes of your time , and it 's free . GO WATCH SPATULA MADNESS !
1 I 've never seen many online movies in most of my life , but if I 'd pick any of them , I 'd pick Spatula Madness , A clever reference to most movies like star trooper ( etc . ) , using a camera , and wits of steel , Jason Steele mastered the art of turning a normal image into a painting , and then putting it all together with frame - by - frame animation to get a world inhabited by spatulas . the story begins at the middle , how s that for directors delight ? then the middle is at the beginning , and so on , when I first watched it , I expected a soggy pixely look , but Jason , Like me , Loves looks , so took every detail to the max . although I do n't recommend it for children , or would anybody besides me like it , but please search it up on the net ( its a short film , look up film cow ) , its style reminds me of south park , but less violent . 10 for the look , 6 for the laughs , and 6 for the story , it all comes to a 10/10 , good work < br /><br />Jason Steele , I 'm anxious to see the movie .
1 I love this movie / short thing . Jason Steele is amazing ! My favorite parts are The French Song and in the opening title when the spatula soldier yells " SPOONS ! " I crack up every time . I would recommend this movie to Knox Klaymation fans , and people who enjoy Jason Steele 's other movies . His style of animation is very original . It takes a few views to notice the detailed backgrounds . His humor is also hilarious , and is definitely not something you 'd hear before . Like Max the deformed Spatula who has a sound and light system in his head that beams colorful lights and happy music whenever he talks about his miserable life . This is a wonderful animation to watch anytime any where .
1 Many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path : murder most foul , gathering of clues , gaggle of possible perps , sprinkling of red herrings , and inevitable showdown between clever evildoer and even more clever crime solver.<br /><br />"Forgotten " abandons the well - trod and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts . The fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly - tied package might frustrate some , but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes , disturbs , and haunts with the question : What does an evil person look like?<br /><br />Excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily ... forgotten .
1 This is possibly the best short crime drama I 've ever seen . The acting is superb especially Amanda Burton who 's character goes from scary to sweet to disturbing to sad and then some ... She does an amazing job balancing Rachels / Carlas feelings and acting out the pain of someone who 's lost a child , its so believable that it feels more like a real life story then a drama . The other actors are of course great too which they usually are in British TV / Film . The ending , which I 'm not going to give away , is fantastic mainly because you do n't really get one ... ( you 'll get what I mean after you 've seen it ) This is well worth buying and seeing over and over again and if you 're not touched by this you 're one cold hearted person .
1 Tight script , good direction , excellent performances , strong cast , effective use of locations .... <br /><br />Paul McGann gives a detailed , subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.<br /><br />There is an interesting moral & emotional journey happening with his character ( Ben Turner ) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton . Inevitably they cross over ... Who has done what?<br /><br />The examination of WHY , both in the past and in the present , rather than WHO might have yielded a more interesting , Dostoyevskian story , but hey , who 's complaining?<br /><br / >
1 I thoroughly enjoyed this movie , but it is nothing new.<br /><br />Everyone here is grouping it with other war movies , this movie has been miscategorized ! Its not a war movie any more than " One flew over the cuckoos nest " is a asylum movie or " Cool Hand Luke " is a prison movie . This is a movie about individuality , nonconformity , self - confidence and the costs of that personality type.<br /><br />The plot is the same as " One flew over the Cuckoos nest " and " Cool Hand Luke " , its in GOOD company , and it holds its own . Its these movies it should be held up against and compared , not " Apocalypse Now " or " Platoon".<br /><br />Eric
1 War drama that takes place in Louisiana in 1971 . It follows a bunch of recruits through basic training and then Tigerland -- an accurate portrayal of Vietnam on American soil , before they 're shipped over . It focuses on two men -- Booz ( Colin Farrell ) and Paxton ( Matthew Davis) ... how they meet , become friends and deal with a corwardly squadron leader ( Clifton Collins Jr. ) and a borderline psycho ( Shea Wingham).<br /><br />A surprisingly non - commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher . He uses a hand - held camera throughout most of the movie and uses digital video for the combat scenes . It works very well -- the film looks gritty ( as it should ) and uncomfortably realistic.<br /><br />Farrell successfully covers up his Irish brogue and adopts a pretty convincing Southern accent . His performance is just superb -- he 's an extremely talented young man . Davis , unfortunately , is not that good . He 's tall , muscular , very handsome -- and very bland . The rest of the cast however is just great.<br /><br />This film was thrown away by its studio . It had no stars in it , a familar story and was considered " just another war film " . It only played a week in Boston ! It 's well worth catching on video or DVD.<br /><br />Also , Farrell and Davis have a lengthy nude scene .
1 While it was filmed at a Florida National Guard site , " Tigerland " totally reminded me of Fort Polk , LA . , firing ranges , maneuver areas , waist - deep water and all . The movie was fairly authentic and the characters similar to those same ones at my AIT in 1974 . The difference between the Tigerland year , 1971 , and mine of 1974 is all the drill sergeants and instructors knew they were n't going back to Vietnam , as it was pretty much all over , so training was very relaxed - not a challenge at all . That was the precursor to all our troubles in the 70s and 80s , which I know for a fact as I stayed in until 2004 . I never heard anyone mention " Tigerland " but the Army did have realistic Vietnam training villages at different bases across the U.S. Vietnam Vets tell me that up to 1972 Basic & AIT could be pretty rough and rugged , because the trainers had been there and were mandated to train Vietnam - bound men those skills to make it , although that was not always the case . Both a drill sergeant at Polk and later one of my Vietnam Vet NCOs , when we had become instructors at a basic training brigade at Fort Bliss , told me there was nothing they could do to get anyone ready and people just had to find out and figure out for themselves . This movie rates high .
1 I really like this movie . Bozz is an ultra - cool , not to be intimidated soldier who does not want to go to war . His persona is similar in a way to Yossarian in Catch-22 , Joseph Heller 's classic novel about men and war . This film , however , is not set in a war zone , but in a pre - war combat prep training . This wonderful film is all about the sickening realization that the Vietnam war was a mistake and those men who were pegged to be sacrificed for a losing cause.<br /><br />Colin Farrell is brilliant as Bozz , a soldier who showed as much genuine love and compassion for his fellow soldier as he did disdain and irreverence for the establishment that was trying to kill him . Bozz is totally cool and non - plussed , testing and tweaking his military superiors , getting their goat at every opportunity . He is a Jesus Christ figure with a psychology degree , " saving " his fellow soldiers and showing the ones in genuine need , the way out of this man 's army.<br /><br />The acting and action is crisp and believable and as a " Sleeper " , Tigerland goes down with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket as one of the top three Vietnam films in my opinion.<br /><br />FIVE STARS , a top pick .
1 TIGERLAND / ( 2000 ) * * * 1/2 ( out of four)<br /><br />By Blake French:<br /><br / > 	 Throughout the years audiences have seen and understood war films with every point of view possible , and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of portraying various soldiers on the battlefield . Joel Schumacher ( " 8MM , " " A Time to Kill " ) , easily one of the riskiest directors currently working , has found resemblance with " The Thin Red Line " in the way his new drama " Tigerland " steps in an individual soldier 's shoes . This movie , written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther , has more guts and irony than " The Thin Red Line " or even " Saving Private Ryan . " Although the movie 's dramatic impact is somewhat lessened due to the perversity of the material present , it certainly enlightens us on a new perspective of young men training for war . < br /><br / > 	 I would want to know Joel Schumacher 's experiences with the army . Are the men really this unabashed and brutal ? I am sure some of them are , but the movie views its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz ( Colin Farrell ) , who is rebellious against the ideas of war . His personality instantly counteracts with several other characters , one who becomes his best friend , Paxton ( Matthew Davis ) , and another , Wilson ( Russell Richardson ) , whose flamed temper often exasperates Bozz 's tension with the idea of going to war . The war depicted in this production is not found on a battlefield , but on training grounds of a Louisiana - based instruction camp between conceptions and fears of the soldiers in training . This film is specifically about the preparation for war , nothing more nothing less . It ends when the soldiers finally go to war , kind of disappointing since witnessing the characters in action would have served as a supurb payoff . < br /><br / > Shot on location in about 28 days using 16 mm stock and a minuscule budget , Joel Schumacher accurately displays a gritty , perverse , cruel , and unmerciful atmosphere using hand - held cinematography , unique lighting techniques and direct sound . Schumacher 's grainy and blown - out images make the movie feel like a documentary feature . This unusual style of filmmaking only contributes to the hard core realism of the movie , quite graphic in its use of coarse language , perhaps a little too disturbing . Waves of four - letter words pound the audience , some in shock of what they are hearing . Even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not keep the dialogue from prevailing as heartbreaking , true , and emotional.<br /><br / > 	 If anything , " Tigerland " provides us with a minor appreciation of how much our soldiers go through for our country in the beginning stages of combat . Such bravery must it take to enlist in the army during times of war , knowing the hardships and risks that are being taken . Such thought - provoking ideas are made possible through the heartbreaking performances by the young aspiring actors who portray the various trainees . This movie is not for all audiences , but one that young men should take a look at before enlisting themselves in the army ... and adult audiences should watch to appreciate the courage needed to do such . < br /><br / >
1 First off , this movie was a wild ride the whole way . The story of the training of the soldiers , fighting with their superiors , and in the end grouping together.<br /><br />From the very beginning to the very end . This is one War Drama worth seeing if you are in for the constant cussing ( at times beyond reason ) and the horrors of what boot camp are.<br /><br />The dynamics of how the actors interacted was quite amazing at times , and sometimes humorous . How Bozz ( Colin Farrel ) deals with Paxton ( Matthew Davis ) throughout the storyline , from camp to Tigerland , and even in the end helping him.<br /><br />The innovative free - hand filming did add a certain taste or flavor to the film . Constant moving , constant action , and just constant confusion . At times , it was a help . Others , not so much.<br /><br />Throughout the film , it was increasingly realistic . Some points in the film ( the sex scenes in particular ) seemed to be just a tad too realistic even though they added an effect to the movie that would n't have been there without them . it was a very gritty movie , through and through.<br /><br />In my opinion , this is one of Colin Farrel 's better movies ( if not his top performance ) . The acting for every character was superb . 9/10 -sysnuk3r
1 In Joel Schumacher , you have one of the most inconsistent film makers of all time . But this is common knowledge ; I think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time , failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur . Hitchcock liked his suspense and his horror / thriller ; Chaplin liked his comedy ; Scorsese likes his crime driven mafia stories amongst others and Spielberg likes his large scale , big budget adventure films that combine just enough violence for the adults and fun for the kids . Other more obscure examples include Kubrick and Welles who covered too much to write about here.<br /><br />But Schumacher is the sort of guy who makes a flawed film revolving around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolving around a seemingly dull premise . Falling Down had a great idea behind it but I found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy . Batman is a superhero ; superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me . Then comes 8MM ; a film with a basic premise that is executed in an impressive manner before Tigerland which is Schumacher 's best film from what I 've so far seen , in my opinion . With the war genre , laughter is n't something you 'd associate with it for most of the time . I can remember scoffing at the absurdity of the D - Day landings during Saving Private Ryan : at the time when I first saw the film , I had not much knowledge of the Second World War bar when it began and finished . My eyebrows were up , my mouth slightly open with a weak ' I ca n't believe it smile ' on my face . Needless to say , it was because of that film I searched out learning a bit more on what that event was all about and the war as a whole . In Tigerland , you are invited to laugh at the absurdity of war through Bozz ( Farrell ) , a tough and egotistical soldier training for the Vietnam War.<br /><br />But what 's clever here is that there are no jaw dropping war scenes of fighting and death and destruction ; just one man and his battle with the system for most of the time . The things he says and the audacity at which he deals with his predicament is reminiscent of a school child winding up a series of teachers at an extremely strict boarding school . Tigerland may borrow from Full Metal Jacket in the sense it is a training routine for the Vietnam War but egos and superegos play more of a part here , I think . The superegos that are the drill sergeants go up against Bozz whose ego is extremely large . There is also the third part of Freud 's triangle that sneaks into Bozz : the ID . Compared to all the other soldiers who all have rather large egos , Bozz is the only one brave enough to show it in front of the sergeants thus suggesting he is allows what he should n't do to float to the surface and express itself : " You are all dead in this situation ! " barks a sergeant . " Any Questions ? " " Yeah , if I 'm dead how come I can ask a question ? " replies Bozz whose punishments such as push - ups and dirt eating seem to un - faze him in true ID style ; that is he enjoys the punishments.<br /><br />Also regarding the superegos , Bozz at one point tries to command a group of soldiers in field training . This is something the existing captain of the squad can not do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the superego required for the job and the confidence to tell Bozz he is in charge . What follows is an actual conversation between Bozz and an existing drill sergeant who gives him his Christian name . This is where Private Wilson 's ( Whigham ) character steps in : His uncontrollable rage and anger at Bozz explodes at certain time all culminating in the film 's only real scenes of a shootout which is in the form of a training exercise in a river . Wilson can not control his impulses and dislike toward Bozz and acts out.<br /><br />What I also liked about Tigerland is that it 's shot in such a way that is brave . While lacking in innovation , Tigerland seems to use lower grade film stock or lesser cameras to get across its gritty look . Make no mistake that this could have been a pretty looking film with lots of colour and attractiveness . But , we get a documentary approach in the final piece making everything look like it was shot on a typical everyday camera for TV ; the emphasis on the hand held is also apparent but Schumacher is clever : he never allows the film to become too much like a mockumentry whilst at the same time suggesting the film 's budget could 've been half of what it was . It 's worth saying here that Spielberg said he wanted Saving Private Ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those lines and as if it was recorded from the war scenes.<br /><br />While being very funny and entertaining , Tigerland is still a great study of what makes people tick ; not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute . Its study on one man and how much he hates the system that he can not even take it seriously is fascinating as is the drive of each soldier . There are several memorable scenes and situations culminating in a happy , if not unhappy ending that 'll open your mind and make you think about what it 's perhaps really like in the military .
1 Really touching story of a recruitment camp in America , where young men are prepared for the Vietnam war . The human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies , because it translates personal , subjective opinions on war , opposed war action movies where action , and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor . < br /><br />The movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject , and manages to distance itself from usual war movies , especially by focusing on an anti - hero from the view - point of traditional standard . The movie focuses on the tragic character of Bozz , who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine , and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he does n't believe in , spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas , both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war . Perfect irony.<br /><br />The acting is truly exceptional , and the documentary - style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie . Also the movie will provide food for thought for those exhilarated by the action in usual war movies or war - games enthusiasts , hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being drafted .
1 The dehumanising effect of war is a much - studied subject in the movies ; as is the equally dehumanising , but potentially life - saving , dehumanising effect of military training . Joel Schumacher 's ' Tigerland ' follows the standard template , we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers , with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers , and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified ; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained ( typically , as here , Vietnam ) . But ' Tigerland ' has an interesting take , by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz ( played outstandingly well by Colin Farrell ) , who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent , and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity . Around this character , a taught , gripping plot has been constructed , and it 's also a plus that the action never leaves America ( whereas Stanley Kubrick 's ' Full Metal Jacket ' , to name just one other film of a similar type , lost focus once the action shifted to Asia ) . Although this is not a film of staggering originality , it 's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout : the best film from this director that I 've seen , and among the very best of its genre .
1 I had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam because of mental problems he experienced after coming back . So when I saw part of this movie one night on a pay - for - view channel I was intrigued . I wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt as he got ready for Vietnam . I went out and rented this movie and I have to say it is the most heart - wrenching film I have ever seen . I bought the DVD immediately after renting it . The way it pulls you in so many different directions emotionally is something I 've never experienced with any other film . As far as Vietnam subject films go , I think it is the best one , although Platoon runs a close second . Besides all of that , I think it is also Colin Farrell 's best performance as an actor . I like him in most of his movies but in this one he was incredible . I gave this a 10 rating because it is one of my top five favorite movies .
1 Producer Joel Schumacher who also directed " Phone Booth",'02 , and many other great films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into COMBAT ! ! Colin Farrell(Roland Bozz),"Intermission",'03 , gave one of his best performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back . Matthew Davis(Jim Paxton),"Blue Crush",'02 , gave a great supporting role and Shea Whigham(Pvt . Wilson),"All The Real Girls",'03 , showed his true acting skills in the role that he played . There was two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires . One Army Veteran instructor from Viet Nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body . Enjoyable and entertaining film to view .
1 To me this was Colin Farrells best movie evr ! He introduced himself to America through this movie and he was great . He really got you into his charictor and made u feel the passion he was putting into his role . In my opinion it is a great movie and my favorite .
1 If you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it , then Tigerland is the film for you . I love this movie from top to bottom . This movie 's picture - perfect scenes look so real ; it 's almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama . Boy , I tell you ... REAL drama they actually real " fought " in one of the scenes ( get the DVD listen to the commentary its not obvious ) . I see this film as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape an ill - fated destiny , after watching Saving Private Ryan I have an a appreciation of what an " ill - fated destiny " is and know exactly how the men in the film feel . I see this movie as a crossbreed between " Stand By Me " and " Saving Private Ryan . " What do men do when they are with a situation that 's " hard pressed " in real life ? Some men go crazy , some men cry , some men through fists , others do drugs , some randomly sleep with hookers ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of love from their life , some try drink the pain away , some jump off buildings or bridges , some feel guilty and others feel so much agony it makes them so sick they collapse - physically . This movie has all those desperate emotions rolled into one ball . But do n't get me wrong its not depressing movie , its realistic , its a very very humorous movie , the cocky and funny Bozz ( Collin 's Character ) lights it all up , and on top of that there are about 5 female actresses in the movie ; I 'll let you figure out what their in there for ! With dialogue , war / action sequences , picture perfect scenes along with appropriate music ; this movie has it all , like I said : from top to bottom . I do n't why Tigerland is heavily under - credited . The best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it says in big bold writing " The best film of the year , " and it absolutely falls nothing short of that . Keep the rare gems coming Hollywood , 10/10 .
1 While I suppose this film could get the rap as being Anti - Vietnam , while watching it I did n't feel that such was the case as much as the film was simply an honest look into the perspective of the young guys being trained for a war that the public did n't support .... it showed their fear , their desperation , their drive ... all of it , out in the open , naked . As a soldier myself alot of the themes rang true to me in my experience in the military - especially boot camp . On the whole this movie , although it was shot on a very small budget , looks great , is very well put together , and features excellent acting and directing . I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for another excellent Colin Farrell film . 10/10
1 Never heard of this movie , saw it on DVD.Great movie , perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it work . No overhyped typical Hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors . No current Quote " A " list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie . Brought back memories of my own post Vietnam war military experiences . It concentrated on the people who were sent to fight . As was portrayed by the characters who had fears and emotions even if some volunteered for service . They were regular people too , some just were n't cut out for military life , I remember a few in my experience -- to put it mildly could n't adapt to military life either - but I 'll never forget them - should have stayed in touch . I highly recommend it and then think about those serving present day in Afganistan . Basic training is a trip , notice those drill sergeants are n't morning people and maybe they need " sensitivity training " HA!HA!HA !
1 Tigerland is one of the finest films that i have seen , and in my opinion it outdoes even full metal jacket , a film of similar nature . Bozz is played exceptionally well by Farrell , and is a character who stays in your mind long after the film ends . The ending is brilliantly cut by schumacher - with the melodic harmony singing and the slow mo of the troops preparing to leave . What a film .
1 I was n't expecting the highest calibre of film - making with Joel Schumacher directing this one , so I was surprised that TIGERLAND was n't a complete waste of time.<br /><br />In technique , it 's often derivative of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN with the shaky camera work , grainy shots , the film occasionally running like it 's skipping a sprocket --- all those techniques Speilberg used to make his film seem more realistic but in the end was more distracting than anything else.<br /><br />But unlike SAVING PRIVATE RYAN , the emotional component was n't as weak , as the characters in this film seemed more like real people and the story less contrived , not so wrapped up in the American flag ( Speilberg gets an ' F ' in subtlety).<br /><br />Next to the first section of Kubrick 's FULL METAL JACKET , this is the most realistic portrayal of boot camp that I have seen in a film , and for that I think it 's worth watching.<br /><br />It 's not a great film , but neither is it a bad film .
1 There are four great movie depicting the Vietnam War . They are ( in no particular order : Apocalypse Now , Born on the Fourth of July , Platoon , and finally Tigerland . All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it . Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War . The character of Boz is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war , and the absurdity of it . This has been done in many war movies , but rarely in boot camp . Also , this is a very complex character , whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie . The character of Boz makes this movie so good . It is a shame it did not get a major release . It belongs on the shelf of any movie fan alongside the aforementioned movie titles .
1 Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in Vietnam in 1971.<br /><br />At this point , America knows they are fighting a loosing battle , and the director takes us through a 16 mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the ' Tigerland ' training camp in Louisiana.<br /><br />The film is more of a character study no real plot , but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz , who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man , who only wants to escape the camp . We are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.<br /><br />I'd have to say this is a great story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general .. Great acting , and very memorable . Also the directors use of film and style works so well , cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding Vietnam . Its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle . The particular scene where Boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell ... and it 's futility.<br /><br />Fantastic film . Not just about Nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being ' in the army'.<br /><br />Rating 9 out of 10 .
1 There 's an inexhaustible hunger for " basic training " movies , so it 's surprising that this one got so little notice when first released . Looks likely to have a well - deserved second life on DVD / VHS.<br /><br />Tigerland is n't uniformly great by any means , there are some terribly cliched characters ( especially the portrayal of the NCO 's , makes you long for the return of Lee ' Full Metal Jacket ' Ermey ) but the lead performance of Colin Farrell is the stuff of instant stardom . Charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get .
1 First of all I saw this movie without knowing anything about it I just knew that Joel Schumacher did it and that was enough for me . A friend and I went to see it at a Danish film festival called the night - film festival which is a lot of different movies shown after hours the festival pretty much specializes in showing movies that would n't otherwise be shown in Danish theaters.<br /><br />Anyway My friend and I went to see it and we were astonished at how real it seemed and that it really struck a cord with our feelings , we really got caught up in the plot without being able to figure out the ending which is a great plus in our book.<br /><br />The film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the Danish initiative " dogma 95 " which was started by 4 Danish directors including Lars Von Trier ( Dancer In the Dark).<br /><br />In conclusion the movie is really worth seeing it gives a different perspective on how things were for the American G.I. Joe coming out of school being expected to serve their country in battle a long way from home.<br /><br />Also Colin Farrell is exceptional in this movie I have n't seen him before but I ca n't wait to see more of him.<br /><br />Lars P. Helvard
1 This was one of the best war movies I 've seen because it focuses on the characters more then the actual war . All of the cast do an excellent job and because most of them are relative unknowns it makes everything seem more believable . The camera footage is great is so was the pacing and editing . This movie will actually get to you and causes the audience to care for the charcters .
1 Joel schumacher Made a heck of a choice when he decided on this cast and this script . The story is well written and well laid out , and this entirely new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant . It seemed that there were 6 " leads " and about a half dozen supporting , and by far this is the best thing about the movie , the fresh young faces of tomorrow . It has been a long time since hollywood has touched the controversial vietnam war films , which says something for the"story that needed to be told"(as stated by schumacher ) and Tigerland lands in that handful of top war movies period . Yet it can not be labeled as a war movie because it seemed to be based more on the human spirit of Bozz and the others . I Think anyone who just wants to see a good film with out all of the special FX , but just good , gritty drama should go see Tigerland , obviously Shumachers Best works in the past 8 years .
1 Just caught it at the Toronto International Film Festival . This is a good story , told in a compelling way . The handheld camera approach to action scenes added to the intensity of those scenes ( in a documentary style , not a Blair Witch style ) . Joel Schumacher shows he does n't need a big budget to produce a gripping film.<br /><br />The actors were strong , particularly the actor playing the focus of the events in the film , Boz .
1 This was a good movie . It was n't your typical war flick but something a bit different . This movie showed us recruits in training before the war and not actually fighting a war . This film is one of the more realist views on war and the army than most other films like this made . Colin Farrel did a great job at portraying an army recruit and Clifton Collins Jr and also Matthew Davis contributed reasonably well . Seeing Colin Farrel move from b grade to a grade in a few short years , You would never thought it would happen . I will also add that the makers of tigerland did a great job at filming a movie in the year 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a good touch . Its good to see talent used wisely and i hope to see this same talent again in the near future .
1 It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag . Just beautiful sentiment and yet never stooping to being soppy . There is some terrific cinematography and the lead girl is quite brilliant . It captures more than the nostalgia of the time . It has a real heart to it . It is the Achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful . A simple story is always effective when done well . This Glendyn Ivin has a big future and I for one , am looking out for his next project . The follow up is always the most difficut thing . It 's like the second album blues for most people . < br /><br />I just hope his next film is not something lame like a shark film . Cheers to all . Enjoy your cinema .
1 I was treated to a viewing of Cracker Bag last night before a preview screening of Disney 's Holes . I do n't know who decided to show it but I 'm so very glad they did . Cracker Bag is an absolute gem , a snapshot of Australia in the early 80s as seen through a child 's eye . The " conversations " between Eddie and her brother were hilarious and , as with the rest of the film , so true to life . Each shot brought a great sense of nostalgia as it reminded me of my own childhood ( being the same age as the director probably helps a little ) and the audio multiplied the feeling . I only hope I get to see Cracker Bag again some day .
1 Alright this was quite a sensitive little number but I ca n't help thinking I 've seen it before . Reminds me of another VCA film I saw at Poitier called " THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE " Also had specks of " Welcome to the Dollhouse " and " Ratcatcher " and Lynne Ramsay in it 's execution . Which is not to say that they 're not tasteful references ... just that they feel very modern and very fashionable ... which makes me feel like this is closer to advertising ( as an approach in style and story ) than the work of an original and authentic auteur to come.<br /><br />The cinematography is just ... too perfect for my liking . Too coral filter ( or charcoal ) for my liking ... too archly framed 12 mm . Therefore the entire impression left me a little distant -- beware of art that proclaims itself too readily ! The french ( they are a conservative bunch ) seemed to buy it as did the jury however ... but Cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to it 's feature selection although I wonder what 's been happening in the last few years .
1 First off , I did n't know what to expect when I started the video.<br /><br />Anytime someone brings back a cult type movie genre and adapts it into the present , something gets inexplicably lost in the translation.<br /><br />That 's not the case here . This movie just starts off on the right track . It 's part familiar territory but manages to take it over the top as well . Crockzilla scene anyone ? That has to be seen , and just try and keep a straight face . This movie takes some of the old fun cult movie classics and manages to blend it seamlessly into a modern production . It 's good to see someone is filling the need in this market . Very well done.<br /><br / >
1 With this movie , it 's all about style , atmosphere , and acting . True , I did n't believe all of the plot developments , but it did n't matter- the terrific acting , the unexpected plot twists , and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me right in , and carried me along for the ride , and I had a great time . Kenneth Branagh is not only a great actor but a master of accents , and he proves it once again with a flawless Georgia accent . He 's surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles ( Robert Downey , Jr. , Embeth Davidtz from Schindler 's List and Fallen , Tom Berenger , Daryl Hannah , and Robert Duvall ) that I was simply blown away . I recently bought a copy of this movie , and I never tire of watching it . Simply one of the best thrillers of the year . If you 've ignored this movie ( and chances are you have ) , then I suggest you check it out .
1 Robert Altman should n't make a movie like this , but the fact that he did- and that it turns out to be a reasonably good and tightly - wound thriller in that paperback - tradition of Grisham thrillers- shows a versatility that is commendable . In the Gingerbread Man he actually has to work with something that , unfortunately , he is n't always very successful at , or at least it 's not the first thing on his checklist as director : plot . There 's one of those big , juicy almost pot - boiler plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate low - class woman and then a nefarious figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most staggering ways , twists and plot ensues , yada yada . And it 's surprising that Altman would really want to take on one of these " I saw that coming from back there ! " endings , or just a such a semi - conventional thriller.<br /><br />But it 's a surprise that pays off because , oddly enough , Altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior , or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very well - cast ensemble , of a small - town Georgian environment . The film drips with atmosphere ( if not total superlative craftsmanship , sometimes it 's good and sometimes just decent for Altman ) , as Savannah is possibly going to be hit by a big hurricane and the swamp and marshes and rain keep things soaked and muggy and humid . So the atmosphere is really potent , but so are performances from ( sometimes ) hysterical Kenneth Branaugh , Embeth Davitz as the ' woman ' who lawyer Branaugh gets caught up with , and Robert Downey Jr ( when is he * not * good ? ) as the private detective in Branaugh 's employ . Did I neglect Robert Duvall , who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an indelible impression to hang the bad - vibes of the picture on ? < br /><br />As said , some of the plot is a little weak , or just kind of standard ( lawyer is divorced , bitter custody battle looms , innocent and goofy kids ) , but at the same time I think Altman saw something captivating in the material , something darker than some of the other Grisham works that has this standing out somehow . If it 's not entirely masterful , it still works on its limited terms as a what - will - happen - next mystery - Southern - noir .
1 This is n't among Jimmy Stewart 's best films -- I'm quick to admit that . However , while some view his film as pure propaganda , I 'm wondering what 's so wrong with that ? Yes , sure , like the TV show THE FBI , this is an obvious case of the Bureau doing some PR work to try to drum up support . But , as entertainment goes , it does a good job . Plus , surprisingly enough for the time it was made , the film focuses more on crime than espionage and " Commies " . Instead , it 's a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose . Now considering the agent is played by Jimmy Stewart , then it 's pretty certain the acting and writing were good -- as this was a movie with a real budget and a studio who was n't about to waste the star in a third - rate flick . So overall , it 's worth seeing but not especially great .
1 JAMES STEWART plays an FBI agent who began working with the agency before it was called the FBI and the story involves dealing with the Ku Klux Klan , the Prohibition Era gangsters , World War II German and Japanese spies , etc . A continuously interesting picture covering 40 years of history ; far superior to any films being made these days.<br /><br />Of special interest to older viewers familiar with Washington , DC . In a scene about 20 minutes into the movie --- where James Stewart finds out from Vera Miles that she 's expecting their first child --- the scene was filmed in Herzog 's Seafood Restaurant on the former Washington waterfront , the only movie in which this historic location appears . Shortly after taking office , President Kennedy decided that Southwest Washington , a 99 % Black neighborhood , was an eyesore and ought to be torn down . By decree befitting his position of undisputed royalty , the entire area , including the popular waterfront restaurant district , but excluding 3 historic churches ; was reduced to rubble . Black residents evicted from their homes relocated as best they could , and without Federal assistance ; likewise businesses were simply put out of business , few re - locating . Restaurant Row was converted into a sidewalk , and Washington had no waterfront ( restaurants , seafood stands , boats , etc ) for about 10 years . As a lifetime resident , the Herzog Restaurant scene was our # 1 reason to see this fine movie again .
1 The film as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is excellent as Chip Hardesty , with well done co - starring turns by Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton . But the film , directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy , was constantly vetted and script approval as well as every aspect of the film , down to clothing , was closely watched and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover . Not that J. Edgar Hoover did n't have something to be proud of . His management of the bureau from 1924 to his death crated on of the finest investigative services in the world . But by 1959 Hoover was already beginning to worry about being forced out and had already started to collect dossiers on powerful people to make sure and protect his little kingdom . And he was determined to make sure that no motion picture showed even a single wart about the bureau . The films shows only continued successes and glosses over the failures which occurred , and the bureau 's part in the witch hunts of the early 1950 's . Enjoy the story , but with tongue firmly in cheek .
1 I found The FBI Story considerably entertaining and suitably upbeat for my New Years Day holiday viewing . Its drama and action - packed episodes were thrilling . The Hardesty character was well drawn and admirable . Overall the photography , script and direction was perfectly creditable . Rather than taking the film to be a repugnant piece of propaganda , as some might , I enjoyed it as a well mounted portrayal of the necessity of ingenious minds and brave bodies in the fight against crime . Again , the depiction of a family holding together even under the strain of the husband 's commitment to his ( arguably ) important work , I did not find to be a twee representation but an ideal and exemplary one .
1 The history of the FBI , as told from the point of view of Agent Stewart via flashbacks , interwoven with his personal life story . Stewart and Miles ( as his wife ) are pretty good , as is Hamilton as an earnest agent . The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved . It 's like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a who 's who cast of gangsters . Some of the episodes are too long , some too short , and some just look out of place ( Stewart 's daughter 's school sequence ) . Overall , it goes on way too long . Nevertheless , it 's worth a look for its handsome production values .
1 Marvelous James Stewart , Vera Miles vehicle . What makes this historical film dealing with the FBI so good is the family element that is involved during a 35 year career as depicted by Stewart in the film.<br /><br />The film shows a history of the great investigatory agency . It deals with airplane bomb plots , killing off of Indians in Oklahoma for real estate gain , fighting organized crime , Nazis and Communists in that order . The human element is never far behind as Stewart weds Vera Miles . They raise 3 children as Miles ' heart goes out each time Stewart goes out on assignment.<br /><br />Look for a brief but memorable performance by Murray Hamilton . Years later , he appeared as Mr. Robinson in 1967 's " The Graduate." < br /><br />The film has nothing but praise for J. Edgar Hoover . He certainly brought the FBI up to par.<br /><br />True , this could be viewed as right - wing propaganda , especially with Stewart 's real - life Republican views , but it 's well done , historically informative , and the view of the family so well depicted .
1 This is the magnum opus from the Swedish king of crap , Mats - Helge Olsson . Seldom has a movie of this magnitude been made in Sweden and it truly stands out as one of the most amazing achievements in Swedish film to date . Who pays for these things ? < br /><br />The Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to defect to Sweden . But his plans are ruined by the Russian military who kidnap him and tell him that he has arrived in Sweden . This trickery is their way of seeing to that Markov continues his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply for the whole planet . The CIA however is bent on getting Markov to the west and send their ninja to liberate him.<br /><br />The practice of having Swedish actors speaking English is something that Mats - Helge has perfected in his later works . The cheap b - movie feeling this creates is probably unmatched for performance . But besides this ? Well the action is standard direct - to - video style . Machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke . Thousands of Russians dying . People running around in black ninja suits , trying to hide in the snow.<br /><br />What really stands out though is the insanely poor way the fighting scenes are choreographed . When they say " Ninja " in the title i expect martial arts , i expect close combat . But there are maybe two or three scenes of actual martial arts in this movie . And they are hilarious . It 's so bad i lack the words to describe it . If the ninjas moved any slower their hearts would stop . And of course the whole movie ends in a bang that indicates a special - effects budget consisting of four food - stamps and a McDonald 's voucher.<br /><br />So what 's the verdict ? Instant classic of course . Never before has a movie been made that is so obviously meant to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol . It 's the ultimate party movie . Insert into video and laugh . One just has to realize that movies like these are not made any more . This is film history.<br /><br />Therefore the rating is 8/10 for entertainment , 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents .
1 According to the director this movie was popular in Asia . It is somewhat difficult to take these Mats Helge movies seriously since most of his films are shot on a very tight budget . Almost no USD at all . But it is fascinating to establish that Mats Helge eventually completes something which can be called an action movie . The Ninja Mission is - I think - the best one among all movies directed by him . Some special effects are quite enjoyable . This is not a " B " or " C " movie . It is a " Z " movie - but an enjoyable and fun " Z " movie !
1 Maybe one of the most entertaining Ninja - movies ever made . A hard - hitting action movie with lots of gore and slow motion ( eehaaa ! ) . Made in ´ 83 and still the greatest swedish action movie made so far ! And we can hardly wait to see the upcoming sequel , Ninja mission 2000 - The legacy of Markov !
1 Moe and Larry are newly henpecked husbands , having married Shemp 's demanding sisters . At his music studio , Shemp learns he will inherit a fortune if he marries someone himself ! < br /><br />"Husbands Beware " is a remake of 1947 's " Brideless Groom , " widely considered by many to be one of the best Stooge films with Shemp . The remake contains most of the footage from that film . The new scenes , shot May 17 , 1955 , include the storyline of Moe and Larry marrying Shemp 's sisters , along with their cooking of a turkey laced with turpentine ! A few new scenes are tacked onto the end of the film as well(a double for Dee Green was used ; if you blink , you will miss the double 's appearance . ) < br /><br />"Husbands Beware " would have made for a good film with just the plot line of marrying the sisters . Budget considerations , coupled with fewer bookings for two - reel comedies , influenced the decision to use older footage.<br /><br />Although completely new films were still being made by the Stooges , most of their releases by 1955 - 56 were made up of older films with a few new scenes tossed in . " Husbands Beware , " while one of these hybrids , is watchable and entertaining ; we get to see most of " Brideless Groom " again , and the new scenes are funny enough to get the viewer through the film . This film is one of the last Stooge comedies to feature new footage of Shemp , and it was released six weeks after his death.<br /><br />7 out of 10 .
1 The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! < br /><br />One of My favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than Husbands Beware ! All appearing in this short are the beautiful Christine McIntyre , Dee Green , Doris Houck , Alyn Lockwood , Johnny Kascier , Nancy Saunders , Lu Leonard , Maxine Gates , and Emil Sitka . Green and McIntyre provide great performances here ! There are so many funny parts here . This is a very hilarious short . There is another similar Three Stooges short like this one called Brideless Groom and I recommend both !
1 HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of the Shemp classic BRIDELESS GROOM . The film 's new cooking scene at the beginning of the film is great . The stooges are always funny when they cook . However after the first few minutes of cooking footage , we cut to original footage of BRIDELESS GROOM . One thing I noticed about these 1953 to 1956 remakes are that they do fit with the new story . They do an insert shot if the old story line does n't match.<br /><br />HUSBANDS BEWARE does have a new ending , but I wo n't give it away to those who want to be surprised.<br /><br / > * * * * out of 4 stars .
1 I can not believe how unknown this movie is , it was absolutely incredible . The ending alone has stuck with me for almost thirty years . The road sign through the rearveiw mirror blew me away . If you liked " RACE WITH THE DEVIL " you will love this movie
1 Whenever people ask me to name the scariest movie I 've ever seen , I invariably reply " Black Noon " and to this day nobody 's ever heard of it.<br /><br />I watched it alone some 30 years ago at the tender age of 13 when my parents had gone out for the evening . As far as I know its only ever been shown once in the UK and sadly is unavailable on DVD or VHS.<br /><br />If anyone can trace a copy please let me know.<br /><br />If I watched it again now it would probably be a big disappointment but it has always stuck in my memory as a particularly disturbing little film !
1 I saw this movie on TV when it came out , and never seen it again . For the life of me , I could n't remember the title and just stumbled across it while checking Roy Thinne 's movie credits . Excellent , dark , and spooky TV horror movie in the same class as " Crowhaven Farm " ; " Do n't Be Afraid Of The Dark " ; and " Satan 's School for Girls " , all lost Satanic classics . I also think it has many parallels to Clint Eastwood 's classic , " High Plains Drifter " . Why do n't they release these great little movies , especially when you consider all of the more recent garbage that fills the discount DVD racks at Wal - Mart ? Most of these flicks have a cult - following , so sales should n't be a problem .
1 I feel like I have some uber - rare disease that no one has heard of and I have finally come across a support group on the net ! I finally found this title by asking for an answer on an " experts " site on the web . I too , saw this movie in my youth and was struck by the atmosphere and especially the ending . I have never forgotten it and have never seen it since . No one I know saw the film and I had almost given up on ever finding it 's title . Alas , even knowing the name , I shall probably never see the film again as it is impossible to find commercially . Small steps ... <br /><br />G
1 I have seen this film only once , on TV , and it has not been repeated . This is strange when you consider the rubbish that is repeated over and over again . Usually horror movies for me are a source of amusement , but this one really scared me.<br /><br />DO NOT READ THE NEXT BIT IF YOU HAVE'NT SEEN THE FILM YET < br /><br />The scariest bit is when the townsfolk pursue the preacher to where his wife lies almost dead ( they 'd been poisoning her ) . He asks who the hell are you people anyway . One by one they give their true identities . The girl who was pretending to be deaf in order to corrupt and seduce him says " I am Lilith , the witch who loved Adam before Eve " .
1 Finally got to see this classic TV movie on an unofficial disc recorded from an old VHS , it is a classic piece of horror . Its a pity more of this neglected corner of horror in terms of official releases on DVD and VHS ... the TV horror movie . Recommended for all fans of the 70 's TV movie much like trilogy of terror . Those interested should get the book on the subject by David Deal - Television Fright Films of the 70 's . Email me for a chance to see it ..... its fabulous to see it again.<br /><br />It does have it problems like many TV movies they have to be rather inventive in the effects dept and even at 70 mins it can seem to drag possibly we are all used to more modern editing but still great stuff and far better than many theatrical frights released today .
1 Like many people on this site , I saw this movie only once , when it was first televised in 1971 . Certain scenes linger in my memory and an overall feeling of disquiet is how I remember being affected by it . I would be fascinated to see it again , if it was ever made available for home video.<br /><br />Possible spoiler : I wonder if anyone else would agree that the basic plot setup and characters might have been derived from a 1960 British movie , originally titled City of the Dead , retitled Horror Hotel for the American release ? There are some similarities also to a later British film The Wicker Man.<br /><br />One detail remains with me years after seeing the film . It 's a small but significant moment near the beginning of the film . As I recall , a minister and his wife have stopped to aid some people by the side of the road , circa 1870 , somewhere out West . The friendly seeming Ray Milland introduces himself and his ( daughter ? ) , Yvette Mimieux , a beautiful young mute woman . While the preacher is helping Ray Milland with the wagon , a rattlesnake slithers into view and coils menacingly , unobserved by any of the characters except Yvette Mimieux . She does n't look scared at all , but stares at the snake with silent concentration , until it goes away . With this strange little moment , we already realize there 's something highly unusual about these seemingly normal folks , though the possible danger to the minister and his wife remains vague and uncertain for a long time.<br /><br />That one little scene stays with me vividly after all these years , along with many others . The film has a haunting quality about it that wo n't let go , and it 's not surprising that people remember it so vividly . Someone ought to make this available for home video !
1 So , finally I know it exists . Along with the other Uk contributors on here I saw this on what MUST HAVE BEEN it 's only UK screening in the 70 's . I remembered the title , but got nowhere when I mentioned it to people . It scarred me ( that 's 2 ' r 's ) but when you go to bed with doom whizzing about your brain and listening all around for impending terror , then is n't that what a TRULY CLASSIC horror movie is all about ? ? I can barely remember the intricacies of the movie , but what I do recollect is my shivering flesh and heightened senses . Can anyone confirm my suspicions that this is black and white ? Again , if anyone has any info on how to obtain a copy of this , please get in touch ...
1 Based on a true story of how a man ahead of his time - the great 19th century American poet and humanist Walt Whitman - made a significant contribution to how western medicine treats people with psychological problems.<br /><br />Interested in the treatment of people with psychological problems , he began to associate with psychiatric workers and patients . After seeing the psychological methods of the time ( inhumane and ignorantly cruel methods ) , Walt rejected those methods , and treated patients with compassion and dignity , encouraging other people to do the same > The story of Walt 's interactions with psychiatric workers , patients and townsfolk is full of drama , good humor and wisdom . : )
1 I found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh , so I have decided to write my own . I first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then . First of all let me say that , overall , the things that this movie gets RIGHT are what make it worthwhile . It does n't matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults . It is worth watching . The idea of basing a movie on Walt Whitman 's visit a restrictive , narrow - minded Anglo - Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis - en - scene . The movie is about the kind of humanizing catalysis Whitman inspired in people . And in that sense it is exactly accurate . The acting - especially by Rip Torn ( Whitman ) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is very good . The scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time . Overall , what 's not to like ? Besides , name another film in which Whitman is brought so vividly to life ?
1 The rating is only a 5 because it 's a movie that could have used better acting and direction ( or at least music ! ) . However , for the achievements of Walt Whitman , it deserves a 10 . A previous poster calls the movie cheesy , however , I think it 's a simple case of not seeing the forest for the trees . The film makers were apparently more interested in getting the story out there than to have a Hollywood shiny feature film . And for this , I applaud them - the fact it is non - mainstream reflects the life of Whitman as well . This film is more documentary than for the sake of acting . To be fascinated with a story such as this , when you rarely hear of these types of stories that shape current day mental health , is the most important thing . I found it a highly enjoyable look at history .
1 This little film had long been on my " keeper " list . Do people realize how stressed out , menopausal , emotionally abused women ( as well as the mentally retarded ) were REALLY treated by the medical profession at the turn of the century ? ? ! ! All of the pious uptight Christian attitudes of that time were deadly to exploring TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace suffering souls , let alone explore what it means to embrace our humanity . Can you really imagine ( by today 's standards ) that Walt Whitman 's books were banned because he acknowledged women as having feelings and emotional responses as great as a mans ? Think about that ! The sensitivity of this movie still gets me and I give credit to the director for capturing this through his eyes .
1 In his otherwise excellent book , Lincoln in American Memory , the historian Merrill Peterson calls Young Mr . Lincoln a " boring , dreadful , film " . This amazingly wrongheaded analysis simply proves that great historians are rarely fine film critics . I am working on a doctoral dissertation on Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass . As part of my preparation for writing the dissertation , I made a careful analysis of this film , and of Tag Gallaghers brilliant interpretation of it in his seminal book on Ford . Young Mr. Lincoln comes out that culminating year of the first phase of Ford 's cinematic authorship , 1939.In that greatest of Hollywood years , Ford directed three superb , still not fully appreciated films : Drums Along the Mohawk , Stagecoach , and Young Mr . Lincoln . It might seem odd to say that Stagecoach is not fully appreciated , all but the most purblind of critics must perceive that it is one of of the greatest Westerns , and perhaps even one of the hundred greatest films of all time . However , what is NOT fully appreciated is that these three films work together as a kind of trilogy - a triptych , in fact . Ford is creating a sort of mythic history of America on screen . Drums Along the Mohawk is the Revolutionary War . Young Mr . Lincoln is pre - Civil War America . Finally , Stagecoach is Post Civil War America . What the three films have in common is that they are an extended meditation on the American Adam and his " errand into the Wilderness " . What are the Psychic and social costs of American manifest destiny , as America strives to build a new human city in the wilderness?Lincoln symbolizes Americas journey , as he seeks to reconcile the civilizational inmpulse ( law ) , with the freedom of the wilderness . Young Mr . Lincoln is not history , ( It is full of historical " howlers'-as both Ford and Trotti were well aware ) , but myth . This is Lincoln , the symbol of justice and mercy , Lincoln , the man of the wilderness , striving to found a civilization within himself , and to become the " remarkable lawgiver ' of young America . Young Mr. Lincoln is not history - like James Agee 's long forgotten teleplay about Lincoln , and like Sandburgs biography , it is an epic poem ... a very beautiful epic poem .
1 1939 is universally accepted as the greatest year in Hollywood history , with more classic films released than in any other , and John Ford directed three of the best , " Stagecoach " , " Drums Along the Mohawk " , and this beautiful homage to frontier days and a young backwoods lawyer destined to eventually save the Union , " Young Mr. Lincoln".<br /><br />With the world plunging into a war that America dreaded , but knew it would be drawn into , Abraham Lincoln was much on people 's minds , in 1939 , as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his own life , and had triumphed . On Broadway , Robert E. Sherwood 's award - winning " Abe Lincoln in Illinois " , with Raymond Massey 's physically dead - on portrayal , was playing to packed houses ( it would be filmed in 1940 ) . Carl Sandburg 's continuation of his epic biography , " Abraham Lincoln : The War Years " , was published , and quickly became a best seller . President Roosevelt frequently referred to Lincoln in speeches , and the Lincoln Memorial , in Washington , D.C. , became the most popular landmark in town ( a fact that Frank Capra made good use of , in " Mr. Smith Goes to Washington").<br /><br />All this was not lost on Darryl F. Zanuck , at 20th Century Fox ; as soon as he read Lamar Trotti 's screenplay of Lincoln 's early days as a lawyer , he designated it a ' prestige ' production , and assigned John Ford to direct , and Henry Fonda , to star.<br /><br />Fonda did NOT want to play Lincoln ; he felt he could n't do justice to the ' Great Emancipator ' , and feared a bad performance would damage his career . Even a filmed make - up test , in which he was stunned by how much he would resemble Lincoln , would n't change his mind . According to Fonda , John Ford , whom he 'd never worked with , cussed him out royally , at their first meeting , and explained he was n't portraying the Lincoln of Legend , but a young " jackanape " country lawyer facing his first murder trial . Humbled , Fonda took the role . ( John Ford offered a different scenario of the events , but the outcome was the same ! ) Obviously , they found a chemistry together that worked , as nearly all of their pairings would produce ' classics'.<br /><br />Unlike the introverted , melancholia - racked Lincoln of " Abe Lincoln in Illinois " , Ford 's vision was that of a shy but likable young attorney , who made friends easily , and misses the mother he lost , too young ( resulting in a bond with a pioneer mother that becomes a vital part of the story ) . Injustice riles him , and he speaks ' common sense ' to quell violence , interlaced with doses of humor . Both productions play on Lincoln 's ( undocumented ) relationship with Ann Rutledge ; in Ford 's version , the pair are truly in love , and committed to each other . After her death , Lincoln would frequently visit her grave , to share his life with her ' spirit ' ( a theme Ford would continue in " She Wore a Yellow Ribbon").<br /><br />A murder trial is the centerpiece of the film , and shows the prodigious talents of the star and director . Fonda deftly portrays Lincoln 's inexperience , yet earnest belief in justice tempered with mercy , and Ford emphasizes the gulf between the big - city ' intellectuals ' ( represented by pompous D.A. Donald Meek , and his slick ' advisor ' , Stephen Douglas , played by a young Milburn Stone ) , and the informal , rule - bending country sense of Lincoln . With Ford ' regular ' Ward Bond as a key witness , the trial is both unconventional , and riveting.<br /><br />With the film closing as Lincoln strides away into the stormy distance , and his destiny ( dissolving into a view of the statue at the Lincoln Memorial ) , audiences could take comfort in the film 's message that if a cause is just , good would ultimately triumph.<br /><br />"Young Mr. Lincoln " is a truly remarkable film , from an amazing year !
1 Young Mr. Lincoln marks the first film of the director / star collaboration of John Ford and Henry Fonda . I recall years ago Fonda telling that as a young actor he was understandably nervous about playing Abraham Lincoln and scared he would n't live up to the challenge.<br /><br />John Ford before the shooting starts put him at ease by saying he was n't going to be playing the Great Emancipator , but just a jack - leg prairie lawyer . That being settled Fonda headed a cast that John Ford directed into a classic film.<br /><br />This is not a biographical film of Lincoln . That had come before in the sound era with Walter Huston and a year after Young Mr. Lincoln , Raymond Massey did the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois . Massey still remains the definitive Lincoln.<br /><br />But as Ford said , Fonda was n't playing the Great Emancipator just a small town lawyer in Illinois . The film encompasses about 10 years of Lincoln 's early life . We see him clerking in a general store , getting some law books from an immigrant pioneer family whose path he would cross again later in the story . And his romance with Ann Rutledge with her early death leaving Lincoln a most melancholy being.<br /><br />Fast forward about 10 years and Lincoln is now a practicing attorney beginning to get some notice . He 's served a couple of terms in the legislature , but he 's back in private practice not really sure if politics is for him.<br /><br />This is where the bulk of the action takes place . The two sons of that family he 'd gotten the law books from way back when are accused of murder . He offers to defend them . And not an ordinary murder but one of a deputy sheriff . < br /><br />The trial itself is fiction , but the gambit used in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan who played the two sons is based on a real case Lincoln defended . I 'll say no more.<br /><br />Other than the performances , the great strength of Young Mr. Lincoln is the way John Ford captures the mood and atmosphere and setting of a small Illinois prairie town in a Fourth of July celebration . It 's almost like you 're watching a newsreel . And it was the mood of the country itself , young , vibrant and growing.<br /><br />Fans of John Ford films will recognize two musical themes here that were repeated in later films . During the romantic interlude at the beginning with Fonda and Pauline Moore who played Ann Rutledge the music in the background is the same theme used in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles . And at a dance , the tune Lovely Susan Brown that Fonda and Marjorie Weaver who plays Mary Todd is the same one Fonda danced with Cathy Downs to , in My Darling Clementine at the dance for the raising of a church in Tombstone . < br /><br />Lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographers and dramatists because of two reasons , I believe . The first is he 's the living embodiment of our own American mythology about people rising from the very bottom to the pinnacle of power through their own efforts . In fact Young Mr. Lincoln very graphically shows the background Lincoln came from . And secondly the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history and that he made a singularly good and moral decision to free slaves during the Civil War , albeit for some necessary political reasons . His assassination assured his place in history.<br /><br />Besides Fonda and others I 've mentioned special praise should also go to Fred Kohler , Jr. and Ward Bond , the two town louts , Kohler being the murder victim and Bond the chief accuser . Also Donald Meek as the prosecuting attorney and Alice Brady in what turned out to be her last film as the pioneer mother of Cromwell and Quillan . And a very nice performance by Spencer Charters who specialized in rustic characters as the judge.<br /><br />For a film that captures the drama and romance of the time it 's set in , you ca n't do better than Young Mr. Lincoln .
1 This film was not only one of John Ford 's own personal favorites but also numbered directors Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among its high - profile admirers . Ironically , I 've just caught up with it myself via Criterion 's recent 2-Disc Set after missing out on a couple of original language screenings of it on Italian TV many years ago and again a few times on TV while in Hollywood ! < br /><br />The film marked Ford 's first of nine collaborations with Henry Fonda and is also a quintessential example of Ford 's folksy Americana vein . A beautifully made and pictorially quite poetic piece of work , the courtroom sequences ( and eventual revelation ) in its second half still pack quite a wallop , apart from giving stalwart character actor Donald Meek a memorably meaty role as the prosecuting attorney.<br /><br />Fonda is , of course , perfectly cast as a bashful , inexperienced but rigorous and humanistic lawyer who was destined to become President ; Fonda would go on to portray other fictitious politicians on film - most notably in Franklin J. Schaffner 's THE BEST MAN ( 1964 ) and Sidney Lumet 's FAIL - SAFE ( 1964 ) - and it 's surprising now to learn that he was reluctant at the time about accepting the role of Lincoln since , in his view , that was " like playing God " ! < br /><br />It is interesting to note here that Ford had previously tackled Abraham Lincoln ( tangentially ) in THE PRISONER OF SHARK ISLAND ( 1936 ) , a superb but perhaps little - known gem which has , luckily , just been released as a Special Edition DVD by the UK 's veritable Criterion stand - in , Eureka 's " Masters Of Cinema " label . Besides , I also have two more Abraham Lincoln films in my DVD collection which I 've yet to watch and , incidentally , both were directed by D. W. Griffith - THE BIRTH OF A NATION ( 1915 ) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN ( 1930 ) - and , had I not just received a bunch of films I 've never watched before just now , I would have gladly given them a spin based on my highly - satisfying viewing experience with YOUNG MR . LINCOLN .
1 According to John Ford 's lyrically shot , fictional biopic of Abraham Lincoln 's life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in " the worst way . " Ford 's camera has only praising views to reveal of Mr. Lincoln 's early life . But for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision . Uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film , what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames , Ford has a unique eye for telling a story . The film sings of the life of a hopeful young man . Henry Fonda plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever Lincoln to a tee , one of his best roles.<br /><br />The film concerns two young men , brothers , on trial for a murder that both claim to have committed . In classic angry mob style , the town decides to take justice into their own hands and lynch the pair of them , until honest Abe steps into the fray . He charms them with his humor , telling them not to rob him of his first big case , and that they are as good as lynched with him as the boys lawyer . What follows seems to become the outline for all courtroom- murder - dramas thereafter , as Abe cunningly interrogates witnesses to the delight and humor of the judge , jury and town before he stumbles upon the missing links.<br /><br />The film plays out like many John Ford movies do : a tablespoon of Americana , a dash of moderate predictability , a hint of sarcasm that you are n't sure if you put in the recipe or if Ford did it himself . Despite the overtly ' Hollywood ' feel of the film , and overly patriotic banter alluding to Lincoln 's future presidency , the film is entirely enjoyable and enjoyably well constructed , if you can take your drama with a grain of salt .
1 Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like . It is a fooler . Through Fonda 's performance we are led to believe ( on the surface ) that Abraham Lincoln was a country bumpkin . But , through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings , you can see that beneath the exterior posturings is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on around him and how to influence the people around him . < br /><br />In this movie Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good grasp of how to present humor . It is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years . When he is telling stories and jokes he has the timing down perfect . There is a sequence in the trial that had me laughing quite hard . He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940.<br /><br />The ending by John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda going to the top of a hill and in the distance a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War . He goes forward into history . The movie is fiction but the insight into Lincoln is tremendous . Definitely worth seeing again .
1 The early career of Abe Lincoln is beautifully presented by Ford . Not that anyone alive has seen footage of the real Lincoln , but Fonda , wearing a fake nose , is uncanny as Lincoln , with the voice , delivery , walk , and other mannerisms - exactly as one would imagine Lincoln to have been . Ford , in the first of three consecutive films he made with Fonda , is at the top of his form , perfectly evoking early 19th century America . The story focuses on a pair accused of murder that Lincoln defends and the courtroom scenes are quite well done . The supporting cast includes many of Ford 's regulars . This was Alice Brady 's last film , as she died months after its release .
1 This is an evocative and idealized portrait of the early life of Lincoln(born 1809 Hodgensville - Kentucky- and died in Washington 1865 ) . Ford 's excellent movie takes Abraham Lincoln(Fonda ) from his youth . He studied laws , common law and began practice as lawyer in 1837.This Hollywood biography follows Lincoln from his log - cabin days , initial relationship to Mary Todd(Weaver ) , following the couple from their first ball , and his departure for congress candidate . But focuses mainly on a brothers(Richard Cromwell , Eddie Quillan ) accused for murder , the posterior trial with amusing court debate scenes and the protection for their mum(Alice Brady ) . The Lincoln - Fonda as defender advocate and Donald Meek - prosecutor are nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />Excellent performance from Henry Fonda as idealistic , traveller Springfield solicitor , he was to star regularly for Ford from this movie , as ¨Grapes of wrath , My darling Clementine , and Fort Apache¨. Besides sterling acting by Alice Brady as grieved mother , she was a great actress from the silent cinema , but this one results to be her last movie because she early died from cancer . The Lincoln 's deeds developing make for skilfully appealing entertaining . His portrayal shows a nostalgic longing for things past and old values and describes his goodness , uprightness and willful . Lincoln , like John Ford , was a straightforward man who never varied the ideals of his youth . This American masterpiece is correct on both counts , as splendid biography and as magnificent drama.<br /><br />Another biographies about Abraham Lincoln are the following : 1 ) ¨Abraham Lincoln¨(1930 ) by D.W.Griffith with Walter Huston , Una Merkel , talking from his birth until his assassination ; 2 ) ¨Abe Lincoln in Illinois¨(1940)by John Cromwell with Raymond Massey , Ruth Gordon , concerning similar events to Ford 's film through his career as lawyer 3)TV version titled ¨Gore Vidal 's Lincoln¨ with Sam Waterston and Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd .
1 The basic hook here is : Lincoln Is Slow . It is his slowness that represents his thoughtfulness and deliberation , making him a Great Leader who is here engaged in single - handedly civilizing the American frontier through the grand instrument of Law . All that John Ford hooey and more , including one lurking slave and extraneous Death By Injun . However ! The ' slow ' conceit is also at the center of one brilliant piece of movie - making , funny and moving at extremes . The history may be bunk , but the telling of it suggests a view of history as process that inspires some excitingly true - seeming moments . Check out Henry Fonda 's big introductory stroll across the deck , his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river , his dalliance with Mary Todd on the porch , and the priceless business that follows ' Ma'am , we 've got to hurry ! ' Things do thin out once we settle into the big courtroom drama ; but Fonda is priceless throughout .
1 Young Mr . Lincoln is a poetic , beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most revered figures in American history . Henry Fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure and at the same time make him human enough for people to care about . It is perhaps the actors best performance . Watch how he singlehandedly stops a lynching - mob . Alice Brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer woman . Most of the last part of the film plays out in a courtroom , and there lies the only negative thing I can say about this movie . Most of the characters from judge to spectators are given so many folksy humorously lines that distracts from the serious trial that is on hand . But I 'm quite used to this because the humor is a Ford trademark . Supporting parts by Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good .
1 The problem with portraying a real life individual is that the performance can be good , but still not work if the audience does n't believe that the actor is portraying the person . That 's the main issue with " Young Mr. Lincoln : " Henry Fonda gives a terrific performance , but I found it hard to believe that Abraham Lincoln was as soft - spoken as Fonda portrays him.<br /><br />This is essentially a courtroom drama with a young Abraham Licoln at the forefront . Whether or not this was a true story , I do n't know , but if it is n't , then why tell it using Lincoln as the central character ? Never mind though . In the film , Lincoln is defending two young men who are accused of murder.<br /><br />There 's really not much to the film , and as a result , it seems rather empty . I wanted more story and character development . The film is 100 minutes long , but it does n't feel like it . There are some little scenes featuring Lincoln and the blooming relationship with Mary Todd , but they seem superficial.<br /><br />The acting is good all around , but as I said , Fonda 's performance works as a character , but not Abraham Lincoln . I just do n't believe that the real Lincoln was that soft - spoken . True , he has a big voice when he needs to , such as when he persuades a drunken lynch mob to let the accused stand trial , but Fonda portrays Lincoln too meekly . The other performances are solid though , especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay , the mother of the accused . She 's a nice lady who we can really feel for . Simple and uneducated , yet very sweet ; we can see why Lincoln wanted to help her.<br /><br />John Ford seems to think of this film as an epic , and at the time of its release , it probably was . But even then , there 's just not enough material to present it as such.<br /><br />It 's a nice watch , but not a classic .
1 In the same tune as his Americana Drums Along the Mohawk , John Ford captures American history in a way that is fictional yet very believable . Henry Fonda made three consecutive films in this era with Ford and all three are about a certain time and place with emphasis on the setting and the cultural surroundings . In Mohawk , pioneer America is in full bloom with Americans fending for themselves against Indians and other forces . Here , Ford shows us 19th century America ; a time when invention and creativity were beginning to blossom and this nation truly was becoming great . Amongst it all was a tall , lanky , young lawyer from Illinois named Abe Lincoln and this film fictionalizes his life as a lawyer , foreshadowing the greatness he would later accomplish.<br /><br />Fonda is superb in this movie , capturing the essence of what is considered to be the persona of Lincoln , although no one knows exactly what he was like then . The sets and supporting cast also work well together and give a unique balance in Ford 's picturesque of the American dream and its many forms . This is not a film to be taken literally but rather symbolically , showing that Lincoln was indeed warming up for the events in his life that were to creates his legacy . We even get some scenes between him and a young Mary Todd ; and it is hard to see how they did end up together but that is not the point . I believe this is simply a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln , widely regarded as the greatest American president . His quiet and straightforward demeanor was rare then and would be today . Indeed , our government surely needs more men like him .
1 A somewhat fictionalized biographical portrait of Abraham Lincoln 's early years from Director John Ford , concentrating primarily on a trial in which the young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder.<br /><br />The film offers an interesting portrayal of this important American figure and the film is well made , but seems somewhat incomplete without any of the great moments from his presidency or even his debates with Stephen Douglas . The obvious intent was to portray Lincoln as young man developing the attributes that would make him the great man he would become . But the result for me was that while I admired the portrayal it just was n't as satisfying as I think it could have been with a greater scope.<br /><br />In the role of Abraham Lincoln we have Henry Fonda who effectively displays a quiet strength . Fonda 's performance includes some gangly mannerisms ' and other affectations which are fairly effective in presenting a portrayal of Lincoln , particularly when combined with some effective makeup and the costuming which occasionally is a bit to overt.<br /><br />The supporting cast is solid and surprisingly does not include that many of Ford 's regular supporting cast ( sometimes referred to as his stock company ) but we do have Ward Bond one of the most prolific character actors in Hollywood . Bond has appeared in more of the AFI Top 100 Films than any other actor , both the original and revised list . He has also appeared in 11 Best Picture Nominees.<br /><br />The film features one scene that would seem to have inspired a quite similar scene in " To Kill a Mockingbird " , where it would be done even better than it is here , even though that scene is one of the most effective in this film .
1 It 's remarkable that for ' Young Mr. Lincoln 's ' supporting players Ford cast lesser known , other - than - star actors . This not only heightens his film 's focus on the central character of Lincoln , but it also affords the audience a refreshing insight into Lincoln as a man of his place and time , a man embroiled , as each one of us inexorably is , in the issues and sentiments of his time and seeking his way to resolving them . It 's not so much through Fonda 's Lincoln 's words and actions but in the faces , the reactions of the supporting players that Ford tells the story of the formation of the young Lincoln 's worldview , sense of place in society and polity , and of how the people responded to Mr. Lincoln 's words and deeds and placed their trust in this man whom they deemed to have earned their respect and heeding.<br /><br />Give this a try : instead of focusing on Henry Fonda , next time you view ' Young Mr. Lincoln ' shift your focus to the supporting characters - you will , I expect , be handsomely rewarded with a more profound appreciation of both Lincoln and Ford . I like to suspect that Ford 's storytelling through the supporting characters ' reactions to Fonda 's Lincoln may have appealed to David Lean when he directed Omar Sharif in ' Doctor Zhivago ' , in which it 's the supporting characters ' reactions to Zhivago that actually tell about Zhivago .
1 My what a director 's intuition can bring on material that needs just the right nudge in the right directions . Young Mr. Lincoln is filled up with some ' old - fashioned ' values , which in retrospect , despite its two - dimensional portrayal , is at least more respectably done than one might see in the pap in current cinema . What makes it work so extremely well as it does , in all its simplicity and grandeur , is that its a truly great courtroom drama in the guise of a history lesson . < br /><br />We all know of Abraham Lincoln as the 16th president that did the emancipation and after the Civil war got assassinated . But as the lawyer in his earlier years he was charismatic , funny in the most unexpected places , and a true gentleman . He 's not some superhero that can do no wrong ( which was Fonda 's only apprehension to the part before signing on ) , but a figure with possible flaws that are surpassed by his innate goodness and clear sight of right and wrong.<br /><br />It 's suffice to say that John Ford is exceptional as a storyteller almost without trying . Actually , it 's a lie , he does try , but he makes it sort of effortless in the studio system ; he worked in an independent manner while also pleasing simultaneously Zanuck , so he was pretty much left alone to his own succinct practices in " editing in camera " , and not moving it around so as to not waver far off from the story . It 's this strength of conventional wisdom that somehow works hand in hand with the material , as a kind of companion piece to the full - blooded Americana in 1939 as seen in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington ( only here it 's the law and not politics ) . < br /><br />Fonda is terrific in the lead- his first with Ford- and never lets us loose sight of Lincoln past the make - up and extra boost in the shoes . Fonda 's own personality , in a sense , as it would in Grapes of Wrath and My Darling Clementine , comes out in the character of Lincoln . However unlikely it might be , there 's no one else from this period that could have played him then : he 's mature and wise , but has the gumption to prove himself in this case of a convoluted he - saw - that - but - did - she murder case.<br /><br />Only in little bits and pieces , like that final shot which superimposes Lincoln walking down the road with his monument , and a couple of small instances during that big parade scene early on , seem pretty dated . As far as the goals set out with Young Mr. Lincoln , there were all met by Ford and his crew and cast ; it 's not as hokey as one might think going in , and it 's got a strong balance of humor and genuine pathos .
1 Sure it was well shot and made , very well shot and made ! But the story was just so weak . And the portrayal of Lincoln was even weaker . Not that Henry Fonda was n't good but the character he played was nothing but a loon . Do you mean to tell me that Lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect of the law or the court . I mean who the hell was he supposed to be ? Cousin Vinnie ? I mean come on , " I 'll just call you Jackass then " ? ? ? ? I understand that Ford was going for great funny hero guy but I did n't really like this guy at all . He cheats in sports , talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom . How am I supposed to take this seriously.<br /><br />The twist was even weaker . I mean come on ! That was just stupid . The whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams . Saying that I liked it enough , it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so I ca n't say it 's a bad film . In fact I must say that I must say it 's good enough , nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad BUT this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous that I ca n't understand how anyone could consider it great.<br /><br />I have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true I would really have to shake my head .
1 OK , first a correction to the tag posted on this movie 's main page . Abe Lincoln did not walk with his sister in the movie , nor did he stop at his sister 's grave . The individual in question is Ann Rutledge who was a very close friend to Lincoln in his New Salem days . Some say that Ann was , in fact , Lincoln 's girlfriend , but there is no evidence to support it.<br /><br />Now , there are fabrications and fictionalizations in this film . Hollywood has always taken dramatic license with anything under the sun , and " Young Mr. Lincoln " is no exception . However , the courtroom case that is in the film is based on a real event : the accusation of murder against William " Duff " Armstrong , and even though it 's largely fictionalized in this film with lots of name changes , it will still have viewers riveted to the screen . This is Hollywood 's Golden Age , with drama at it 's finest , and Henry Fonda gives possibly the best Lincoln played by anyone .
1 Plotwise this is a rather silly little whodunnit masquerading as a period drama / biopic.<br /><br />However the only reason I wanted to see it in the first place was because I was curious about what the great Henry Fonda was really like at his peak . I was n't disappointed - he produces a truly warm and charismatic performance.<br /><br />In addition I can honestly say that I was never really bored at any stage during the film , so a strong * * * 1/2 Out of * * * * *
1 Undoubtedly one of the great John Ford 's masterpieces , Young Mr. Lincoln went practically unnoticed at the time of its initial release , no wonder because the year was 1939 when many of the greatest movies of the whole cinema history had been released , including the most mythical Western in the history of the genre , John Ford 's milestone Stagecoach and many others , such as Gone with the Wind , The Wizard of Oz , Mr. Smith Goes to Washington which took the Oscar in the only category Young Mr. Lincoln was nominated for , which is Original Screenplay . < br /><br / > It continued to be the most underrated Ford 's film for many years ahead destined to gradually fade away in the shadow of other John Ford 's masterpieces , but by the end of the 1950s American and European film critics and historians took a hold of a note written by legendary Russian director Sergei Eisenstein about the Young Mr. Lincoln where he praised it and acknowledged that if he would only have had an opportunity to direct any American film ever made till then , it would be definitely John Ford 's Young Mr. Lincoln . Impressed by such an undoubted preference from Eisenstein , critics began to see the film again but only with a bit different eyes and film 's reputation has been increasing ever since . < br /><br / > It was far not for the first time the life of one of the most legendary American presidents was brought to the screen . Right in the beginning of the 1930s Griffith did it in his Abraham Lincoln and the same year as Ford 's film , MGM released John Cromwell 's one called Abe Lincoln in Illinois . Curiously enough both of them were based on a very successful Broadway Stage Play released in 1938 and written by Robert Sherwood . < br /><br / > As far as John Ford 's films are concerned , we can easily find many references to the life and deeds and even death of mythical Lincoln 's figure in several of director 's works , such as 1924 The Iron Horse or 1936 The Prisoner of the Shark Island , the second one , just as Young Mr. Lincoln , utilizes as the main musical theme the favourite Lincoln 's song - Dixie.<br /><br / > The screenplay based on a previously mentioned Stage Play and Lincoln 's biographies was written by Lamar Trotti in collaboration with John Ford himself , which was quite a rare thing for Ford to do but final result was simply superb - a script combining elements of the Play with several historical facts as well as myths and legends about the beginning of Abraham Lincoln 's life and law practice culminating in a hilarious but mostly heartbreaking trial scene , which is the film 's highest point and main laugh and tears generator , where Lincoln defends the two young brothers accused of a murder and have to devise a manner to help their mother too when she is brought before the court as a witness and where the prosecuting attorney ( played by Donald Meek ) demands her to indicate which one of her sons actually committed the murder obviously obliging her to the making of an impossible choice of condemning to death one and letting live the other.<br /><br / > Overall it 's a very touching , heart - warming and even funny film with simply magnificent performance from Henry Fonda in his supreme characterization of Abraham Lincoln and with overwhelming richness of other characters no matter how little or how big they are incarnated from the wonderful and intelligent screenplay and conducted by the ability of John Ford 's genius at one of its best deliveries ever . A definite must see for everyone . 10/10
1 This 1939 film from director John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells a fictional tale of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln , his trials ( literally ) and his tribulations . It 's a sentimental film , reasonably well made but hardly breathtaking . The casting of Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems a mistake , for while the actor had the right doleful qualities for the part , even with several inches of makeup and a false nose he 's way too handsome for Honest Abe , who was famously homely . It 's a good try from Fonda , who 's nothing if not sincere , but his miscasting throws the entire film off . The supporting cast is excellent , though , and includes Alice Brady , Ward Bond and Donald Meek . But Ford is too reverential in his treatment of Lincoln , who is presented as just shy of a saint , and in the final scene the movie goes way over the top .
1 This is an amazing film , both for the incredibly energy evoked from the frenetic flamenco dancing , and from the unique way that the filmmakers interweave the story of the stage production with the lives of the characters preparing for it . Spellbinding is the only word I can use to describe the experience . This is not ' Bizet 's Carmen ' by any usual standard . This is not a usual film by any standard . Every nuanced glance , every stomp of the foot , every piece of the music is intertwined so captivatingly that you ca n't take your eyes off the screen . You do n't need to love opera or flamenco(I don't)to be captured , enraptured , enthralled by this film . Subtle and direct ; loud and still ; One of , if not the best , movies of it 's kind , because there are so few like it .
1 Carmen is one of the best films I 've ever seen . It 's hard to say whose performance is best : Antonio Gades , Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are superb . They dance their souls out . It 's a beautiful tale of inseparability of life and myth ; myth penetrates everyday life . Dance becomes life and entire life is danced out . Real people at one and the same time live their own lives and become somebody else , act out the parts of lovers of old . The magic is continuing .
1 In Carmen , Saura once again seeks to establish a dynamic rapport between reality and fiction , between the actual passions of the personalities in a dance company preparing the choreography for the dance portions of the opera Carmen and the scripted passions from the story of the fictional Carmen , the famous fatal mix of a free spirit ( read disregard for fidelity ) and her ability to drive men mad with desire . Saura used this same vehicle fiction / reality in an earlier black - and - white film , Bodes de Sangre ( Blood Wedding ) . But , whereas the tensions between the dancers rehearsing Blood Wedding showed to advantage how they evolved into the fictional characters of the story to be performed through directing their emotions into their roles , in Carmen , the parallel between the petty , libidinal urges of the dancers of the troop during rehearsals and the spirit forging to do with the mythic Carmen never comes even close to being believable . It remains a gadget , and , for that reason , a bothersome distraction . One really needs to see Blood Wedding next to Carmen to appreciate the comparison . However , it hardly matters , the melodrama Saura tries to impose upon his Carmen , because the Flamenco dancing and guitar music of the rehearsals _ which are 95 % of the film _ by some of the best known Flamenco dancers and musicians , more than repays the price of entry . A flawed film , and a wonder : perfect for doing a drill in Keats 's ' negative capacity ' , perhaps ?
1 The movie within the movie - a concept done many times in the history of cinema . It is accomplished here as well as in any.<br /><br />If you love Carmen , you 'll love this version.<br /><br />If you love flamenco , you 'll love this version.<br /><br />The plot of the classic opera is played out in the actual rehearsal of the opera by a flamenco troupe . The music is authentic . The direction wonderful.<br /><br />If you like dancing , you 'll love this version.<br /><br />There is tragedy . There is passion . There is intrigue.<br /><br />There is ... <br /><br />Carmen .
1 While rehearing Carmen of Bizet , the middle - aged choreographer Antonio ( Antonio Gades ) brings the sexy Carmen ( Laura del Sol ) to perform the lead role . Antonio falls in love for Carmen , who is an independent and seductive woman incapable to accept a possessive love . When Carmen has an affair with another dancer , Antonio is consumed by his jealousy like D. José in the original opera , entwining fiction with reality.<br /><br />"Carmen " is another great movie of Carlos Saura 's trilogy dedicated to the Flamenco dance . The dramatic love story is developed with the lives of the artists entwined with the characters they are rehearsing , and many times is not absolutely clear whether what is happening is reality ( with the dancers ) or fiction ( of the play ) . Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous Bizet 's opera , which is based on the novel of Prosper Mérimée . My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Carmen "
1 Passionate , dramatic , riveting as Flamenco itself , the film is simply amazing . It is set on the immortal Bizet 's music . The original music is written and performed by one of the greatest classical guitarists , leading proponent of the Modern Flamenco style , Paco de Lucia who plays a musician with the same name . Legendary Flamenco dancer and choreographer Antonio Gades co / wrote the script and choreographed this fabulous version of the celebrated Georges Bizet / Prosper Mérimée novella / opera . He plays a main character Antonio , the famous dancer / choreographer who works on retelling the story of Carmen in the Flamenco style that combines dances with singing and rhythmic hand clapping and has a highly charged level of dynamics that appeals enormously to the viewers.<br /><br />Brilliant and graceful Cristina Hoyos whose technical excellence matches the elegant artistry of her dancing shines in the supporting role . Hoyos had been the first dancer in Gades ' company for twenty years ( 1968 - 1988 ) and she was the protagonist of three films that Carlos Saura made of Gades ' three great shows : " Bodas de Sangre " ( 1978 ) , " Carmen " ( 1983 ) and " El Amor Brujo " ( 1985 ) . Gorgeous Laura del Sol is a young dancer named Carmen in whom Antony sees from the first sight another Carmen , who was immortalized by two Frenchmen , the writer Prosper Mérimée in his most famous novella written in 1846 that had inspired George Bizet 's world famous Opéra - Comique version from 1875.<br /><br />As in the opera and in the novella , Carmen in Saura 's film is desirable and deadly , the ultimate femme fatale who has to be free above anything else . She could not tolerate the possessive love of any man and would prefer death to submission . There some 50 movie adaptations of the story and the opera to the screen , and as different as they are , they all have in common the only possible tragic end . Saura / Gades ' film is unique as the most sensual of all and truly Spanish . I fell in love with it from the first time I saw it over twenty years ago and it is as special and beautiful today as it was back then . Highly recommended .
1 I first saw this movie when it was released in the U.S. in 1984 . I have seen it many , many times since . What strikes me about the film is the incorporation of the art of the rehearsal into the lives of the characters and visa versa . Throughout the movie the two intertwine and at times one is never too sure if one is watching the lives of the characters or a scene from a rehearsal . This continues up to the climax of the film . All these years later my friends and I still love to debate whether or not " Carmen " is really stabbed at the end . From the reactions of the other characters , to the stylized murder , it is open to debate . The passion of the dance , the quality of the acting , the love of art , and the brilliance of the performances all combine to create a superb movie that , once again , blends and twists the line between life and art .
1 This is one of the best films we watched in my high school Spanish class . If you are a fan of the opera , this film will strongly entertain you . Of course , the dancing is wonderful . Watching these amazing dancers moving to the music of Bizet is well worth checking out .
1 I 've seen this film at least 4 times since ' 84 and it 's still great every time I see it . It 's a very compelling version of the opera Carmen , with amazing Flamenco dancing , bare bones sets , and , of course , wonderful music.<br /><br />This telling of Carmen is a story within a story , with each paralleling the other , until the doubly tragic ending . Obviously a low budget Spanish production , the film contains dancing by some of Spain 's premier Flamenco dancers . The combination of the soaring opera music and the sound of the dancers boots on the wooden stage , makes the telling of the story even more powerful.<br /><br />It 's independent movie making at it 's best and probably my all time favorite foreign film .
1 Personally , I think that the film was done very professionally , I loved the choreography and the acting . The plot is also gripping and mysterious . The film itself is very emotional , and what I liked about it most is that it makes you think afterwards . Antonio Gades has absolutely lived his role to the end , and I must say that it 's one of my favourite pictures and Saura is a wonderful director .
1 Carlos Saura 's Carmen is one of the finest achievements in world , let alone Spanish , cinema . It manages to excite interest in flamenco in its wonderful staged adaptations from Bizet with powerful physical force . At the same time we see the impact of the creation and rehearsal of a new interpretation of Carmen on the choreographer / director and the principle dancers . The fine line between life and art is dazzling .
1 Highly regarded at release , but since rather neglected . Immense importance in the history of performing arts . A classic use of embedded plots . One of my favourite films . Why has n't the soundtrack been re - released ?
1 Eddie Izzard is a one - in - a - million comic genius . He goes from squirrels to WWII to Stonehenge to religion to Englebert Humperdink and it 's absolutely hilarious and it all makes sense ! Get a copy of this now , you wo n't regret it ! I give this an 11 out of 10 .
1 So I 'm at home , flipping channels one night , and I come across this man wearing heels and makeup , standing in front of a colored background on HBO . Naturally , I did a double - take and decided I 'd watch for a little while . I did n't change the channel until he was finished , it was so incredibly hilarious . The next time it was on , I made sure to tape it so I could watch it over and over again , and it has remained one of my favorite things to watch . During the first couple of minutes , you can tell that the audience is n't quite sure what to think , but he quickly wins them over with his incredible humor and wit . While many stand - up comedians mesh together in my brain , Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best . His style is incredibly refreshing , and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to current events . His show stayed with me afterwards . I went to Italy over the summer , and all I could think about while I was there was how " Italians are always on scooters going ' CIAO ... ' " 10 out of 10 . See it . You wo n't regret it .
1 I love Eddie Izzard . I think this is awesome , and the other television specials should be looked at as well . He has a good book " Dress To Kill " out to buy as well , which I think people should read . I loved that this program won an Emmy , and anyone who likes history will probably get a laugh from Eddie . Enjoy :)
1 I had no idea that Mr. Izzard was so damn funny , It really boggles the mind that he is not more well known ! His command over the crowd and his timing is perfect . The monologue about Star Wars will kill ya too ! If only all the stand up performers had his wit ...
1 I find myself comparing all stand - up acts to this one performance now . Even older recorded performances I once thought were funny just do n't seem as funny after seeing Eddie Izzard in this award - winning look at history , language disparities , and Englebert Humperdink ...
1 This has to be the funniest stand up comedy I have ever seen . Eddie Izzard is a genius , he picks in Brits , Americans and everyone in between . His style is completely natural and completely hilarious . I doubt that anyone could sit through this and not laugh their a * * off . Watch , enjoy , it 's funny .
1 witty . funny . intelligent . awesome . i was flipping channels late one night years ago . came across this and a wildfire started . i was staying up late every night and taping it for everyone i know . a few . like 3 people out of the almost 100 people i made watch this did n't think it was as awesome as i did . the others were laughing out loud so hard they were crying and thanking me at the same time . please do yourself a favor . run do n't walk . watch this and enjoy . intelligence and humor . it 's a win - win situation . i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need more of .... sanechaos .
1 In my opinion , this is the best stand - up show I have ever seen . I became an instant Eddie fan after seeing Dress to Kill , but I must say I think this is his best work . I would say , though , if you ever get the chance to definitely go see him live . It is worth it!<br /><br />Most of the time after seeing a stand - up routine a couple times , the jokes start to get old . But I have to say , I 've seen this show SO many times that I literally have the entire thing memorized ( which yes , I realize is kinda sad ) but every joke still makes me laugh . This is truly a feel good show.<br /><br />Dress to Kill will never get old for me . I own it and watch it anytime I need a good laugh .
1 Stumbling upon this HBO special late one night , I was absolutely taken by this attractive British " executive transvestite . " I have never laughed so hard over European History or any of the other completely worthwhile point Eddie Izzard made . I laughed so much that I woke up my mother sleeping at the other end of the house ...
1 I 'd heard of Eddie Izzard , but had never seen him in action . I knew he was a transvestite , and when I saw he was on HBO one night last summer , I put it on , not knowing how my husband would react . Well , he blew us away . He 's better than Robin Williams ever was . He has total control of the audience ; when he does the ' Englebert is dead - no he 's not ' , routine , the audience does n't know what to think by the end . God as James Mason is also an inspired touch , and his version of the Python Spanish Inquisition as carried out by the Church of England - ' Cake or Death ? ' is priceless . My jaws were aching from laughter by the end of the show . We scoured the TV listings for months after that to be able to see him again , and were lucky enough to tape him the next time he came on . If you get the chance to see this show , cancel everything and tape it , you wo n't be disappointed .
1 This video rocked ! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I have ever seen . Not only does he have class , he makes some of the funniest observations on history and culture that I have ever seen . Eddie is the most original and most intelligent comic I 've seen in a VERY long time . Tell all those other stand - ups to get off the stage and let this " executive " reign !
1 This is right up at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows I 've ever seen . I laughed so hard , I 'm sure I missed half the jokes . This showcases Izzard as the brilliantly gifted comedian he is . What I particularly like is that he seems never to be " dumbing down " the material for his audience . His timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance piece rather than just a series of gags . Thumbs way up .
1 This is another gem of a stand up show from Eddie Izzard . You can not fail to laugh at the wide range of topics he talks about . He even takes the piss out of his American audiance at times and most of them did nt even realise it ! A must see for anybody who likes comedians . 9 out of 10 .
1 Hilarious hardly begins to describe this one of a kind genuine tour - de - Star - Wars - force ( Luke : how strong ? Vader : the strength of a small pony ) , in which , being the master he is , he does n't even break a sweat , ingeniously sparing himself mascara leakage .. -and that 's with almost 2 hours of whirling his way thru history , its birthplace , Europe , and more.<br /><br />From Heimlich 's middle - of - the - night , " I 've invented a maneuver ! " to the British Empire 's " .. do you have a flag .. ? " and ancient deadbeat gods , " Jeff ! The God of Biscuits ! " and many more , this is fish - flop - on - the - floor - to - jumpstart - your - lungs funny.<br /><br />And I confess to having passed on this video dozens of times over the years , seeing as a British transvestite standup , vogueing on a chair , is one longshot of a rental after all , especially one going back 10 years now . And yet , the material is not only timeless but almost oracular , turning present day into nothing more than an amplified , funnier / sadder version of where we were at a decade ago , although come to think about it , that may just be a coincidence .
1 This video was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard . We had several friends over one night and for some reason or another had channel - surfed to HBO during the course of the evening . Someone by the name of " Eddie Izzard " was on . I tried not to laugh too loudly at the first few jokes . I did n't want to be held " responsible " for the rest of the group 's enjoyment of something that was obviously killing me . After holding in my laughs for more than was healthful , I let go -- as did the others of us(we were not stoned , by the way , nor talking of insurance and pensions ... ) . We were asphyxiated after that . The story lines , the plot , the bizarre yet ingenious connections throughout the sketches are nothing short of brilliance . I have since been addicted to every Eddie - Izzard - piece - of - comedy I can get my hands on . His work is sheer genius . His comedy appears effortless . He seems more like that hysterically funny friend hanging out at your house and rambling on about this or that ... It 's convulsively funny . He gives you the impression that the joke is between you .. and himself , the only true aficionados of humor , after all . If you are disappointed in this video , you have no sense of the penultimate in humor -- or humour , as they say in the UK .
1 Some people loved " The Aristocrats " and others hated it , frequently walking out in the middle . Reactions to Eddie Izzard are n't likely to be that extreme -- if you can handle a transvestite comedian ( who says he likes girls ) and has a vocabulary that makes , shall we say , enough use of the " f " word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television . Many of Izzard 's fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances . On the other hand , I thought this show was occasionally flatter than Izzard 's chest but also more often than not funny and , in spots , absolutely hilarious . He has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines . He 's not a story teller . He 's not a joke maker . He 's not a frenetic fantasist like Robin Williams . He plays around with ideas , some of which work and some of which -- a routine with the San Francisco cable car and Alcatraz , for instance -- are completely unfunny . He has a way , however , of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect . I gave this performance a 7 and might be persuaded to raise it to an 8 . But a 10 ? No way .
1 A bit of Trivia b / c I ca n't figure out how to submit Trivia : In the backdrop of this performance , one of the images is < br /><br />George Serat 's " A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte " painting ( seen best in chapter 18 ) , this painting is the subject of a Sonheim musical Sunday in the Park with George.<br /><br />A bit of Trivia b / c I ca n't figure out how to submit Trivia : In the backdrop of this performance , one of the images is < br /><br />George Serat 's " A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte " painting ( seen best in chapter 18 ) , this painting is the subject of a Sonheim musical Sunday in the Park with George .
1 I wish I could laugh again as much as when I saw this show for the first time . I have not done so ever since.<br /><br />The strange thing is , I find myself laughing almost as hard after watching the show again , and again . < br /><br />Eddie Izzard is cultivated , is poignant , is a man of the world . He is deft talking about politics and yet feels no need to " engage " in political discussion . He is above that . I would contrast him to George Carlin , who uses his comedy to try and convince people about his ideas , and does not seem to enjoy the fact that he is trying to entertain.<br /><br />Funniest guy on Earth
1 What more could anyone want ? He 's a history lesson , foreign language tutor , NRA representative and ambassador to Burundi dressed in a nice silk frock and heels . I laughed so hard I left a puddle . His woes about puberty , transvestism , public school , and done in several languages made the absolute finest stand - up routine I have ever seen . I think about it now , years later when I see cake ( tea and cake or death ) and hear something translated into French ( the mouse is under the table , the cat is on the chair and the monkey is on the branch . I like his versions of what Jerry Dorsey could have been named before he settled on Englebert Humperdinck . I really hope to see a lot more from this wonderful guy . He has a lot to teach us , and a wonderful way of telling it . Thanks for your time .
1 Right , then , he 's absolutely brilliant . But you must be intelligent and quick to understand his humor . He covers ( attacks ? ) all sorts of topics , such as the first moon landing , Easter / Christmas , transvestitism , movies , and Herr Doktor Heimlich.<br /><br />For those of you are averse to swearing , this is n't for you . While some of us punctuate with commas and periods , he uses the f - word . Also , if you ca n't laugh at yourself , never watch this ; you will feel the fool.<br /><br />Incidentally , I 've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live , and this is by far his best work . He simply shines.<br /><br />What might go so far as to say he is Glorious .
1 One of the best comedians ever . I 've seen this show about 10 times and will probably watch it at least 100 more . My friends and family quote from this DVD so often , you 'd think we did nothing other than watch it . The beginning part about Alcatraz is a little bit slow , but either wade through it or zip on through to the part where Eddie is on stage . Watch for the " Cake or Death " part ( Joking about the Church of England ) and the " Hitler / Pol Pot " part ( Hard to explain , just watch it ) . The best part of the show may be Eddie 's facial expressions . He can really say a lot with his eyes . ( Mascara , eyeliner , and eyeshadow probably help , huh ? ) Fair warning : Eddie does have a tendency to throw a lot of four - letter words in .
1 This is an excellent stand - up DVD ! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I have seen in years . His routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it . I HIGHLY recommend this one . The part about the history of Europe is a bit slow , but the ending jokes in French are quite good , because you do n't have to speak French to get it ( although if you do , it is still hilarious ) . Also , the parts about being a transvestite are quite good . The first scene ( about San Francisco ) is not great , but funny the first time . Skip over those if you can . It 's almost not worth watching . However , this really is a funny , funny stand - up show that everyone should see . " I was dead at the time ! "
1 Eddie Izzard is nothing short of a comedic genius , and this is Eddie at his very best . His material is extremely witty and hilarious , and his delivery is some of the best ever witnessed on stage . Instead of insulting the audience 's intelligence , he relies on it to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences , Hitler , the moon landing , and the British . With so many memorable laughs , one ca n't help but repeat some of his lines . Forever more , " Do you have a flag ? " should be considered one of the funniest lines ever delivered in a standup routine . Every fan of top notch standup comedy needs to see " Dress to Kill " . By far the best British standup comedian I 've ever witnessed , Eddie Izzard has struggled for success off of the live stage . However , his lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how extremely talented he genuinely is . " Dress to Kill " is a treasure , one that luckily has found its way to home video , and can and should be enjoyed again and again .
1 This is definatley one of the best stand - up shows evre . EVER . Eddie is so off the wall that I 've been watching this damn show for nearly five years now , and it still rocks every single time . Just everything from his big broad physical comedy down to the little off the top of the head side remarks , it 's a masterpeice . You need look no further than this line " The word herb . You say erb , and we say herb , cuz ther 's a f###ing h in it " . Brilliant .
1 I managed to tape this off my satellite , but I would love to get an original release in a format we can use here in the States . Eddie truly is Glorious in this performance from San Francisco . I do n't remember laughing so hard at a stand up routine . My wife and I both enjoyed this tape and his work on Glorious I just wish I could buy a copy and help support Eddie financially through my purchase . We need more of his shows available .
1 Eddie Izzard is genius with his non - stop humor . I could listen all day . His unique approach to life is quite logical . His understanding of discovery ( such as the Heimlich Maneuver ) is creative . Eddie Izzard captures the heart of what we think . I do n't know when I laughed so hard at anyone 's off - beat mind .
1 I was first introduced to " Eddie " by friends from " across - the - pond " who know I like intelligent humor . I prefer comedians who can be thought provoking while entertaining such as George Carlin and Dennis Miller . In ' Dress to Kill ' Eddie provides the same type of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject all the while causing your side to split at the same time . There is a wide range of subjects in this stand - up and they are simply hysterical . The piece on how to decide on Englebert 's stage name will leave you in stitches!<br /><br />Thanks Andrew and Catherine ! ... and " Do you have a Flag ? "
1 Izzard was both hysterical and insightful in his humor . He definitely represents his own little niche in the comedic world.<br /><br />It 's a pity more Americans wo n't see this stand - up routine due to its PAL - only availability .
1 Until I saw this special on HBO , I had never heard of Eddie Izzard . I sure am glad that I have now ! He is one of the funniest comedians I have ever seen ! Rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then Eddie . I could not stop laughing for the entire show . If you like to laugh you HAVE to see this special !
1 i watched this tape , immediately rewound it , watched it again and laughed twice as hard . I strongly recommend this tape for those who are not hateful of , but uncomfortable around transvestites . It shows you that transvestitism is a feature , rather than the entirety of one 's being . The comedy is not single issue . This man is brilliant . All comics should aspire to his level of candor , intelligence and talent .
1 This movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence which tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective , so I was hooked by the time the title came on . The theme of this movie is that everyone is acting , trying to re - invent themselves , but not in a tricky way like Identity or the Usual Suspects , but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life we find ourselves in a little more interesting . The scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular . At one point Jorgen ( who owns the chicken farm ) attends a seminar in laughing , where he 's the worst student . His discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his yearning to change himself . The movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most commonplace people I see every day . There 's not a lot of plot here . Guessing the old man 's secret is pretty easy , but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out . This movie appealed to me in the same way that Sideways did , although the characters could n't be more dissimilar .
1 Well , for starters , this actually was THE most elegant Clausen film to this date.<br /><br />The man 's always got a sense for characters with a slice of humor to them , but I think that he in this movie adds a dimension unparrallel to anything he 's made earlier . His work has - in very black n ' white words - been accepted by the broad but not that critical audience , and we 've always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way of letting the audience know what he needs to say.<br /><br />In " Villa Paranoia , however , for the first time , he surprises with an unseen wisdom and a respect for the minorities . Not only the ethnic but also the normal people you tend to forget . Set in Jutland - in ' the country ' - it deals with the everlasting issue of lack of love , but in a close and at times brutal way that keeps you looking and keeps you focused . And on top of that , he himself manages to play a b******d ! A true b*****d , who wants the right thing but has no clue how to get there , and people therefore suffer . Bitterly.<br /><br / > I 'd have to say it 's one of the best movies I 've seen this year and I 'm greatly anticipating his next .
1 A typical Clausen film , but then again not typical . Clausen writes , directs and play one of the leading roles . This is really a great film about normal people living normal lives trying to make the best of it . The 4 primary actors were fantastic.<br /><br />Fritz Helmut was convincing . You believe that he really is sick.<br /><br />Sonja Richter plays a nurse that really is an actor , but it turns out that she is the best nurse to take care of the old man.<br /><br />Everybody has problems and those who nobody believes in ends up being happy . But nothing good comes easy , they have to fight to win their life and love .
1 ROUEN PRIZES AND THE TRIUMPH OF " VILLA PARANOIA " The favorite film of the general public , actually more important than the jury prize , was Erik Clausen 's brilliant bittersweet dramatic comedy , " Villa Paranoia " , which was also selected by the European Youth Jury indicative of its appeal to cinephiles of all ages . The following day director - actor Clausen traveled to the remote Town of MAMERS , Pays de Loire , for a provincial festival of new European cinema , where " Villa Paranoia " picked up three more prizes -- Best film , Professional Jury ; Best Film , Audience prize ; and Best film of another youth jury composed of " lycéens " , French high school students . Five prizes in a single weekend -- not a bad scoop for a film from a small country with unknown actors . In addition , " Villa " was awarded the Grand Prix , the MAVERICK SPIRIT AWARD , at San Jose , California , just a week ago , by distinguished British actor Sir Ben Kingsley ( " Ghandi " ) , making for a grand total of six prizes in a single week . If Lars van Trier has put Denmark on the offbeat - oddball Dogma Cinematic map in recent years , there is now a good chance that Veteran Maverick Erik Clausen ( 62 ) and his capable crew of actors will soon show the world that Denmark has more to offer than dogmatic drivel , which is to say , a mass audience pleaser for young and old alike . Moreover , the female lead of his film , Sonja Richter , has such a magical screen presence that , with a little more exposure , she stands a good chance of becoming the next international Scandinavian Diva . For the record , " Villa Paranoia " is a fiction film , written , directed and acted in by Mr. Clausen , and employing certain motifs from Moliere 's " The Imaginary Invalid " . Anna ( Richter ) , an ambitious young actress , has lost a deeply coveted role in the Moliere play and , reduced to making an utterly stupid TV chicken commercial , is on the verge of suicide . However , Jorgen ( Clausen ) who runs a massive chicken farm sponsoring the spot , offers her a job with room and board taking care of his cantankerous , senile , wheel - chair ridden father , Walentin , who has not spoken a word since his wife Stella committed suicide years before . Anna is the only one who eventually finds a way of communicating with the hostile silent old grouch -- and moreover , discovers that he has been faking deafness and immobility all these years -- a living " Malade Imaginaire " . This will lead to her playing the greatest role of her own life in order to uncover the dark secret which led to Walentin 's total withdrawal from life and reality . Villa " Paradise - Paranoia " , true to the Moliere tradition from which it is partially derived , is a heartwarming , multi - layered , serial - comic psycho - drama that literally has something for everybody and only needs proper placement to attain the kind of general international outreach it richly deserves .

1 Being from Canada , I can not say whether this film is original in the context of Danish cinema - unfortunately , we , here , do not get to see many Danish films in a year ! I also can not comment on Clausen 's acting in the context of his other roles - I personally found him quite believable - a touching monstrosity of a man , this Jorgen ! As for the actor who played Kenneth - why would his participation in a TV show rule him out as an actor - are n't we over such elitist attitudes ? International viewers unaware of his Big Brother participation will find him a fair actor.<br /><br />In spite of the movie 's faults ( the writing could have been subtler in some instances ) , I do subscribe to what one could call the ' message ' of the film - namely art 's essential role in everyday life , art as healing force . Art , as Nietzsche said , sanctifies the lie ( ' Kunst heiligt die Luege ' ) - it is a holy lie : the wedding scene is fabulous in this sense - a theatrical , not religious , wedding , celebrating love and life as play ...
1 The lovely Danish actress Sonja Richter steals this film from under the noses of everyone , no small feat considering the terrific performances surrounding her.<br /><br />Richter plays Anna , an out - of - work , independent - minded , somewhat neurotic ( and perhaps suicidal ) actress who lands a desperation job looking after a wheelchair - bound , muted , aged father named Walentin ( the great Danish actor Frits Helmuth , who died at 77 shortly after this film was made).<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT < br /><br />Walentin refuses to respond to anyone --until he confronts the gifted Anna , whose whimsical and mischievous manner brings the poor old battered devil back from a self - imposed death sentence.<br /><br />Writer / director / actor Eric Clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty a ponderous businessman son ( Jorgen , played by Clausen ) has loving a father who has never accepted him . The film sags toward the end , but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia , the nature and value of loving and caring , and how one person , the irrepressible Anna , can alter the course of a human life . Highly recommended . Sonja Richter 's performance is alone worth the price of admission .
1 This movie has been made by one of the most absurd humorists in Canada , Yves P. Pelletier . I was shocked for a second that he made a ROMANTIC comedy , but knowing he was a heavy cinephile , was seen in every local festival and in the local cinematheque , I had a positive feeling about this movie.<br /><br />Hell , I was right . Right off the bat , the scenario ( written by Pelletier himself ) is a bit twisted and hard to follow , but , in Pelletier 's fashion it 's a one - of - a - kind 90 minutes jack - in - the - box.<br /><br />Loosely inspired and mostly transformed allusion to Dangerous Liaisons ( by Laclos ) " Les Aimants " consists of a twisted game of writing notes on the fridge . Throughout the movie you 'll get the occasion to find out who 's who and who 's writing to who on that goddam fridge .... which pops up in an interesting love affair.<br /><br />Great storyline , great photography , great quotations of other movies . Should we ask more for a first movie ?
1 And I absolutely adore Isabelle Blais ! ! ! She was so cute in this movie , and far different from her role in " Quebec - Montreal " where she was more like a man - eater . I think she should have been nominated for a Jutra . I mean , Syvlie Moreau was good , but Isabelle was far superior , IMO . Pelletier has done fine work for his first time out , and I noticed he snuck in a couple of his buddies from Rock et Belles Oreilles , Guy A. LePage & Andre Ducharme . It was fun to see them in this , I did n't know they were going to appear.<br /><br />I do n't think I 've seen a romantic comedy from Quebec that I did n't like , and this one is as good as any I 've had the pleasure to see . And if you 're in the states and wondering how you can get a copy of the DVD , www.archambault.ca delivered it to me in less than a week .
1 This movie is light , funny , and beautifully filmed . The lightning is absolutely superb , and the colours convincingly remind Vermeer paintings.<br /><br />This is sentimental comedy at its best , way above US and French standards , and arguably better than English ones too . < br /><br />Every character is touching , and interpretation is close to perfection . Isabelle Blais is splendid , Sylvie Moreau is better than in the Catherine series , Stéphane Gagnon is charming , Emmanuel Bilodeau is great in that weird role of his , and Geneviève Laroche is the perfect best friend!<br /><br />I could go on for hours before finding any negative comment on this movie , so give it a chance , and add your own review .
1 After you 've seen this small likable and comical film , you will for sure feel better . Cheer to Yves B. Pelletier to have given birth to this small magnificent movie moment , that according to me , will be recognized as a marking movie of year 2004 for the Quebec . The actors Isabelle Blais , Emmanuel Bilodeau , Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon all deliver a touching performance . I would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to the ones that Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain have given me . So if you 've like the Jean - Pierre Jeunet magnificent film , I would say that you should also like the first movie from Yves B. Pelletier , Les Aimants
1 Esther Kahn is a young Jewish woman living in an overcrowded , Jewish Ghetto in 19th century England . She is surrounded by looming , oppressive , dreary , featureless , worn brick architecture , narrow sidewalks and streets , blacked out windows , and hordes of black - and - brown jacketed crowds.<br /><br />She lives in a tiny apartment with her large family whom operate a clothes shop within the apartment . As child , she worked , had no privacy , wore colourless clothing , shared a bed , and remained silent to avert the mockery of her mother and siblings who ridiculed her for mimicking them out of boredom.<br /><br />As a young woman , her life remains the same - she has no privacy , lives in a state of mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and inertia , exudes a blank , featureless expression , is clothed in plain , unremarkable clothing , and is continuously oppressed and dwarfed by the grey , mundane , massively imposing buildings , and narrow streets , and narrow hallways , and narrow doorways , and her loud - mouthed mother and siblings , and the prosaic , banal lifestyle of her family.<br /><br />Her only form of mental escape is the Yiddish theatre . Sitting in the balcony , front row , leaning over the rail , there is a vast space between her mind and the stage , a space that enables her to breathe , think , feel , and yearn.<br /><br />Yet despite the freedom of thought the open stage provides for Esther , her face and body remain torpidly somnolent , impassive , dispassionate.<br /><br />The plain and common looking Summer Phoenix brilliantly conveys Esther 's emotionless demeanour - Summer / Esther does not convey any desire to want anything or anticipate anything.<br /><br />After an unusual explosive confrontation with her mother , Esther finally decides to break free from the bleak life she is trapped in.<br /><br />She is eventually cast in minor parts in a few stage plays , and meets Nathan Quellen , portrayed by quintessential British actor Ian Holm , who commences to teach Esther the technical skill of acting.<br /><br />From this point forward , Esther begins a grueling dual journey of learning how to act and learning how to feel.<br /><br />She begins experiencing emotions she never felt before , and she begins gaining the experience she needs to fully comprehend and wield the technical aspects of acting.<br /><br />Nathan walks her across the stage through the physical and emotional steps of surprise , hesitancy , anger , disgust , self - loathing , etc ; she then begins walking through those emotions in her personal life.<br /><br />There are three truths , Nathan tells her - the truth of how a character reacts , the truth of how the actor would react , and the truth that a character and actor are not the same person.<br /><br />These technical steps and three truths slowly deconstruct Esther 's defenses and lead her to two edifying experiences in the denouement of the film which mark the beginning of her freedom of thought , movement , and emotion.<br /><br />Esther Kahn is a technically challenging film to watch because of its odd and narrow camera shots , lackluster photo direction which conveys the realistic lackluster setting of the Ghetto , and Summer Phoenix 's characterless and insipid and unappealing portrayal which brilliantly conveys Kahn 's mental and physical hebetude and lethargy and lackluster nature.<br /><br />A must - see film for people who want to learn the technical craft of acting , and for people who appreciate minimalistic films and character studies .
1 This is an extremely dense , somber , and complicated film that unravels quite slowly , revealing excruciating detail , like the attention paid in a novel , and watching this film " IS " like watching a novel unfold . While I did n't care for the narrator , as I felt he was out of balance with the rest of the performances , this film features some of the best ensemble acting I have ever seen , and the lead , Summer Phoenix , is fabulous . Her innocence and naivete some might find implausible , sort of a cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland . I can buy that critique , but she 's still fabulous , partially because she 's unlike anything I 've ever seen before.<br /><br />This film is unbelievably beautiful , filmed by Eric Gautier , and part of what is so unique about this film is how it does n't ever show what you 'd expect . It 's always surprising , and despite it 's length , the film never reveals more than it needs to . At 163 minutes , it 's extremely concise , to a fault , I 'd say , which is one of the wonders of this film . It 's filled with brief moments which are simply stunning , some of the best you 're likely to see all year , and all these moments add up in the end to an extraordinary film experience . The family moments are unique , Ian Holm is brilliant , and what this film has to say about the theater has n't been seen in films since Cassavetes ' " Opening Night , " or perhaps Chaplin 's " Limelight . " But , believe it or not , this film is much " less " conventional . I never knew where this film was going , and now , having seen it , it still has multiple possibilities . This is a powerful , incredibly provocative film .
1 I have seen the movie at the Viennale a few years ago , where the audiences liked it . I liked it as well , Summer Phoenix performance still haunts me , that´s why I decided to write a comment.<br /><br />The story unfolds in London around 1900 , where a jewish girl decides to become an actress . She tries desperately to become one , but it isn´t before a man treats her badly that she realizes on stage , that she has talent and that she connects with the audience and emerges as a stronger human being.<br /><br />There were certain reviews , were her performance was smashed , they accused her of being dull , not able to bring life to her character . I think that´s her strong point , that´s exactly what Esther Kahn should be and Phoenix makes a brave decision to make her Esther a rather boring girl . So her transformation at the end is more powerful than it could have been otherwise . < br /><br />The cinematography is great , the images of London around the turn of the century are very dark and sad , you can see how unpleasant life was back then . < br /><br />The only fault in my opinion is the length of the movie , you loose touch with the characters , after all it´s only about finding the actor in yourself , so there are no dramatic actions in the film . It´s Phoenix credit that we don´t loose the interest in the movie after the first hour .
1 A masterpiece.<br /><br />Thus it is , possibly , not for everyone.<br /><br />The camera work , acting , directing and everything else is unique , original , superb in every way - and very different from the trash we are sadly used to getting.<br /><br />Summer Phoenix creates a deep , believable and intriguing Esther Kahn . As everything else in this film , her acting is unique - it is completely her own - neither " British " nor " American " nor anything else I have ever seen . There is something mesmerizing about it.<br /><br />The lengthy , unbroken , natural shots are wonderful , reminding us that we have become too accustomed to a few restricted ways of shooting and editing .
1 Summer Phoenix did a great performance where you really feel what she 's not able to feel and you just can not understand what she has on her mind . Besides , she portrays a jewish girl who behaves really confronting the status quo of that century .
1 This unassuming , fairly routine series deserves credit in the TV history books for two reasons : it was the first to win an Emmy award for best syndicated series , and it was the very first show to come from the fabled studios of Republic Pictures , known for its low - budget but high - powered shoot - em - ups in the 30 's and 40's.<br /><br />Republic was one of the first Hollywood studios to make a leap into the small screen , which was still in its infancy . But the studios ' tenure as producer of TV pulp fiction would be brief . After this show , they would later dabble with the other format that they were known for , the adventure serial , with " Commando Cody " , as well as other series , but like this one , they did n't last longer than 39 episodes . Also , Republic was in its last stages as a studio ; it would finish out its tenure in Hollywood as rental stages for several Revue Studio series such as " Soldiers of Fortune " , the original " Dragnet " , and " Kit Carson " , before finally shutting its doors in 1959.<br /><br />Anyway , " Stories of the Century " was n't that bad of an oater , its calling card was tales based on authentic figures in Western history , mainly outlaws like Black Bart , Johnny Ringo , John Wesley Hardin , The Dalton Bros. and the like . The late Jim Davis , best known for his role as the Ewing patriarch in " Dallas " , put in an amiable job in the lead role as Matt Clark , a fictional railroad detective who has to contend with said outlaws , played by veteran and soon - to - be veteran character actors.<br /><br />Two amazing facts here : The incidents would take place in different time lines , some in the 1880 's , some at the turn of the century , but Clark never ages . And also , Matt has the good luck to saddle himself with two lovely female detectives as sidekicks , Frankie Adams , played by Mary Castle , and her replacement , Margaret " Jonesy " Jones , by Kristine Miller . The Lone Ranger could only wish for lady companionship . You can only spend such time with Tonto for so long.<br /><br />"Stories Of The Century " is a Studio City TV production from Republic Pictures Corp. 39 episodes were made during 1954 , all 39 of which are in public domain and on DVD .
1 " Stories of the Century " was a half hour series and appeared in first run syndication during the ' 54-'55 television season . It was also the first western TV series to win an Emmy award . Starring veteran western actor Jim Davis as railroad detective Matt Clark , the series set Clark and his fellow railroad detective partners ( Mary Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as " Jonesy " during the second half)against historic western outlaws of various periods ranging from the mid-1860 's to the early 1900 's . The series was very satisfying , easy to watch , and fairly realistic due mainly to the easygoing charm of Jim Davis in the lead role . He seemed like an actual western character . One other note . When Matt Clark would arrive in town after a long ride he actually looked like he had been on a long horse ride as he would be covered in dust.<br /><br />A very good early adult western .
1 This rather poorly named western series won an Emmy for best syndicated program and is certainly an interesting series . It was produced by Republic , the studio which did action better than anyone , and they put their best into it . Each episode was built around a real historical figure of the old west . A railroad detective named Matt Clark , similar to the later Elliot Ness with the gangsters of the 1920 's and 30 's , managed to become involved with almost every notorious western outlaw between the middle of the 1800 's and WWI . The series ' best asset was Jim Davis . Tall , rugged , ruggedly good looking , in prime shape , with an authentic western accent , and great riding skills which made him utterly convincing in the action scenes , Davis was every inch the western hero . He was teamed with two lovely and active co - stars , Mary Castle as " Frankie " during the first season , and Kristine Miller as " Jonesy " during the second . Each worked well with Davis.<br /><br />What separated this show from its contemporaries and much of what came later was the professionalism invested in the action scenes . Ace action directer William Witney directed 30 episodes . Franklin Adreon the rest . Both filmed the action with polish . Republic 's vast store of stock footage from serials and B 's was utilized to give scope . The level of individual episodes rose or fell with the quality of the guest stars brought in to the play the outlaws . Among the really good ones were Marie Windsor as Belle Starr , Lee Van Cleef as Jesse James , Fess Parker as Grat Dalton , Jean Parker as Cattle Kate , and Joe Sawyer and Slim Pickins as Butch Cassady and " The Smilin ' Kid " . The cream of the western up and comers , Pickins , Parker , Denver Pyle , James Best , and Richard Jaeckel , honed their craft . B veterans with decades of experience under their belts , Harry Woods , Glenn Strange , Kenneth MacDonald , Earle Hodgkins , Steve Darrell , and Chief Yowlachie , provided the old leather feel of vintage westerns.<br /><br />The weakness of the concept was that there are only so many famous western outlaws . By the second season the famous figures were becoming a mite obscure for all by the most dedicated history buff . Nevertheless , a few of the later shows were a match for any , due to the guest stars . Henry Brandon portrayed rustler Nate Champion , and former Republic star Don Barry was outstanding as small - time outlaw Milt Sharp.<br /><br />Western fans or history buffs will want to see this .
1 This is an interesting series that takes real life people ( Jesse James , John Wesley Hardin , etc) ... and dramatizes part of their real story with a continuing series character taking part in that story . Railroad Detective " Matt Clark " -- takes a role in tracking down famous outlaws from the Old West in stories that are at least partly based on the true accounts . In that sense , it 's almost an anthology series , and as someone else pointed out , this odd structure poses some timeline conflicts with the real events , but it 's a fun series with plenty of action to satisfy a western - hungry 1950 's audience -- and it still holds up pretty well 55 years later . Clark cuts a powerful figure in his western gear as he goes up against some of history 's baddest baddies . And his girl - sidekick Frankie is quite a dish . If you 're a western fan , be sure to check it out if you have a chance .
1 As I am always looking for something new and unique , I watched this film online . I thought that it would be just another " B " rate movie but I was amazed at the acting by the two main characters . All of the actors in this film were very capable and well directed . The plot was wonderful and unique as well with an excellent moral to the story.<br /><br />This movie is definitely not for someone looking for a sex romp , " Dumb and Dumber " or blood and guts . This is a wonderfully poignant film showing some grim realities of life coupled with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting.<br /><br />I would prefer this movie to many " A " rate movies I have seen even a great number with high box office earnings.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie .
1 2 WORDS : Academy Award . Nuff said . This film had everything in it . Comedy to make me laugh , Drama to make me cry and one of the greatest dance scenes to rival Breakin 2 : Electric Boogaloo . The acting was tip top of any independant film . Jeremy Earl was in top form long since seen since his stint on the Joan Cusack Show . His lines were executed with dynamite precision and snappy wit last seen in a very young Jimmy Walker . I thought I saw the next emergance of a young Denzel Washington when the line " My bus ! ! It 's .... Gone " That was the true turning point of the movie . My Grandmother loved it sooo much that i bought her the DVD and recommended it to her friends . It will bring tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart as you see the white Tony Donato and African American Nathan Davis bond . Through thick ( being held up at knife point ) and thin ( Nathan giving Tony tips on women ) the new dynamic duo has arrived and are out to conquer Hollywood .
1 In Holland a gay writer Gerard ( Jeroen Krabbe ) gives a lecture . He stays overnight with a beautiful woman Christine ( Renee Soutendijk ) and has sex with her ( by imagining she 's a boy ) . He plans to leave the next day , but gets a look at a picture of Christine 's hunky boyfriend Herman ( Thom Hoffman ) and decides to stay to have a try at him . Then things get strange.<br /><br />A big X - rated art house hit in the US in 1983 . Why was it X rated ? Let 's see ... there 's strangulation , full frontal male and female nudity , castration , mutilation , simulated sex , a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people , a gay sex scene in a crypt ... and it 's all a comedy ! ! ! ! ! Paul Verhoeven made this after " Spetters " . " Spetters " was attacked by the critics for it 's extreme sexual sequences and denounced as trash . So , Verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking the critics would think it was art and praise it . He was right ! Critics loved the film not realizing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke on them . Still , it 's a great film . < br /><br />It 's beautifully shot by Jan de Bont ( now a director himself ) and there 's so much symbolism and obvious " hidden " layers in the dialogue that you 're never bored . All the acting is great -- Krabbe plays a thoroughly despicable character but ( somehow ) has you rooting for him ; Soutendijk is just stunning to look at and plays her part to perfection -- the little smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling ; Hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body -- he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and going at with Krabbe in the crypt.<br /><br />This is not for people easily offended or the weak of heart , but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you ( like me ) this is for you ! A 10 all the way .
1 Paul Verhoeven 's De Vierde Man ( The Fourth Man ) is one of the most compelling thrillers I have ever seen . It really was a pleasant surprise . The story concerns bi - sexual writer Gerard ( Jeroen Krabbe ) , as he is lured into a relationship with beautiful hairdresser Christine ( Renée Soutendijk ) , but in the twisted mind of Gerard there could be more to the story . Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and sickening sexual imagery , this really pulls you into the story , you do n't want to watch , but you ca n't turn yourself away . This is by far Verhoeven 's best film ( maybe second only to Robocop ) . True The Fourth Man is n't for everyone , some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous ( just ignore them , but trust me , if you watch for at least ten minutes you 'll be hooked . This is one of those films that you need to know how it ends , a true whodunit it in the Hitchcock tradition , compelling , controversial and thrilling . I even like the spider metaphor.<br /><br / > 8/10
1 Director Paul Verhoeven 's American vehicles are of varied quality , but most of the films he made in his native country are indisputable masterworks . This is the story of alcoholic ( and bi - sexual ) writer who moves in with a beautiful rich and very strange woman . But the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the woman 's handsome male lover . In the meantime , the writer is plagued with strange visions - at first they look like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse , but he soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of premonitions . Fascinating Hitchcockian thriller , very original and provocative . I love films that make you think they are about something , but then you realize they are about something completely different . This is one of those movies ; a thriller during the first half , and a quasi - religious surrealist saga during the second half . Very erotic , original and blasphemous , not for kids or people that go to church every Sunday . Great cinematography by future director Jan de Bont . Highly Reommended !
1 Paul Verhoeven 's predecessor to his breakout hit ' Basic Instinct ' is a stylish and shocking neo - noir thriller . Verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films , both in his native Holland and in America and this film is one of the reasons why . The Fourth Man follows the strange story of Gerard Reve ( played by Jeroen Krabbé ) ; a gay , alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to Vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes . While there , he meets the seductive Christine Halsslag ( Renée Soutendijk ) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him , even if it kills him.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film , and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it . Many of the occurrences in The Fourth Man could be what they appear to be , but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration , and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on . Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself , and that is one of things I like best about him . This film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards ( and that does n't happen very often ! ) . I wo nt spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work ... but you 'll see what I mean when you see the film ( make sure you get the uncut version ! ) . There is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one I 've mentioned , but are lovely nonetheless ; a man gets eaten by lions , another one has a pipe sent through his skull , a boat is smashed in half ... lovely.<br /><br />The acting in The Fourth Man is n't anything to write home about , but it 's solid throughout . Jeroen Krabbé holds the audience 's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer . It is Renée Soutendijk that impresses the most , though , as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale . Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine years later with Basic Instinct , but the original fatale did it best . Paul Verhoeven 's direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view , all of which help to create the mystery of the story . Verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish , but he obviously has talent and it 's a shame that he does n't put it to better use . Of all the Verhoeven films I 've seen , this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across ; trust me , it 's worth the effort .
1 " De vierde man " ( The Fourth Man , 1984 ) is considered one of the best European pycho thrillers of the eighties . This last work of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country before he moved to Hollywood to become a big star with movies like " Total Recall " , " Basic Instinct " and " Starship Troopers " is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author ( Jeroen Krabbe ) going to the seaside for recovering . There he meets a mysterious femme fatale ( Renee Soultendieck ) and starts a fatal love affair with her . He becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstances ... <br /><br />"De vierde man " is much influenced by the old Hollywood film noire and the psycho thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells . It takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere , and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to push the story straight forward . The suspense is sometimes nearly unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of Italian cult director Dario Argento.<br /><br />The cast is also outstanding , especially Krabbe 's performance as mentally disturbed writer that opened the doors for his international film career ( " The Living Daylights " , " The Fugitive " ) . If you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on TV , video or DVD , do n't miss it !
1 The morbid Catholic writer Gerard Reve ( Jeroen Krabbé ) that is homosexual , alcoholic and has frequent visions of death is invited to give a lecture in the literature club of Vlissingen . While in the railway station in Amsterdam , he feels a non - corresponded attraction to a handsome man that embarks in another train . Gerard is introduced to the treasurer of the club and beautician Christine Halsslag ( Renée Soutendijk ) , who is a wealthy widow that owns the beauty shop Sphinx , and they have one night stand . On the next morning , Gerard sees the picture of Christine 's boyfriend Herman ( Thom Hoffman ) and he recognizes him as the man he saw in the train station . He suggests her to bring Herman to her house to spend a couple of days together , but with the secret intention of seducing the man . Christine travels to Köln to bring her boyfriend and Gerard stays alone in her house . He drinks whiskey and snoops her safe , finding three film reels with names of men ; he decides to watch the footages and discover that Christine had married the three guys and all of them died in tragic accidents . Later Gerard believes Christine is a witch and question whether Herman or him will be her doomed fourth husband . < br /><br />The ambiguous " The Vierde Man " is another magnificent feature of Paul Verhoeven in his Dutch phase . The story is supported by an excellent screenplay that uses Catholic symbols to build the tension associated to smart dialogs ; magnificent performance of Jeroen Krabbé in the role of a disturbed alcoholic writer ; and stunning cinematography . The inconclusive resolution is open to interpretation like in many European movies that explore the common sense and intelligence of the viewers . There are mediocre directors that use front nudity of men to promote their films ; however , Paul Verhoeven uses the nudity of Gerard Reve as part of the plot and never aggressive or seeking out sensationalism . Last but not the least ; the androgynous beauty of the sexy Renée Soutendijk perfectly fits to her role of a woman that attracts a gay writer . My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " O 4o Homem " ( " The 4th Man " )
1 When it comes to Paul Verhoeven and erotic thrillers , most people think of " Basic Instinct " and some maybe of " Showgirls " . But Verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies : " De Vierde Man " . This film is mesmerizing and mindblowing - and above all the story is absolutely plausible , which makes the whole experience even more intense . The performances by Jeroen Krabbe , Renee Soutendijk and Thom Hoffman are exceptional , and Verhoeven 's direction does the rest . " De Vierde Man " makes even " Basic Instinct " look quite tame ... It ca n't get much better than this , a true classic of erotic nightmare cinema . 10 out of 10 , at least ...
1 I do n't know if I 'd consider it a masterpiece of not , but it 's damn near close ; it 's extremely well made , artistic , suspenseful , intricately plotted , thematically challenging and full of bleak foreshadowing and sexual - religious imagery . There 's also some great camera - work from Jan de Bont , an atmospheric score from Loek Dikker and outstanding acting from Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk , the latter giving one of the most sneaky , subtle ' femme fatale ' performance I 've ever seen . Like many other European movies , this movie has an unashamed , non - judgmental attitude toward sex , nudity and the complexities of sexuality and has zero reservations about mixing it all up with religious and/or surrealistic ( some would say blasphemous ) images . In other words , if you ca n't bear the thought of seeing a lust - driven homosexual envisioning the object of his carnal desire as Jesus crucified on the cross before the two of them go at it inside a cemetery crypt then this might not be the movie for you . What surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess . It mixes the abstract / surreal / parallel fantasy - reality scenes and somehow makes it all work . Like any good mystery , you can see the pieces slowly falling into place as the movie progresses . There is NOT an out - of - left - field resolution here . The movie has direction , there 's no needless filler and once it concludes , you begin to understand the purpose of what may have confused you earlier . If you like the work of Ken Russell and David Lynch , I can almost guarantee you will love this movie . Hell , if   you have no idea who they even are , you still might like it.<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil the plot by getting too detailed , but the film 's opening shot - through a web as a spider catches its prey - sets the stage as Krabbé , as unshaven , smug , bisexual writer Gerard Reve ( interestingly , also the name of the writer whose novel this is based on ) crosses paths with a wealthy , mysterious , sexy woman named Christine ( Soutendijk , melding androgynous stylings with Simone Simon - like innocence / cuteness that 's pretty unnerving ) , who may be a literal ' black widow ' responsible for the deaths of her three previous husbands . The two become lovers and move in with one another , but we 're led to believe ( through Christine 's bizarre behavior and the frequent appearances of another woman - played by Geert de Jong - who may or may not actually exist ) something terrible is boiling under the surface . When another of Christine 's lovers , the young and " beautiful " Herman ( Thom Hoffman ) , shows up at the house , things take an unexpected turn . And that 's all you need to know.<br /><br />THE 4TH MAN was a huge art - house success in much of the world , but did n't make it over to the US until 1984 , where it was awarded the Best Foreign Film of the year from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association . The most common video is the Media release , which has been horribly dubbed . Try to avoid that one and head straight for the newer subtitled Anchor Bay DVD release . Since coming to America , Verhoeven 's career has had its ups and downs . He has made a few decent films ( Flesh & Blood , RoboCop ) and some lousy ones ( Showgirls ) . In fact , Verhoeven 's big hit Basic Instinct is almost like a less interesting , junior league version of The Fourth Man . Soutendjik also tried her hand at acting in America and since GRAVE SECRETS ( 1989 ) and EVE OF DESTRUCTION ( 1991 ) were the best offers she was getting , she headed right back home to the Netherlands .
1 Viewing DE VIERDE MAN ( aka THE FOURTH MAN ) is a slightly unsettling and rather fascinating experience . It 's a very tight and intense psychological mystery / thriller from Netherlands 's Paul Verhoeven . He directed this film just before he got big with his " free - ticket to Hollywood "- movie FLESH + BLOOD . In a lot of user - comments on this site I noticed the mentioning of Alfred Hitchcock . Indeed , this movie might very well be Hitchcockian , but I also noticed touches of early Cronenberg ( the visceral ) , flavors of David Lynch ( surreal story - linked visuals ) and even Roman Polanski ( plot - wise set - up ) . Funny thing is that the movies by those directors I was thinking of while watching DE VIERDE MAN were n't made until after 1983 , the year of release of THE FOURTH MAN . So go figure.<br /><br />Very much credit indeed must be given to the story of the original novel by Gerard Reve this movie is based on . Gerard Reve is also the fictional name of the main character ( a tormented writer , played by Jeroen Krabbé , balancing on the dangerous line of a severe psychosis ) . Now , has anybody stopped and thought about the fact that the word " rêve " is French for " dream " ? And the film does feature a lot of dream - like / nightmarish sequences , often to that extend that you do n't always know for sure if Gerard is awake or dreaming himself . Could this be coincidence ... ? Maybe it 's just me , but I do n't think so . Renée Soutendijk is pretty amazing as the leading lady ( in a rather demanding role ) . She sometimes seems to be guilty of over - acting ( in a subtle way ) . But that aspect was clearly intentional to portray the character she plays , since as this movie progresses , you become unsure about what to actually think of this lady and her intentions . Proves again what an excellent actress she is . I might add that the movie contains also several scenes portraying full frontal male & female nudity , as well as some rather explicit sex - scenes ( and you will even notice that some scenes and aspects clearly were the blueprints of scenes later to be shot for Verhoeven 's BASIC INSTINCT).<br /><br />Another aspect this movie has is a lot of symbolism and biblical references / images , which supposedly made the film thoroughly hated by some conservative / catholic movements at the time of its European release . Either way , it makes the movie worthy of a second viewing . Now , someone recently told me he had grave misgivings about DE VIERDE MAN . One of them being that the film supposedly manoeuvers itself into a position where it needs the divine intervention of the Virgin Mary to resolve itself . I myself have big issues with the way Catholicism has been , and still is sometimes , portrayed in many movies in any genre ( so not only when it comes to religiously themed horror movies ) . But surprisingly , I had no misgivings whatsoever when it comes to THE FOURTH MAN . Although the Virgin Mary - aspect in the plot did make me scratch my head at one point , I also had fun with it , in a way . I think the keyword as to why it did n't bother me at all is ' duality ' . Because , this movie works on two levels . Although ' divine intervention ' might have resolved the plot - line from the protagonist 's point of view ... on the other hand : the movie implies that all this might have been the delirious ramblings of a raving madman . And that 's the fun part : You never know for sure . And then there 's the question : Could it be that Gerard Reve was somehow receiving distorted visions of things to come ... like receiving omens ? At one point in the movie , Gerard even tries to fool Christine into believing he is clairvoyant . The way he is playing Christine in that particular scene is exquisite to behold.<br /><br />So with its compelling story , convincing acting performances and adequate direction , DE VIERDE MAN is a very much recommended viewing indeed ( especially if you enjoy a solid European psychological horror film ) . But make sure you see the original Dutch version ( not the dubbed one ) .
1 Paul Verhoeven has one of the strangest oeuvres of any major director : he started off making art - house films in his native Netherlands before moving to Hollywood where he began making subversive genre pieces which are often seen as mere entertainments by the mainstream crowd . 1983 's The Fourth Man was the last film he made before moving to the U.S. and it seems to have been a transitional film for him.<br /><br />From the beginning of The Fourth Man it 's clear that the film will be seen from the perspective of the famous albeit impoverished author Gerard . In a seeming homage to Carol Reed 's similarly titled 1949 film The Third Man the film begins with an author making a trip to speak to a crowd of literature enthusiasts . The similarities end there , however , as Gerard runs into no major complications before arriving at the auditorium and the speech itself goes fairly smoothly . In spite of the relative ease with which he completes this function we know that the author is somewhat troubled as he has realistic fantasies about murdering his roommate before leaving his house and he also has a surreal fantasy involving a hotel he sees advertised and a detached eyeball growing out of a door 's peephole . That he sometimes has trouble keeping his fantasies separate from reality is made all the more clear when an anecdote he tells is exposed as untrue and he admits that he " lie{s } the truth until { he } no longer knows whether something did or did n't happen . " < br /><br />The Fourth Man is full of surreal fantasies and dreams which are made all the more disturbing because it 's very easy to see how they relate to events which we have seen occur and because they sometimes foreshadow events which have n't occurred yet . Between the effectiveness of the unreal sequences and Verhoeven 's careful editing style this ends up being the most atmospheric film this side of Do n't Look Now and like that film this one is full of ambiguity . Unlike that film The Fourth Man is also perversely funny as Gerard 's deeply held Catholic beliefs seep into every aspect of his life including sexuality . He naturally associates a female hair stylist he knows intimately with the Biblical Delilah though he fears she 'll remove an even more important symbol of masculinity with her scissors . In an erotic fantasy sequence that would make Luis Buñuel blush he substitutes a man he 's attracted to for a life size statue of Christ on the cross.<br /><br />The Fourth Man is a horror film which manages to bring the viewer into the mind of the protagonist while still maintaining a certain ambiguity : it certainly seems as if Gerard is in danger but it may just be more of his " lying the truth . " The film is also full of both subtle and not so subtle visual symbolism which helps make it a unique and satisfying cinematic experience .
1 This is the last Dutch language film Paul Verhoeven made before going on to make mainstream Hollywood films " Basic Instinct , " " Robocop , " and " Total Recall , " among others . He sets the stage by opening this story with a black widow spider catching prey in her web before we meet Gerard Reve , an annoying self - centered writer with a morbid imagination . Gerard has been invited to be the guest speaker at a Literary Club meeting in sea - side town an hour or so from Amsterdam . Verhoeven lets us have glimpses of how Gerard 's imagination twists reality . Asked if writers are a bit close to insanity he admits when he reads the newspaper " and it says ' boom ' I read ' doom , ' when it says ' flood ' I read ' blood , ' when it says ' red ' I see ' dead . ' " When he tells a story enough times he begins to believe it ; " I lie the truth . " He accepts an offer to be the overnight guest of the Club treasurer , a beautiful wealthy salon owner . As he gets to know her and learns her husband has died , he begins to imagine she is ' a black widow . ' Is this his more of his reality twist or is she a murderess ? This is a psychological drama and in recounting which of these old films have stuck in my memory , I figured out is my favorite gender . Looking at his body of work it is seems to be Paul Verhoeven 's too , and he is a master in making us question our own understanding of reality . It 's a nice change of pace from the usual Hollywood fare . I saw it in 1983 and it is a film that " stuck . "
1 This last Dutch speaking film of Verhooven made me laugh good . As a film buff looking for all the small details and cross references etc in any movie I can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece amuses all the senses . I have n't read Gerard Reves book , on which the film is based , but I still believe we get a candid picture of a somewhat self - conceited poet / writer who gets his ( in a way - no spoiling here ) . An anti - hero surrounded by characters that have their ambiguous intentions , as has he . All this in a superbly packaged cinematography , Paul Verhopven manages to turn the otherwise rather cute " gesellich ( ? ) " Dutch locations into a suspenseful film - noir setting , impressive work !
1 Gerard is a writer with a somewhat overactive imagination . He is also homosexual and Catholic prone to Catholic guilt and something of a clairvoyant , or so it seems . On a trip to Flushing he is ' seduced ' by Christine . When he discovers that Christine 's new boyfriend is the bit of rough trade he 's been fancying from afar he decides to stick around . After all , enforced heterosexuality has its compensations . Then he realizes that Christine 's previous three husbands have all died violent deaths . Did Christine murder them and is he or the boyfriend , Herman , going to be ' the fourth man ' ? Verhoeven 's overheated , over - egged melodrama is a delicious blend of Hitchcock and David Lynch , full of OTT eroticism and religious imagery and an awful lot of the colour red . A lot of the time it looks and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we are seeing is real or a figment of Gerard 's imagination . The fun is in figuring it out . Also the fact that Christine is an infinitely more likable character that either the priggish Gerard or the bullish Herman means we are hardly like to root for either of the men over her . In fact , it 's fair to say Gerard 's comeuppance ca n't come soon enough . Super performances , too , from Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and easily Verhoeven 's best film up to his wonderfully subversive piece of sci - fi " Starship Troopers " .
1 In it 's time , this movie had controversy written all over it ( like most of Verhoeven 's projects).<br /><br />Containing very graphic depictions death - scenes ; A parachute that does n't open * smack * guys body on the floor . A guy being eaten by a Lion * chomp * teeth in the throat . And a guy being run over by a speedboat * zoom * bloody corpse going down.<br /><br />But besides gore , this flick also contains some brilliant ( and stunningly beautiful ) scenes , filmed in the gray fisher 's town that is Vlissingen;<br /><br />Thousands of rosebuds flying over the screen , in a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie , a beautiful ( holy ) woman putting flowers in a milk - can , surrounded by slabs of blood - dripping meat and a steamy love scene between two male characters , in a graveyard.<br /><br />The story is concluded in a frantic , but fulfilling 10 minutes , that do n't disappoint , and will leave you sighing a breath of relief.<br /><br />Of course with the pros come the cons , Some special - effects are too over - the - top , and are obviously done to see how far Verhoeven could push the gore - factor ( e.g. the several eyeballs hanging out of their sockets ) . Also , while the two lead actors , ( Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk ) , do an excellent job of breathing life into their characters , the character of Herman ( portrayed by the rather un - charming Thom Hoffman ) just feels enormously underdeveloped , making him hard to care for , even after his tragic death.<br /><br />I've done my best to give you a slight idea of what to expect of this amazing movie , and as you can see , it 's not easily summed up in words . So do yourself a favor , if you happen to find this movie somewhere , watch it ! And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece .
1 basically , i like Verhoeven film because in his film , i enjoy a brilliant pscychosexual story that i have seen before in " Basic Instinct".it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much.so it is obviously for me to watch this another Verhoeven movie.<br /><br />well , it is his previous direction before his block buster hit " Basic Instinct " and for that i was very much curious to watch that movie and yeah , the movie has fulfilled my hope and expectation.<br /><br />this movie " The Fourth Man " is a brilliant pscychosexual drama which is a lit bit complex for some audiences . the story of this movie is about a gay writer named " Reve"(Krabbe ) , an alcoholic person who is lives by his own moral values and sees many visions that may warn him from a future accident.after the end of his lecture , he introduce a seductive woman named " Christine " , who has a mysterious past she does n't want to reveal . Reve do sex with her at her house as she is a boy.next morning , he watch her sexy , macho boyfriend 's picture on her table , the person he met at the station.he is curious to meet him and tell Christine to invite him to her house.<br /><br />that 's it . i do n't want to reveal the entire story because it is a Verhoeven movie and the end of the film is really surprising!<br /><br />especially , i like the character " Reve " which is brilliantly played by " Krabbe".i basically like his acting because as a gay person i am purely identified with his character and yeah i like his charming face.<br /><br />i would like thanks Mr . Verhoeven to make such a black comedy.<br /><br />i rate this movie : 10 out of 10 .
1 Offbeat , slow - paced , entertaining erotic thriller with many graphic and " blasphemous " scenes that will undoubtedly disturb some viewers . However , it 'll be hard even for them not to appreciate the several imaginative sequences this film contains , or to ignore Krabbe 's first - rate performance . Verhoeven maintains an intriguing ambivalence throughout the film , playing with the meaning of the hero 's visions - omens . Unfortunately , in the last 5 minutes everything turns into a blur , and the unsatisfying ending is certainly not as good as the rest of the movie . ( * * * )
1 When you read the summary of this film , you might come to think that this is something of an odd film and in some ways it is , for the primary character of this film , Gerard Reve ( Jeroen Krabbé ) is haunted by visions and hallucinations . The visions Gerard see are all ( more or less ) subtle hints to what will happen to him as the story continues and it is great fun for the viewer to try and figure out the symbolism used in the film . Despite the use of symbolism and a couple of hints to the ending of the film , the film maintains a very high level of excitement throughout and does not get boring for one minute . This is mostly due to the great performances of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk ( Christine ) and the great direction of the whole by Paul Verhoeven . His directing style is clearly visible and one can say , looking at it from different angles , that ' De Vierde Man ' is a typical Verhoeven film . It will not only seem typical for people familiar with his American films because of the nudity and the graphic violent scenes , but it will also seem typical for people familiar with his Dutch films , because of the same things and his talent to tell a great story . When people watch Verhoevens American films , short sighted people might say , he has no talent in telling a good story and only focuses on blood and sex . That is what some people think , whereas I think that he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each with each film . Although not a good film , Hollow Man ( his last American film ) is an example that Verhoeven can do more than science fiction splatter movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more various films to helm . He needs that . Just watch his Dutch films . Not only do they show that he needs a certain amount of freedom , but they also show that he has remarkable talent . ' De Vierde Man ' brought him one step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best.<br /><br />8 out of 10
1 The first time I saw this film in the theatre at a foreign film festival , I thought it intriguing , fascinating , the sensitive bi - sexual artist . So very European , so very Dutch ! I recently rented it for a second viewing and could hardly keep from laughing at that overworked theme of the mad writer with a religious - sexual orientation persecution complex . Get a grip ! This guy is a freeloader , living off of society . I suspect that the real reason he is having these fantasy - nightmares about the " spiderwoman " is that his guilt complex is kicking in after year 's of ignoring mother 's advice about getting into cars ( and bed ) with strangers ! Not only is he making outrageous sums of ( probably taxfree ) loot for making up stories ( lying guilt trip ) but he is too cheap to pay for a hair cut , hence he hustles the beauty salon owner . Then he has the nerve to complain about the bill ! But I also suspect the world has changed alot since this film was made . On a serious note it was entertaining to see some of Jan de Bont 's camera work and one of Paul Verhoeven 's earlier films . Hmmm , maybe the world has n't changed so very much after all ?
1 An occasionally surrealistic thriller that will push most people 's buttons . , the 4th Man is sure to offend anyone with a taste for the politically correct . The story 's protagonist is a bisexual alcoholic Catholic writer , Gerard ( Krabbe ) , with a seriously twisted sense of imagination . Verhoeven offers up < br /><br />Gerard has an example of everything wrong with the modern man . He 's shiftless , delusional , unable to control his urges , afraid to commit to < br /><br />meaningful relationships , and utterly apathetic about life in general . As the character himself states at one point , he is a professional liar , unable to recall the truth.<br /><br />The movie opens with Gerard dreaming of spiders consuming Christ , and then waking to begin the long march to his own destruction . He chases off < br /><br />one man ( a boyfriend presumably ) , then chases another at a train station . Later , at a lecture , he meets a woman who seems to want to help him , or < br /><br />perhaps she has more nefarious plans .. She quickly captures Gerard in her web , enticing him with sex and money , having plenty of both . She 's also got < br /><br />secrets , like three dead husbands . Is she lonely , and genuinely looking for someone to nurture - or is she a deadly black widow , luring Gerard to his < br /><br />death ? Will Garard be the 4th man she kills ? The woman is Christine ( Soutendijk ) , and Verhoeven does his best to keep you guessing what she 's up to.<br /><br />This is an interesting movie , with a lot of sex and intrigue . It 's similar to Verhoeven's < em > Basic instinct</em > , but has a lot more depth , and is certainly more shocking . There 's a lot of very strong gay content , which may make some viewers squirm . Highly recommended for fans of intelligent < br /><br />psychological thrillers , or anyone looking for something entirely new .
1 Awful dreams , wild premonitions , blasphemy and homosexual fantasies permeate Paul Verhoeven 's ( arguable ) masterpiece of a true femme fatale who loves her men then kills them . Filled with blood and occasional gore , The Fourth Man is truly neurosis inducing . Men will literally leap when Renee swings out her scissors ......
1 Jerome Crabbe has the lead role in this movie . I saw this movie 6 times and I still am not tired of it . This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways . Gerald Soetman is a great writer . He wrote all of Paul Verhoeven 's Dutch films . Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors . I have seen all of his movies all except for Showgirls . My Mom does not like him so much but I disagree . I think all of his films are a ride to watch especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct . Jerry Goldsmith did some of his movies which include Total Recall , Basic Instinct and Hollow Man . I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died . Dutch films are different but still enjoyable .
1 Now my friends , films like " La Bête " ( aka " The Beast " or " O Monstro")only can be done in the old continent : ) , in this film we see all : horses dirty sex , nymphomaniac kind off gorilla , non sense dialogs , etc , etc , etc ... In the serious terms now , its an allegory , that men sometimes could be bestial , visceral and brutal , Walerian Borowczyk ( the director ) shows us the loss of innocence , sexual violence , rape and brutality . Its a astonishing cinematic experience , bizarre and full of grotesque scenes . For all fans of European shocking exploitation , i recommend this film . If you like this one i recommend : " Orloff Against the Invisible Man " and " Alterated States " .
1 For anyone who has only seen Disney Productions beautifully animated version of ' Beauty & The Beast ' , or even Jean Cocteau 's surreal fairy tale vision will be quite taken aback by this 1975 French ( but with a director from Poland ) version . The plot concerns a French family of fading aristocracy that is marrying into a well to do English family . The major catch is that the bridegroom is carrying an ancient curse on the family . The film also includes many flashback sequences ( potentially ) explaining this family curse . From the opening credits , to the very end , it 's a nearly non stop erotic fun house ride , with some VERY explicit & graphic sexual content ( hence the film 's X rating in the U.S. in it 's initial run , which is now unrated ) . The film 's somewhat contemptuous sentiment at the ruling class will probably remind one of Bunuel 's flights into similar territory . If you have a taste for the truly bizarre , and are not offended by " taboo " material , then this film may just scratch that itch for you .
1 Regardless of what personal opinion one may have of Walerian Borowczyk grotesque yet beautiful gem " La bête " of 1975 , one has to admit that this bizarre gem is an absolutely unique cinematic experience . Borowczyk erotic fairy tale was banned in several countries for a long time , and it is quite obvious why this controversial gem fell victim to stuporous film censors . " La bête " is a fascinating blend of intense and beautiful fairy - tale - like atmosphere , quite explicit eroticism and genuine weirdness that bravely refuses to take any compromise . The fact that beastiality ( of sorts ) is one of the film 's central themes did certainly not help it with the censors , but it made it highly controversial and therefore known to a wider audience.<br /><br />Pierre de l'Esperance ( Guy Tréjan ) , the head of a French aristocratic family , has arranged for his somewhat demented son Mathurin ( Pierre Benedetti ) to marry Lucy Broadhurst ( Lisbeth Hummel ) , the young and beautiful daughter of a wealthy English family . Due to an old curse , Mathurin 's uncle ( Marcel Dalió ) is strictly against the wedding . When Lucy and her mother arrive at the French estate , Lucy immediately gets fascinated with a portrait of the 18th century ancestor Romilda ( Sirpa Lane ) , and with an old book depicting bizarre drawings . The story soon descends into a bizarre sexual fever - dream ... Without giving away too much , I can say that fans of exceptional cinema should not consider missing this film . As bizarre as it is , " La bête " is doubtlessly also stunningly beautiful in style , settings and cinematography . The fever - dream - like atmosphere is present within- and out of dream - sequences . The forest estate and the imposing family mansion are magnificent settings , and the beautiful score and incredible cinematography build an overwhelming atmosphere for this grotesque tale . The very explicit sexuality ranges from erotic ( elegant female nudity , ravishing actresses ) to seriously demented and even somewhat disgusting ( close - ups on horses ' genitalia while having intercourse , ... ) ; in either case it is not likely to be forgotten . The entire cast of " La bête " is fantastic and all involved deliver great performances in eccentric characters ( some of which are seriously demented ) . The film profits from an exceptionally beautiful cast , be it Lisbeth Hummel in the lead , Finnish actress Sirpa Lane ( who sadly died of Aids in 1999 ) as the ancestor in the dream - sequences , or the relatively unknown but particularly ravishing actress Pascale Rivault , who plays the aristocratic daughter who takes ever opportunity to have sex with a black servant in a cupboard.<br /><br />I am intentionally not giving a full description of the most important parts of the plot as they simply have to be seen to be believed . Some scenes are among the most bizarre ever caught on film , the scenes with the eponymous ' beast ' definitely being among them . Certainly not everybody 's cup of tea , but very highly recommended to fans of controversial and unusual cinema . A true cult gem !
1 Good movie , very 70s , you can not expect much from a film like this , , Sirpa Lane is an actress of erotic films , a nice body but nothing exceptional savant to a pornographic actress from the body disappears , but the ' 70s were characterized a small breasts and a simple eroticism . Not demand a lot from these films are light years away from the movies today , the world has changed incredibly . The plot is simple and the actors not extraordinary . And the brunette actress has a single body , has one breast slightly bigger . Be satisfied . Papaya also is not great but at least these films have a certain charm ... Download them again but then again who knows what you pretend not to them .
1 I saw this film in a London cinema in 1975 and have not seen it since . I found it hilarious . I loved it 's originality . It 's rare that someone MAKES a movie like this - and it 's sad too.<br /><br />What I mean is , I once read a book called " The Black Hotel " - and as a film - fan , I always " picture " books as films . Kinda " adapt " them , you know ? But as I read it , I thought , well , this would make a great movie - but of course it would have to be " adapted " - to the point where it would bear little relationship to the book.<br /><br />But then I thought , well WHY ? Sure , it could never be shown on Sunday afternoon TV , but provided it were shown in cinemas to ADULTS , who knew what it contained , where 's the HARM ? Dammit , my civil liberties were being crushed here . A director SHOULD be able to make a literal film adaptation of " The Black Hotel".<br /><br />In an ideal World , censorship of films for adults should not EXIST . But sadly , whilst I accept that with INTELLIGENT adults , such freedom might be harmless , there would always be those who would lack the rationality to differentiate between fantasy and reality , and who might be spurred on to commit foul deeds.<br /><br />However , it 's hard to see how " La Bete " falls into that category.<br /><br />On it 's appearance in England , the British censor dismissed it out of hand . Despite the ' 69 relaxation on nudity , given the film 's theoretical theme of bestiality , had the censor passed ANY of it , he 'd have been looking for a new job on Monday.<br /><br />BUT ... in those days , there was an alternative . The G.L.C. This was a local town council with a department who had the power to pass a film just for London , where it was deemed audiences were more " sopisticated " than those who lived out in the sticks.<br /><br />The film was duly submitted and PASSED . However , it later emerged that the " board " consisted of just four people - three who voted , plus a " chairman " . And on the day , one of the voters was off sick . Thus the remaining two voters and the chairman sat down to view " La Bete".<br /><br />One of said voters thought , like me , that the film was hilarious and hardly likely to encourage foul deeds by ANYONE . The other lacked imagination and simply thought the piece disgusting . And the chairman did n't understand it , so decided to err on the side of FREEDOM.<br /><br />When the missing voter finally saw the film , they too thought it disgusting , but it was TOO LATE ! The film had received its " X - London " certificate and opened to mixed reaction . The G.L.C. film censorship board was disbanded soon after ! Thus " La Bete " only opened in London by what could best be termed a FLUKE ! But I 'm glad it was . It 's GREAT ! If you have n't seen it , DO so . It 's a FANTASY , and as such , it 's far less disturbing than most things you see on the news these days ...
1 This movie is simply incredible ! I had expected something quite different form the film that I actually saw . However , it is very insightful in that it shows the aggressive nature of human sexuality and its linkage with animal behavior . Let me warn those among the readers of this article who are easily offended by content that is all too sexual , for the explicit sexual nature of this film feels like a high - brow sort of pornography . It even features a scene that comes extremely close to rape.<br /><br />Meanwhile , I strongly suggest seeing this rare work of " sexual art " . Every minute of the picture breathes the sexual spirit of the seventies , by the way . One should not forget how times have changed!<br /><br />Go see it ! It´s worth your money and time !
1 Strangely erotic schlock Gothic horror that will be loved by Hammer House of Horror fans the world over . Appears to be an interesting take on " Beauty and the Beast " . It is definitely worth a look and surprisingly well acted when taking into consideration the genre and era.<br /><br />Corsets , castles , rutting horses , rampaging faux fur monsters in the woods , proof that no - one had a Brazilian in the 70 's , and more bodily fluids than you can shake a stick at , what more could you possibly want?!<br /><br />It certainly brightened my Sunday afternoon !
1 this one is out there . Not much to say about it except that it deals with a rarely touched topic in films of beastiality . I can see why this film was banned for so long , the topics dealt within the film are still a little taboo for most of the world will say the eroticism in the film is well deserved and fits in with the mood of the film . It 's a good film that is well acted and serves a purpose ... to shock the viewer and cross boundaries that we do n't see to often in films . I came across this film on the net that I thought I might check out . I enjoyed the film as it is thought provoking and somewhat erotic at the same time . Something you do n't rarely see in films today .
1 I must say , I thought I had seen it all . I am an extremely jaded movie buff . This movie did n't shock me , by any means . I 'm way past that point . But it did take me to certain emotional places I did n't know I could go to . I had no idea I could ever find ( ick ) the idea of beastiality erotic . Never never never . Ever . Ever . But there you go . He did it . I have to give the director credit . He pulled it off.<br /><br />For the first 40 minutes this movie is a TOTAL bore . We start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex . After five minutes of this I started wondering if buying this movie was n't a mistake . Then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married . Then some nervous guy shaves . Then we see ( briefly ) a hot chick getting it on with a butler ( but this is very brief ) . At this point I was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake . In fact , I fell asleep at about the 40 minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night.<br /><br />We finally get the good stuff when a girl ( who knows who she is , or who anyone is in this movie ) has a dream about a Victorian - era gal being ravaged by a beast - thing in the forest . The scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat ( heh - heh ) of the whole deal . It 's beautifully shot , superbly edited , and does deliver the goods . They do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of does n't either . Oh well . I would definitely recommend this film . The first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself ( and my TV ) but the last 50 minutes totally redeems it .
1 Wow . Uhm ... well ... wow ! I guess I 'll start with the plot . A betrothed woman ( Lucy ) arrives at the family home of her would be husband ( Mathurin ) in France , where they are awaiting the arrival of the Bishop or Cardinal or someone in the Catholic Church to marry them ( to satisfy a will . ) While waiting , young Lucy learns about a legend of a Beast who roamed the grounds centuries before . In bed that night , she begins fantasizing about the Beast and his rape - turned - consensual tryst with the former lady of the house . That 's where it gets interesting ! The plot is really pretty thin ( and it seems to drag on for quite a while in the middle of the flick ) , but the filmmaker rewards ( ? ) those who stick it out with a shocking and hilarious finale.<br /><br />This movie is n't for everyone . If you 're looking for great cinema , look elsewhere . If you 're looking for a far - out movie about bestiality ( that almost casts a sympathetic glance over the subject ) this movie is for you ! ( If you have a weak stomach , do n't be afraid of this one . Outside of some horse - on - horse action at the beginning , the ' deeds ' are pretty cartoonish , IMO )
1 If you were born around the time this movie was finished , and had a liberal / open minded household that I had , I 'm sure during the early 80 's you 'd be first introduced to walking in on your parents watching dirty movies or extreme dirty movies . You know , not 100 % pornographic but rather an alchemical mixture of actual drama and pornography , or that you 'd sneak into their collection and pop in the plastic rectangle representation of such a film in a big dookie machine called a VHS . You had to be very quiet and ninja like but still having minor heart failure when huge pop noises were made when pressing the tablet - like buttons out of fear of being discovered . Whatever the case , such films were sent into the back of your mind , waiting and waiting to be reunited with such visual " art " . Needless to say , this movie fits into the aforementioned description to a " T " . Many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film but perhaps due to me being desensitized , I am more disturbed by the subtleties . Was the creator speaking to us on deeper levels of human carnality and or what could be considered a true abomination , interracial relations , bed frame masturbation , voyeurism , or could it be desperation for social status to the point of murder , pedophilia / homosexuality , or the repressed sexual nature of social elitist females in 18th century France ? Who can say , but despite Mr. Borowcyzk 's taste for vivid , raw sexuality being the " norm " for his works , I 'd say that indeed this movie does speak to the viewer on a deeper level concerning bestial carnality . Once I have learned this , the story became much more interesting beyond the giddiness of shock value and there fore , it is well worth checking out .
1 I guess this is meant to be a sort of reworking or updating of " Beauty and the Beast " , but I ca n't say I 've ever watched a movie that began with several minutes of graphic horse sex . Wow . Anyway it seems that a young woman and her .. aunt ? Have traveled to this castle in France where the woman is to be married to the son of the castle owner , who is the man who takes care of making sure the horses get their rocks off . It seems that there are legends in that area of a beast that was rather , uh , frisky , I guess you could say , with the ladies , or at least , one in particular . There are all kinds of references tucked away in that regard but every time the soon - to - be - blushing young bride gets her curious little hands on one the groom 's father removes it from her sight . Anyway , the young bride - to - be goes upstairs to sleep while the family is waiting for a Cardinal to show up to the wedding ( a family member , I guess ) and as she dreams she dreams of a beast in the woods that has its way with her . The effects in this leave a little to be desired , and any attempt at eroticism ( not that I know much about that ) is kind of rendered laughable , especially when certain featured appendages appear about as realistic as a bed post or a baseball bat . This has a rather strange and abrupt , yet twist ending , with not really any clues or much build up to it , but it was kind of fitting and definitely not what I expected . I do n't know , this is kind of a tough one to get through but it has its moments and is definitely weird . 7 out of 10 .
1 This is a film exploring the female sexuality in a way not so often used . Almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes always becomes rated X , and so seen as a pornographic movie . Here is a kind of romantic horror story combined with the females " own satisfaction " need.<br /><br />A very good film !
1 Hayao Miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand - drawn animation as a form of storytelling , yet often he is being compared to Walt Disney . That is just so unfair , because it becomes apparent by watching Miyazaki 's films that he is the superior artist . He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children , and Laputa is indeed one awesome ride.<br /><br />But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking ! Miyazaki 's works have never cease to amaze me . Laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination . Ask yourself this question : if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical , what would it be like ? The answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch Laputa , because it 's truly a childhood fantasy come true . Every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing ... from the train chase to the amazing air - flying sequences ... and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself . Not to mention the excellent score by Joe Hisaishi ! Everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here .
1 I have seen just about all of Miyazaki 's films , and they are all beautiful and captivating . But this one rises above the rest . This movie totally impressed me!<br /><br />I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta , and their sweet , caring friendship . They were what made the movie for me . Of course , the animation is also superb and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly . But the characters are the shining point in this movie : they are so well developed and full of personality.<br /><br />Now , let me clarify : I 'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie ( with English subs ) . While the English dub is good ( mostly ) , it simply pales in comparison to the original language version . The voices are better , the dialogue , everything . So I suggest seeing ( and hearing ) the movie the way it originally was .
1 This is one of the best animated family films of all time . Moreover , virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli . Specifically , other great films include " My Neighbor Totoro " and " Kikki 's Delivery Service . " Spirited Away is quite good , but a bit too creepy for typical family fare - better for teenagers and adult . The one thing that sets " Laputa : Castle in the Sky " apart from other films by Miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension - filled adventure ride.<br /><br />Why is this film so good ? Because it 's a complete package : the animation is very well done , and the story is truly engaging and compelling.<br /><br />Most Japanese anime is imaginative , but decidedly dark or cynical or violent ; and the animation itself is often jerky , stylized , and juvenile . None of these problems plague Castle in the Sky . It has imagination to burn , and the characters are well drawn , if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people . ( None of those trench - coat wearing posers ) There is plenty of adventure , but not blood and gore . The animation is smooth , detailed , and cinematic ally composed - not a lot of flat shots . The backgrounds are wonderful.<br /><br />The voice acting in the dubbed English version is first rate , particularly the two leads , Pazo ( James Van der Beek ) and Sheeta ( Anna Paquin ) . The sound engineering is great , too . Use your studio sound , if you 've got it.<br /><br />One aspect that I particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained . Laputa was once inhabited , and is now abandoned . Why ? We never know . We know as much as we need to know , and then we just have to accept the rest , which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized . Indeed , it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters , who are for the most part one - dimensional stock characters ( e.g. , gruff general , silly sidekick , kooky old miner , etc . ) Highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60 !
1 I first saw this film when I was about 8 years old on TV in the UK ( where it was called " Laupta : The Flying Island " ) . I absolutely loved it , and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and I missed it . I was enchanted by the story and characters , but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music . It would have been the original English dubbed version which I saw - sometimes erroneously referred to as the " Streamline Dub " ( the dub was actually by Ghibli themselves and only distributed by Streamline ) which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box - set.<br /><br />Unfortunately I feel that the release has been partly spoiled by Disney . The voice acting is OK but the dialogue does n't have the same raw energy that the " streamline " dub or the original Japanese had , and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play the lead . They have made some pointless alterations , such as changing the main character 's name from " Pazu " to " Patzu " , and added some dialogue . But worst of all I feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music - the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to Disney 's moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking , which I find annoying in many Disney films.<br /><br />This film still blows away most recent animated films , and I can not recommend it highly enough . The plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass - market , homogenized animation .
1 This is one of my all time favorite movies , PERIOD . I ca n't think of another movie that combines so many nice movie qualities like this one does . This flick has it all : Action , Adventure , Science Fiction , Good vs. Bad and even some Romance ( without even an innocent " peck " on the cheek between the Pazu and Sheeta ) . Maybe best of all , you do n't have to be in Mensa to " get it " and enjoy the movie like you do with some of Miyazaki 's other movies ( I do n't know about you , but I watch movies to take a break from thinking ) . This is just a flat - out enjoyable movie that everyone will like , so do yourself a favor and go buy it . The only sour note is the American Dubbing . I found Vander - Geek to be just plain annoying . But all is not lost , the original Japanese version is on the two - disc set and it rocks ! Who cares if you ca n't understand spoken Japanese ? If you can read at a second - grade level then watch the original Japanese recording with English subtitles . You wo n't regret it .
1 I first saw this back in the early 90s on UK TV , i did like it then but i missed the chance to tape it , many years passed but the film always stuck with me and i lost hope of seeing it TV again , the main thing that stuck with me was the end , the hole castle part really touched me , its easy to watch , has a great story , great music , the list goes on and on , its OK me saying how good it is but everyone will take there own best bits away with them once they have seen it , yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to watch , it does show its age in a very few parts but that has now become part of it beauty , i am so glad it has came out on DVD as it is one of my top 10 films of all time . Buy it or rent it just see it , best viewing is at night alone with drink and food in reach so you do n't have to stop the film.<br /><br />Enjoy
1 By now you 've probably heard a bit about the new Disney dub of Miyazaki 's classic film , Laputa : Castle In The Sky . During late summer of 1998 , Disney released " Kiki 's Delivery Service " on video which included a preview of the Laputa dub saying it was due out in " 1999 " . It 's obviously way past that year now , but the dub has been finally completed . And it 's not " Laputa : Castle In The Sky " , just " Castle In The Sky " for the dub , since Laputa is not such a nice word in Spanish ( even though they use the word Laputa many times throughout the dub ) . You 've also probably heard that world renowned composer , Joe Hisaishi , who scored the movie originally , went back to rescore the excellent music with new arrangements . Laputa came out before My Neighbor Totoro and after Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind , which began Studio Ghibli and it 's long string of hits . And in my opinion , I think it 's one of Miyazaki 's best films with a powerful lesson tuckered inside this two hour and four minute gem . Laputa : Castle in the Sky is a film for all ages and I urge everyone to see it.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with Castle in the Sky 's story , it begins right at the start and does n't stop for the next two hours . The storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted , you see Miyazaki 's true vision . And believe me , it 's one fantastic one . The film begins with Sheeta , a girl with one helluva past as she is being held captive by the government on an airship . Sheeta holds the key to Laputa , the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization . The key to Laputa is a sacred pendant she has which is sought by many , namely the government , the military and the air pirate group , the Dola gang ( who Sheeta and Pazu later befriend ) . Soon , the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid . She falls a few thousand feet , but the fall is soft and thanks to her pendant . As she floats down from the sky , Pazu , an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines , sees Sheeta and catches her . The two become fast friends , but thanks to her pendant , the two get caught up in one huge thrill ride as the Dola gang and government try to capture Sheeta . One action sequence after another , we learn all of the character 's motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with it 's fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue . Plus somewhat twisty surprise . I think this film is simply remarkable and does hold for the two hour and four minute run time . The story is wonderful , as we peak into Hayao Miyazaki 's animation which has no limits . The setting of the film is a combo of many time periods . It does seem to take place at the end of the 1800s , but it is some alternante universe which has advanced technology and weapons . Laputa is also surprisingly a funny film . The film has tons of hilarious moments , almost equal to the drama and action the film holds . I think the funniest part is a fight scene where Pazu 's boss faces off against a pirate , and soon after a riot breaks out . It 's funny as we see the men compare their strength and the music fits right in with it perfectly.<br /><br />Now let 's talk about how the dub rates . An excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life . Teen heartthrob James Van Der Beek plays the hero Pazu , who has a much more mature voice then in the Japanese version , where in the original he sounded more childlike . Either way , I think his voice is a nice fit with Pazu . Anna Paquin , the young Oscar winner from " The Piano " , plays Sheeta . This is also a nice performance , but the voice is a bit uneven , she does n't stay true to one accent . At times she sounds as American as apple pie , but at other times she sounds like someone from New Zealand . The performance I most enjoyed however was of Coris Leachman , who played Mama Dola . Not only is this an excellent performance , but the voice and emotion she gives the character really brings it to life . If there was ever a live action Laputa movie ( G - d forbid ) , she would be the one to play her , you can just imagine her in the role ( well , somewhat ) . Luke Skywalker himself , Mark Hamill is Muska , and this is another top rate Hamill performance . You may be familiar with Hamill from a long line of voice work after he did the original Star Wars movies , but he renders Muska to full evil . His voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the Joker , who he played for many episodes on the animated Batman series . Rounding out the cast is voice character actor Jim Cummings , who does a great , gruff job as the general and Andy Dick and Mandy Patakin as members of the Dola gang.<br /><br />Now let me talk about what really makes this dub special , Joe Hisaishi 's newly arranged music ! For those who have never heard of him , Mr. Hisaishi does the music and like all of Miyazaki 's films , the music is very memorable . Each of his scores has it 's own personas which fits the particular film perfectly . Now , these new arrangements he has done are more " American like " , which I think was the goal of the new recordings . Do n't worry , the classic tunes of the Japanese version are still here in great form . The score , to me , sounds to be arranged like this is a Hollywood blockbuster . It has more power , it has more emphasis , it 's clearer and deeper . The film 's prologue , the first seconds where we are introduced to the airships , has some new music ( I am not sure , but I believe when we first saw the ships there was no music at all ) . But a majority of the music has new backdrops and more background music to enjoy . Things seem very enhanced . In a powerful scene , the music is more stronger then in the original versions . In a calm scene , it 's more calmer . Overall , I think many of you will be pleased with the new arrangements an mixes , I highly did myself , and personally think it helps improve the film . I prefer the new score over the old one , and I hope Disney will release or license the music rights to a full blown soundtrack.<br /><br />Another plus side to the dub is that the story remains faithful , and much of the original Japanese lines are intact . In Kiki , I 'm sure a few lines where changed , and this is the same way , lines have been changed . But a majority are close or exactly the original lines and dialogue Miyazaki has written . I was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered , but they were there intact . Some new lines have been added as well which help out . But I am not sure whether to consider this a good thing or a bad thing , Disney DID NOT translate the ending song , it was in Japanese . I was mortified when they did completely new songs for the Kiki dub , but with this version it 's the original song ... in Japanese . So I guess it 's good it 's still the original , but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak English.<br /><br />There is a big down side to this dub , and it deals with how the voices match the character 's lips . Of course in any dub it wo n't be perfect , but I think in Kiki and Mononoke the dubbing of lines to match were much better executed ( and Disney had a little bit more time with this one ... ) . Some of the time everything matches perfect , some of the time it does n't completley match , and in a rare case , someone says something and the lips do n't move at all ( there 's a scene where Sheeta chuckles and her mouth does n't move one bit).<br /><br />As far as things about the film itself , these are my thoughts . I thought the most amazing part of Laputa was the animation . From the opening sequence to the ending , the animation is so lush and detailed , you just have to watch in awe . You see the true nature of each character , true detail to their face with extreme close ups and action . You have to give a ton of credit for the effort that these animators put into this film . Everything is so well done and beautifully hand drawn , it 's like a moving piece of art . And to think , this was done in the mid 1980 's . The animation is quite different from Disney , Ghibli has it 's own distinctive flare which is very different , but very good . And after all these years , the colors look as vibrant as ever . Laputa also has tons of action sequences , lots of plane dogfights plus a few on ground . These sequences are so well done and so intriguing , it 's scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film . And the finale is just something you MUST see . The sound effects are pure and classic and fit explosions , guns firing and everything else well . And like all Miyazaki films , each one focuses on a different theme ( i.g . Kiki : Confidence ) . This one has a great a lesson on greed and power . People do n't realize how greed can take over you , and how having too much power is n't good . People are obsessed with power , and are greedy , and the main villian , Muska , greatly shows this.<br /><br />All in all , Laputa : Castle In The Sky was a great film to begin with , and is now improved for the most part . I am glad a more mainstream audience now have the chance to see this classic animated film in all it 's glory . With a great voice cast who put a lot into the film with the excellent redone musical score from Joe Hisaishi , Disney has done a nice job on this dub and is quite worthy . Though I think the voices matched the mouths better in the Kiki and Princess Mononoke Disney dubs , Castle In The Sky is still a great dub and is worth the long delays because now more can expierence a fantastic film .
1 Laputa : castle in the sky is the bomb . The message is as strong as his newer works and more pure , fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better ! The art is totally amazing and the soundtrack , which is reused many times after this , ( i m not sure if this was the first time i heard it ) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack . Sheeta , the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy , Pazu is also a great role - model -- he lives on his own ! The plot is classic Miyazaki . I wo n't give it away , but the end is really great . I rank this as one of Miyazaki 's three best with Nausicaa and Spirited Away . Also you may want to check out Howl 's Moving Castle when it comes out ( sometime next year i hope ) If you like Miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the USA . Enjoy , Piper A
1 It 's always difficult to put a stamp on any film as being ' the best , ' whether of all time , a certain genre , or what have you , but I believe a strong argument could be made that in fact , Laputa is the greatest animated film ever made . It is in my mind the masterwork of Hayao Miyazaki , the most talented of Japan 's animated directors , and it best captures his strengths as a director , storyteller , and designer , as well as encapsulating all of his favorite underlying themes . The version I 'm reviewing is the 2003 American dub ( I know , sacrilege for a hard - core anime fan to not watch it in its native language ) ; there is at least one other English language dub out there , I have it on VHS ( I have no idea from what source ) , and that version is the single best dub I have ever encountered of any film . But I thought it better to concentrate on the version people can actually find.<br /><br />Laputa tells the story of a boy named Pazu ( voiced by James Van Der Beek here ) , who 's growing up in a mining town when one day a young girl named Sheeta ( Anna Paquin ) literally drops from the sky . It seems she is being pursued by a sinister government agent , Colonel Muska ( Mark Hamill ) , who is more interested in the magical crystal that hangs around her neck . To keep things lively , there 's also a wickedly funny pirate gang after the crystal , led by the aging but still boisterous Dola ( Cloris Leachman ) . The plot revolves around the crystal 's ability to reveal the location of the fabled flying city of Laputa , a potential treasure trove of scientific knowledge and hidden treasure . It 's all very much in keeping with a fairy - tale setting , but Miyazaki knows exactly how far to take the story , and the plot is peppered with ' gosh - wow ' moments and threaded with his customary morality and warnings about abusing the power of nature.<br /><br />The design work on Laputa , nearly twenty years later , is still revolutionary . Flying machines of all sorts abound , utterly impossible but so meticulously designed that you instantly accept them without blinking . The world is set somewhere around the start of the twentieth century , with telegraphs and ancient motorcars alongside those wonderful impossible flying machines . But it is the city itself that is sheer brilliance in execution ; Laputa is both the Garden of Eden and the Fire of Heaven itself , and in that juxtaposition lies its appeal , its power , and its danger.<br /><br />Besides being a thoughtfully designed and beautifully rendered film , Laputa is blessed with a wonderful sense of cinematography . From sweeping flying shots to high speed chases on tiny one - man flyers to ships submerging into the clouds as if they were water , Laputa displays a scope that most films  even with the magic of CGI  can only daydream about . Though we only see a small fraction of this world , its simple elegance extends beyond the borders of the frame and we have no trouble believing in it . The film also contains one of my favorite , if not the most exciting , action sequences ever : a guardian robot that fell to Earth is accidentally reactivated and wreaks havoc on the fortress it is kept in , all the while trying to protect Sheeta ( who was the one who woke it up ) . Meanwhile , Pazu and the pirates swoop in on their little flying machines to snatch her , literally , from the jaws of destruction . From the horrific sight of the robot incinerating the countryside to the exhilarating last - second rescue , the entire sequence is a masterpiece of timing and camera angles and knowing exactly how far to take the audience.<br /><br />It helps that Laputa has an amazing score . Composer Joe Hisaishi captures the wondrous beauty of this world , the dewy innocence , the exciting action , and the creepy otherworldliness of the flying city and its bizarre robot guardians . Though he re - recorded it for this DVD release ( which IMO is not an improvement over his original score ) , adding pieces here and there , the score matches the visuals perfectly , a rare total union of sound and vision.<br /><br />This is n't a bad dub . I 'm inordinately fond of the older English dub , and this one over - explains things just a tad in spots , but I was almost shocked how closely these voices matched those ( and those matched the Japanese pretty well ) . Dola in particular is hard to get right , but Leachman is spot on as the fiery old pirate woman ( her sons are n't quite as good as the original ) . Paquin does a good job as Sheeta , and Mark Hamill , while I knew it was him early , is more than talented enough to do Muska ( I liked the other English dub of Muska a little more , but Hamill 's good ) . Much of the film rests on Pazu 's shoulders , and Van Der Beek is wonderful . Listening to him made me think this crew must have had access to the other English dub , because VDB matches up very closely with the original Pazu . Although again watching a dub is grounds for excommunication among the otaku faithful , as much as I love this film , I do n't think you 're sacrificing a great deal simply watching this particular Anglicized version . John Lassiter of Pixar introduces it up front , and my suspicion is that he , like so many others , simply love this film so much that they tried very hard to ensure its high quality.<br /><br />Miyazaki has had success in America in recent years with Spirited Away and Mononoke ( one of his few films I did n't care for ) , but to me Laputa is still his crowning achievement . Anyone familiar with his later work will almost certainly enjoy this earlier work , and again , this film is a master at the top of his form hitting on every cylinder . I 'd pay big money to be able to see this on a large screen ; while that will probably never happen , it 's good to know that at least this classic has been preserved on DVD .
1 Have you ever wished that you could escape your dull and stressful life at school or work and go on a magical adventure of your own , with one of your closest friends at your side , facing all sorts of dangers and villains , and unraveling the mystery of a lost civilization that 's just waiting for someone to discover all its secrets ? Even if you 're not quite that much of a fantasy - lover , have you ever wished you could simply experience what it 's like to be a kid again , and not have a care in the world , for just a couple of hours ? < br /><br />This is exactly what Miyazaki 's " Castle in the Sky " is all about . Pazu , a young but very brave and ambitious engineer , lives a rustic life in a mining town until one day , a girl named Sheeta falls down from the sky like an angel and takes him on a journey to a place far beyond the clouds , while all the while they have pirates and military units hot on their trail . Simply put , it is just the incredible adventure that every kid dreams of at one point or another , and I ca n't help but feel my worries melt away every time I see it.<br /><br />As it is one of Miyazaki 's older works and takes much place in the everyday world , the film is not as visually spectacular or deep in its storyline as Spirited Away , Howl 's Moving Castle , or even Princess Mononoke . Still , I find it difficult to say that any of these films are superior over the other , because all three of those films are , at some point or another , mystical to the point of being enigmatic , if not perplexing , especially for the youngest of viewers.<br /><br />"Castle in the Sky " , on the other hand , does n't try so much to be an allegory of any kind , and it 's not a coming - of - age story either ; it is instead quite possibly one of the best depictions of the inside of a child 's mind I 've ever seen . Not only is the artwork beautiful , but the use of perspective from the kids ' eyes is just amazing ; whether it 's the panning up of the " camera " to see the enormous trees or clouds overhead , or the incredible sense of height from looking down at the ground or ocean while hundreds of feet in the air , I just ca n't help but FEEL like I 'm there with Pazu and Sheeta , just a kid in another world , far far away from reality.<br /><br />Even the kids themselves do n't have a complex relationship that suggests a need for hope like Ashitaka / San or Chihiro / Haku ; Sheeta is Pazu 's angel , having literally fallen into his life from the sky one day , the absolutely perfect person for him right from the very start . As the film progresses , more and more of their true adventurous childhood spirit comes out through their kind words and beautifully realistic facial expressions . Not only are they an adorable reminder of who I used to be , but their endearing friendship never lets up throughout the whole film , only growing stronger all the way to the last frame . For that reason , I 've fallen in love with the two of them more than I have with any other Miyazaki couple.<br /><br />At the same time , " Castle in the Sky " is such an easily accessible film because no matter what kind of casual moviegoer you may be , you 'll be sure to find your fix here . Mystery , action , drama , comedy , suspense , sci - fi , romance , even some western ... it 's all here , just about everything people go to the movies for ( except maybe horror ) . This why I can easily recommend it as a first Miyazaki film ; it 's perfect for those who have no expectations from having already seen the incredible otherworldliness of some of his more recent works.<br /><br />Even the ending song of the film , when translated into English , conveys the sense of longing for the discovery of some kind of lost civilization , and some kind of soul - mate , that could not be found in our mundane lives . " The reason I long for the many lights is that you are there in one of them ... The earth spins , carrying you , carrying us both who 'll surely meet . " Miyazaki has always provided poetic lyrics to make ending songs out of Joe Hiasashi 's gorgeous scores , but this is the only one I 've seen that 's both a touching love song and an inspirational dream . I have found myself near tears just listening to it.<br /><br />"Castle in the Sky " may not be Miyazaki 's most developed , spectacular , or meaningful work , but it 's absolutely perfect for what it really was meant to be : a true vision of childhood fantasy , and a wonderful escape from reality for any adults who wish they could have the same wonderful sense of imagination they had when they were just carefree little kids . Sit back , relax , and love it for what it is .
1 Hayao Miyazaki name became prominent with Spitied Away , however what is often overlooked are director 's first film efforts . Who remembers that Spielberg directed Duel or George Lucas directed THX 1138 ? I remember seeing fragments of this movie - almost certainly the last 45 minutes in late 80s and what stuck with me was the visual lushness of the design and animation . So when I found a copy in a well known store for £ 9 I could n't resist but buy it . The odd thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not tally with my memory of it ( memory is funny that way).<br /><br />Viewing this movie now with all the gained knowledge of artists portfolios is how very like Jean ' Moebius ' Giraud some of the artwork is . I can only assume some influence here.<br /><br />When Pazu catches a falling girl ( Sheeta ) his adventure really begins - the quest for Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift 's overlooked portion of Gulliver 's Travels . With healthy references to Jules Verne it 's a basic good vs. bad chase movie with the final portion having the heroes end up on Laputa.<br /><br />This is the portion that is strongest in my memory - the ' pastoral ' ecological aspect of Laputa returned to nature - the multitude of robots covered in moss beneath the giant tree . This is , in my opinion , the highlight of the movie - the views of the surface of Laputa , as opposed to the mechanised underground.<br /><br />Although this is the dichotomy of this movie - to show that even technology can not overcome nature - the irony of the last robot tending the garden and animals . The ending of the movie Silent Running is almost exactly the same.<br /><br />It is incredibly stylish , I would not say ' slick ' - very beautiful and organic and a tremendous amount of detail in the buildings , airships and the design and look of just about everything.<br /><br />Myazaki is a true master of this kind of Japnanese anime . Buy this movie and treasure it .
1 I first saw this film when I was about seven years old and was completely enchanted by it then but for years was unable to find out what the film was called . now i am twenty one and stumbled upon the film by accident about two weeks ago and bought a copy . although my memory of the film was a little hazy I was in no way disappointed by what I saw . the animation in this film is superb conjuring up an entire world that is so believable and so well animated that you are drawn in to the film by that alone . But this film also has a plot that will enchant and entertain adults and children alike . with a floating island , a mad general , a friendly pirate granny and a well constructed love story this film will not let you down I would recommend this film to any one .
1 I know Anime . I 've been into it long before it became a national phenomenon ; i loved Ranma before most people knew what Dragonball Z even was . And just so you know I 'm not bragging about my , let me say this : out of all the animes I 've seen , Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best . It 's obvious people say Spirited Away is the best , but I really disagree . Most people only know that movie because it one an Acedmy Award ; this is n't an exaggeration - I 've shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who 'd only ever seen Spirited Away , and they agree that the latter two are the superior of the three . Personally , I 'd never thought that anything could compare to Princess Mononoke , until I finally saw Castle in the Sky . I still think that the prior is the better of the two , but Castle in the Sky is easily on par with it ; in many ways , Castle has major elements that Mononoke was missing . In either case , if you 've only seen Spirited Away , and think that that is Miyazaki 's best film , be prepared to have your earth shaken .
1 Listening to the soundtrack at the moment , the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong ( in order to be able to type this ) . I 've seen it twice thus far , and I should be ashamed for having seen it * only * twice.<br /><br />I've seen all Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli films , and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces ( except maybe for Nausicaa which was , even in the non - cut up version too premature compared to the nec - plus - ultra manga ) . Still , their strength sometimes becomes their weakness , as they tend to get too naive / positive ( Chihiro ) , or , with more nuance , a bit too explicit / moralist ( Mononoke ) . At least , compared to for example the other Ghibli master Takahata ( Grave of the Fireflies / Only Yesterday / Raccoon Wars ) . But not this one.<br /><br />In Laputa , Miyazaki pours all the brilliant storytelling that tellers of tales have gathered and perfected over the ages , combined with a bit of morale , but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere , but also with the humor and amusement of for example Totoro . Every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties . The pacing is so perfect that I know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being . The story sets out as an action flic with mysteries hinted at , but when the girl falls from the sky , unconscious , floating with the stone , and the main theme kicks in , you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you 're about to uncover , but the story then settles and gradually , over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty , builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy , hope , beauty - like , following days of sombre gloom , finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning , knowing the path walked , seeing the distance ahead , but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it.<br /><br />It is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind numb , you should see a therapist.<br /><br />Despite the fact that technically - image - wise some more recent Miyazakis might be more overwhelming , this to me remains his undisputed masterpiece . If you take a fraction of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986 , you can only come to the conclusion that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years . This of course has been suggested before , but to me this is his only film that can , on its own , fully illustrate that simple fact . If you miss this during your lifetime , you 'll die with a huge gap - which would be a pity , as the coffin costs the same .
1 breathtaking , this is without doubt the best anime cartoon ever made . i first saw castle in the sky in the late 80s as a child and it left a lasting impression . years went by and i forgot the title of the film , and only by chance browsing on the internet i found this masterpiece again . after reading other peoples reviews and analysis I 'm not surprised it has such acclaim and touched so many because it does leave an impression . a true fantasy adventure , a must see for all children and adults . its best not giving the story away so i would say watch this movie will a clear and open mind . if you have kids treat them to this i promise you they will love it . there 's not much to say about this piece of art but if you 've not seen it watch it and enjoy .
1 Hayao Miyazaki 's second feature film , and his first one to be widely acclaimed both commercially and critically ( though his debut - Nausicaa AKA Warriors of the Wind is considered by many fans his best ) , ' Tenku no Shiro Rapyuta ' AKA ' Castle in the Sky ' may seem childish and simplistic when compared to his more recent masterpieces like ' Kiki 's Delivery Service ' , ' Mononoke - hime ' and ' Spirited Away ' , but in 1986 it was years ahead of its time and it was one of the milestones of modern anime . It 's important to remember that ' Castle in the Sky ' was made two years before the revolutionary ' Akira ' , and while it 's not provocative and controversial like the aforementioned masterpiece , the lead characters are all mainly basic manga hero / heroine / villain type characters , and the story is quite predictable and obvious ( at least in today 's standards ) , Miyazaki 's designs and animation work are of standards never seen before . While the story and humor are a bit silly and outdated at times , the movie is still very entertaining and very enjoyable - if not as breathtaking as ' Spirited Away ' . And if you 'll allow yourself to see the beauty of the frames themselves and ignore the low - budget coloring and animation and the identical twin faces - at this point Miyazaki is still faithful to his roots and to the agreed standards of Japanese cartooning - you 'll see Miyazaki 's genius shine through as well as it does on ' Spirited Away ' and Mononoke . While ' Castle in the Sky ' , being a sci - fi adventure and very suitable for children , fits in more neatly with classic anime than anything else he had done since , his motifs and principles still show and play an important part . To say much more would be to ruin the movie , so I 'll kindly shut up . Suffice to say that I 'm giving it only nine stars because if I gave it ten I could n't go any higher for ' Spirited Away ' and ' Princess Mononoke ' . And that would be a crime.<br /><br />As in most anime movies , I recommend watching the Japanese version with the English subtitles , even if you do n't speak a word of Japanese - the English overdubs just do n't tend to be very good , and in this case it 's just horrendous . You might want to watch it in the English version once , though , just for the laughs , and for the star - filled cast ( the English dub was only recorded following the success of ' Spirited Away ' , as it was for ' Kiki 's Delivery Service ' ) - Anna Paquin and James Van Der Beek ( Yeah , the Dawson guy ! ) fill the lead roles , Mark Hamill ( Luke Skywalker from ' Star Wars ' , in case you do n't know ! ) plays the villain , and other roles are filled by Andy Dick , Tres MacNeille ( The Simpsons , Rugrats , Animaniacs ... ) , Michael McShane ( Friar Tuck from Kevin Costner 's Robin Hood travesty ) and Mandy Patinkin ( Hello , my name is Inigo Montoya ... ) Good for a laugh , or a few laughs really . But watch the Japanese one first .
1 Lapyuta ( Castle in the Sky ) , more than any of Hayao Miyazaki 's movies , brings the joy of storytelling to the audience . It is the kind of movie that makes one feel like a kid again ; it 's just magical . It 's a crime that it took this long for it to be released in the states , but now that it 's here check it out ! And stick with the original language ; the dub changed my impressions of the characters somewhat , which is something that should be avoided at all costs in a translation of a movie ( or book , whatever.)<br /><br />I give it a ten / ten .
1 I 've seen the original English version on video . Disney 's choice of voice actors looks very promising . I ca n't believe I 'm saying that . The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own . The two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film . The animation quality is excellent ! If you 've seen Disney 's job of Kiki 's delivery service you can see the quality in their production . It almost redeems them for stealing the story of Kimba the white lion . ( but not quite ! ) Finally Miyazaki 's films are being released properly ! I ca n't wait to see an uncut English version of Nausicaa !
1 I never met a single person ( out of hundreds ) who hated this movie . Bet that anyone who votes it down is a petty saboteur , or a victim of one . This film has everything . Ask yourself , " Are you a fan of . . . ? " Then go see " Laputa".<br /><br />It 's not my favorite movie , but my favorite IS directed by the same person ( Hayao Miyazaki ) . In any case , this one ranks among my top five . And I 've seen a LOT of movies .
