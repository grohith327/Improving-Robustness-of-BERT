1 A simple and effective film about what life is all about , responding to challenges . It took a lot of gall for Homer and his friends to be able to grow into manhood without falling in the trap of a prefabricated future that runs from father to son , to be a miner in the local mine and never get out of that fate . It took also three different challenges for Homer and his friends to conquer a personal and free future . The challenge of the first ever man - made artificial satellite , Sputnik 1 , a Soviet satellite , a milestone in human history , a turning point that Homer and his friends could not miss , did not want to miss . Then the challenge of science and applied mechanics to calculate and to devise a rocket from scratch or rather from what they could gather in books and order in their minds . Finally the challenge of a world that resists and refuses and tries to force you back into the pack , even with an untimely accident that forces you to get back into the pack for plain survival necessity , and even then Homer proved he had the guts to accept the challenge that was blocking for a while his own plans and dreams . But there is another side of the story that the film does not emphasize enough . Homer is the carrier of the project but he is also the carrier of the inspiration he and his friends need . If he is the one who is going to get the university scholarship , because his friends gave him precedence , his friends will also be able to get on their own roads and tracks and step out of the mining fate , thanks to the energy his inspiring example sets in front of their eyes . It is hard at times not to follow the example of the one who is like a beacon on a difficult road . But the film is also effective to show how the father resisted this dream because for him science was not the fabric of a true man , like mining or football . The working class fate that was so present in those 1950s and 1960s and still is present in some areas is too often enforced by the traditional thinking of the father . If the mother does not have the courage to speak up one day , the working class fate I am speaking of becomes a tremendous trap . Here too the film is effective and it should make some parents think . This might have been the fourth challenge Homer had to face : the challenge of taking a road that was not the one pointed at and programmed by his own father.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
1 I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead ( 2005 ) a little while back and , since then , I 've been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen . Like Clive Owen , he has an intensity ( and he even resembles Owen somewhat ) that just oozes from the screen . I feel sure that , if he lands some meaty roles , he 'll crack an Oscar one day ... <br /><br />That 's not to denigrate this film at all.<br /><br />It 's a fine story , with very believable people ( well , it 's based upon the author 's early shenanigans with rocketry ) , a great cast  Chris Cooper is always good , and Laura Dern is always on my watch list  with the appropriate mix of humor , pathos , excitement ... and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping.<br /><br />But , this film had a very special significance for me : in 1957 , I was the same age as Homer Hickham ; like him , I looked up at the night stars to watch Sputnik as it scudded across the blackness ; like Homer also , I experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel ; and like Homer , I also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster ! What fun it was ... <br /><br />I did n't achieve his great ( metaphorical and physical ) heights though . But , that 's what you find out when you see this movie.<br /><br />Sure , it 's a basic family movie , but that 's a dying breed these days , it seems . Take the time to see it , with the kids : you 'll all have a lot of good laughs .
1 There is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where Homer watches the attempt of December 6 , 1957 ( at least that was the video used on the TV he was watching ) which showed the Vangard launch attempt , which failed.<br /><br />He is next shown reading or dictating a letter to Dr. Von Braun offering condolences about the failure.<br /><br />Von Braun was at Marshall space flight center in Huntsville working for the Army . The Vanguard project was by the early Nasa team which was at what soon became Goddard Space flight center.<br /><br />The army rushed the Jupiter - C , which was essentially a US made V2 technology , but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russia 's success with Sputnik.<br /><br />This error may have actually been made by Homer , because of the notoriety of Von Braun , but his team did n't have their attempt fail . In fact the underlying Redstone was flying from 52 and was the first US man rated booster , used for Shepard 's sub orbital flight , as well as Grissom's.<br /><br />This is why this sort of movie is so good , as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia , and in the process see what has been done , and be inspired to do more .
1 I have recently seen this movie due to Jake 's recent success with Brokeback Mountain . I figured I would see the movies that I missed . I had no expectations going into the film so was astounded that I had missed this movie at all . It 's a gripping father and son tale , and it is also an underdog story . I even shed a tear at the finale of this wonderful tale . This movie appeals to all ages . The only reason I give it a 9 out of 10 is that it slows down a little in the middle , but it comes back strong in the end . The acting was great , the story was magnificent , and the cinematography was captivating given the setting of the film . GO SEE THIS MOVIE ! Rent it , buy it , watch it , LOVE IT ! I know I did !
1 I just accidentally stumbled over this film on TV one day . It was aired in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for airing good movies . This one , however , was nothing less then good.<br /><br />October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam , a boy inspired by the Sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist . He and his friends begin to build rockets . His father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coal - miner as himself or go to college on a football - scholarship like his brother.<br /><br />The story is well written . A bit too predictable maybe , but that 's OK cause it does n't focus too much on those parts of the story . It 's important part , but where this is obvious the inner action , the action between the characters is focused on . The story is good . It has some clichés , but that 's OK . It 's based on actual event 's so you kind of ca n't just drop out these clichés . The characters are really good . Where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high . You get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them . They are well written and believable.<br /><br />This is a good looking movie . The sets and the 50 's style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit . This all sets the mood of the film very good.<br /><br />The acting is really good . Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is good as John Hickam . As for the rest of the cast they are good too . All together this makes out a pretty strong cast.<br /><br />All in all I 'm glad I caught this movie . It was first after seeing it I learned that it was based on actual events . If I had known that when seeing it , it would probably just be even more interesting . October Sky is a good and interesting movie . It 's a movie I believe everyone can enjoy . It 's kind of a feel - good movie . Not bad at all !
1 I think I read this someplace : Joe Johnston ( director of the film and also one of the guys who founded Industrial Light and Magic for work on the first Star Wars film ) and one of his producers or something were racking their brains for a title for the movie , " Rocket Boys " ( I guess ) was lacking something.<br /><br />One day they were messing with a PC program that forms words from other words ( ie : you type in a word or series of words and it mixes the letters up and forms other words ) I think the technical term is an " anagram" < br /><br />Anyway , they typed in " Rocket Boys " and sure enough what comes back is " October Sky " . They were shocked to say the least . The title summed up everything in the movie since the movie revolves around Sputnik . At first Homer Jr did not like the idea , but he warmed up to it after the " movie poster paperback novel " came out and took off .
1 Based on fact , this is the story of a teenager named Homer Hickam ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) , growing up in a coal town in West Virginia where a boy 's usual destiny was to " end up in the mines . " But Homer had his eye on the sky and a love for flying rockets , to the dismay of his mine - foreman father , and the consternation of the townsfolk generally . A misfit for sure , he and three of his equally outcast buddies begin making rockets , which they fly from a patch of barren land eight miles out of town , so as to no longer terrorize the community with their oft - times errant rockets . Unfortunately , most of the town and especially Homer 's father ( Chris Cooper ) thinks that they are wasting their time . However , the people become intrigued and soon start coming out in droves to watch the ' Rocketboys ' send off their homemade missiles . Only one teacher ( Laura Dern ) in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize . Now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars . Director Joe Johnston has always been a famous name for his movies such as Jumanji & Jurassic Park 3 & " October Sky " surely stands above all of his other films . Without any doubts , " October Sky " is his best effort & obviously his best film . It 's not only a true story filmed extremely well , but even as a movie , it has every single thing , which is required for a top level cinema . And along with Johnston 's extra - ordinary direction , are some exceptional performances . Jake Gyllenhaal was around 19 , when this movie was released & he gives a beautiful & natural performance . He is a perfect actor . Chris Cooper as his father , also gives a very fine performance . The same goes for Laura Dern & also she looks beautiful . Even the rest of the performances are extremely well . The background score was fine . Highly inspiring movie , which lifts up your spirit sky high . One of those movies which definitely inspires you for all of your life . An amazing inspiring movie along with loads of entertainment . Not to be missed .
1 A true wholesome American story about teenagers who are interested in launching their own rocket in a rural West Virginia coal mining town , after the launch of Sputnik in 1957.<br /><br />Through trial , tribulations and perseverance beyond belief , they are ultimately able to achieve their goals.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal , as the leader of the group , is excellent in the title role . As his motivating science teacher , Laura Linney is quite good but her southern accent is over the top.<br /><br />There is a standout supporting performance by Chris Cooper , a head miner , who wants his son to follow in his footsteps , but gradually comes around at film 's end.<br /><br />What makes this film so unusual for our times is that there are no bed - hopping scenes and no profanity whatsoever . It is the epitome of an American story that is well done.<br /><br />Besides the science angle , we have the father - son disagreement , football scholarships as a way to escape coal mining , and the loving spirit of family.<br /><br />Why are n't pictures like this recognized more at award times ?
1 I grew up in Southern West Virginia ; I 'm about the same age as ( or maybe a year older than ) Homer Hickam , author of " The Rocket Boys , " the book forming the true - story basis of this heart - warming film.<br /><br />And so I relate closely to the West Virginia coal - mining theme , and to the stunning effect Sputnik had at that time ( October 4 , 1957 ) on all of us . The Rocket Boys went on to make great lives for themselves . I went on to get my degrees in Physics and Computer Engineering . All because Sputnik woke up a lot of young people to the " Science Gap " the U.S.S.R. had on the U.S. in those Cold War days ... <br /><br />This is a wonderful film for everyone , of all ages . But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950 's , it 'll touch the core of your being.<br /><br />Everyone : Get it ; watch it ; recommend it to your friends ... who 'll thank you many times .
1 I loved October Sky . The thing I loved most had to be the music . It worked two ways : in the first hour of the film , it gives the viewer a time - frame . This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties . In the second hour , an instrumental score takes over . The music now fits the mood of the film perfectly.<br /><br />I did not only enjoy the music , I also quite enjoyed the cast . Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a surprise for me . He gave off a first - class performance , as did Chris Owen ( Quentin ) and Chris Cooper ( John Hickam).<br /><br />I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now , and both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself .
1 October Sky is a highly lauded movie , and it¡ ¦ s easy to see why . The story is easy to comprehend and many turning points are gripping , the actors and actresses do fairly good jobs , especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper , the hero finally gets what he wants , and it¡ ¦ s a true story . Frankly I think the director¡ ¦ s achievement is not comparable to the sparks and heat the original story generates . We don¡ ¦ t see any special narrative or cinematography ; the power of the movie relies much on the riveting plot and tough situation the young hero is trapped in that most audience will find themselves identify with the characters . We feel Homer¡ ¦ s desire to earn his father¡ ¦ s recognition and create his own future , and his resilience wins our respect . ¡ § October Sky¡¨ reminds me of a later 2001 Japanese production of mini series ¡ § Rocket Boy,¡¨ which might owe some of the inspiration from this movie . Actually these two works shot from two different cultures provide interesting comparison . When October Sky unfolds a story of a young man crying out loud to claim his right over his own destiny , ¡ § Rocket Boy¡¨ offers a more compromised description that could sometimes constitute an acrid criticism of modern society . Starring the outstanding actor Yuji Oda , ¡ § Rocket Boy¡¨ focuses on three men as ordinary as can be : a travel agent who has a dream of becoming an astronaut , a boastful advertising agent who is on the brink of being torn apart by his inferiority complex resulted from the extreme success of his father and older brother ( like what Homer feels in his family ) , and a food company employee who is about to getting married but scared of this idea . The collected social consciousness superimposes its definition of success on its constituents and steps further to force them suffocate their dreams by claiming them ¡ § impossible.¡¨ To compensate for his lost ideal , Kobayashi ( Yuji ) works in the tour operator because it¡ ¦ s called ¡ § Galaxy.¡¨ When his client fails him and his girlfriend decides to leave him , he finally finds strength from his father¡ ¦ s words , who had determined to be a sailor but later found life on the sea less attractive as he had presumed . ¡ § But I don¡ ¦ t regret it,¡¨ his father told Kobayashi , ¡ § at least I tried.¡¨ It is his father¡ ¦ s confession that encourages him to resign his job and apply for astronautships despite the fact that he hurts his legs and needs to move around on a wheelchair . Kobayashi¡ ¦ s effort finally fails , and he goes back to the travel agency . But his ¡ § crazy¡¨ courage inspires his friends , and everyone loves him more . Just before the end of the series , Kobayashi is on the job as a guide of a space camp meant to let children learn more about astronauts . After the tour is over we see him leaning against a tree , unfolding a sheet of poster he tears from the bulletin board that says : ¡ § Astronauts Wanted for 2004.¡¨ Kobayashi looks at the piece of paper and laughs and laughs , just like a kid looking at his ticket to Disneyland . Kobayashi may never get what he wants , but he dares his destiny and ¡ § just does it.¡¨ This series is so heart - gripping not because the hero exhibits any heroic deeds , but his ordinariness and unstoppable urge to realize his dream which make us wonder and envy . Unlike Dilbert or other sarcastic writings , this show enlightens us and teaches us something . Homer and Kobayashi both have the dream , and they do what they can despite other people¡ ¦ s opinions . I recommend other IMDB users to see the Japanese TV series . If you are a nine - to - fiver , you will feel more touched . I feel sorry that IMDB doesn¡ ¦ t have its data , maybe you can ask somebody from Japan to help you .
1 My wife did not realize what a gem this movie was when she picked it up . It is a story that shows real world success through hard work and determination.<br /><br />That is so refreshing in a world of violent movies not that I dis - like them ) , but you have to love a movie that succeeds without it .
1 The acting in this movie was superb . As an amateur rocketeer , I found very few mistakes . As a human being , it touched my heart and soul . To watch the actors , you would think that they are the actual characters . Laura Dern , a favorite actress of mine , left nothing out of her performance . The young actors playing the Rocket Boys showed talent beyond their years , especially young Homer . Homer 's father inspired that eternal love / hate relationship between a father and son so that it felt real . If you do n't get a lump in your throat or shed a tear when that first successful rocket goes up or when father and son come to terms , then get your pulse checked ( you may be dead ) .
1 This film was absolutely BRILLIANT ! ! Every performance in this film is excellent , especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper . It looks like Mr Gyllenhaal will have a HUGE film career if this is anything to go by . I thought that Joe Johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated woth big budget blockbusters(Jumanji , Honey I shrunk the kids ) . He pulls of every scene with sheer class . My favourite scene was where Homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky , going down , as all of his dreams were , it was beautiful . Joe Johnston should direct more of these brilliant , acting driven films as well as his Big budget blockbuster faire , which is also excellent . KUDOS ! ! to all involved in this masterpiece !
1 I watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to Billy Elliott ( 2000 ) . Both films are based around a troubled father / son relationship . In both films , the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town . Both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.<br /><br />The major difference that I found between the films was that October Sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film . Laura Dern puts in a moving performance and Chris Cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in American Beauty ( 1999 ) . Joe Johnston surprised me with his subtle directing , very different from his other directorial features such as Jumanji ( 1995 ) and Jurassic Park III ( 2001).<br /><br / >
1 Maybe not the most original way of telling a story , we 've seen all this before in many movies .. but .. I liked it October Sky alot anyways . It got something , Great directing and good acting by all parts , especially Laura Dern(the teacher ) and Chris Cooper(the father ) . I wanna be a rocket - engineer ! : )
1 < br /><br />I'm sure things did n't exactly go the same way in the real life of Homer Hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book , Rocket Boys , but the movie " October Sky " ( an anagram of the book 's title ) is good enough to stand alone . I have not read Hickam 's memoirs , but I am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation . The film , directed by Joe Johnston and written by Lewis Colick , records the story of teenager Homer Hickam ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) , beginning in October of 1957 . It opens with the sound of a radio broadcast , bringing news of the Russian satellite Sputnik , the first artificial satellite in orbit . We see a images of a blue - gray town and its people : mostly miners working for the Olga Coal Company . One of the miners listens to the news on a hand - held radio as he enters the elevator shaft , but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness , losing sight of the starry sky above him . A melancholy violin tune fades with this image . We then get a jolt of Elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting : October 5 , 1957 , Coalwood , West Virginia . Homer and his buddies , Roy Lee Cook ( William Lee Scott ) and Sherman O'Dell ( Chad Lindberg ) , are talking about football tryouts . Football scholarships are the only way out of the town , and working in the mines , for these boys . " Why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college , " questions Homer . Roy Lee replies , " They 're also the only ones who get the girls . " Homer does n't make it in football like his older brother , so he is destined for the mines , and to follow in his father 's footsteps as mine foreman . Until he sees the dot of light streaking across the October sky . Then he wants to build a rocket . " I want to go into space , " says Homer . After a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother 's ( Natalie Canerday ) fence , Homer enlists the help of the nerdy Quentin Wilson ( Chris Owen ) . Quentin asks Homer , " What do you want to know about rockets ? " Homer quickly anwers , " Everything . " His science teacher at Big Creek High School , Miss Frieda Riley ( Laura Dern ) greatly supports Homer , and the four boys work on building rockets in Homer 's basement . His father , however , whose life is the mine , does not support him . John Hickam ( Chris Cooper ) believes that Homer should n't waste his time on the rockets , that the coal mines are all that matter . The coal from the mines is used to make steel , and without steel , the country would be nothing . The difficult relationship between Homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships I have ever seen in a film . Miss Riley introduces Homer to the idea of entering the local science fair , with a chance to go the nationals and win a college scholarship . " You ca n't just dream your way out of Coalwood , " she tells Homer . Homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets , improving the models with each attempt . Despite the many attempts , the boys do not lose their determination . " What are the chances of us winning that science fair , " O'Dell asks Homer in one of their more despairing moments . " A million to one , " answers Homer . " That good ? " O'Dell replies , " Well , why did n't you say so ? " The music , composed by Mark Isham , conveys sadness and hope at the same time , especially sad at a point when Homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of Coalwood . Rollicking 1950s ' rock and roll , including songs by The Coasters and Buddy Holly , occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light - hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers ' lives with the lives of the miners . The film , photographed by Fred Murphy , also uses colors to set moods and symbolize . The town of Coalwood , actually filmed in Tennessee , is washed with blues , grays , and browns . It 's as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything- faces , clothes , houses , and roads . When a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys , it is obvious that they are from the world outside of Coalwood and the Olga Coal Company . The book on guided missile design that Miss Riley gives Homer is red . The red stands out enough against the blue - gray world of Coalwood to symbolize " getting out " , but it is still subtle . The reds are fleeting hints of a world that Homer only dreams of . Jake Gyllenhaal expresses such zeal , hope , and pertinacity as Homer Hickam that it is hard to believe he is n't the real Homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film . Chris Cooper is also extraordinarily believable as Homer 's stubborn father , who does n't recognize , or just does n't want to admit , that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive . Homer , and everyone who encourages him in his rocket - building , is aware that the town is dying . With the community disintegrating , the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys ' demonstrations . Again , I 'm sure things did n't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them , but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism ? " October Sky " has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real .
1 This film caught me by surprise . My friend told me that this movie was a " chick flick . " Boy , was he wrong ! This movie has a great family appeal , with no sex scenes like _ other _ movies . Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job in Homer Hickam 's shoes . The supporting cast is great , as well.<br /><br />Science , coming - of - age , family quarrels , a great train scene ... This film has it all . The soundtrack is good , although the score is presented quite choppily . The 50s music kicks the movie over the edge of greatness.<br /><br />The DVD is definitely worth its weigh in coal . Replay value is great - I 've seen it quite a few times already .
1 I saw that movie few days ago . This movie is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad that you have always dreamed about it - you can have it . This shows a big wish come true trought happiness and sadness , hopeless and failure . But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something that you love you can make things different and be happy .
1 This movie will kick your ass ! Powerful acting in a story that pushes all of us to live out our dreams . Jake Gyllenhaal will go places from here , and the supporting cast was superb . Why would would anyone want to stay in Coalville and develop black lung anyway ?
1 Above - average film and acting partly spoiled by its completely predictable story line . Even the music is chosen so that the words fit the action every time . A scent of " Pleasantville " camp hangs around this flick . As a period piece , it 's more accurate than not . Its depiction of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is sketchy but moving . Chris Cooper turns in a first - class performance as Howard 's coal - miner daddy .
1 In my opinion , October Sky is one of the best movies of 1999 ... It totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need , like , wonderful story and good character interactions . October Sky will remain in heart for as long as I can remember , and I just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film .
1 The film belongs to Inventor - Underdog genre . Jake Gyllenhaal , Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a little acting verve to story with several standard elements . Well filmed , well edited , with plenty of well acted secondary roles.<br /><br />Some have declared this movie to be classic American hokey . It is that and more . I agree with those who say " The movie celebrates the thrill of youthful inspiration . " < br /><br />The film is a pleasant reminder that achievement may be born of ordinary roots.<br /><br / >
1 Five years on from the Tenko survivors returning home , and from Marion 's double - edged " Well that 's that".<br /><br />It 's now 1950 : reunion time . The gang 's all here : Marion , Bea , Ulrica , Kate , Dorothy , Christina , Dominica , and latecomers Maggie and Alice . The story that unfolds is a beaut : as perfectly written and acted , and as thought - provoking and moving , as the original series.<br /><br />All the questions left hanging at the end of the series are neatly answered here . From Marion 's family to Joss 's health centre , everything has changed in five years , and not everything has changed for the best.<br /><br />A trip to Dominica 's plantation brings plenty of shocks and some truly edge - of - the - seat tension . There 's a real sense of tragedy and disaster as , once again , fate takes over and the women struggle for their lives . Dominica finally shows her true colours , and there are some shout - at - the - telly moments of drama.<br /><br />Lush location filming in Singapore , and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends . It 's such a shame that this really is the end . I could watch it all over again . Perfection .
1 A very gritty , gutsy portrayal of a part of world war 2 history , that most of us in the U.S. had / have no idea ever occurred . I would love to have this on video . It only was shown on t.v . one time as far as I know , back in 89or 90 . I have asked around for this movie , and most video stores do n't even know about it . Great actresses all around , Wish that I could see it again . Top notch series .
1 Well , Tenko is without doubt the best British television show ever , the performances , the directing , the casting , the suspense , the drama ..... everything is fantastic about it.<br /><br />Although the show fell a little later in its final season , this ending movie picked up the threads nicely and wove a superb story for fans of the show and newbies . I can not recommend this movie more , find it and watch it . But I do advise watching the series first , as the first 2 seasons are even better than this fantastic movie.<br /><br />An obvious ( 10/10 )
1 myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of Tenko and agree this is by far one of the BBC better series . The whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wo nt be the same without it . No doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which I would never get sick of watching . Excellent viewing and full marks to the BBC for such a brilliant series and the casting . First rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone although some age limits must be considered because of some adult material . So grateful to the BBC for releasing this series on DVD and Video .
1 The Theory Of Flight is an engaging character study of an artist ( Branagh ) yearning to break free of boredom and mediocrity , and a terminally ill patient ( Bonham - Carter ) in the last stages of ASL , confined to a wheelchair , who desires to make love to a man before dying.<br /><br />Helena Bonham - Carter exudes wit , defiance , and independence as an ASL patient who is virtually dependent upon people around her to take care of her.<br /><br />Kenneth Branagh , sentenced through community service to take part in caring for her , complements Helena 's charm with woeful melancholy , creating a sentimental , compelling love story in which two people try to help each other find the road to happiness , before time runs out .
1 Not wishing to give * anything * away here , I would just say this technically excellent , flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half 's entertainment : It will amuse , surprise , possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time , as it approaches the inevitable , but not obvious , ending without becoming clichéd or predictable in any way . Most definitely recommended.<br /><br />A previous User 's Comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham - Carter 's outstanding performances - I agree entirely ....
1 Despite its low - key release in this country , and its apparent disregard in other countries ( the ' R ' rating in the States ca n't have helped - honestly , just because HBC uses the C - word ! ) , this is actually a fine piece of work . The sentimentality does occasionally threaten to choke it , but it 's overcome by the playing of the two leads.<br /><br />It 's easy to win plaudits just because you 're playing a physical or mental cripple ( Daniel Day - Lewis , Geoffrey Rush , Dustin Hoffman , etc . ) , and Helena Bonham - Carter may not quite capture the physical degradation of MND , but her vocal stretching and ruthless emotional drive compensate entirely . In fact , almost all her performance is conducted through her eyes ( and what eyes ! ) . This is an intelligent turn from an actress who is rapidly undoing her English Rose reputation , and emerging as a figure of some stature . Awards must surely follow , though not , alas , for this fine performance.<br /><br />Branagh , one feels , has never quite given his best on film ( except possibly ' Hamlet ' , and there his playing was diluted by the large cast ) . Here , though , he tops his other appearances , playing to the hilt a self - loathing , unstable , ultimately lovable guy with a subtlety he has n't always displayed , and exhibiting both intelligence and depth . In short , we believe him , just as much as we could NOT believe him as Frankenstein , as the priest in ' The Proposition ' , as the lawyer in ' The Gingerbread Man ' , even as Andrew in ' Peter 's Friends ' . This is surely his finest performance yet - so why could he not produce the goods much earlier?<br /><br />As a film , it looks more like a television offering , and without its stars it probably would n't amount to very much . But it 's been a pleasure to see this pair perform their socks off like this , and I eagerly await more from them ( though not ' Love 's Labour 's Lost ' ... ) . 8 out of 10 , but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10 .
1 This film does a superb job of depicting the plight of an ALS ( Lou Gehrig 's Disease)sufferer . The subject is done with compassion as well as humor . Helena Bonham Carter is so convincing as a person with ALS that I found it hard to believe that she was only acting . Kenneth Branagh , a superb actor , lives up to expectations as the quirky artist who misbehaves and is forced to provide companionship to Helena 's character as part of his " community service " , an alternative to prison time . Watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from beginning to end . Tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances . One comes to care deeply for the two of them .
1 Loved this film . Real people , great acting , humour , unpredictable . The characters were believable and you really connected with them . If you 're looking for a film about slightly offbeat characters outside the mainstream of society and how they help each other , this would be a good choice .
1 At the start , this one is from England , so , of course , I had 98 % chances that it will be intelligent and very good cinema . I never heard of this film before . From the minute I saw Helena Bonham - Carter , I said to myself : Oh ! Here 's comes the feminine version of My Left Foot . I was right , but I was also wrong . Wrong because the two movies are very differents . My Left Foot was a John Ford alike movie and this one is a Chaplin alike movie ( not because this is funny , but Chaplin at that great sense of melodrama that brings tears to your eyes . ) I was right because in 1990 handsome Daniel Day - Lewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality . Here , very beautiful Bonham - Carter did exactly the same thing , but with very feminine emotions . The story is well written and it 's very intelligent . For me , miss Bonham - Carter gives one of the greatest woman 's part of the 1990 's , with Emily Lloyd in Breaking The Waves . Gee ! And look at her eyes ! She had the most beautiful eyes of cinema since Jobyna Ralston , Louise Brooks , Michele Morgan and Ava Gardner ! She 's also a true talent , as seen on many other movies . See this one , you wo n't regret it ! And a very fine job by Branagh too !
1 Shamefully , before I saw this film , I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />I had to do some research , in order to assure myself she was n't actually afflicted , as was her character , with ( well ? ) , what she was afflicted with . I was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady . She pulled it of flawlessly.<br /><br />Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants , and needs , of a unique young lady , could be interpreted as tender , and romantic ? Well , they can be , when the right performers present them in the proper manner , as they did in this wonderful movie . I forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful Miss Carter looked in this movie . I have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the face of our earth , but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie.<br /><br />I hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as I did . Thank you for letting me express my opinion .
1 Although this movie has some weaknesses , it is worth seeing . I chose it because of the cast , and applaud Bonham Carter and Branagh for choosing roles different from those they have taken in the past . Both portray very troubled people , complete with warts , but make them likeable because of their humanity . The story is touching , but it is the performances that soar . Bonham Carter 's " Jane " is a remarkable achievement , whose quest for romance opened my eyes to aspects of being disabled that I had not thought of before , but was interesting as well for other reasons . I felt the movie ended too abruptly , but better that than a drawn out emotionally manipulative ending ( see " Stepmom . " ) The very real English setting added to my enjoyment - it was England in the 90 's , both urban and rural , without being depressing .
1 Imagine the plight of Richard , a painter , whose real passion is flying . When we first meet him , he is seen atop a building in London wearing his home made wings . He has ripped his canvases and other works , at the height of his despair , and fashions a flying device for his jump . When he falls into the protective police contraption , he does n't suffer a scratch , but it lands him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service . Richard , whose relationship with Anne apparently ended badly , decides to relocate to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large barn he plans to use to construct his own plane.<br /><br />Richard ends up trying to help Jane Harchard reluctantly . She is a young woman suffering from A.L.S. , or Lou Gehrig 's disease and is confined to a motorized wheel chair . Jane is extremely intelligent , but has a dark side and a salty vocabulary . She uses a hand held device to speak sometimes , as her speech is not clear . What Jane loves to do is to lose her virginity , at any cost . Jane and Richard clash as they meet , but a mutual tolerance soon makes them comfortable with one another.<br /><br />Jane , who watches porn on her computer , has a notion for finding someone like Richard Gere in " American Gigolo " , who will , for a fee , have sex with her . When Richard takes her to London , they find the right man for the job . His fee is exorbitant , but they agree . Since they have no money , Richard decides to rob a big bank . Unfortunately , things do n't go according to plan when Jane realizes that she ca n't go through with what she had wanted . At the end , Richard takes Jane for a ride in his crudely built plane for the thrill of her life , something that brings them closer , as they find an affinity with one another.<br /><br />Peter Greengrass directed this quirky film which presents an unusual situation . Jane is clearly not the romantic heroine in mainstream films , and yet , she has such a sweet aura about her that is hard not to feel for her and what she is trying to accomplish . Mr. Greengrass shows an affinity Richar Hawkins ' material he wrote for the film . The movie does n't try to be cute or give a rosy picture of a young woman afflicted with an incurable disease.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter is the main reason for watching the film . She makes a wonderful Jane . On the other hand , Kenneth Branagh does n't seem too well suited for this type of comedy . Somehow , he has problems of his own in the way he interprets Richard . Gemma Jones has some good moments as Anne , Richard 's former love.<br /><br />"The Theory of Flight " shows a good director . No doubt Peter Greengrass will go to bigger and better things .
1 I found this movie quite by accident , but am happy that I did . Kenneth Branagh 's performance came close to stealing this movie from Helena Bonham Carter , but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie . This movie brought to mind the excellent movies that Branagh made with Emma Thompson . Carter 's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as I have seen from a female lead in a long time . Portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off , but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life , she made it so believable . If this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women " uglying " themselves up for roles ( Charlize Theron , Halle Berry ) , I fell sure Carter would have had strong consideration for an Oscar . If you run across this movie on cable late at night as I did , trust me , it is worth the lost sleep .
1 A bit quirky and bordering bad taste ; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching . A wheelchair - bound young woman Jane Hatchard(Helena Bonham Carter)is teamed with a reluctant caregiver , Richard(Kenneth Branagh ) . Richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight . He builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it . He wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent , dying Jane , who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills . Wheelchair - bound and full of spirit , her last dying wish is to loose her virginity . She offers herself to Richard , who wo n't help her directly ; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed . I found this flick ambitious and humorous . Even in this role , Carter has a certain charisma and likability .
1 This movie truly captures the feeling of freedom ....... and what the freedom of your own integrity is worth .... in the most delightful , light - hearted way . Not a serious , but hilarious adventure.<br /><br />The story mirrors life . We do n't always get what we want right away but we find out we get what we need to to understand why we did n't get what we wanted .... which results in us getting more than we thought we would get ! You will get this once you see the movie . < br /><br />And this movie is truly about finding love and knowing one has found it and that it totally changed one 's life.<br /><br />It is one of my all time favorites ...... not easy to find but worth the hunt ......... I guarantee you will watch it more than once !
1 I saw this film without to know what about were ... I 'm a fan of Branagh , even more his Shakespeare ' films , and , in the beginning , I saw it only for this ... and I finished with tears in my eyes , because the great , great serenity , values , affect and brave philosophy about Life of Helena 's girl . Recommended to people who are bored with TV programming ( in Spain , at least ) .
1 This is the best movie I 've seen since White and the best romantic comedy I 've seen since The Hairdresser 's Husband . An emotive , beautiful masterwork from Kenneth Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter . It is a tragedy this movie has n't gotten more recognition .
1 Helena Bonham Carter is the center of this movie . She plays her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity . Kenneth Branagh was tolerable . The movie itself was good not exceptional . If you are a Helena Bonham Carter fan it is worth seeing .
1 This was one of those times when I had nothing to do with 27 premium movie channels available to me . The Theory of Flight grabbed me and held my interest . I found it both touching and amusing , a nice combination of feelings . I recommend it !
1 I had my doubts about another love story wherein disabled individuals find meaning and redemption through honest communication . And it 's still not at the top of my list . But the performances from Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplary , almost stunning , and rescue this from being just another tear - jerker . Carter 's depiction of an ALS victim is strong , perhaps even overdone at times ( sometimes her dialog dissolves into undistinguishable mutterings ) . But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding . Branagh may be the perfect compliment to her performance.<br /><br / >
1 < br /><br / > I suppose this is not the best film ever made but I voted it at 10 stars all the same . Mainly because of my feelings at the end . I and all the people around me were simply touched . This is something you do n't often feel . We are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality , lazy manipulation or preaching in modern films . The story of the film centres around Jane a young woman in the last stages of MND and the friendship that grows between her and Richard , a man on the verge of a breakdown . This could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous , humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie . < br /><br />The acting from Branagh and Bonham - Carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role . The chemistry between the two also lifts the movie . < br /><br />The title comes from Richards masterpiece , a plane made of junk and his old paintings . Flying here is a symbol for both Richards and Janes living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end . < br /><br />A beautiful and funny movie that I would recommend to anyone . do n't let the subject matter put you off .
1 i thought this movie was really really great ! Helena did an amazing job in it ! I thought she played her character very well ! she 's an AWESOME actress ! ! : ) < br /><br />the movie was also really funny too ! The jokes were great ! i could nt stop laughing ! : ) < br /><br />i think everyone should see it ... : ) < br /><br / >
1 A quite good film version of the novel , though at the beginning a little bit lengthy . Fortunately there are a few funny scenes from time to time . This movie is surely not for the main stream audience - but for fans of Italian ( or Portuguese ) cinema , a must - see also for Mastroianni - fans .
1 I first saw BLOOD OF THE SAMURAI at its premiere during the Hawaii International Film Festival . WOW ! Blood just blew us away with its sheer verve , gore , vitality , gore , excitement , gore , utter campiness , and even more gore , and all in SUCH GREAT FUN ! Especially for those of you who enjoy all those Japanese chambara samurai and ninja films , YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO SEE BLOOD !
1 This films makes no pretentious efforts to hide its true genre -- a campy B movie . It will flat out tell you in the beginning the definition of campy . It should have also given the adjective meaning of cheese . But the two come together in this film in ways that make you go , " Hmmmmm ... that 's so stupid ! " and then have you laughing . For example , there is a scene back in " 16th Century Japan " , which shows a couple of samurai walking in the foreground of a temple . In the background of the temple , there are several tourists looking off in the distance in slippers and shorts . Hmmmm ... hahahah ! I could not stop laughing . And the acting goes from decent , to bearable , to oh my Lord , but that 's what makes it funny . You 'll see some decent actors and then find others really terrible . I have to digress somewhat though because I have seen Stephanie Sanchez in several plays and she is awesome . Her air time in the film was pretty short though . I have also seen Bryan Yamasaki in several plays in the islands during my visits and he 's also better in theatre than in this movie . Anyhow , it 's an entertaining film , if you 've got nothing to do on a weekday evening .
1 This movie for what it is , may be one of the most amazing indie films of recent day . Made on a super small budget , the film has special effects that blow away alot of the current films ! IF you have a chance watch it !
1 I 've seen this movie on several different occasions . I find one of the funniest things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see it.<br /><br />Type 1 : OLD PEOPLE . A lot of old Japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a honest - to - goodness samurai movie with lots of swordplay and medieval Japanese dialogue . As soon the two protagonists begin debating horror movies while inserting expletives almost randomly throughout their sentences , the old people walk out , usually disgusted.<br /><br />Type 2 : FILM SNOBS . These people think that just because a movie bears the label of " Independent " that it will automatically be a load of hard - to - follow , overemotional crap that may or may not be in English . Yet they see it anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and cultured . They are really in for a surprise when they see this film . As soon as the blood begins to squirt exaggeratedly from anime - inspired sword battles or the over - the - top villain nonchalantly pegs a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation , these people will be so dismayed , they will walk out . A few will stay just to see " how bad it will get " and later they 'll rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends.<br /><br />Type 3 : PEOPLE EXPECTING TO SEE LIVE - ACTION ANIME OR MATRIX - LIKE SPECIAL EFFECTS . Sorry folks , the martial arts are pretty solid in the film , but director Yamasato really does n't have the budget for that kind of thing.<br /><br />Type 4 : PEOPLE WITH NO EXPECTATIONS . These are the people who really enjoy the film . Whether they had only heard of Blood of the Samurai , picked it at random , or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze , these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it ultimately is : ENTERTAINMENT . This movie was not made to enlighten or to provoke deep spiritual thought , it was meant ( if I may borrow a line of dialogue from the film ) to " really kick some ass . " And that 's what it does.<br /><br />So depending on what type of person you are , you may or may not enjoy this film ; however , if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting , then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friends .
1 A documentary about two rocks bands , spanning a number of years . Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols . What makes it special is the examination of the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure.<br /><br />Anton Newcombe , the main man of Brian Jonestown Massacre , is widely recognised as a musical genius not only by his colleagues , his friends and rivals the Dandy Warhols , but also by record producers and most people who have worked with him . Sadly he and his band members are also incapable of integrating with the real world . Newcombe picks fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience ( getting arrested at one point for literally kicking in the head of a fan ) . Newcombe knows no limits  he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments , writes and produces all BJM 's music , can produce enough songs to fill a whole album in a single day , has a prophet - like obsessiveness with his own musical genius , but is also a heavy drugs user , flies into rages at the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity , orders his band members about as if they are lower forms of life , and can blow deals as fast as he makes them . BJM go through a large number of record labels in fast succession  they sign them up as soon as they realise Newcombe 's talents and let them go as soon as they realise he is totally uncontrollable.<br /><br />The Warhols acknowledge their debt to Newcombe 's creativity and do n't even put themselves in the same exalted sphere of greatness  but the Warhols have something that BJM do n't  the ability to integrate their talents with common sense , the real world , and their market  as a mixing pot of talent ( even if much of it is distilled from guru Newcombe ) and accessibility , they are the very definition of ' cool . ' DiG ! follows the parallel careers of the two bands with increasing poignancy . At one point , Newcombe pulls stunts designed to generate publicity by sending apparent death threats and hate messages to the Warhols ( in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap ' to clean up their act ' )  only he forgets to tell them it 's a stunt and they get so paranoid they take out a restraining order against Newcombe . By the time the Dandy Warhols take off in Europe with hits like ' Every Day Should Be A Holiday ' and ' Bohemian Like You ' , Newcombe is becoming increasingly isolated . BJM are stopped and the band breaks up when they are arrested for possession of marijuana  the Warhols get busted for drugs around the same time , let off with a warning , and even allowed to keep the grass.<br /><br />The wider appeal of DiG ! is that the lessons of genius versus accessibility go way beyond two bands or even rock music . The downside is that it is still a documentary , however intimate , and it will mostly only appeal to dedicated film fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the featured bands . Newcombe may well be a largely unrecognised genius , and there are feint glimpses of this in the film , but to the unattuned ear there is little more than the assertions of the people interviewed to attest to this . In the words of one of the band members : " In every spiritual tradition , you burn in hell for pretending to be God and not being able to back it up . " Newcombe is n't pretending  but numerically there are maybe still insufficient people to appreciate him in his own lifetime , and DiG ! has an uphill struggle to rectify the balance in favour of a tortured but largely unrecognised genius .
1 I could n't find anyone to watch DiG ! with me because no one I knew was a fan of either of the bands . Naturally everyone assumed you can only enjoy this film if you like the music of either The Dandy Warhols or the Brian Jonestown Massacre , but this is so far from the truth . The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and/or pop culture in general . The way in which the careers of the two groups are paralleled is a perfect representation of the paths a band can take , and watching the public eat up and spit out the Dandy Warhols is fascinating . I agree with other reviews that mention it would be nice to get a final word from Anton himself , since he 's clearly depicted as his own worst enemy and the bulwark to the band 's ability to just remain.<br /><br />Most interesting to me is the Dandys ' respect for the BJM ( despite their lack or reciprocation ) and for Anton ( despite his erratic behavior ) . The Dandy Warhols respect the art the group produces even if the group hates everything the Dandy Warhols now stand for ( although that 's disputable ) . The best line is when the drummer for the Dandy 's says " I wo n't have them anywhere new me again " and the guitarist unconsciously blurts out " I 'll still buy their records though . " To me , this just shows how powerful good music can be.<br /><br />Definitely see this movie , even if you know nothing of either band . It 's more about the themes of rock music and how they develop that makes this film so interesting . It 's rare to follow a group so closely for so long .
1 Excellent documentary , ostensibly about the friendship and subsequent rivalry between two West Coast retro rock'n'roll bands : The Dandy Warhols and the Brian Jonestown Massacre . What it actually turns out to be is a portrait of a borderline psychopath - Anton Newcomb - and his tortured relationship with the rest of the world . Interestingly , for a music documentary , there is hardly any music . What there is - snatches of songs , more often than not aborted by the performers - is incidental rather than central . Although the protagonists are musicians , the story is not about music but rather about a particularly American version of a British myth of a cartoon lifestyle , ie , one where nobody has to take responsibility for behaving like spoiled adolescents on a full - time basis . Tantrums , drugs , violence , grossly dysfunctional attitudes , egomania on a truly epic scale - all of this is excused or positively encouraged because it conforms to some collectively held idea about what rock'n'roll is about . As a film this is a first - class documentary but it raises more questions than it answers . For example , why is Anton 's music so conservative ? For someone so wild and outrageous ( and he IS wild and outrageous ) his music never seems to have progressed beyond the most obvious derivations of his 60s idols ( The Stones , Velvets etc . ) For someone who claims to be able to play 80 instruments he has never bothered to learn to play any one of them beyond the most rudimentary level . Similarly , the Dandy Warhols burning ambition is based on a vision of rock'n'roll which is astonishingly fossilised in 1969 . Nothing wrong with pastiches , of course , but surely there 's more to musical life than perpetually acting out a cartoon from the late 60s . Why do n't they take some risks with their music - in the way that their role models did ? Because , one suspects , this is not about music . Music is just an accessory , a prop , or an excuse , to lead completely dysfunctional and irresponsible lives . But why ? In the Dandy Warhols case , the answer is obvious : to make lots of money and be famous . Big deal . Anton Newcomb 's case is more interesting . He is obviously very talented , but every time he is given an opportunity to reach a wider audience he sabotages it , usually in the most dramatic way possible . He is terrified of success , and at the same time , deeply resents anyone else who has it - especially his former friends the Dandy Warhols . Fascinating movie . Highly recommended .
1 Rock n ' roll is a messy business and DiG ! demonstrates this masterfully . A project of serious ambition , and perhaps foolhardiness , the filmmaker is able to mend together seven tumultuous years of following around two unwieldy rock groups . With that said , the abundance of quality material ensures the film 's ability to captivate the audience . If you 've ever been interested in any realm of the music industry , this movie will undoubtedly be an arresting viewing . the music in the film , although it suffers minimally from requisite cutting and pasting , is worth the price of admission alone . the morning after i saw DiG ! i went straight to the record store to pick up a Brian Jonestown Massacre album ( i was already initiated to the Dandy Warhols ' sounds ) . Primarily defined by its exploration of rock music , the film succeeds at other profound levels . DiG ! is a sincere , and sufficiently objective , glance into the destructive and volatile nature of the creative process and the people that try to wrangle those forces .
1 A really cool flick . A must for any music snob . You do n't really have to know about the bands to enjoy the movie . Before the movie , I only heard only two songs from the Dandy Warhols . The only thing is required is an open mind . < br /><br />The movie centers around the Brian Jonestown Massacre . The Dandy Warhols have a role in the film , as the ' rival band , ' but they are second fiddle to the BJM . The Dandy Warhols do n't play as big of a role in the film as I originally guessed , but then again , they did n't have the element of excitement and unpredictability of the BJM.You ca n't help but be fascinated by the band and its very charismatic front man , Anton Newcombe . By itself , it 's an insightful film and study on the music industry . Just watch this film and enjoy .
1 DIG ! is funny , fun , amusing , interesting , stylish , and very well done . Knowing that it was made on such a shoestring budget over 7 years it is amazing that such a story can be told , especially with such style and substance . If you are a music fan or documentary fan this is a must see.<br /><br />Focusing on The Brian Jonestown Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols over the years is a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent band who meets with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to compromise and a genius megalomaniacal lead singer backed up by a varied cast of characters who sabotage their own success through drugs , alcohol , and insanity . If I did not know that this is footage of real people , I would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative scripted piece . The story is compelling , concise , and simply amazing .
1 The movie is about Anton Newcombe . The music and careers of the two bands are simply backdrop . It 's only fair that Newcombe have the last word about the film , which at this writing you can find in the " news " section at the brianjonestownmassacre website . I 'd link it here but IMDb wo n't permit it.<br /><br />Documentarians are limited by what the camera captures , as well as by the need to assemble a cohesive narrative from the somewhat - random occasions when chance has put the camera lens on a sight - line with relevant happenstance . In Dig ! , fortune smiled on the Dandy Warhols , capturing their rise to the status of pop - idol candidates , as they formed slickly - produced pop confections for mass consumption , most notably " Bohemian Like You , " a song that made them global darlings thanks to a Euro cell phone ad . < br /><br />No such luck for Brian Jonestown Massacre . The film captures little of what made the original BJM lineup great , with the sole exception of a single montage , lasting a minute or so , showing Newcombe creating / recording a number of brief instrumental parts , unremarkable in themselves , and concluding the sequence with a playback of the lush , shimmering sounds that had to have been in Newcombe 's mind and soul before they could enter the world.<br /><br />Three commentaries accompany the film ; one by the filmmakers , and two by the members of the bands ( the BJM track is solely former members , and without Newcombe ) . Both the Warhols and BJM alumni point up this montage sequence as the " best " bit in the film , and I 'd agree that , given the film 's focus on Anton Newcombe , it is the only part of the film that sheds proper light on his gift , and seems too brief to lend proper balance to this attempted portrait of the " tortured artist." < br /><br />Interesting thing about commentaries is that , unlike film , they are recorded in real time -- one long take -- which can be more honestly revelatory than a documentary that takes shape primarily through editing.<br /><br />The Dandies do not come off well in their comments . If the rock and roll world extends the experience of high school life for its denizens -- as I believe it does -- the Dandies are the popularity - obsessed preppy types , the ones who listen to rock because it 's what their peers do , while the BJM crew come off as the half - rejected , half - self - exiled outsiders ( to insiders like the Dandies , " losers " ) that are the real rock spirit . BJM 's Joel Gion , who talks a LOT , nails the film 's message for me when he says ( paraphrasing ) : " You ca n't forget that Anton has been able to do the only thing he ever said he wanted to do . Make a lot of great music." < br /><br />The Dandies , meanwhile , laugh too easily at every outrageous display in the course of Newcombe 's meltdown ( all the BJM footage here ends at 1997 , before Newcombe quit heroin ) . Courtney Taylor - Taylor 's discounting of Newcombe 's commitment to his vision is summed up as follows : " He 's 37 and still living in his car . You can download all his work at his website . He was so tired of being ripped off by everyone else , he 's giving it all away . He could be making a mint . " You can practically hear him shaking his head in disbelief.<br /><br />The film 's shortcomings ca n't be blamed on the filmmakers ; rather it 's the difficulties of the documentary form , and the loss of cooperation by the film 's subject , that makes this portrait of Newcombe so fragmentary . But it 's likely the best we will get , outside of his music.<br /><br />I only rented disc one , which has the feature . Most of the extras are on disc two . Not renting that , as I 've put in my order to buy the set .
1 Anton Newcombe and Courtney Taylor are friends , they both are the leads in their own respective bands ; Anton with The Brian Jonestown Massacre and Courtney with The Dandy Warhols . What 's interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals ; its a love hate relationship . At times you both hear them praising one another , but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are . While the Dandy Warhols went on the reach commercial success , BJM still was stuck in the underground scene ; and for good reason why.<br /><br />The focus of Dig ! is more towards Anton and the BJM , as they have a lot more substance . They are the most dysfunctional band . During gigs they will fight and bash each other . Anton will hit other members if he feels they are n't performing correctly . With the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume , fight was always waiting to happen . You know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens ; that 's why people would go to their gigs , for the fights . < br /><br />Anton is very unstable . Always thinking himself as a music messiah , he wants to change music and create a revolution , but he could never get out of the underground . He is a very talented musician , its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill . But his draw back is he ca nt escape the world he created ; a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs , alcohol and depression . On the other side , the Dandy Warhols were having their own troubles . They did n't find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label . But they found huge success in Europe . But Courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of Anton . Its interesting that both Anton and Courtney both had what the other needed . Courtney always wanted to be musically talented as Anton , though Anton would n't say it , he needed the commercial success that the Dandy 's had , to make his revolution.<br /><br />Over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands , there is a lot of footage . There is never a dull moment in Dig!. It is constantly moving along as it does n't have time to slow down as it has to much to say , seven years of story telling in the 1h 45mins is a hard job . Ondi Timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more . Even if you do n't like the bands it still deserves viewing ; it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure.<br /><br />You wo nt be disappointed .
1 To suggest Anton Newcombe of the Brian Jonestown Massacre could also use some therapy is putting it mildly . In Dig ! which won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance , we watch him and his band self - sabotage over seven years , while ex - friends and contemporaries The Dandy Warhols rise to comparative greatness ( a mobile phone advert , anyway).<br /><br />What elevates Dig ! above its contemporaries is the immense , near - biblical comic - tragedy being played out : a depressingly honest treatise on art versus commerce and compromise . For all his " look at me , I 'm a bloody genius " posturing , Newcombe is in fact revealed to be a singularly gifted , if immensely troubled , musician - far more talented than his rival , the Dandy 's Courtney Taylor who narrates the picture . If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper , Taylor 's Peter Fonda.<br /><br />Even sadder , Taylor appears to realise this , evinced by his weary , self - loathing voice - over : he knows his band won the battle - but at what cost ? In truth , they sold out , made Indie - Lite records , kept their teeth nice and clean , and probably brushed their hair twice before bedtime - thus winning record contracts and a large tour bus . And jettisoning all credibility in the process . Newcombe , on the other hand , lives in filth , is continually busted , beats up fellow band members on stage , kicks hecklers in the head - and is last glimpsed in Dig ! being ferried away by police , having lost the right to see his child.<br /><br />Two of the best films about rock 's subculture have been directed by women : Penelope Spheeris 's The Decline Of Western Civilization and this one  an instant classic the moment it was released .
1 I recently rented this doc , having remembered hearing about it from IMDb.com and being intrigued by the premise . I knew very little about either of these bands , but I do remember hearing " Not If You Were The Last Junkie On Earth " by The Dandy Warhols ages ago and enjoying it . That being said , this is my perspective on the doc:<br /><br />One thing I found incredible about this film is there is no need to have any prior knowledge of either of these bands . The director ( Ondi Timoner ) wastes no time in engaging the audience and familiarizing them with the people in this film . I quickly became grooved to the lives both Anton and Courtney as well as their respective bands , The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols . I think that is part of what makes this doc so good , and what makes Ondi Timoner such a master documentarian.<br /><br />I also loved how the " story " of these bands was told . Most of what you see is of the bands on tour . Both bands start out playing small venues and struggling to make it in the recording industry . Throughout the film , each band strives to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm . However it is this that makes the two bands similar , and thus the brilliant perspective on how two bands of a feather can go in such different directions.<br /><br />I would basically recommend this for ANYONE who likes film in general . You do not need to have a particular love for documentaries , or either of the bands . An appreciation for music helps , but the music itself takes a backseat to the love / hate relationship between The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols .
1 Anton Newcombe makes the film and he is the main subject . Watching him knock up a song if not a whole album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent . He thinks he is god but is so prollific and interesting . The DW are not really that interesting in comparison musicly or otherwise . " Hey , do you haver a drivers license ? " , Anton says to the cameraman , " Well lets go pawn this guitar ! " . Great use of archive/ home video material . Great to see rock docs still being made . A cool doc about the creative process . If you like this go see Nirvana Live ! Tonight ! Sold Out ! on DVD . A good experience Anton is this film . 8 out of 10
1 Although DiG ! was being hailed as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly fabricated . The director has misled the audience into believing the Brian Jonestown Massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post-'98 . And the rivalry between the Dandy Warhols and Jonestown has been milked . The truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film.<br /><br />That said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art . One of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene.<br /><br />Recommended mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands .
1 I first saw this film when I was flipping through the movie channels on my parents DirecTV . It was on the Sundance channel and was just starting . I love music , especially late 60s and this is what the BJM sounded like ( The Dandys are alright ) . Everything about the Brian Jonestown Massacre intrigued me from the music , to Anton and Joel 's personalities , to the illicit drug use . It was funny because as I was watching the first party scene when everyone is doing lines my parents walked by and decided to watch ( The look on their faces were priceless ) . Anyways this is definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to The Brian Jonestown Massacre who is now my favorite band of all time.<br /><br />just watch it ... seriously
1 Shot into car from through the windscreen , someone is playing someone else their latest song , someone else did n't react , according to the voice - over . I just wonder how that came to be made . There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered about how come a camera was there . If the scenes shot where the Warhols descended on a BJM post - party are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max , if not , then it was a total fabrication , either way it made me uncomfortable , if that was the purpose ? All the way thru this movie I kept wondering how the footage came about . Taken at face value , a nice portrait of the ( tortured ) genius we all believe ourselves to be .
1 Damn , was that a lot to take in . I was pretty much mesmerised throughout . It was pretty perfect , though I would say the editing had a lot to do with that . I ca n't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them ( Anton especially ) to get all of this footage without any serious ... beef . The Dandy 's did come off well - together , middle - class kids who took advantage of their situation ( and rightly so ! ) . I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton , which maybe was n't what a lot of other people felt . Great piece of film - making and great choice of subject(s ) . I recommend this to any music / film fan . You 'll probably learn something about film - making .
1 Dig ! I would say to anyone even if you do n't like Metallica to see ' some kind of monster ' it is a spinal tap type documentary about one of the biggest bands in the world acting like mental kids during a breakdown of sorts . It 's fun and fascinating . Along the same lines comes dig ! A film about ' the Dandy Warhol 's ' and ' the Brian Jonestown massacre ' two Portland bands who start off a kind of music scene in there home town only for one of the bands to become huge and one to fall by the wayside into the musical history books . Right from the start the two bands pull in opposite directions just on their ability to make decisions whether good or bad . Filmed over seven years and at times painful to watch we see the dandy 's meteoric rise to fame ( thanks to that vodaphone ad ! ) and the Jonestown seminal fall from scene instigators to bickering wannabes . As the bands become more disjointed the friendships are stretched tension tight and at several points snap into arguments and even on stage fights . All of this is half funny and half tragic and believe it or not is perversely watch able . Like I said at the beginning you can watch the Metallica film even if you have no interest in the band . Dig ! on the other hand is slightly different and is more enjoyable and a whole lot easier to watch if you have a passing interest in either band . Still a good film and more a testament to not be in a band than encouraging that as a career path . Dig ! Is a mad ride on rock and roll 's coat tails and a fine example of the pitfalls and pleasures of being or wanting to be famous .
1 I should admit first I am a huge fan of The Dandy Warhols , and that is the reason I came watching this film.<br /><br />The uniqueness of this film , compared to other modern rockumentaries , is that it 's not just about one page of a band 's history ( like " I Am Trying To Break Your Heart " , about Wilco ) , but rather covers long period of the band 's history . In this movie , director / producer Ondi Timoner closely followed friends / rivals The Brian Jonestown Massacre ( BJM ) and The Dandy Warhols ( DW ) for more than 8 years ( 1995 - 2003 ) and shoot tremendous 1500 hours of raw video , cut than to 1:45 hours ( the future DVD release will contain much more material than the original film ) . The result is astonishing - there are no fillers - the film is 100 % pure and genuine archive footage , which gives you feeling as film progresses that you live with the bands , through all these years.<br /><br />Both bands in the start of their careers promised to " make a revolution " in the music making , and not to sell their souls to the devil of " record industry " . However , their paths quickly diverged - The Dandy Warhols signed a contract with Capitol Records and became relatively popular ( especially in Europe ) after only one album , while The Brian Jonestown Massacre ( with its self - destruction - bound leader Anton Newcombe ) dissolved into oblivion ( at least how it is portrayed in the film ) . And the movie follows the descent of The Brian Jonestown Massacre , contrasted by the ascent of The Dandy Warhols.<br /><br />First , I was delighted by the movie and its approach of telling the story of Anton Newcombe ( for example , Courtney Taylor - the leader of The Dandy Warhols - narrates ) , but after some thinking I realized that something is wrong with this film.<br /><br />First , it treats Anton Newcombe as a disappeared person . The project started in 1995 as a documentary about several promising emerging groups , in which Anton Newcombe and Ondi Timoner were equal partners ( that was the reason why all these years Ondi Timoner had unmediated access to the both bands ) . It was Anton Newcombe who brought The Dandy Warhols into the project . In the end he was ignored completely , as if he was kicked out of the project . Everybody talk about BJM , but he does not take part in the discussion . I guess he was n't even informed when the group started the final editing process . There are always both sides of the story , and here we have only one ... Of course , as one would expect , Anton does not approve the final result and sees this movie as a betrayal of his former friends.<br /><br />Second , the film is very Dandy Warhols - biased . Sure , the winner takes it all , but the fact that Courtney Taylor ( leader of DW ) narrates ( even though it seems a good choice - it provides a feeling of seemingly closer involvement ) and that bands ' late history is represented nonproportionally ( BJM is covered till 1997 , and DW - till 2003 ) , does not add objectivity to the film.<br /><br />Third , the movie is ( somewhat ) shallow . What does it want to teach us ? As one critic said : " ... movie examines old questions : where does genius fit into a commodified world ? Can it thrive and get its due , or does it need to self - destruct to preserve its integrity ? " No , IT DOES NOT EXAMINE these questions ! It just depicts a story of a brilliant , but unsuccessful musician , narrated by a less brilliant , but successful one , who indulges in self - assurance and eternal coolness of an ego greater than mountain.<br /><br />Anyway , the movie was fun - it 's raw , it 's fresh , it 's stylish , it 's ... just god damn interesting , at least for the DW or BJM fans . For the rest of the crowd - I do n't know ...
1 I loved this film , at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage but I quickly got into it . There must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and I really admire the work done in cutting it down . If you 're easily shocked by drugs or violence it might not be the film for you but there are some great characters here , ( and some real tossers ) . Technically I liked it a lot too , they must have used a new de - interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but I was n't annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video to film transfers . ( Open Water drove me nuts , mostly because there are cheap , progressive cameras available now and I see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema ) . Sorry that 's my own little rant . I definitely recommend this film if you 've ever been involved with the music scene , it has some tragic moments but most of it is hilarious , I might be accused of laughing at others misfortune but it 's a classic piece .
1 At first I did n't like the movie cause of it being a Nazi swastika drama . But after buying it and seeing it , it was n't that bad . I heard so many complaints about the numbers being short and Ilse Werner not singing . Now I understand . The radio show was a super propaganda radio program . Ilse , Johanne and Zara plus Rudy Shruki and band like Kurt Widman and his Orchestra and Fud Cantics ex cetera never appeared in the radio show cause the singers and the bands were of the pop jazz and swing categories . The Club Foot had that regulated that for touring occupied areas for the soldiers to short wave radios for the soldiers also night clubs and hotels , in Berlin and Hamburg , and record sales only . This is why Ilse was n't allowed to sing in this picture . This would be made up by medium budget musical , Were making music , 1942 , in which she would demonstrate her whistling . But this is an excellent example propaganda . Inge and her aunt Eichhorn , played by Ida Wust , goes to the 1936 Olympics . The aunt forgets her tickets so Inge has to wait till her aunt comes back with the tickets . She meets Carle Radditz , who plays Herbert , who has an extra ticket . She goes with him and it 's love at first sight . they plan to marry but the Spanish war get in the way so he has to go on an assignment against the right side . Carl Raddatz as so many people complained about him was really handsome and not plain . When he did Opfergang and they put a mustache on him plus his own suntan that made him plain looking . You see the Nazi soldiers acting normal , like a scene in which a ex butcher and his troops are in France and they steal pigs from a farm and they are about to make lunch until their leader suggest to save the pigs . This reflect Adolphs animal rights extremism . The character was a butcher now soldier . This was a subtle put down against meat eating . Late on in world war 11 , Herbert is flying in a German airplane . We shoot one of the pilots so Herbert takes over . We shoot his plane . They crash . Unfortunately for us they survive . Another seen the Nazis soldiers go in a bomb Catholic church , now it 's putting the catholics down , and Hubert 's best friend Helmet , played by Joachim Brennecke starts to play the organ , Beethtoven , .More bombs come in from us . The church is bomb more the soldier continues to stay and play the organ he 's being told to leave . We end up injuring him . Propaganda message ? The catholic church organ cause him to become addicted to it . It injured him . See ? By this time Inge is with her either mother or grandma , played Hedwig Bleibteu , the same German Grandame actress who played Maria Holst 's Aunt in Weiner Blut . Well , later it comes to the short view of the radio show . This was not intended to be a musical revue , such as Kora Terry released that same year were as well As Rosen in Tirol , The music as well as their side of the war was so supposed to be only the back drop . It was mainly a war romantic movie . It 's easy to take a pot shot at those soldier in the movie but in real life many of those soldiers were being forced to fight the Nazi cause , cause of the job and the monthly pay that they would receive . After the war many of them who survive would regret it . This is a good swastika classic . The only problem is that today you have Neo Nazi and Nazi skin heads , who watched the same movies to reflect their Hitler worship and their . They have disturbing websites who exploit these film classics to raise money for their insanity . Be careful most of the time it 's the direct hate only classics . If their scenario looks like they are glorifying it , then its a Nazi website skip it .Go to IHF or German wartime films dot com , Amazon dot Dee or German video dot net . They are legitimate . 01/23/10 Mada a mistake it was n't Herbert 's friend that got killed at the church . It was Malte Yager 's character 's friend Schartzscop .
1 As a movie this barely rates a 4 but for movie fans of the 1940s period , it 's almost a must - see and rates a 9 as a variety show ! I was drawn to watch this by the presence of Richard ( Captain Midnight ) Webb who plays the Colonel in charge of the event . What surprised me was the stunning performance of Doris Day . Outside of ' Calamity Jane ' , I 've never seen her put over a song better than she does here . Randolph Scott is memorable as well , even if he does n't see much screen time . It 's been a while since I saw the movie but I was almost sure Humphrey Bogart put in an appearance . With so many familiar faces , it 's hard to keep track . If it ever turns up on a TV station near you , be sure to catch the Doris Day sequence , if nothing else!<br /><br / >
1 Starlift is a pleasant and interesting throwback to those all star musical pictures that every studio was putting out during the World War II years . When you 've got such stars as Gary Cooper , James Cagney , Doris Day , Gordon MacRae , and Randolph Scott , etc . , in the film and with such people as the Gershwin Brothers , Cole Porter , Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn supplying the music , it 's an easy to take film . And the plot is n't even in the way.<br /><br />What plot there is involves two Air Force enlisted men , Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy , trying to meet Warner Brothers starlet Janice Rule using as a gimmick the fact that both come from Youngstown , Ohio and Hagerthy 's father was Rule 's dentist as well as half of the town 's . The scheme works too well as Louella Parsons is soon putting them as an item in her column . Yes , Louella 's in the film as well . She must have liked Warner Brothers or Jack Warner catered to her more than the other studio bosses because she also used this studio to publicize her Hollywood Hotel radio program back in the day.<br /><br />But the rest of the plot also touched on the real life efforts of Ruth Roman also playing herself to get her studio and others to do shows at the Air Force bases for the servicemen and women going to Korea . Some of the names I 've mentioned and others sing and perform in a show at Travis Air Force Base where a lot of this film was shot.<br /><br />One specialty number was shot for the talents of Phil Harris who sing / narrates a ballad Look Out Stranger , I 'm A Texas Ranger aided and assisted by Virginia Gibson , Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper . Yup , Cooper looked like he was having a great old time kidding his image.<br /><br />This is the oldest of clichés when you say they do n't make them like this any more , but they really do n't because you do n't have a studio system that has all this talent under contract . That 's one thing about the demise of the old studio system we can mourn .
1 An absolutely brilliant film ! Jiri Trnka , the master of puppet animation , confronts totalitarianism in this , his final , film . It would be banned by the Communist Czechoslovakian government ( at the time ) , despite taking the country 's highest animation award.<br /><br />In this dark and entertaining short film , an artist attempts to create a new pot for his favourite plant . He happily makes his creations while dreaming that his plant will grow to be a beautiful rose . All of a sudden , he here 's a knock at the door , and in comes this giant omnipotent hand , that tries to force the artist to make statues in it 's likeness . The artist resists as best he can , but he eventually becomes overwhelmed by the constant attempts , by the hand , to force him to conform . He becomes brainwashed ; an intellectual zombie . At this point the hand attaches strings to the artist , puts him in a cage , and uses him to make hand statues . All the while glorifying the artist 's work and awarding him with medals and honours.<br /><br />The artist 's inner lust to be able to express himself freely is what helps him prevail over his indoctrination , and enables him escape his prison , whether it be literal or in his mind , and return to his home where he now must live in constant fear of the wrath of the omnipotent hand . He shuts himself in , thinking he is out of the reach of the almighty hand , but in the process he puts his plant and pot up high , hoping it is out of the reach of the hand , and it ends up falling on his head , killing him . The artist is inevitabally destroyed by his own creation . All because of the constant fear he had to live with once he escaped the hand 's strings . Once dead , the hand paints the artist as a great person , a national hero . Unfortunately not in the circumstances or for the reasons that the artist would like to be remembered.<br /><br />Trnka 's condemnation of Totalitarian society , and their lack of right for free expression is dark , damning and an amazingly animated . It is no wonder the government banned it as this is the sort of media that people admire , and would perhaps even listen to . That was obviously not acceptable . An amazing example of an artists civil disobedience and the impact it can have . And still quite relevant today for many parts of the world , from the US to the middle east . A must see and definite 10 out of 10 ! Talk about going out with a bang !
1 Jiøí Trnka made his last animated short an indictment of totalitarism , which caused him trouble in his native Czechoslovakia . The elements are few , the symbolisms simple , and his trademark ornaments almost absent here , allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fable . A man in his room dedicates to pottery and to take care of his only plant . But suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue of itself . The man refuses and he 's persecuted by the ominous gloved hand . In these days , where the impression of reality factor seems to be erased from most animations that try to replace the real world , it is refreshing to watch a film , which makes its technique part of the enjoyment .
1 I saw this film when I was a young child on television ( thank - you Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ) and had nightmares about it for years afterwards.<br /><br />Trnka was one of the mentors for Bratislav Pojar , one of Canada 's National Film Board 's best animators . Pojar was , in turn a mentor and collaborator for the great Drouin . If you like Trnka you should see " Night Angel".<br /><br />The symbolism is obvious , but deftly used . The oppositions of beauty and life ( the plant ) are placed in opposition with the anonymity of the gloved hand . The poor puppet hero is condemned despite a lack of political agenda.<br /><br />What I most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor . The small room where the action takes place is the character 's entire world . The invasion by the hand is a complete violation of that world.<br /><br />Beautiful and haunting film . I found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts by Trnka at the public library and showed it to my own kids . A must see .
1 My discovery of the cinema of Jan Svankmajer opened My eyes to a whole tradition of Czech animation , of which Jirí Trnka was a pioneer . His Ruka is one of the finest , most technically - impressive animated movies I 've ever seen.<br /><br />A potter wakes up and waters his plant . Then he goes about making a pot . But in comes the huge hand which crashes the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of itself . He casts the hand out , but soon it returns and imprisons him in a bird cage where he 's forced to sculpt a stone hand . He sets about it , fainting from exhaustion , but eventually completes the task.<br /><br />In a marvellous sequence of metacinema , the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings , which keep him in thrall , and he escapes back home . He shuts himself in and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on his head.<br /><br />This movie does n't hide the fact it 's pure animation , unlike modern movies that strive to be realistic ( why ? ) . The hand , for instance , is clearly someone 's hand in a glove . Everything else is clay . Strings are visible and are part of the narrative , making it a precursor of the movie Strings . The atmosphere is eerie : that hand going after the little potter managed to instill more dread in me than many horror movies combined.<br /><br />The movie is obvious but it avoids being totally manipulative for its simplicity . it 's a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny which ca n't help winning the heart and mind of anyone who holds freedom as a natural right .
1 Generally , I am not a huge fan of stop - motion films and at first RUKA did n't capture my attention . However , knowing that this film was made in the repressive Czechoslovakia during the Soviet - domination era , the more I watched the film , the more I realized just how subversive this innocent looking little film was . This subtext really made the film come to life and gives it real staying power as both a work of art and a political statement.<br /><br />The sad little film is done without any dialog , but it 's pretty clear what is happening . A cute little wooden man is making a clay pot and having a lovely time when suddenly a meddling animated hand appears and destroys the pot -- making it into a sculpture of a hand instead . Well , the wooden man tries again and again to chase away the hand and do his own thing . However , over time the hand becomes more and more insistent and eventually cages the man . And , by the end , the man is dead thanks to the meddling hand and the hand , in a sign of real hypocrisy , gives the man a hero 's funeral ! < br /><br />As I said , this film is an obvious attempt by the brave Jirí Trnka to criticize his domineering government . Not surprisingly , though Czechs loved the film and gave it critical praise , the state ( i.e. , the hand ) banned this little parable . Sadly , Trnka did not live to see his nation liberated a little more than two decades later during the co - called " Velvet Revolution " .
1 I researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the Post WWII Greenwich Village world of gays and lesbians . With the exception of Stewart and Novak , the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle . John Van Druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this Greenwich Village . I thought this was ironic because I first saw Bell , Book and Candle in the theater when I was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me . It was hard to get me to a movie that did n't include horses , machine guns , or alien monsters and I planned on being bored . But , I remember the moment when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak on the top of the Flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground . As the glorious George Duning love theme soared , I suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love . The first stirrings of romantic / sexual love left me dazed as I left the theater . I am sure I 'm not the only pre - adolescent boy who was seduced by Kim Novak 's startling , direct gaze . It 's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump - start heterosexual puberty in so many of us . I am in my late 50 's now and re - watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as I watched that hat touch down fifty years later . . .
1 Stewart is a distinguished bachelor and a successful executive who is about to marry his fiancée Janice Rule but instead gets involved with a capricious , sensual art dealer ( Kim Novak ) who turns out to be a Greenwich Village witch   Novak desires earnestly and intensely to love , but is unable to feel it ... <br /><br />Stewart slowly falls in love with her , and looks for a way to free her from her witch - spell ... Novak resents his well - intentioned concern , as does her Siamese cat , Pyewacket ... Still , Stewart continues in his attempts to change her into a loving , feeling woman as he aspires to marry her ... <br /><br />Also blocking his way are such talented supporting actors as Novak 's brother ( Jack Lemmon ) , a silly , charming sorcerer who can walk nonchalantly through walls ; a terrible author who is writing a book about witchcraft ; and the Head of the Association of Manhattan Witches , none other than the incredible Hermione Gingold ... <br /><br />Novak 's Aunt Queenie ( Elsa Lanchester ) , unlike her other relatives , is a tender witch who accepts that nothing should prevent the course of true love ... She aids and stimulates them in turning Novak into the woman of Stewart 's dreams , for a happy ending ... <br /><br />If you like to see a lightweight comedy about magic , fantasy and love ; beautiful cinematography ; stunning use of color ; and with an exceptional cast ; do n't miss this enjoyable and amusing movie 
1 This movie was like any Jimmy Stewart film , witty , charming and very enjoyable . Kim Novak 's performance as Gillian , the beautiful witch who longs to be human , is splendid , her subtle facial expressions , her every move and gesture all create Gillian 's unique and somewhat haunting character , she left us hanging on her every word . I should not fail to mention Ernie Kovacs ' and Elsa Lanchester 's highly commendable performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic(Kovacs ) and the latter as the lovable aunt who ca n't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to . The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is great , but then again when is the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady bad !
1 The play Bell , Book , and Candle was a favorite of mature actresses to do in summer stock and take on the road . One famous story , told by director Harold J. Kennedy , has Ginger Rogers insisting that her then husband , William Marshall , who was not an actor , costar with her . Marshall wore a toupee , and when he walked through a doorway , his toupee caught on a nail and stayed behind , dangling in the doorway as he walked on stage.<br /><br />The play was adapted successfully into a beautiful color film starring Kim Novak , James Stewart , Jack Lemmon , Elsa Lanchester , Hermoine Gingold , Ernie Kovacs , and Janice Rule . It 's light entertainment , about a normal - appearing family of witches ( Novak , Lemmon , and Lanchester ) and the publisher ( Stewart ) who lives in their building . The most expert of them is the sultry , soft - voiced Gillian , who would love to be normal . One night , with Stewart in her apartment , she puts a spell on him using her Siamese cat , Pyewacket , and he falls in love with her.<br /><br />"Bell Book and Candle " was filmed on a charming set that replicates New York . The movie is loads of fun . Jack Lemmon is very funny in a supporting role as Gillian 's brother , a musician in the witch and warlock - laden Zodiac Club . He uses his powers to turn streetlights on and off and to turn on the occasional woman . Janice Rule is perfect as the snobby ex - college rival of Gillian , now dating Stewart , and Ernie Kovacs has a great turn as an eccentric who is writing the definitive book on witches . Lanchester and Gingold , of course , are always wonderful , Lanchester Gillian 's daft aunt and Gingold as a sort of queen of witchcraft.<br /><br />Kim Novak is a good fit for Gillian , giving the character a detachment befitting a witch , showing emotion when it becomes appropriate , and with that voice , fabulous face , and magnificent wardrobe , she certainly is magical . Stewart , in his last foray as a romantic lead , costars with Novak as he did in Vertigo , and they make an effective team . He supplies the warmth , she supplies the coolness , and somehow , together they spark . In this , of course , he 's much more elegant than in " Vertigo . " A charming film , good for a Sunday afternoon , good around Christmas ( as part of it takes place at Christmastime ) , and great if you feel like smiling .
1 this is a wonderful film , makes the 1950 'S look beautifully stylish . Kim Novak is intriguing and compelling as a modern - day witch with one foot in Manhattan and another in infinity . All the supporting performances are terrific , from Jack Lemmon as her bother Nicky to Ernie Kovacs as the author of Magic in Mexico who is working on Magic in Manghattan , to Elsa Lanchester as the slightly batty as well as witchy Aunt Queenie . And then there is the cat- I have no idea how many witches ( besides me ) have named a cat Pyewacket but suggest a zillion . Jmes Stewart looks out of place , but only just as much as his character is out of p;ace in this weird sub - world of magic and witchcraft . Perfect . And it has the perfect romantic happy ending , which we believe in because movies of this vintage do have those happy endings . Gillian and Shep certainly have as much chance to be happy ever after as Rose and Charlie Allnut in The African Queen ( another great film )
1 Made in the same year as " Vertigo , " this is an equally bewitching movie , though in a much lighter vein . It 's set in an enchanted New York during the winter : Kim Novak is a witch who casts a spell over James Stewart , but gets caught in it instead . The interesting sidelight is that Novak 's rival is played by Janice Rule , who originated the part of Madge in " Picnic " on Broadway ( the part that Novak would make famous on film ) .
1 By some happy coincidence the same year that Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak made Alfred Hitchcock 's haunting masterpiece " Vertigo " , they also made this light comedy . Perhaps the two actors needed to do it after undergoing the heaviness of the Hitchcock film . At any rate this a great companion piece to " Vertigo " as it again explores a very un - likely but powerful romance . In fact the film can be seen as the flip side of " Vertigo " with it 's happy ending . Here again Novak undergoes a transformation , in Vertigo she essentially plays two women and here she ' transforms ' from witch to mortal . Stewart is again bewitched and for awhile tormented by his love for her . Unlike Vertigo the two come together in " Bell Book and Candle " , a perfect antidote for the Hitcock movie . Again the dynamics of love and attraction are examined but in an altogether different vein . The cast is terrific . Lemmon hilarious as Novak 's warlock brother and Elsa Lancaster giving a classic performance as the Aunt . Ernie Kovacs as the alcoholic cult writer and of course Hermoine Gingold playing Novak 's competitor are all great . The scene with Stewart drinking the potion is comedy at it 's best . Anyone who has seen Vertigo or even if you have n't should see this memorable light comedy .
1 The John Van Druten Broadway hit is brought to the screen with a maximum of star power in this romantic fantasy about a modern - day witch who beguiles a successful Manhattan publisher . James Stewart may get top billing , but it is Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most alluring witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen . The lead pairing is , in fact , one of the movie 's few weaknesses : the gray - haired Stewart seems a bit old for the role , and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for Novak , it 's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him , as they seem mismatched in temperment and outlook . ( It is one of the story 's amusing conceits that witches and warlocks are portrayed as Greenwich Village beatniks and bohemians . ) Curiously , the Stewart - Novak pairing would generate a lot more heat in " Vertigo " , released the same year as this film , but then " Vertigo " had a compelling suspense story , and the benefit of Alfred Hitchcock 's direction.<br /><br />The film 's comic moments are mostly provided by the stellar supporting cast , including a young Jack Lemmon ( as Kim 's warlock brother ) , Elsa Lanchester ( their ditzy aunt ) , and Ernie Kovacs ( ! ) as a befuddled writer . Hermione Gingold even shows up in a hilarious cameo as a sort of Grand Witch . There 's lots to like in this movie -- wit , romance , and a great cast -- that is , if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting Miss Novak . I have seen the movie a half a dozen times , and I never can .
1 As a Pagan , I must say this movie has little if any Magickal significance . It 's a " fun " witchcraft movie and not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest Magick of all , and never to use it in a controlling or vengeful way . That 's a lesson everyone needs to learn , not just Pagans.<br /><br />That having been said , this movie is wonderfully written and sweetly executed by Kim Novak and the venerable Jimmy Stewart.<br /><br />Hermione Gingold delivers a stellar performance as Bianca , Elsa Lanchester ( with too many movie credits to mention except as Ms. Jane Marbles of " Murder By Death " ) was wonderful as Ms. Novak 's absent - minded - yet - capable upstairs neighbor Queenie . Also starring Jack Lemmon ( wonderful performance ) and Jim Kovacs ( brilliantly witty).<br /><br />"Witches ca n't cry . Why , they ca n't shed a single tear because their heart is full of Magick . They do n't have time for silly things such as love . " Queenie.<br /><br />Gillian Holroyd ( Novak ) and her brother Nicky ( Jack Lemmon ) are Manhattan witches . Cloaked deeply within the secret underworld of those of the Craft , they live among other New Yorkers as one of them , without so much as causing a raised eyebrow . < br /><br />But then , along comes Shepherd " Shep " Henderson ( Stewart ) , a steadfast , no - nonsense , dedicated businessman who is engaged to be married to Gillian 's old college rival . < br /><br />By a quirky mishap of chance , he finds himself moving into Gillian 's building and is instantly " bewitched " by her charm and grace . By the use of Magick , with a little help from Pyewacket ( Gillian 's familiar , trained by Robert E. Blair ) and Queenie , Gillian begins to work on this handsome new dream man to get back at her old enemy.<br /><br />But Magick should never be used to control , nor to hurt , and Gillian learns that the hard way in the most bittersweet way . Not only does she have to face what she 's done , but she has to face Shep in her guilt . < br /><br />From the critical perspective ; however , the movie takes a serious turn : The effects are very dated to the point of being pure camp . Some of the scenery was seemingly shot in the basement of someone 's small home , but at least the characters were quirky and fun.<br /><br />On a personal note , Pyewacket steals the show . Great cat ! Great training by Robert E. Blair . < br /><br />As a Note of Trivia , this is the roots for the beloved Bewitched television sitcom . This introduces the original Samantha and Darrin . All the characters of note are present and accounted for . You have but to look , to see it for yourself.<br /><br />This is one of my favorites , and I watch it often.<br /><br />This movie gets a 9.1/10 from ... <br /><br />the Fiend : .
1 Bell , Book and Candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid - twentieth century , very similar to the phenoms we see today ( back in the 70 's - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film ) . It made Novak a huge star , put a nice item on Jack Lemon 's resume , cast new light on Jimmy Stewart , and gave Lancaster and Gingold new avenues to explore in their careers ( both went on to continue to play witches and other curious " old bats " , in film and television).<br /><br />Along with the 40s movie I Married a Witch ( which helped to make Veronica Lake an icon ) , Bell , Book and Candle inspired the grand film and TV fascination with all things witchy that began with Bewitched and has continued through Practical Magic , Worst Witch and Harry Potter.<br /><br />What I rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather interesting alternative Xmas movie . The story takes place over the Christmas holidays , and , despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft , actually embodies a great deal of Xmas spirit ( giving , love , family , self - sacrifice , etc).<br /><br />I will always watch this movie ( have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90 's ) particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season . It has style , substance , a great cast , and terrific production values . And like Adam 's Rib , it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time , are radical even now ( in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful ) , and so always seems ahead of the times .
1 this may not be War & Peace , but the two Academy noms would n't have been forthcoming if it were n't for the genius of James Wong Howe ... <br /><br />this is one of the few films I 've fallen in love with as a child and gone back to without dissatisfaction . whether you have any interest in what it offers fictively or not , BB&C is a visual feast.<br /><br />I'm not saying it 's his best work , I 'm no expert there for sure . but the look of this movie is amazing . I love everything about it ; Elsa Lanchester , the cat , the crazy hoo - doo , the retro - downtown - ness ; but the way it was put on film is breathtaking.<br /><br />I even like the inconsistencies pointed out on this page above , and the " special effects " that seem backward now . it all creates a really consistent world .
1 What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archaeology and mermaid worshipping cults ? Tobe Hooper tries to answer that question in one weird little film.<br /><br />Genie is a young cutie who visits her nerdy archaeology father in Alexandria , Egypt . Genie gets caught up with a mysterious hooker ( and blatant lesbian ) who services daddy on the side . Daddy gets sent back to the site , where he uncovers a tomb with what appears to be a mermaid on it . Genie meets a descendant of the Marquis de Sade , and falls for a hunky Egyptian ( providing the film 's hottest scenes ) . Eventually , Genie finds out she is to be a sacrifice and the protracted and bloody climax gets going . Wrapped around this story is footage of the Marquis de Sade in prison , talking to a portrait of what looks like Genie.<br /><br />Robert Englund is terrific as both the Marquis and his descendant . His acting abilities have always been sideswiped by his makeup requirements , so he is allowed to shine here . His best performance is still in " Killer Tongue , " if you have not seen that yet.<br /><br />The rest of the cast , including young Genie , are pretty and average . The script , however , is problematic . You will quickly learn that the Marquis scenes are completely unnecessary , except maybe the film makers had access to the cool set . The mermaid cult that eventually saves Genie makes no sense whatsoever . Who the mermaid is is never explained , and its link to Christianity ( which is hyped throughout the film ) is nothing . The film is very anti - Christian , as the archaeologist is a Bible spouting father , but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute . There are plenty of scenes of depravity and violence , but Hooper probably had little idea of what the screenwriters were trying to say . I know I have no idea.<br /><br />So why am I recommending this film ? It is weird . There is an extended sex scene . For the ladies , hunky Egyptian rides a horse completely nude . Englund is marvelous . Do you like snakes ? This film is full of them . This is like Roger Corman with a bigger budget . Knowing Hooper somehow came up with " Crocodile " after this is rather sad . " Night Terrors " is not perfect , but definitely worth a winking , unserious look.<br /><br />This is rated ( R ) for physical violence , some sexual violence , gore , profanity , female nudity , male nudity , sexual content , sexual references , and drug abuse.<br /><br / >
1 In what appears an attempt to mix drama and comedy , Manuel Gomez Pereira made this film , ' Things that make life worthwhile . " It is not an original discovery , by many voice you have ( quite off the pitch , by the way ) , but it departs somewhat from the norm in the Spanish cinema . The downside is that the elements forming the film are poorly combined , and while some points are not well developed , others are out of place . A day in the lives of two people close to the median age . It 's basically what the movie Gómez Pereira . Jorge ( Eduard Fernandez ) is a stationary ( parado ) one which , despite load on your back with a drama major , seems willing to see things change . Only this explains his commitment to a minor could mean a turning point in its existence . In line with Audrey Tautou of ' Long dating ' ( Jean - Pierre Jeunet , 2004 ) , Jorge says things like this to herself : " if I find a coin before the corner that is now going to change my luck . " Of course it finds it , begins to play ' Today could be a great day ' ( Hoy puede ser un gran dia)by Joan Manuel Serrat and in a few crosses on its way Hortensia ( Ana Belen).She is another woman entry age , divorced and a little lonely . Take valeriana for sleeping , organizes birthday parties as an exemplary mother , said her belief in God and leads to a speed of homicidal mother . Hortensia is a woman of many contradictions in his behavior , life was going in his head driving data as " 70 % of people fall in love only once in a lifetime " and said although it is short of Jorge and unemployed and does not preclude the possibility that it is a " sadistic " sleeping in his shoulder in the cinema at the earliest opportunity . Later came a communion , a dance in the luxurious wedding banquet , the back of a car and other things that players seem to live unique experiences like that but end up doing quite heavy for the viewer . ' Things that make life worthwhile ' debate between us is the drama of two adult persons who have no other that leads them to see where their strange relationship and , conversely , make us take the case as a comedy , focusing on things like a Chinese singing at a wedding ( which seem to be amusing in itself ) or the gait of a drunk person . The problem is that it does not leave us time to connect with the players , therefore we can not identify with the dramatic , and not give us a solid base comic too , leaving everything except pure joke . In the end , all mixed in a way that the viewer no longer know very well whether to laugh or mourn , and ends up not doing either . And it is true that something is not seen a thousand times , is not the kind of film that we find to bend every corner , but it is not sufficiently different or special as we want to do . Ana Belén ( which apparently far less than the 53 years that has in this film ) and Eduard Fernandez are two actors who are very enjoyable to see working , but this time it seems ready or comfortable enough in scenes that require him to break the calm that prevails in the film , so in moments like the " accident " with the children of the bar thing seems to be slipping from their hands . Perhaps a very dramatic change that has to do , but that is no excuse to lower our guard . In any case , both interpreters are erected easily the highlight of the function . ' Things that make life worthwhile ' work only up to the modest level of entertainment . Any claim that is beyond that point has not been fulfilled , as a romantic comedy or dramatic as that , we presume , they wanted to do , can not afford to have little moments finished successful ( beyond bad ) as that in which one of the characters talk and laugh , lost drunk , compared to a boy who remains in a coma in part because of him . Neither do much for people like Rosario Pardo , making the typical friend launched whose biggest contribution to the film is the phrase " must be screwed over , " and songs from the soundtrack , though significant , not just fit . It is true that the film by Manuel Gomez Pereira has its hits ( some of the moments involving Jose Sacristan ) , but the whole is a anodyne Story , a film with good intentions and a nice result when the better .
1 Gómez Pereira is the responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of latest Spanish cinema ( just take a look at his curriculum vitae ) , so I did n't expect that much of " Cosas Que Hacen ... " ... In fact I do n't know why in the world did I decide to watch it . Anyway , I just did ... And what a surprise . It looks that Gómez Pereira has finally matured and now he 's capable of making a good movie . He 's last work deals with the midlife crisis , the disappointing , and the seeking for a second chance after you 've ruined it all . The last half hour of the movie ( the more dramatic ) is the best part , and it just makes worth watching the film . Also we have Eduard Fernandez playing the main role , and I keep on thinking he 's the best actor of his generation ( by far).<br /><br />*My rate : 7/10
1 Yesterday , I went alone to the cinema , because here in Mexico , most of the times movies from other countries are part of the so called " camára alternativa " ( alternative camera ) . But after I saw this movie , I realized that not all the foreign movies are alternative . Afortunately , this is a good a example . But I have to said that I enjoyed so much this movie .. that at the end I was happy .. this movie is a little spoon of hope in these days . And the main lesson for me .. is that at the end of the day ... the love is main force behind us . This is a good option to see a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to mention the good music .. specially the main song of the movie .. Cosas que hacen que la vida valga la pena .... Excellent song ! ! !
1 Action , horror , sci - fi , exploitation director Fred Olen Ray shows he has some talent as a director . Character actor William Smith is one of the best tough / bad guys in the industry . He treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career . As for Randy Travis he gives his best Lee Van Cleef impression . He 's not bad in the film . Smith and Travis make the movie . As for the rest of the cast none of them really stand out . Ray did a great job directing this flick , Smith and Travis were good , I 'd give this B western on a scale of one to ten(ten being the best ) a seven .
1 I feel this is one of the best movies I 've seen , I'm an older male and love most westerns . I love movies based in part at least on facts , If I am not mistaken this is such a movie . I also like revenge type movies , This qualifies there as well in my opinion . Some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the whipping and the barn shooting scene . I felt the corral beating scene was a little overkill but did not affect how I feel about the complete movie . I saw what I think is a continuation of this movie in a gun smoke episode . I also enjoyed that . I recommend taking the time to watch this movie , I will watch it again . I also felt the romance parts of this movie were well played . I thought it was so out of character for Randy Travis to play a villain type , but I always enjoy his acting .
1 STAR RATING : * * * * * The Works * * * * Just Misses the Mark * * * That Little Bit In Between * * Lagging Behind * The Pits < br /><br />Mike Atherton ( Dudikoff ) is peacefully making his way in the Wild West when he spots a group of men mistreating a lady . Being a gentleman , he naturally steps in and puts a stop to this and in doing so kills the son of a nasty enforcer . This is just the beginning of a all guns blazing battle to the finish from which there will be only one winner.<br /><br />M Dudikoff is an action star who 's never truly managed to take off with me . Maybe I discovered him too late and after the other film I saw with him in it last Monday , The Human Shield , it was just another Dud ( ha ha ) added to the list . But I have a thing for westerns , being films that just sort of transport me to a different time and place and provide real escapist entertainment and with this Dudikoff has picked one of his better scripts , as his films go anyway.<br /><br />The film hits a few low points in the shape of a naff central villain , sounding like a blank Marlon Brando and some generally ropey acting from some of the cast , along with the obligatory cheap looking sets . But if , for some strange reason , your life ever depended on watching a Dudikoff film , this would be one of your best choices . * * *
1 " The Shooter " was a different type of film for Michael Dudikoff . Although normally associated with action flicks that incorporate martial arts , this film , because it was a western , enabled him to display that he is a far more capable actor than certain formula story lines have allowed.<br /><br />The major problem , of course , is that the film does not allow any solid character development . The fleshing in is really left to the viewer . We can only guess at the sadness that has made the Shooter , whose real name is Michael Atherton , the killer that he is- a killer , mind you , that a little town , terrorized by a local bully , welcomes as a hero who can release it from its misery .
1 Hare Rama Hare Krishna was the biggest hit movie of 1971 . Filmed almost entirely in Kathmandu , the capital of Nepal , the movie depicts not only with the theme of a broken family , but also a relationship between a brother and a sister , as well as drugs and the hippie movement , which made many people think that it involved the ISKON - the movement for Krishna consciousness.<br /><br />The movie begins with scenes of drugs and being informed that the woman dancing in front is the narrator 's sister . Going back to the past the brother and sister are happily playing around the house only to hear their parents arguing . This soon leads to a split in the family . The brother goes with the mother and the sister with the father.<br /><br />As years pass , the brother goes in search of his sister and is informed that she no longer lives with the father and that she has moved to Nepal . Here , Prashant , the brother not only finds love , but he also finds his sister , Janice . But he finds out that she is not only in the wrong company of friends but is also on drugs as she wants to block all memory of her past . With help of Shanti , his love , the brother tries to get his sister away from all this but has to overcome many obstacles , including people who stoop to all sorts of levels to stop him This is a multi cast movie and is led by the director and producer himself , Dev Anand and also stars Zeenat Aman ( her first movie ) , Mumtaz , Rajendranath , Prem Chopra , Jnr Mehmood , A.K. Hangal and Achala Sachdev . The music is superbly provided by the late R.D. Burman , whose last score was " 1942 - A Love Story . " During the filming , Dev Anand asked Panchamda ( R.D. Burman ) to compose something special for this film . Days later Panchamda came back with the composition of " Dum Maro Dum . " The song was an instant hit .
1 We do not come across movies on brother - sister relationship in Indian cinema , or any other language or medium . This relationship has several aspects which have not been exploited in movies or novels . Typically , a sister is depicted as a pile - on who can be used for ransom in the climax . This movie treats the subject in an entirely different light.<br /><br />It is inspired by George Eliot 's novel " The Mill on the Floss " . The brother is very prosaic , all - good , the blue - eyed boy who is a conventionally good son and a favorite with his mother . The sister is romantic , wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of the society . In spite of this , the love of the brother - sister is the winner.<br /><br />This movie is about the love of the two siblings who are separated in childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later . It is also the quest of the subdued brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to defy the world.<br /><br />Although the movie and the novel are set about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries , yet the sentiments are the same and still hold true .
1 This one grew on me . I love the R.D. Burman music and in spite of the cruder elements of the story I found much to be moved by as I kept re - watching the movie . The brother - sister plot line is powerful , I thought ; there 's also more probably obligatory stuff , like bar fights , a loony crime story , etc . that are just distracting . ( Though not unfunny from a certain point of view . ) Also the English translation is definitely by someone for whom it was a bit of a stretch , and as loony as it is I am grateful to him for doing it.<br /><br />Like many of the Bollywood movies I 've seen , this one is melodramatic and opera - like , including here notably a song sung first by a little boy to cheer up his abused and unhappy sister , and then the same song sung 12 or so years later by the man who has travelled to Kathmandu seeking to re - connect with this girl , grown up and troubled ( she had been told her brother and mother were dead ) , numbing her pain with drugs.<br /><br />A super thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement , which brought hordes of seekers to India , from an Indian point of view , that sees them as people driven to India by a spiritual hunger aroused by the failings of their own societies , but nonetheless , in India , living only for the pleasures of the moment . The hippie singing - dancing - drugging scenes are truly wonderful , and accurate in their tone ( I 'm old enough to remember ) , and I feel pretty sure that the masses of young white zoned - out kids are actual hippie extras , as I remember hearing about kids on the caravan to the East getting this kind of work in Bollywood.<br /><br />(It is not about the actual Hare Krishna movement , though the movie hippies sing a Krishna / Rama chant , as do a group of actual Indian devotees , unrelated to the hippies , in the opening scene of the movie.)<br /><br />~Virginia
1 The story for Hare Rama Hare Krishna actually came to Dev Anand 's mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in Kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his previous Prem Pujari in Calcutta . He was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt Prem Pujari 's posters . But the life of hippies re ignited a story in Dev 's mind to be made into a film.<br /><br />This was Dev Anand 's perhaps best directorial effort . The film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and Zeenat Aman as Dev 's sister made a tremendous impact.<br /><br />This film was Dev Anand 's call to the nation to keep up their moral values.<br /><br />It is about a Montereal based Indian family and the brother 's role is a very affectionate one for his sister . But the parents quarrel and separate leaving Prashant(Dev ) with mother and Jasbir(Zeenat ) with father . She is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she eventually believes that she will never see Prashant again.<br /><br />She is ill treated by her step mother and she runs away from home . Dev grows up to be a pilot and he learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with certain hippies.<br /><br />To reunite with his sister , Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti(Mumtaz ) who was to later marry him and also Janice who in reality is Jasbir with a new name and new identity . She has forgotten her childhood and Dev too.<br /><br />Dev has to get his sister back amongst all other happenings which include his being suspected as a thief in Kathmandu and the people are after his life.<br /><br />This was a story well directed and acted - both by Dev Anand . We see more of Zeenat Aman than of Mumtaz . But the music by Rahul Dev Burman was well composed . Dev had first offered the music to be composed by Sachin Dev Burman but Burman Da did not want Dev to do the film . He was very close to Dev and his earlier film Prem Pujari , though was good , but had been opposed in Calcutta . Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter subject as he thought hippie cultist film might reignite people 's anger against Dev . But Dev continued with the film reassuring Burman Da and the film was indeed a success.<br /><br />R D Burman had Asha Bhosle sing the award winning Dum Maro Dum . Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good number.<br /><br />Overall it is a good film .
1 This is one of the movies of Dev Anand who gave great yet distinct movies to Hindi movie industries such as Jewel thief and guide . The story is short ( if you ask me what is the story ) , plot is simple- a brother seeks for his lost sister . Sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant Hare Rama hare Krishna . Yet the movie portrays few of the significant events that the world experienced in 70's . Hippie culture , their submission to drugs , freedom , escaping duty , family , and adopting anything new such as eastern ( which was new for whites ) religion . They have been handled perfectly . Zeenat gave her best and Dev as usual was remarkable . Songs are the best used ( unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs ) in this movie . They have not been spoiled . One perfect example is ' Dekho o deewano ... Ram ka naam badnam na karo ' . Each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful . The end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie . Overall Devji who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here . A must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful Nepal of 70 's .
1 One must admit , that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent . He gave a break to Zeenat Aman , a successful model , and also former winner of beauty pageant 's title , by casting her in a role , which was tailor - made for her debut . Her bespectacled , stoned look , and her swaying at the hypnotizing music , made her an instant darling of the viewers . This movie is a treat to the eyes , with it 's scenic locales , ethnic people , those Buddha temples , and chirpy , naughty Mumtaz , who looks quite attractive , in her ethnic wear , and dancing skills . Dev is of course , adorable , and this is one of his commercially successful performance . Hare Rama manages to keep the interest going , with it 's carefully written script , editing , and captivating music . Like Des Pardes , his another movie , Anand has handled the topic of youngsters falling in the habit of drug addiction , and the theory of them coming from disturbed families , and troubled childhood , is quite plausible . A good entertainer , this movie retains it 's freshness till date !
1 Dev Anand ( or Prashant ) and Zeenat Aman ( Jasbir / Janice ) are siblings brought up in single parent families . Jasbir ( the sister ) grows up in an affluent environment but this is not enough to lead her to reject her life and ultimately join a hippie movement that eventually leads her to drugs . Prashant ( the brother ) on the other hand grows up in a less affluent environment but grows up to be a matured gentleman . The story marks Prashant making efforts to save his little sister ( who is perpetually in a trance ) from a hostile hippie environment . This movie stands the test of time , commenting that cults and hippie groups are a place for those who give up on their lives when they should instead stand up and be counted in the face of adversity . Great music compositions in this movie that mean different things in different situations and to different people , and the director brings forth an eerie feeling to it .
1 I 've read countless of posts about this game being so similar to Max Payne , when i played it the first time i thought it was a bit weird arcade - like game with a desire to rip - off the Max Payne style ( not just bullet - time ) . So when i played it for a couple of hours i realized how much fun it is ! and how different from " Max Payne " , yeah the bullet time is a bit similar but i think it fits differently to the game - style . This game is non - stop action - a mix between a shoot'em up and a fight'em up , so much fun , as a big fan of Max Payne i must say that the storyline of DTR is not near to the greatness of Max Payne , the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same , but if you want a bit more of that " bullet - time " you should definitely own this game .
1 Dead To Rights is about a Police Officer named Jack Slate who finds his murdered father and goes after the man that he thinks killed him . Jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father.<br /><br />Several months later on the day Jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who framed him for murder . Jack 's search leads him through a trail of * beep * that does n't end until everyone is dead.<br /><br />Through out the game Jack uses weapons from M4 Carbines to his dog Shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels . The game play is basically " kill 30 people , find switch to open door.kill 50 people , find switch to open door " over and over until the level is done . There are fun mini games too like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a Night Club so Jack can get to another area in the club , or bomb disarming.<br /><br />Dead To Rights is also a hard game . You will be put in an area swarming with bad guys armed with Sub Machine Guns while you only have a pistol . Near the end of the game skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck.<br /><br />Dead To Rights is as gory as it is hard . If you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun blood will splatter on the walls , ceiling and floor . And since there are several guys in each area the walls will be painted in blood.<br /><br />Family fun for everyone .
1 B Movie ? Yes . DIY ? Yes . First Movie ? Yes . But Aestheically A+ . This movie definitely had some bad sound / editing / lighting / acting / etc . etc . problems . However , this movie has many positive things about it . First off , the most annoying character dies first ! Second , its made to be a parody / funny B Rated Horror movie . The comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling around on the floor laughing.<br /><br />The problem is a lot of people try to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece . Take it for what it is , a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie . For what it is , just that , it is really good .
1 This is actually a groovy - neat little flick , made on absolutely no discernible budget with shot on video crinkliness . It takes a little while to warm up to it . The acting is so bad that it soon acquires a zen - like charm . After a few scenes , you stop noticing the awkward lines or rehearsed sound of some deliveries . The characters all develop a quirky charm , especially " Richard " . Forget Anthony Hopkins , Maidens is the guy I 'd hire to play a raving psychopath . He just seems to enjoy it so very much ! Mixed in with the scenes of mad - slasher gore and zombie infestation are some truly visually effective shots of the title character , " The Midnight Skater " zooming through the campus in a black hoodie , looking for all the world like a cross between the Grim Reaper and , say , The Silver Surfer . These shots make the sometimes ludicrous things the characters say about the Skater seem almost ominous . The soundtrack features some very fun Garage - Punk tunes and the raspy , raucous meanness of it meshes well with the film 's mood . Thumbs upish , I say .
1 Kimi wa petto is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is outside her apartment one day . She decides to bring him in and fix his cuts . She then leaves a note for him to eats some food she made then go home because she had to go to work . When she gets home however she finds that he is still there . He tells her that he wants to live there with her like a brother or cousin . In desperation to get him to leave she tells him that if he became her pet then he could stay . And as a pet she says that he would have no rights and do whatever she told him . ( not in that perverted way ! ) To her surprise he agrees and from then on he is known as Momo , her pet .
1 I do n't give a movie or a show ten very often but this show touched a nerve in a way no other show has . I found the entire series on mysoju.com and thought the premise looked interesting so I took a look see . I was n't disappointed in what I saw ; I was moved . This story stays on the tender side as the main characters move us through the scenes . Sumire Iwaya , played thoughtfully by Koyuki , shows us human nature as she wants to keep troubles from being shown . No one really wants to lay their soul out in front of a perspective mate . So instead she substitutes a human , played by an adorable Matsumoto Jun , as a pet . This pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet . The difference ; he can retaliate in the same way , after all Momo is a man , not a dog . As he is treated like a pet , he reacts to situations how a dog might react . She spends time with the new boyfriend , Momo gets jealous . It 's when she realizes that her pet is n't just a pet that the sexual tension between the two starts to become thick - Momo is a dance prodigy . Her thinking slowly changes as we start to get a glance at his own thoughts . Matsumoto takes us from seeing a character who is very one dimensional in the beginning , to two dimensional when we see he 's a dancer , to a three dimensional character when we see him start to fall for his master as a man , not as a dog . In my opinion , it 's worth watching this story just to see this character develop . Plus Matsumoto plays Momo with such tenderness you almost start to wish you had one too . Neither wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change , but as Momo ( the name she gives him as one would name their new puppy ) states  we both knew this was n't going to be able to last . Watch this show with a open mind , it 's worth it .
1 I first encountered this show when I was staying in Japan for six months last year . I found it in the internet when I was looking for sub - titled dramas to help me with my Japanese . My host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird , but I found it delightful ! Koyuki showed such conflicting character traits and Matsujun 's spirit made my day every time I tuned in ! I first saw him on " Hana Yori Dango " , but I liked him much better in this!<br /><br />Although the characters are interesting and well - developed , I was disappointed to find that they did n't change very much throughout the show . Their relationship grew , but they did n't really . Still , a fun time had by all ( Even for Fukushima ! ) .
1 It holds very true to the original manga of the same name , aka ( Tramps Like Us in the U.S ) but it can still be enjoyed even if you have n't read the manga . It 's a different kind of tail , showing a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone else . However , because of her outward strength , she fears showing her inner feelings and thus let 's those around her hurt her with their blunt comments . The only one who truly figures her out and who she can be at ease with is her new pet ... human ... Momo . If you want something different than the normal boring stuff with some wonderful J - Dorama ( Japanese Drama ) actors / resses then this is definitely the series to watch ... and read !
1 Let 's start this review out on a positive note -- I am very glad they did n't decide to wimp out with Tony being shot and do a retrospective season like some people were rumoring . Actually , creator and writer of this episode David Chase did quite the opposite . We do n't actually know if Tony will live or die . He 's in a coma and his chances of recovering are very slim to none . This episode seemed to move very slow , and the coma induced dream Tony was in involving mistaken identity and robed Asian monks slapping the sh*t out of him was absolutely , flat - out weird . After 45-minutes I got a little sick of everyone grieving , but that shouldn ' t be a reason to slam this episode . It was a weird and unpredictable episode , but it was still well - written and intense . Edie Falco gave an astounding career - defining performance in this episode as the conflicted wife having to face with her husband 's could - be demise . I also found it interesting AJ dropped out of school and swore a vendetta against Junior , which AJ most likely wo n't have the balls to pull off . Silvio is now acting - boss which opens numerous doors to problems in later episodes . There were a lot of great quips in this episode , also , and I think Vito ' Pole - Smoker ' Spadafore may meet his demise if he keeps being a greedy S.O.B.<br /><br />This was n't a great episode and disappointed only because even though Tony kills people , we as an audience adore him and feel he is our hero of the show . This was a necessary episode for the series , even though it was a little snore inducing towards the conclusion . Kudos to Edie Falco 's performance , and David Chase and the writers for creating this wholly original and unpredictable plot twist . This is the only season of ' The Sopranos ' where I have n't a f*cking clue where it is going to go . I ca n't wait for next week 's episode . My Rating : 7.5/10 < br /><br />Best Line of the Episode : ( Paulie to AJ ) : " Let 's go , Van Helsing ! "
1 Okay , I did n't get the Purgatory thing the first time I watched this episode . It seemed like something significant was going on that I could n't put my finger on . This time those Costa Mesa fires on TV really caught my attention- and it helped that I was just writing an essay on Inferno ! But let me see what HASN'T been discussed yet ... <br /><br />A TWOP review mentioned that Tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator . Yeah , 7 is a significant number for lots of reasons , especially religious , but here 's one more for ya . On a hunch I consulted wikipedia , and guess what Dante divided into 7 levels ? Purgatorio . Excluding ante - Purgatory and Paradise . ( The stuff at the bottom of the stairs and ... what Tony ca n't get to . ) < br /><br />On to the allegedly " random " monk - slap scene . As soon as the monks appeared , it fit perfectly in place with Tony trying to get out of Purgatory . You can tell he got worried when that Christian commercial ( death , disease , and sin ) came on , and he 's getting more and more desperate because Christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him . By the time he meets the monks he 's thinking " hey maybe these guys can help me ? " which sounds like contemplating other religions ( e.g. Buddhism ) and wondering if some other path could take him to " salvation " . Not that Tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a Buddhist , but it appears Finnerty tried that ( and messed up ) . That slap in the face basically tells Tony there 's no quick fix- as in , no , you ca n't suddenly embrace Buddhism and get out of here . < br /><br />Tony was initially not too concerned about getting to heaven . But at the " conference entrance " , he realizes that 's not going to be so easy for him . At first I saw the name vs. driver 's license problem as Tony having led sort of a double life , what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people . He feels free to have an affair with quasi - Melfi because " he 's Kevin Finnerty " . He figures out that he CAN fool some people with KF 's cards , like hotel receptionists , but it wo n't get him out of Purgatory . Those helicopters- the helicopters of Heaven?- are keeping track of him and everything he does.<br /><br />After reading all the theories on " inFinnerty " , though , it seems like KF 's identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths Tony could 've taken in his life . Possibly along with the car joke involving Infiniti 's that made no sense to me otherwise . Aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out .
1 With the badly injured Tony in an induced coma , two things happen : Tony imagines himself leading the life of a salesman attending a business convention , while his family and friends go through hell trying to cope with the possible loss of the big man . The dream sequences are right out of an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode , as Tony finds himself transformed into an Average Joe trying to deal with a missing wallet and mixed - up identities while on a cross - country business trip . His intonation as a blazer- and khaki - wearing schnook is more mid - American and less that of an Italian thug from Noo Joisey . A nice touch . The shockingly long - haired , hippy - dippy AJ ( whom Paulie calls " Van Helsing " at one point ) has a nice scene with his comatose old man . The best moment has the big boys trying to talk about life without Tony , which immediately breaks down into a territorial dispute . Vito gets off a line about the new - dead Gene possibly having been a closet case , which is interesting in light of what we are about to learn about Vito .
1 Let me start off by saying that after watching this episode for the first time on DVD at 10 o'clock P.M. one night , I could not fall asleep until about 3:00 A.M.<br /><br />This brief review may contain spoilers.<br /><br />I'm a long - time fan of The Sopranos and I can safely say this is the best episode I 've seen . I 'm not saying everyone should feel this way , but I do . This episode is identical to the weekend I spent with my family , watching over my own father , comatose in the ICU before he passed.<br /><br />The episode begins with Tony in an alternate reality : he is a salesman who 's identity has been mistaken for that of a man named Kevin Finnerty.<br /><br />By the time ten minutes had gone by , I knew either Tony was dreaming , or I was watching some other show . It was n't like the normal Sopranos and I loved it.<br /><br />Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony ( or " Kevin " ) looks into the sky at a " helicopter spotlight " and we see prodding through it , a doctor with a flashlight . We see this only for a moment and the sequence plays out until we go back to real life in a situation similar to the one I just stated.<br /><br />Tony has come out of the coma for only a moment . His boys take A.J. home and Carmella , overcome by stress , breaks down in the hallway : a signature moment in the episode.<br /><br />For the remainder of the episode , we cut in between the real world : the family dealing with the potential negative outcome of this coma , and Tony 's alternate reality , which parallels what 's going on both in his mind and in the real world around him.<br /><br />Then comes the stellar point in the episode : after A.J. finishes telling his mother he 's flunked school , she walks in to see Meadow sitting at Anthony 's side.<br /><br />She approaches Tony , and utters the best line of the episode : " Anthony , can you hear us ? " In Tony 's world , he enters a dark hotel room and turns on a light . He takes off his shoes and goes to the phone . He tries to dial , but he cannot -- as if he were trying to say something back to Carmella , but could n't physically bring himself to do so . Not yet.<br /><br />He sits down and looks out his window . A shimmering light that has reoccurred throughout the episode now seems to call to him from the other side of the city.<br /><br />"When It 's Cold I 'd Like To Die " by Moby marries perfectly with these last images and helps in creating an emotional roller - coaster of an episode.<br /><br />10 out of 10.<br /><br />P.S. : Watch the next episode . You find out what the light is . It 's wonderful .
1 Its too bad a lot of people did n't understand this and the next episode.<br /><br />But do n't worry ! ill explain it too you : ) < br /><br />This episode is split in 2 parts.<br /><br />first part is Tony 's " Dream " in his coma . Second part is what happens in real life.<br /><br />now what people did n't understand is that Tony 's dream is more then just a dream . in this episode its about his preparation for his Death . He loses his own identity and eventually even forgets himself , thus he disconnects all his bindings with this world . You will notice what I 'm saying at the doctor scene , where tony says he has lost his briefcase which contains " his life " . They makers really did a superb job of interpreting they 're own thoughts of what happens when you die . < br /><br />If you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode an unique thing , with great spiritual meanings.<br /><br />Like every sopranos episode the acting and filming is superb . < br /><br />Only thing i did n't understand was what the role where of the monks . gon na re watch it till i get this.<br /><br />anyways this episode really touched me , and i do n't think anyone else can make a better view of what happens in a almost death experience.<br /><br />10/10 no doubt .
1 To call this episode brilliant feels like too little . To say it keeps up the excellent work of the season premiere is reductive too , 'cause there 's never been a far - from - great Sopranos episode so far . In fact , the title might be a smug invitation for those who are n't real fans yet : Join the Club ... <br /><br />Picking up where Junior left off ( putting a bullet in his nephew 's gut after mistaking him for a crook he killed in the first season ) , the story begins with Tony being absolutely fine . With no recollection whatsoever of what happened to him , he 's attending some kind of convention . Only he 's not speaking with his normal accent , and there seems to be something wrong with his papers : apparently , he is not Tony Soprano but Kevin Finnerty , or at least that 's what a group of people think , and until the mess is sorted out he ca n't leave his hotel.<br /><br />Naturally , in pure Sopranos tradition , that turns out to be nothing but a dream : Tony is actually in a coma , with the doctors uncertain regarding his fate , his family and friends worried sick and Junior refusing to believe the whole thing actually happened . Unfortunately it did , and Anthony Jr. looks willing to avenge the attempt on his father 's life.<br /><br />Dreams have popped up rather frequently in the series , often as some kind of spiritual trial for the protagonists ( most notably in the Season Five show The Test Dream ) . Join the Club , however , takes the metaphysical qualities of the program , already hinted at by the previous episode 's use of a William S. Burroughs poem , and pushes the envelope in the most audacious way : Tony hallucinating about his dead friends ( the first occurrence of the sort was caused by food poisoning , four seasons ago ) is one thing , him actually being in what would appear to be Purgatory is radically different . The " heavenly " section of the story is crammed with allegorical significances , not least the name Tony is given ( as one character points out , spelling it in a certain way will give you the word " infinity " ) , and none of it comes off as overblown or far - fetched : David Chase has created a piece of work that is far too intelligent to use weird set - ups just for their own sake ; it all helps the narrative . Talking about " help from above " in the case of Tony Soprano might be stretching it a tad , though .
1 Troubled men 's magazine photographer Adrien Wilde ( well played with considerable intensity by Michael Callan ) has horrific nightmares in which he brutally murders his models . When the lovely ladies start turning up dead for real , Adrien worries that he might be the killer . Writer / director William Byron Hillman relates the engrossing story at a steady pace , builds a reasonable amount of tension , delivers a few gruesomely effective moments of savage misogynistic violence ( one woman who has a plastic garbage bag with a rattlesnake in it placed over her head rates as the definite squirm - inducing highlight ) , puts a refreshing emphasis on the nicely drawn and engaging true - to - life characters , further grounds everything in a plausible everyday world , and tops things off with a nice smattering of tasty female nudity . The fine acting from an excellent cast helps matters a whole lot : Joanna Pettet as sunny , charming love interest Mindy Jordache , James Stacy as Adrien 's macho double amputee brother B.J. , Seymour Cassel as Adrien 's concerned psychiatrist Dr. Frank Curtis , Don Potter as Adrien 's feisty gay assistant Louis , Pamela Hensley as gutsy homicide detective Sergeant Fountain , Cleavon Little as a hard - nosed police chief , and Misty Rowe as sweet , bubbly model Bambi . R. Michael Stringer 's polished cinematography makes impressive occasional use of breathtaking panoramic aerial shots . Jack Goga 's ominous rattling score likewise does the trick . Popping up in cool bit parts are Robert Tessier as a gruff bartender , Sally Kirkland as a saucy hooker , Kathy Shower as a fierce female wrestler B.J. grapples with in the ring , and Frances Bay in one of her standard old woman roles . A solid and enjoyable picture .
1 DOUBLE EXPOSURE was a tremendous surprise . It contains outstanding acting ( particularly from the underrated Callan ) , fine cinematography and a compelling storyline . In other words , it 's one of the finest horror efforts to emerge from the 1980s.<br /><br />Callan plays a fashion photographer who experiences dreams of murdering his models , at a time when he is reunited with his psychologically volatile brother ( who happens to be missing an arm and a leg ) . When the models Callan dreams about killing actually turn up dead , the photographer begins to doubt his own sanity ... but there is more to the picture than he is seeing.<br /><br />This film never received the praise it deserves . Most critics and filmgoers lump it in with the horde of slasher films released at the same time , but it stands high above the bulk of that sorry lot . It 's clever and unique , which is n't something one can comfortably say about most films of this genre , but it 's also passionately crafted and performed . DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a gem of its kind .
1 Yes , this production is long ( good news for Bronte fans ! ) and it has a somewhat dated feel , but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you wo n't want to watch any other versions!<br /><br />Timothy Dalton IS Edward Rochester ... it 's that simple . I do n't care that other reviewers claim he 's too handsome . Dalton is attractive , certainly , but no pretty - boy . In fact he possesses a craggy , angular dark charm that , in my mind , is quite in keeping with the mysterious , very masculine Mr R. And he takes on Rochester 's sad , tortured persona so poignantly . He portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it , but also displays Rochester 's tender , passionate , emotional side as well . ( IMO the newer A&E production suffers in that Ciaran Hinds - whom I normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout . I 've read the book many times and I never felt that Rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast.)<br /><br />When I reread the novel , I always see Zelah Clarke as Jane . Ms. Clarke , to me , resembles Jane as she describes herself ( and is described by others ) . Small , childlike , fairy ... though it 's true the actress does n't look 18 , she portrays Jane 's attributes so well . While other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional , one must remember that the character spent 8 years at Lowood being trained to hold her emotions and " passionate nature " in check . Her main inspiration was her childhood friend Helen , who was the picture of demure submission . Although her true nature was dissimilar , Jane learned to master her temper and appear docile , in keeping with the school 's aims for its charity students who would go into ' service ' . Jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich Mr. Rochester . She would certainly * not * speak to him as an equal . Even later on when she gave as well as she got , she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer . Nevertheless , if you read the book - to which this production stays amazingly close - you can clearly see the small struggles Zelah - as - Jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even - tempered.<br /><br />The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is just right , I think . No , it does not in the least resemble Hollywood ( thank God ! It 's not a Hollywood sort of book ) but theirs is a romance which is true , devoted and loyal . And for a woman like Jane , who never presumed to have * any * love come her way , it is a minor miracle.<br /><br />The rest of the casting is terrific , and I love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here . So , too , is much of the rich , poetic original dialogue . This version is the only one that I know of to include the lovely , infamous ' gypsy scene ' and in general , features more humor than other versions I 've seen . In particular , the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful!<br /><br />Jane Eyre was , in many ways , one of the first novelized feminists . She finally accepted love on her own terms and independently , and , at last , as Rochester 's true equal . Just beautiful !
1 This wonderful 1983 BBC television production ( not a movie , as others have written here ) of the classic love story " Jane Eyre " , starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester , and Zelah Clarke as Jane , is the finest version that has been made to date , since it is the most faithful to the novel by Charlotte Bronte in both concept and dialogue . < br /><br />A classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons ; when film producers start to meddle with a classic 's very lifeblood then that classic is destroyed . Thankfully the producers of THIS " Jane Eyre " approached the story with respect and faithfulness towards the original , which results in a spectacularly addictive concoction that is worth viewing multiple times , to enjoy its multi - layers of sweetness and delight and suspense . The performances are delightful , the music is just right , even the Gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful , and set the right tone for the production . < br /><br />My only criticism , though slight , is that this version , like every other version ever made of Jane Eyre , ignores the Christian influences that built Jane 's character and influenced her moral choices . In today 's modern world a woman in Jane 's situation would n't think twice but to stay with Rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her . " Oh , just get a divorce " , she would say to her man , or she would live in sin with him . But Jane Eyre knew she could n't settle for this course in life and respect herself . Why ? This decision was based on the foundations of the Christian faith she had been taught since childhood , not from the brutal Calvinist Lowood Institution , but from the Christian example of a true friend , Helen Burns , who was martyred rather than not turn the other cheek . Someday I would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation . A classic novel that ends with the heroine writing " Even so , come Lord Jesus ! " should not have the foundations of that faith stripped out of it .
1 Those who love the book Jane Eyre as I do ( it 's my all time favorite , and I re read it at least once a year ) will love this version . Timothy Dalton is just a tad too good looking to be Mr. Rochester , but other than that , he does a marvelous job portraying the brooding master of Thornfield . Zelah Clarke may have been just a little too old to play the 18 year old Jane , but when I watch this movie , I do n't think about the ages of the characters . The dialog from the film is taken almost verbatim from the book , which was very smart . Sure , this film might seem a little long , but it 's the only version I 've seen that includes part 3 of the story.<br /><br />I wish the people who made this film had been involved in the newer Zeferelli version , as it would have helped that mess of a film.<br /><br />I also realized the last time I watched this video that Judy Cornwell plays " Aunt Reed " ! She is so versatile that I did n't recognize her . She plays Daisy in Keeping up Appearances , and also played Mrs. Musgrove in 1995 's Persuasion ( another wonderful adaption).<br /><br />UPDATE : Got the DVD this week , and it 's marvelous to see the original unedited version . There 's lots more at the beginning ( Young Jane at Gateshead and at Lowood . ) And at the end , they 've restored lots of things , ( I always wondered why St. John had a slip of paper when he reveals that he knows who Jane is-- because the part where he tears it from her painting was edited out of the US VHS version ! ) . Rosamund Oliver is in it ... she was completely cut out of the VHS . As far as I could tell , they had n't edited out any of Timothy Dalton 's parts , so nothing new there , but it is great to see the whole miniseries in its entirety after all these years of enjoying the VHS . Thanks , BBC ( PS ... I would have paid more for a special edition DVD ... with maybe some interviews with the stars ... or a making of show )
1 I had no idea what Jane Eyre was before I saw this miniseries . I had read and watched many classics before , and I believed that most classics were boring , over - worded , and overrated stories with moderately interesting plots at best . This Jane Eyre miniseries completely changed my conceptions.<br /><br />Zelah Clarke is a fabulous actress , and she gives a wonderful portrayal of Jane Eyre . Her accent is delightful and her quiet , yet firm nature matches the young governess ' character exactly . Timothy Dalton is an amazing Rochester . His passion and energy in the film makes me believe that he was born to play the brooding master of Thornfield Hall . I could n't sleep at all the night after I had watched this miniseries . The plot is both haunting and inspiring . The characters are masterfully performed , and the story is incredible . This is the best version of Jane Eyre to ever appear on film.<br /><br />I read the book later and was amazed at how closely this miniseries followed Charolette Bronte 's writing . Jane Eyre is now my favorite film and book . If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life , watch the 1983 BBC version of Jane Eyre .
1 I felt duty bound to watch the 1983 Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke adaptation of " Jane Eyre , " because I 'd just written an article about the 2006 BBC " Jane Eyre " for TheScreamOnline.<br /><br />So , I approached watching this the way I 'd approach doing homework.<br /><br />I was irritated at first . The lighting in this version is bad . Everyone / everything is washed out in a bright white klieg light that , in some scenes , casts shadows on the wall behind the characters.<br /><br />And the sound is poorly recorded . I felt like I was listening to a high school play.<br /><br />And the pancake make - up is way too heavy.<br /><br />And the sets do n't fully convey the Gothic mood of the novel . They are too fussy , too Martha Stewart . I just ca n't see Bronte 's Rochester abiding such Martha Stewart domestic arrangements . Orson Welles ' Rochester lived in cave - like gloom , very appropriate to the novel 's Gothic mood.<br /><br />And yet ... with all those objections ... not only is this the best " Jane Eyre " I 've seen , it may be the best adaptation of any novel I 've ever seen.<br /><br />This " Jane Eyre , " in spite of its technical flaws , brought the feeling back to me of reading " Jane Eyre " for the first time.<br /><br />The critics of this production say it is too close to the book . For me , someone who valued the book and did n't need it to be any less " wordy " or any less " Christian " or any more sexed up , this version 's faithfulness to the novel Bronte actually wrote is its finest asset.<br /><br />Bronte wrote a darn good book . There 's a reason it has lasted 150 years plus , while other , slicker , sexier and easier texts , have disappeared.<br /><br />As a long time " Jane Eyre " fan , I was prejudiced against Timothy Dalton as Rochester . Rochester is , famously , not handsome ; Jane and Rochester are literature 's famous ugly couple . And Timothy Dalton is nothing if not stunningly handsome.<br /><br />But Dalton gives a mesmerizing performance as Rochester . He just blew me away . I 've never seen anything like his utter devotion to the role , the text , the dialogue , and Rochester 's love for Jane . Dalton brings the page 's Rochester to quivering life on screen.<br /><br />Rochester is meant to be a bit scary . Dalton is scary . Welles got the scary streak down , too , for example , when he shouts " Enough ! " after Fontaine plays a short piano piece . But Dalton is scary more than once , here . You really ca n't tell if he 's going to hurt Jane , or himself , in his desperation.<br /><br />Rochester 's imperiousness , his humor , his rage , his vulnerability : Dalton conveys all , sometimes seconds apart . It 's stunning.<br /><br />And here 's the key thing -- the actor performing Rochester has to convey that he has spent over a decade of his life in utter despair , lonely , living with an ugly , life - destroying secret.<br /><br />No other actor I 've seen attempt this part conveys that black hole of despair as Timothy Dalton does . Current fan favorite Toby Stephens does n't even try . Dalton hits it out of the park . If I saw Timothy Dalton performing Rochester in a singles bar , i would say , " That guy is trouble . Do n't even look at him . " He 's that radioactive with tamped down agony.<br /><br />Zelah Clarke is not only , overall , the best Jane I 've seen , she 's one of the very few Janes whom producers were willing to cast as the book casts Jane . No , folks who know " Jane Eyre " only from the 2006 version , Bronte did * not * describe a statuesque , robust Jane with finely arched eyebrows and pouty lips . Rather , Charlotte Bronte 's Jane is , indeed , poor , plain , obscure , and little , and NOT pretty.<br /><br />Zelah has a small mouth , close - set eyes , and a bit of a nose . She 's truly " little . " She is no fashion model . And she is the best Jane , the truest to the book.<br /><br />Some described her a cold or boring . No , she 's true to the book . Bronte 's Jane is not a red hot mama , she 's a sheltered , deprived teen whose inner passions come out only at key moments , as Zelah 's do here . The book 's Jane is someone you have to watch slowly , carefully , patiently , observantly , if you want to truly plumb her depths . You have to watch Zelah , here , to get to know who she really is.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen more fire in Zelah in one key scene , but that 's one scene out of five hours in which she is , otherwise , very good.<br /><br />In spite of its closeness to the text , this version , like every other version I 've seen , shys away from fully explicating the overtly Christian themes in " Jane Eyre . " Christianity is not incidental subtext in " Jane Eyre , " it is central.<br /><br />Helen Burns instructs Jane in Christianity , thus giving her a subversive , counter cultural way to read , and live , her apparently doomed , pinched life . It is Christianity , and a Christian God , who convinces poor , plain , obscure Jane of her equal worth , her need to live up to her ideals , and her rejection of a key marriage proposal . That is n't made fully clear here.<br /><br />In any case , Charlotte Bronte wrote an excellent , complex , rich novel , and this adaptation of it , of all the ones I 've seen , mines and honors the novel best of any adaptation I 've seen , and that says a lot.<br /><br />Other versions , that do n't fully honor the book , end up being a chore to watch in many places . If you do n't care about what Charlotte Bronte has to say about child abuse , or the hypocrisy of a culture built on looks and money , your adaptation of much of the book will be something people fast forward through to get to the kissing scenes between Jane and Rochester.<br /><br />This version , like Bronte 's novel , realizes that everything Bronte wrote -- about Jane 's experiences at Lowood , and her relationship to St. John -- are part of what makes Jane 's relationship to Rochester as explosive and unforgettable as it is .
1 This is the best version ( so far ) that you will see and the most true to the Bronte work . Dalton is a little tough to imagine as Rochester who Jane Eyre declared " not handsome " . But his acting overcomes this and Zelah Clark , pretty as she is , is also a complete and believable Jane Eyre . This production is a lengthy watch but well worth it . Nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true ' romance ' in literature , this is the way to see it . I own every copy of this movie and have read and re - read the original . The filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this .
1 I really have to say , this was always a favorite of mine when I went to see my grandma . And it still is . It is very , very close to the book . The way it is filmed , and the players were just all excellent ! I have to recommend this movie to everyone who has n't seen it . Almost everyone I talk to hates TV movies , but this was really great ! I gave it 10/10 .
1 I have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel " Jane Eyre " . Both Dalton and Clarke are very believable as Rochester and Jane . I 've seen other versions , but none compare to this one . The best one for me . I could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again . The last time I saw this one was in 1984 when I was only 13 . At that time , I was a bookworm and I had just read Charlotte Bronte 's novel . I was completely enchanted by this miniseries and I remember not missing any of the episodes . I 'd like to see it again because it 's so good . :-)
1 This review comes nearly 30 years late . Nevertheless , it has to be mentioned that I chanced by a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 months straight ! I just had to write about it ! I got smitten and forgot anything else existed once I saw this movie . How ironic it is to see Literature 's ugliest male protagonist portrayed by the handsomest man ! yet , what a welcome irony ! It suited me perfectly and more so because Timothy Dalton did full justice to his role . He delivered an astounding and triumphant performance ! I have never seen anything like it ! All the other actors are very good too . The whole movie was put together beautifully . I do n't care what anyone says about this movie . I just love it and love it ! It made me happy and satisfied . It crushes me a bit to say this but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 to A&E 's P&J , which I believe is the ultimate mini - series . < br /><br />The excerpts from Jane Eyre spooked me a little back in school . I never got around to reading the book seriously knowing the story line so well . Seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and drove me to a near frenzy . The scenes and Mr. Dalton 's voice haunted me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously , which , of course is a masterpiece . Bravo to the whole team and especially to Mr . Dalton ! ! This movie is now a part of me.<br /><br />I give it 10/10 rating .
1 There are many adaptations of Charlotte Brontë 's classic novel " Jane Eyre " , and taking into consideration the numerous reviews written about them there is also a lively discussion on which of them is the best . The short film adaptations all suffer from the fact that it is simply not possible to cram the whole plot of the novel into a movie of about a 100 min . length , consequently these movies only show few parts of the novel . The TV series have proved to be a more suitable format to render all the different episodes of the heroine 's life.<br /><br />There are three TV mini series , released in ' 73 , ' 83 and 2006 . The 2006 version is not only the worst of these three , but the worst of all Jane Eyre adaptations and a striking example of a completely overrated film . The novel 's beautiful lines are substituted by insipid and trivial ones , and crucial scenes are either deleted or replaced by scenes which have nothing whatever to do with the novel . What it all leads to then is that the characters portrayed have not only nothing in common with the Rochester and Jane of the novel and behave in exactly the opposite way as described in the book , but that also their behaviour and language is absolutely not consistent with the behaviour of the period in which the novel is set . It is a silly soap opera , in which the actors look and act as if they had been put in the costumes of the 1850ies by mistake . This " Jane Eyre " ( as it dares to call itself ) is indeed a slap in the face of Charlotte Brontë.<br /><br />The 1973 version is very faithful to the novel in that the long dialogues between Mr. Rochester and Jane are rendered in nearly their full length . But what works beautifully in the novel does not necessarily work beautifully on the screen . At times the language of the novel is too complex and convoluted as to appear natural when spoken on screen , and the constant interruptions of the dialogues by Jane 's voice - overs add to the impression of artificiality and staginess . And despite the faithfulness to the novel the essence of the scenes is not captured . Another problem is the casting of the main characters . Sorcha Cusack 's portrayal of Jane as a bold , self - confident , worldly - wise young woman is totally at odds with the literary model , and Michael Jayston , although a good actor , does simply not possess the commanding physical presence nor the charisma necessary to play Rochester . Although a decent adaptation it simply fails to convey the passion and intensity of the novel and never really captivates the audience.<br /><br />All the faults of the ' 73 version stand corrected in the TV mini series of ' 83 with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke . Although from a purist 's point of view Timothy Dalton is too handsome , tall and lean to be Rochester , he possesses the essential qualities for the role : He has an imposing physical presence , great magnetism and an air of self - assurance and authority . And despite his undeniable handsomeness he looks grim and stern enough to play the gloomy master of Thornfield convincingly . But the excellence of his performance lies in the way he renders all the facets of Rochester 's character . Of all the actors who have played Rochester he is the only one to capture them all : Rochester 's harshness , nearly insolence , his moodiness and abruptness , as well as his humorous side , his tenderness , his solicitude and deep , frantic love . Dalton 's handling of Charlotte Brontë 's language is equally superb . Even Rochester 's most far - fetched and complicated thoughts ring absolutely true and natural when Dalton delivers them . He is the definitive Rochester , unsurpassed and unsurpassable , and after watching him in this role it is impossible to imagine Rochester to be played in any other way or by any other actor.<br /><br />Zelah Clarke delivers an equally excellent performance in a role that is possibly even more difficult to play well than the one of Rochester . She portrays exactly the Jane of the novel , an outwardly shy , reserved and guarded young woman , but who possesses a great depth of feeling and an equally great strength of will . She catches beautifully the duality in Jane 's character : her modesty and respectfulness on the one hand , and her fire and passion on the other , her seeming frailty and her indomitable sense of right and wrong . She and Dalton have wonderful chemistry and their scenes together are pure delight.<br /><br />As regards faithfulness to the literary model this version also quotes verbatim from the novel as does the ' 73 version , but with one important difference : The dialogues are shortened in this version , but the core lines which are essential for the characterisation of the protagonists and the development of the plot are rendered unchanged . Thus the scriptwriter avoided any artificiality of speech , while still fully preserving the beauty and originality of Charlotte Brontë 's language . And in contrast to the earlier BBC version the essence of each scene is perfectly captured.<br /><br />The plot of the novel is followed with even greater accuracy than in the ' 73 series . It is nearly a scene for scene enactment of the novel , where equal time and emphasis is given to each episode of Jane 's life . It is the only Jane Eyre adaptation that has a gypsy scene worthy of the novel , and the only one which does full justice to the novel 's pivotal and most heartrending scene when Jane and Rochester meet after the aborted wedding . Timothy Dalton in particular plays that scene with superb skill . He renders with almost painful intensity Rochester 's anguish as he realizes Jane 's resolution to leave him , his frantic attempts to make her stay and his final despair as she indeed leaves him . It is a heartbreaking , almost devastating , scene , which will stay with the viewer for a long time.<br /><br />With even the smaller roles perfectly cast , an excellent script and two ideal leading actors this is the definitive and only true " Jane Eyre " .
1 There have been many film and TV productions of Jane Eyre each with aspects to recommend them , but I suspect this is the one that people will still be discovering and falling in love with decades from now . It 's just a classic ( and offers much more of the story than others do ) . Timothy Dalton is utterly in his element as Rochester , rarely missing the mark ; his performance is astonishingly nimble and many - colored , while never straying too far from the dark complexities of the character . Zelah Clarke 's Jane is more cerebral than otherworldly , but she makes a perfect foil for Dalton ( who , appropriately , towers over her ! ) The nuances of her performance come through better on a second viewing ( once you 've absorbed the shock of Dalton 's charisma ) . There are some technical faults and a couple of moments where the production values could have been better ; though this pretty much was a top - of - the - line production by the BBC 's standards of that time . But , it 's the performances that are the real pleasure . Do n't miss this one !
1 I think this is a great version , I came on here before , to help me find which version I should use and I went to Jane Eyre 1983 and read a comment from users comment and then helped me to get this version . I do not regret picking this version and neither will you . I tried watching all the other versions and none matched up to it , There is nothing like the book , and TRUST ME if you are reading the book you want something that is going to match up with it . When you are looking for something real and moving after you have read the book it is hard because you want something that is going to match up with that . I would say God personally led me to this version . It points to true love for a humans . I would say God 's love is greater.if there is anything better , I would like to see it . but so far there is none like it !
1 I studied Charlotte Bronte 's novel in high school , and it left me with a stunning impression . Here was a beautiful novel about a young woman 's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England . This young woman was Jane Eyre , a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will of her own . Her story , which Bronte told through Jane 's own eyes , was both sad and inspiring . < br /><br />As part of our study , we watched the 1983 adaptation of the story , and it blew me away . The mini - series not only made the effort to stay true to Bronte 's original text and the essence of the story , but the actors who portrayed the characters were just great . Both Zelah Clarke ( Jane Eyre ) and Timothy Dalton ( Jane 's lover , by the name of Rochester ) captured brilliantly the essence of their characters . I can not imagine anyone else in their roles . ( The other performances of Rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion , energy , and tenderness needed to portray Rochester accurately . I say that Timothy Dalton comes out on top because he possesses all these characteristics in his portrayal of Rochester . Zelah Clarke not only looks like Jane Eyre , but she captures Jane 's quiet , but firm and passionate nature brilliantly . She holds in her emotions , like the Jane of the book , at the appropriate moments in the story but allows her fire to come out in Jane 's passionate scenes . The chemistry that Clarke and Dalton portray in their scenes together is also credible and true to Jane and Rochester 's devoted relationship . ) As well , the supporting actors also fit their roles perfectly , and the sets fit the Gothic nature of the story . < br /><br />I strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte tale . If you have not read the book before , then you can watch this production as a faithful introduction to this beautiful story .
1 I am a Jane Eyre lover and a purist , and this version includes almost all of the important details of the book , and the characters are portrayed as I imagined them . Jane Eyre is a complex story of great richness and ca n't be delivered properly in a feature - length format , so it needs a TV mini - series . Timothy Dalton 's Rochester is probably the best ever . There has been a lot of discussion about how attractive he is and his age . In the book , Jane ( the narrator ) describes him as " about 35 " and not young , but not yet middle aged . I think Timothy Dalton was about 38 when he made this , so that is about right . Also , we only have Jane 's opinion of whether Rochester is handsome . She only just met him and he asks her bluntly what she thinks . As an inexperienced and humble girl , I ca n't imagine her saying she did think him handsome . The actor playing Rochester needs to show us the character of the man , and this is fulfilled to perfection . I love the relationship between the two leads , which is the crucial thing about this story , and the humour of their encounters . Other versions have blown it , but this gets it right . The 2006 version with Toby Stephens ( aged 37 years ) is in progress on BBC1 and is very good indeed , so I will decide whether that is my favourite when it is completed.<br /><br />On viewing this series again , after watching the 2006 version , I have decided that this version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is the best ! Charlotte Bronte 's dialogue is preserved and this is essential to the power of the story . Modernisation just does n't work - it 's a Victorian story and having archaic poetic speech suits the characters . This version has an excellent cast - Zelah Clark is tiny and the difference in height between her and Rochester is important ; Timothy Dalton has real presence and is an amazing actor . There are no extra scenes to divert from the plot and the screenplay includes all the essential scenes , but leaves out unnecessary details , making it to the point and gripping . I recommend it to all true Jane Eyre fans .
1 * SPOILER ALERT : I wish I could discuss this without revealing specific plot points , but I ca n't . Sorry.*<br /><br />I was looking for an IMDb review of the George C. Scott movie when I stumbled across the summary and reviews for this version . It had so many positive reviews that I decided to order it even though : ( a)while truncated and rushed , I thought George C. Scott embodied the tortured nature ( and physical appearance ) of the book 's Rochester to a T ; and ( b)even while looking at the DVD 's cover , I was thinking " Is n't Timothy Dalton too good - looking for the role ? " The latter concern was reinforced by the fact that I decided to re - read the book while the DVD was on backorder . That said , the minute I started watching this , I was captivated . At first it was disconcerting to hear 1840 's dialog spoken as written -- with little or no attempts at modernization -- but Dalton and Clarke threw themselves into it so thoroughly , that I actually enjoyed the fact that the adapters trusted the audience to follow archaic speech . To have so much of the book up on the screen was an extra bonus . I know someone who wo n't watch any versions of Jane Eyre because " who wants to see a film about a man who keeps a poor crazy woman in the attic ? " Frankly , if someone who had n't read the book stumbled across the hour and a half or two hour versions , they would think that 's pretty much all the story entails -- Rochester 's secret and its affect on everyone around him . Luckily , this version is actually about Jane Eyre 's whole life.<br /><br />Some people have criticized the casting . Dalton is too dashing ; Clarke is too reserved . I ca n't argue against the first point , but he is so " in the moment " that I believe he IS Rochester . To me , Clarke 's performance is on the mark . Jane Eyre is quiet , guarded . If one remembers the book , so much of the adult Jane 's fieriness and passion occurs during her private struggles . Some of the criticisms baffle me . Reviewers say Clarke is too short or is n't pretty enough . The book goes on ad infinitum about how small and plain Jane is . Ms. Clarke should n't be tall and the filmmakers toned down her looks to make Jane 's declarations of her lack of beauty credible . She can scarcely help it if Dalton is tall . Some say there is no chemistry between the leads . What ? ! ! The scene when Jane finally comes out of her room after the wedding fiasco fairly vibrates with passion and longing and sadness and regret -- and that 's just the first example that comes to mind.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the other criticisms . I too missed more scenes with Helen Burns and the Rivers siblings . Some of the dialog was oddly truncated . When Rochester declares , " Jane , you misjudge me . I do not hate her because she is mad , " I waited for the rest of the exchange when Rochester explains how if Jane were to go mad , he would still love and care for her . It 's a powerful moment in the book , and I wish it had been included . I think it was a mistake to bring a scene with Rochester into the part of the story where Jane is on her own . It might have been done for clarity 's sake , but I found it jarring . I wanted the sly humor of the scene where Jane opines that Rochester 's ardor will cool and he 'll become gruff again , but he may " like " her again by and by . Dalton 's performance is so good that the rare misstep is glaring -- when Rochester weeps in the library , I saw him as an actor doing a crying scene , not as Rochester . As for the sets , if anyone has ever caught an episode of the 1960 's show " Dark Shadows , " one knows what to expect -- very stark and sometimes rickety looking interiors . Others have commented thoroughly and succinctly about the make - up job Rochester sports at the end . Yikes ! It IS bad . The conclusion is too abrupt . After all that anguish and suspense , I wanted a more rounded off ending . And , on my copy of the DVD , having credits at the beginning and end of all eleven 25 - 30 minute episodes gets to be a bit much . That said , I am so glad I have this film and will watch it again and again .
1 I liked Timothy Dalton very much even though he was a bit young and too handsome for Mr R. but I thought Zelah Clarke too plump and short . This version however was very true to the novel and very well filmed . I have seen 4 versions , Orson Welles is still my favorite Mr R , though George C Scott did very well and it 's a toss up between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York , although they were both a bit too old for the role . I recently saw a brilliant TV version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox . I would love to see those two do Jane Eyre . By the time I got to watching the Ciarin Hinds version , I think I was Jane Eyred out , but I will never tire of those first few minutes of hearing Joan Fontaine 's voice narrate the opening of the first version I ever saw . I always want to go back and read the book again .
1 this was a fabulous adaptation of Jane Eyre . the only problem i had with it was that i did n't like Zelah Clarke . i thought she was too old and made Jane seem much to timid . in the book Jane seemed like a much stronger character . i was really annoyed by this portrayal of her . the part where it 's the morning after Rochester asks her to marry him and she runs up to him and hugs him always makes me laugh . i think they made a bad choice in casting her . but Dalton was absolutely wonderful as Rochester . he makes this version of Jane Eyre worth seeing . another thing that made this version not quite 100 % was the quality of film . i know it was made in the eighties for TV . if it had been a feature film , and better quality , it would have been perfect . my main complaint however , is that Zelah Clarke was definitely too old .
1 This is , in my opinion , much better than either of the 2 1990 's versions , but is still not all that good . It feels dated , probably because it is , but it does stand up well compared to other BBC 1980 's period pieces such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey.<br /><br />The length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90 's versions , and St John Rivers is at least covered , although not very well . Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester , but the actress playing Jane is much too old . There is definitely scope for a TV adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it .
1 If a more masterful adaptation than this one even existed , you need not look for it ; you will find all and more in this near - perfect presentation of Charlotte Brontë 's masterpiece.<br /><br />Rarely have I seen a film that would urge me to read the novel on which it was based , but I admit to that here . Although I have not read Jane Eyre , I am convinced that I have missed very little in the way of dialogue and plot or of intensity and emotion . I only wish to explore the novel due to the immense curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has stirred within me.<br /><br />I need not divulge anything in the way of plot here . Let me just say this : if you are perhaps unsure as to whether you should watch or read the beautiful story that is Jane Eyre , I implore you to doubt no more ! Every atom of might and magic that has reared Jane Eyre as a popular classic of English literature has successfully been captured in this film.<br /><br />What Brontë did not bring herself , Clarke and Dalton managed to translate in the limelight with stupendous intensity . The movie 's success is , no doubt , due in no small part to their acting prowess.<br /><br />Love Jane Eyre or hate her , but appreciate the richness , the vitality , the truth of the story ; love the characters ; love the actors ; all just as you would love what is great in cinema .
1 This has to be the best adaptation I have seen it 's my favourite and I think it stays very close to the book . What really makes this a must see though is the casting of the two lead actors . The wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester I have seen on screen brooding and tragic , while Zelah Clarke is the perfect combination of strength , courage , shyness and gentleness as Jane . The story(as i 'm sure most people know)is this , the young and plain Jane Eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800 's who advertises her services as a governess in the newspapers . She is offered the post of governess at the big mansion Thornfield Hall to tutor Adele the young ward of the halls mysterious and respected owner Mr Rochester . As the months go on he falls in love with Jane and puts into effect a few situations to try and see if Jane is as madly in love with him as he is with her . However there is a secret still waiting to be discovered at Thornfield Hall and when it is it 's effects are devastating . This is a moving and well acted drama with nice locations and gorgeous costumes plus as I said earlier excellent acting especially from Zelah and Timothy .
1 I have recently seen this production on DVD . It is the first time I have seen it since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was just as good as I remembered . At first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and I suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the BBC serials were back then . ( I miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on Sunday afternoons back then ) But that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been . I am a bit of a " Jane Eyre " purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one . I have recently re - read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on . Reading the scene near the end where Rochester questions Jane about what St John was like I noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by Dalton and Clarke and done perfectly . < br /><br />All the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way , some even leave out the " Rivers " family and their connection to Jane altogether . I also think this is the only production to include the " Gypsy " scene done correctly.<br /><br />The casting is perfect , Zelah Clarke is like Jane is described in the book " small plain and dark " and I disagree that she looked too old . Timothy Dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as Rochester , portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off ! I agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time , like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted , his expression is fantastically frightening . But then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when Jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another . A love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable . Oh to be loved by a man like that ! There were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however , like when Jane climbs in to bed with the dying Helen and also when Rochester takes Jane shopping for her wedding things ( I thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks).<br /><br />Finally if you never see another production of Jane Eyre - you simply most see this one it is simply perfection !
1 When my now college age daughter was in preschool , this miniseries appeared on A&E from 8 - 9 each morning . My neighbor and I made a pact that we would n't miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week . Good choice.<br /><br />I'd forgotten how much I loved this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently . Timothy Dalton is very handsome , but still perfect as Rochester . The dark , craggy face , the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book . Although Dalton eats a little scenery , I could n't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds . The magic here is that women love Dalton and get caught up in the romance.<br /><br />I would love to know what 's become of Zelah Clarke . She is dead on as Jane , quiet , formal , saying volumes with but a look . The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth . Criticism of her performance as " wooden " is misplaced . A servant in a proper English household would have maintained just such a demeanor , but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion . Unlike many other screen Janes , she appears plain enough to be Jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester 's attraction to her.<br /><br />Bronte 's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact . Dalton and Clarke capture the interplay between Jane and Rochester with wit and quiet intensity . Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard , she refuses to be cowed by the dark , blustery Rochester . The two leads play off each other beautifully . < br /><br />This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever .
1 Though I did not begin to read the " Classics " in literature until I was 47 , it 's never too late . Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons , mainly because there is n't a part of the book I liked less , only parts I enjoyed more . The 1983 TV mini - series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton was everything I hoped it would be . I saw it as a full length movie in 2006 . Dalton 's ' Mr. Rochester ' was very good but I absolutely loved Zelah 's ' Jane Eyre ' . Relecting on another ' Classics ' movie I saw recently , I was disappointed in the production , direction and dialogue . It was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance of Hollywood . Artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism . Using the title after such license is fraud . Leave it to the Brits to get this one right ( among others ) . You wo n't be able to reread the book without reliving the movie with it 's proper context and spirit . Well done BBC .
1 The 1983 BBC production of " Jane Eyre " starring Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton ( LOVE HIM ) has always been and will always be my favorite Jane Eyre . If you watch any other version of Jane Eyre without reading the book , it will be like watching some regular movie which you will forget the next day . But watching this one almost equals to reading the book . I used to watch these miniseries a lot when I was little , and they inspired me to read the book . At the time I did n't pay attention to how close this television production was to the book . Recently , I watched the 1996 version of Jane Eyre and was very disappointed . It was only 2 hours long and did n't have many important scenes from the book ( such as my favorite gypsy scene ) . After that I fell in love with This " Jane Eyre " even more because it includes all the important scenes of the book and it just tells the whole story ( the other versions do n't , if you have n't read the book ) . < br /><br />The cast of 1983 Jane Eyre is excellent . It 's true that Timothy Dalton is a very handsome actor ( handsome enough to play Butler in " Scarlet " , and Julius Caesar ) , but he is so great as Rochester that I ca n't imagine anybody else playing this role . And Zelah Clarke is , without a doubt , the only Jane that follows the description of the book . The other thing that makes this film so great is the clothes and the makeup of the actors . Jane looks so modest and naive , just as Bronte describes her ( although she does n't look 18 , but do you actually pay attention to that ? ... ) < br /><br />Some people say that this " Jane Eyre " is too long , but I would rather spend my whole day watching it than spend 2 hours watching some other version . Some say the movie is dull and boring because Jane is not passionate enough , or because there are not enough " kissing scenes " . I hate when they make Jane Eyre some " Hollywood movie " with inappropriate kissing scenes . You do n't have to include " crazy , madly in love " scenes to show the love between Jane and Rochester . And both Zelah and Timothy express this love so perfectly that there are no other scenes needed ! ! I am 19 years old , and many girls of my age refer to this film as " boring and old - fashioned " . But I can only feel sorry for them because they do n't appreciate the purity and beauty of it . After all , the novel is set in 19th century , and that old - fashioned look makes it more attractive and more like the book . < br /><br />I do n't think there will ever be any other version of Jane Ayre that will have the popularity and love of this one . No matter who plays Jane and Rochester in other movies , the real Jane and Rochester ( for me at least ) will always be Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton !
1 In all the comments praising or damning Dalton 's performance , I thought he was excellent . He does not play Rochester as a spoiled pretty rich boy , but as a roguish , powerful man . I liked this version , although the shot on video aspect was sometimes distracting , and the scenes with Jane and St. John never quite gelled . I give this an 8 .
1 Playing a character from a literary classic can be a bit of a poisoned chalice for an actor , paying for the pleasure of a meaty character by competing with the fantasies of generations of readers  not to mention the numerous other actors who 've besieged the castle before . Fortunately for the fantasists , this version  with the nicely cast Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton  stands head and shoulders above versions that have come after it . It 's the right length to do the story full justice , and makes considerable use of Bronte 's cracking dialogue ; none of that modern meddling away , cutting text and adding new and inferior scenes.<br /><br />The magic of the original story lies in the tensions created between the central characters , and the lives circumstances create for them to lead . Jane  " poor , plain and little "  grows up on the stinting charity of a cold aunt , her nature and independence shaped by a long spell in a very harsh school . She arrives as a governess in the household of Mr Rochester , utterly friendless and alone . She represses herself habitually out of duty and hard experience , but her passionate nature soon finds its touch - paper in her stern , keenly intelligent , enigmatic master , to whom she is drawn , as he is to her , by forces beyond their control . Rochester is the caged tiger , busy " paving hell with energy " ; potentially dangerous to all who come into contact with him  but " pervious , through a chink or two " . His character is extraordinary : he takes extraordinary liberties with a paid subordinate ; but then Jane is no ordinary employee , as he sees . But a dark secret , and severe trials , lie before them both.<br /><br />It 's a pleasure to hear Bronte 's remarkable dialogue spoken by such accomplished actors  Dalton in particular seems formed for passion on a Brontean scale . If you 've only ever seen him as a not - so - memorable Bond , you 've missed the thing he 's best at . Those who 've commented that his Rochester is too handsome , miss the point of these dramatisations : his character has simply too much screen time for a really ugly man to retain the viewer 's attention . Timothy Dalton is just right , not always or consistently handsome , but often glancingly , strikingly so , just as it should be . And Zelah Clarke 's Jane is no wallflower ; she conveys the emotions of a woman who habitually represses her sense of humour and her passionate nature very successfully , allowing her rare outbursts to show to more dramatic effect.<br /><br />Not so long ago the BBC aired an excellent dramatisation of Jean Rhys ' enlightened and most unsettling riposte to Bronte , " Wide Sargasso Sea " , imagining the back - story of the first Mrs Rochester . Do check it out  you 'll never see the ' hero ' of " Jane Eyre " in quite the same way again .
1 Last night I finished re - watching " Jane Eyre " ( 1983 ) , the BBC mini - series adapted from Charlotte Bronte 's Gothic romance novel which is deservingly a classic of English literature with Timothy Dalton ( my favorite James Bond ) as Mr. Edward Rochester and Zelah Clarke , as Jane Eyre , a poor orphaned 18-year - old girl , a governess at Mr. Rochester 's estate , Thornfield . " Jane Eyre " has been one of my most beloved books since I was an 11-years - old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words , " This book is amazing " and so it was and I have read it dozens of times and I am still not tired of it . Its beautiful language , refined , fragrant , and surprisingly fresh , the dialogs , and above all , two main characters , and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers . " Jane Eyre " has been adapted to TV and big screen many times , 18 according to IMDb . The actors as famous and marvelous as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles , William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg , George C. Scott and Susannah York , Ciarán Hinds and Samantha Morton have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society , laws , religion , by the differences in age , backgrounds , experiences , and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years . Of all these films I 've only seen one , 300 minutes long BBC version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where Timothy Dalton who frequently plays dark , brooding characters did not just play Edward Rochester brilliantly and with class , he WAS Mr. Rochester - sardonic , vibrant , the force of nature , powerful , passionate , sexy , and tormented master of Thornfield . Zelah Clarke was also convincing as sweet , gentle , intelligent and strong Jane who feels deeply and is full of passion mixed with clear reasoning , and quiet but firm willpower.<br /><br />Added on September 17 , 2007 : During the last two weeks , I 've seen five " Jane Eyre " movies and it was a wonderful experience . There is something to admire in every adaptation of " Jane Eyre " even if not all of them are completely successful . This version is still my favorite " Jane Eyre " film .
1 Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel ! When I stumbled upon this movie version in the late 90 's I was ecstatic ! This is the best and most complete version of the book on film ! This version is a little long to sit through in one sitting but well worth it . Timothy Dalton is amazing as Rochester . I was glad that they cast a normal looking actress ( Zelah Clark ) as Jane and not a glamorous person . I love the sets and the location . For anyone who is a true Jane Eyre fan , this is the version to watch ! ! ! For those of you who are interested , I just found this version on DVD . I have watched my VHS copy almost to breaking so I was thrilled to find it on DVD .
1 I think this movie had to be fun to make it , for us it was fun to watch it . The actors look like they have a fun time . My girlfriends like the boy actors and my boyfriends like the girl actors . Not very much do we get to have crazy fun with a movie that is horror make . I see a lot of scary movies and i would watch this one all together once more , or more because we laugh together . If this actors make other scary movies i will watch them . The grander mad man that s chase to kill the actors is very much a good bad man . He make us laugh together the most . i would give this movie a high score if you ask me.<br /><br />I do n't know if the market has any more of the movies with the actors , but the main boy is cute . the actor with the grand chest has to be not real . they does n't look to real .
1 Who ever came up with story is one sick person . I rented it for our slumber party sleepover and all six of us got freaked out cause we 're all in an acting class together , and we know a couple of the actors from class . Besides everybody screaming the whole freaky night , I had freaky nightmares . I kept thinking oh my God , if I get up to go to the bathroom to pee I 'm going to be stabbed in the middle of wiping or something . I could n't even go to the bathroom because we watched this gruesome horror movie . I also thought why are all the girls topless in this movie but we do n't any of the boys units ? You should make a horror film where the killer is a girl and chopping off units . I would watch that over and over . Call it hard or soft or something stupid like that . I 'm only giving this movie a 9 because you FREAKED ME OUT FREAKS .
1 Very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment.<br /><br />The script was very good as was the acting . The visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film . This affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending . < br /><br />I was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever . < br /><br />This movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment . Not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good .
1 I finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it . It actually exceeded my expectations . Considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well - made film . The lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways , especially given the plot . Just like The Blair Witch Project , this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film . Another bonus : Whereas most low - budget horror films ( even the best of the best ) suffer from mediocre - to - unintentionally hysterical acting , this film actually had a talented cast ( save one or two characters ) , particularly the two leads . The only thing missing from the film was an original storyline . It borrows heavily from better - known films like " Deliverance " and " Wrong Turn " but if you 're like me , films of this nature never cease to be terrifying . Plus , the director keeps things interesting throughout . I 'd be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and I have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out ...
1 This is a good film for 99 % of the duration . I feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim.<br /><br />It is shot in a rather naive fashion . This is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film - a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique.<br /><br />The gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the ' nutcase ' called Joe . However , the wholesome ( normal ) characters are a little too pathetic for my liking - granted , they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little OTT.<br /><br />The film starts slowly ( and the naive camera work smacks of ' B ' movie to start with ) and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur . This is one of the most ' twisted ' movies with respect to cold - hearted violence.<br /><br />After the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending I was left feeling disappointed . I would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the ' eeriness ' and nail - biting scenes earlier on in the film.<br /><br />Give it a watch and excuse the ending !
1 Savage Island 's raw savagery will scare the hell out of you ! Trust me.<br /><br />When the boy of the estranged Savage Family is run over by some city slicker tourists , Pa Savage wants revenge , and he 'll stop at nothing until he gets it.<br /><br />This is a real horror film with some truly wonderful horror moments.<br /><br />Also , the negative review clearly comes from someone who lacks proper knowledge of film . The filmmakers chose the lighting and camera - work in order to reflect the dark , murky , and egdy mood of the story ; in other words , to obtain a certain aesthetic . < br /><br />In fact , the film has won SEVERAL horror film festival awards .
1 What great locations . A visual challenge to all those who put their eye behind the lens . This little jewel is an amazing account of what you can shoot in just 16 days . Good going folks!. I can not wait to see what your next feature will be . I 'll be with you all the way .
1 I had never seen Richard Thomas play a bad guy . I was n't sure I would like him this way . And I was n't sure he could pull it off . But this astounded me . He sent shivers up my spine and caused me to take a closer look at street people . The movie is engrossing and fast paced . Bruce Davison is convincing but all he can really play is a nice guy . The real talent here is Thomas . The ending was a little clumsy but perhaps that 's the way real people would fight ... If you are a Thomas fan you MUST see him here at his best being bad !
1 A much undervalued film that tells the story of a young musician caught in an ever - declining spiral of domestic violence.<br /><br />At times difficult to watch , while Morris Day is portrayed as the misogynist , Prince as the knight on ( motorcycle ) steed , he is still called upon to twice beat a woman as part of the screenplay . That he can do this and still emerge as a flawed but vindicated hero is credit to the writing . Prince is so free of ego in this film that not only does he portray himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac who beats women , but his most famous song is fictionalised as being written by his father and Wendy & Lisa . Even further , two of his compositions - Computer Blue ( admittedly the album 's weakest track ) and Darling Nikki - are shown as being songs that kill off an audience . Perhaps the only concession to the Princely ego is a card that lists the ( slightly shorter than Prince ) Apollonia as 5'6.<br /><br />The nearly complete - amateur cast are mainly band members playing themselves ( and reviewers who slate the actors on the terms that they 've never appeared in other movies are completely missing the point ) , and do perfectly well under the direction . Morris Day gets most of the plaudits for his likable ham , though Jerome Benton must also get credit for bouncing off him well , particularly their stage act , which is hilarious . Day and Benton even go so far as to make an Abbott and Costello routine funny , which takes some doing.<br /><br />Lastly , there 's Prince . While I admit to bias , I do actually think he 's a pretty good actor in terms of being able to portray a low - key version of himself . Acting ISN'T his profession , this was a film made for entertainment , so anyone pointing out that the guy in the lead role is n't Robert DeNiro and thinking they 're making a point is sadly deluded . I do n't want this review to be a derisory attack of other people 's comments , but I 've even this film slated as having a low budget and being darkly lit . How would a film about domestic violence be shot , then ? With full overhead spotlights and a CGI dinosaur walking into frame ? < br /><br />The film acts almost as a perfect snapshot of the neon light and skinny tie era   until you remember that it was actually made in a world of curly perms and tinny synths , and this is n't some retro - recreation . Prince 's best film with Oscar - winning music , it sees him at his zenith , and it 's saddening to realise that , even though he would make some fine albums , he would never again capture this high .
1 As a big - time Prince fan of the last three to four years , I really ca n't believe I 've only just got round to watching " Purple Rain " . The brand new 2-disc anniversary Special Edition led me to buy it . Wow , I was really looking forward to watching it , but I was n't prepared for just how electric it actually is . Prince 's musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding - he REALLY has the moves in this one . I am very familiar ( from repeated listens ) with the classic " Purple Rain " album and all its songs , but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics - like COMPUTER BLUE , THE BEAUTIFUL ONES , WHEN DOVES CRY and PURPLE RAIN itself . There is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where Prince and The Revolution perform . The closing songs BABY I'M A STAR and I WOULD DIE FOR U show how much energy and sheer talent Prince was brimming with in his mid-20s ( he 's overflowing ! ) , it blew me away . It even makes Michael Jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years.<br /><br />Prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams - drive her to a lake , make her jump in , then drive off - absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the film 's overall charm . Morris Day is the coolest cat on the block ( and hilarious ) , and when his group The Time perform THE BIRD you get to see Morris Day and Jerome Benton light up the stage Minneapolis funk style - I love their dancing in this bit , and how Benton provides Morris with a mirror mid - performance.<br /><br />I already ca n't wait to watch it again , I really ca n't ! Extras are terrific - particularly seeing a young Eddie Murphy pre - Beverly Hills Cop admit he is a " Prince groupie " .
1 This electrifying musical has more than a whiff of egotism from it 's star , the musical genius that is Prince . The film is 90 or so minutes of posing but in truth it is easy to see why it is such a cult classic.<br /><br />Much like other films that centre around the struggling young musician trying to be big , this has a hint of drama in it to add a dimension to the musical numbers . While this film is n't as good as 8 mile as a recent example , this is entertaining none the less and the soundtrack is much better . On the dramatic side of things the story centres around the Kid ( Prince ) a young artist and regular spot at a club . The owner of the club is frustrated with the Kid 's arrogance and little does the Kid know that he could soon be fired and replaced by a rival . One the side the Kid 's parents are having trouble , with his dad abusing her violently . During the course of the film the Kid learns a few lessons in life , and learns to appreciate his friends more . It 's all stuff we have seen in coming of age dramas of course , but this is combined as a musical , a very stylised musical.<br /><br />The cast are good . Prince is actually quite good on the drama side , when he 's not striking a pose . He seems human and relatable . Clarence Williams is very good as the abusive father as well . Appollonia Kotero makes a good debut as Princes sexy love interest.<br /><br />The main strength of the movie however is the superb soundtrack . The musical numbers are well staged and electrifying . Prince is no doubt a musical maestro , albeit very eccentric . When he is inspired he is great but on the flip side he will often do songs that are solely for his own taste , and occasionally his experimentation can miss - fire , but that is the same for many musical geniuses . The soundtrack for this film is excellent though , with only Sexshooter being a weak point . The show - stopping performance of Purple Rain is the standout though . It is one of my all time favourite songs . * * * < br /><br / >
1 Prince stars as ' the Kid ' in this semi - autobiographical film of a talented , but narcissistic young musician who has a less then stellar home life . True the acting leaves a tad to be desired ( barring Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams who are both pitch perfect ) , but the movie is still great and among the best to come out of the 1980s . It has the best soundtrack of ANY movie of the last 50 years at least , highly quotable lines , and the dumpster scene is HILARIOUS ! ! Plus Apollonia is just simply STUNNING . On an unrelated not , when I saw Prince in concert in 2004 he blew down the stadium . He is an expert showman and it was one of the best concerts that I 've experienced.<br /><br />My Grade : A < br /><br />DVD Extras : Disc 1 ) Commentary with Director Albert Magnoli , Producer Robert Cavallo , & Director of Photography Donald Thorin ; Theatrical Trailer ; Trailers for " Under the Cherry Moon " and " Grafitti Bridge " Disc 2 ) A 12 minute featurette on the First Avenue Club ; " Purple Rain : Bachstage Pass ( a half hour featurette on the movie which i 'll review later on it 's page ) ; " Riffs , Raffs , and Revolution : the Impact and Influence of Purple Rain " 10 minute featurette ; 30 minutes of MTV 's Premiere Footage ( when MTV did n't suck donkey balls ) ; 5 Prince music videos ( Let 's Go Crazy , Take Me With You , When Doves Cry , I Would Die 4 U/ Baby I 'm a Star , and Purple Rain ) ; 2 Videos by The Time ( Jungle Love and The Bird ) ; and a music video for " Sex Shooter " by Apollonia 6<br /><br />Eye Candy : Apollonia shows her fine ass titties
1 Ok , so it may not be the award - winning " movie of the year " type - film ( apart from the brilliant soundtrack that I think won a few awards ) , but it is a really great film about ' The Kid ' ( Prince / O ( take your pick ) and the happenings around him living in Minneapolis , playing his music . The music is absolutely superb , in my opinion you HAVE to own this soundtrack , it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion . And the movie itself plays out a nice plot , it 's worth seeing over and over again , espeically if you like Prince / O ( which I do ) of course .
1 It seemed as though the year 1984 was anything but the Orwellian nightmare it was calculated to be with George Orwell 's science fiction novel ! ! 1984 turned out to be one of the happiest times in American history ! ! The upsurge in the economy , and a reemergence in basic American values , cultivated an idealistic aura of resumed innocence which was viewed by the American people with a very auspicious disposition ! ! There have been many ersatz renditions of classic movies in the past , but , the originals are almost always considered superior ! ! " Purple Rain " is such a movie in this category ! ! Made in 1984 , " Purple Rain " provided a doggerel of eighties , happy - go - lucky quality music , which they incorporated into the making of this excellent film ! ! Certain artifacts indicative of the eighties are indeed classics ! ! Screwball comedies , neon accented clothing , and of course , the music ! ! Eighties music is considered by experts to be the best decade for music in American history ! ! Set in Minneapolis , " Purple Rain " accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city . When I was a little kid , I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months , back then , the non - white population was under 3 % ! ! By 1984 , African Americans had made some in roads into Minneapolis , and , thus , they established a firmly embedded culture of their own as well ! ! The movie " Purple Rain " evokes an eighties style clothing , and music ensemble , which effortlessly captivated the movie audience ! ! I loved the music to " Purple Rain " , and , the innovative approach this film takes to confrontational success , is indeed , brilliant ! ! See this movie if you have not seen it already ! ! Prince became an eighties icon with this masterpiece ! ! For a short time , he dated Kim Bassinger , he must be doing something right ! ! " Purple Rain " put Prince on the map ! ! This film gets my emphatically assertive verdict of THUMBS UP ! ! ! !
1 Purple Rain ... what else can i say , the title speaks for itself . But i think all the actors were well picked . The movie had a great story . I loved it ! Ever since i watched that movie , i 've been stuck in the eighties , and I 'm only 13 ! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he was picking up all of his music compositions , and the Apollonia was sitting on the stairwell with his earing in her hand . Critics say that its a drama but i think its more of a romance . Murphy Brown also did a great job in the movie , he actually acted like himself . I 'm so glad I 've seen this movie . The song Purple Rain , beautifully sung , was so heartfelt . I cried more than once .
1 You can debate Prince 's acting talent , or even his choice to parody his own life in this film . There is no debate about his musical talent either then or now . He seems like a shadowy has - been twenty years later , but the music remains relevant and fantastic . < br /><br />Having lived through the hype of this movie ( graduated high school in'85 ) I can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time . From Tipper Gore ( Al 's wife ) trying to censor " Little Nikki " and every thing else under the sun via the PMRC ( Parents Music Resource Center ) to every " Air Band " at the time impersonating Prince , it was the absolute hottest thing out . For a few weeks at least , Prince was bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson . < br /><br />We all waited for the film and were soooooo excited when it premiered . It did n't disappoint . EVERYONE was caught up . I was an MTV junkie at the time(they actually played music then .... all the time)Prince played at least once or twice an hour . I must qualify this commentary by saying that , at that time , my favorites were Billy Idol , Oingo Boingo , The Fixx , Flock of Seagulls and others in the Punk/ New Wave genre ' The music of Prince at the time transcended all types and styles . One of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and contrite now is that it was SOOOOOOOO big then . All the things that remind you of the 80 's were iconic then . It was mainstream and it seems like a cliché ' now . It got so popular that it became ridiculous . It 's like the rappin ' Granny commercial for Wendy 's Hamburgers . < br /><br />It looks stupid now because EVERYONE was caught up in it ( sadly , kind of like a bizarre purple macarena or something . Anyway , I hope this gave you all a little insight .
1 I love this movie ! ! ! Purple Rain came out the year I was born and it has had my heart since I can remember . Prince is so tight in this movie . I went to a special showing of Purple Rain last night and it was like a concert i was glad to see some true fans cause this movie is so undervalued , it is really one of the greatest movies of all time . The music is untouchable . The movie is about " The Kid " , played by Prince , his family is dysfunctional , his band is the hottest act in town , and he has his eyes on the Apollonia , an aspiring singer . There is no question why purple is my favorite color I can thank " The Kid " for that . So if you have not seen this then you are need to asap . This is a classic - 4ever !
1 The movie is okay , it has it 's moments , the music scenes are the best of all ! The soundtrack is a true classic . It 's a perfect album , it starts out with Let 's Go Crazy(appropriate for the beginning as it 's a great party song and very up - tempo ) , Take Me With U(a fun pop song ... ) , The Beautiful Ones(a cheerful ballad , probably the closest thing to R&B on this whole album ) , Computer Blue(a somewhat angry anthem towards Appolonia ) , Darling Nikki(one of the funniest songs ever , it very vaguely makes fun of Appolonia ) , When Doves Cry(the climax to this masterpiece ) , I Would Die 4 U , Baby I 'm A Star , and , of course , Purple Rain(a true classic , a very appropriate ending for this classic album ) The movie and the album are both very good . I highly recommend them !
1 I own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released . Prince does n't stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything , he 's a musician and I feel like that is what he displayed here , he 's just the best one to tell this story through influence . Most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors / writers fault , still it is a great movie with even better music . The principals and moral convictions in Purple Rain are quite strong and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art .
1 This is the only movie I 've seen Prince in but it do n't matter . And I thought he was only great at singing boy was I wrong . This is probably his best performance . The music is great . That s why it won the Oscar in 1984 for best music to a movie ( or something like that ) . Now he has an Oscar and Grammies under his belt . Although the cursing gets in the way with the film ( just make sure no little kids or in the room ) . There is n't to much to say without revealing the plot . You should really go out and get this movie your collection is n't complete unless you got this movie in it . What else could I possibly say except for go and get this movie now !
1 This is NOT as bad a movie as some reviewers , and as the summary at the IMDB page for this movie , say it is . Why ? First is the fact that in 1984 the movie makers were daring enough to confront , as one of the plot elements , the issue of domestic violence -- so reviewers who complain about the plot are sadly missing one of the main points ! Second , without the plot element of Prince 's movie relationship with his abusive father , the musical climax would n't work as well as it does -- so those reviewers who say that only the music is good have , once again , missed one of the points -- specifically , WHY it is so good ... because all of the music in this film has a plot element backdrop that makes the music more effective . Third , give this movie a break ! For first - time movie producers and director , this is just not that bad ! There are far worse movies out there by accomplished movie people ! ! And last , the reviewers who say that the music is " good " have also missed the point -- check out the range of stylistic musical treatments , the variety , the musicianship , and the stage performance of Prince -- truly one of a kind , going musically where no one else was going during the 1980 's , and with a style seen in the work of other artists ( clothes and movement : which costuming elements came first , Michael Jackson 's or Prince 's ? Also , see if you can spot the splayed fingers sweeping in front of the eyes that Prince does in this movie , long before Quentin Tarentino 's " Pulp Fiction " ) . As the sum of its parts , not a bad movie at all .
1 I do n't care how many bad reviews purple rain gets , this movie rocks ! Excellent movie , has it all , great music(Prince of coarse ! ) , romance , and drama.<br /><br />This is really a very sad movie , very moving . I do n't want to say TO much more , I;m not into giving away the plot , but I will say this - the film is VERY realistic , there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems , so many familys similiar to the one depicted in the film . I see this as being very realistic and being so real , makes the movie that much more moving . My generation loved this movie growing up , so many of us loved Prince and there is alot to relate to for any teenager who has gone through similiar problems.<br /><br />That said , it 's definetly NOT just a movie for teens , I d recomend it to all age groups . And it 's not all so dark , the movie has some great music , band performance scenes , and sexy fun scenes between Prince and Appelonia .
1 " Purple Rain " has never been a critic 's darling but it is a cult classic - and deserves to be . If you are a Prince fan this is for you.<br /><br />The main plot is Prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl . Believe it or not this movie is n't just singing and dancing . There are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming . Sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works . Very hit and miss.<br /><br />No one can really act in the film . Everyone is from one of Prince 's side acts like " The Time " and " Vanity 6 " . Still , it adds charm to the movie . When ever Prince is on screen he lights it up and it fun to see him at his commercial peak . < br /><br />In conclusion , go and see this if you love Prince like me . If you are n't a fan it 'll make you one .
1 I was to young to ever know much about prince but in the past few years I 've seen a lot of Purple Rain Novelty Tee 's and i thought they were cool but i did n't want to buy a shirt i knew nothing about . So one Saturday it came on fuse and i decided to watch it . I did n't know what the movie was going to be about before i watched it but it was great once i found out . In the movie prince was n't known as prince but as " the kid " . All the performances where great to me but my favorite were Purple Rain , Darling Nicki , and I would die for you . All the songs tied into what was going on through out the movie when his mother and father were always fighting the song when doves cried described what he was feeling . I also like how clever prince was with the way he flirted with Apallonia . I liked when Prince and Appallonia first met in the club and he stood behind her standing and then once she turned around he disappeared ! great movie and now i ca nt even find one of those tee shirts :(
1 I 'll start by relating my first encounter with Prince 's music . It was in a bar , on my 39th birthday and a girl was dancing bare breasted to " 1999 " playing on the speakers . I asked people , who is this singer ? I was told it was Prince . It was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful , topless dancer . Later I started hearing other Prince songs and really " digging " them . When Purple Rain came out I still knew very little about this fellow Minnesotan . The movie blew me away . I instantly became Prince 's No . 1 fan of the " War Baby " generation . Later I found out one of my cousins was his secretary , and she got me , and my nephew into a V.I.P. Prince concert where we sat next to his mother ... how cool is that ! Getting back to the topic at hand , I agree with Siskel & Ebert who called Purple Rain an instant classic . I have seen it over 17 times and absolutely love it . I thought Prince 's acting was fine , Apollonia struggled a bit , but all in all the acting was fine . John Gielgud was not available to play ' The Kid ' so Prince took the role . The film is visually stunning , brilliantly paced ( it never gets slow ) , and terrifically directed . I rank it among the Best Movie Musicals of all time . The last time I watched it was after about a 7 year gap and it still delivered . I am so proud of fellow Minnesotan Prince Rogers Nelson and would love to tell him personally . He walked right in front of me during the above mentioned concert and said , " Hi " , to my nephew but not me . He was chatting with his mom . I was a bit crushed but he 's still No . 1 with me .
1 ' I only wanted to see you laughing in the Purple Rain . ' This is an excell film . It should have been re - rated to PG-13 . But anyways , Prince 's first film and greatest . The follow - up sucked . But I have n't seen for years so here 's what I can remember about it . The Kid ( Prince ) has to juggle with winning over the love of his life , Apollonia ( herself ) , keeping his band together ( The Revolution as themselves ) and the tension in his family . But his rival band ( The Time as themselves ) is ruining his life . Like Morris ( himself ) is trying to steal Apollonia from The Kid . Just like Saturday Night Fever , Flashdance and 8 Mile . Really good . Rent it , laugh and cry and if you luv it , buy it .
1 I 've recently went back and watched this movie again from not seeing it in years . When I first seen the movie I was too young to understand what the movie was about . Now that I 've seen it again I could n't believe what I 've missed all these years . For me being able to see movies for what they are , I think that this movie was great . Most people feel as though the music are the best part , but I do n't think that 's true . Most people do n't realize how good the story is because it 's judge by the acting . The truth of the matter is that no one in the movie were really trying to act rather they were just being themselves . The entire main cast were just playing themselves . They were n't trying to be anyone else , but themselves.<br /><br />I've actually watched and analyzed the work and effort put into the movie . Now from my perspective , the situations shown in the movie are pretty much based on what actually went on musically in Minneapolis at the time and it 's most of the things that happen are actually true events that happened in Prince 's career and who can tell it better than him ? The music that was coming from the city at the time was starting to be recognized and be revolutionary . It was interesting to see how the music was very influential mainly at the club " First Avenue & 7th St Entry " where in fact Prince , among other musicians , got their career started . It 's also a known fact that Prince and Morris Day always had a competition with each other in real life , but it was a friendly competition . They were always friends . So the story basically plays off of that competition aspect of their rivalry rather than their friendship which shows the true competitive side of what occurred at club " First Avenue " for it 's time.<br /><br />Another reason why this movie is good is due to the fact that some of the situations that occur in the movie are actually based on events that Prince has gone through in his life with the music aspect and the personal . To me , this made the movie more realistic as far as the emotion because he 's telling his trials and tribulations pre - superstardom . Plus , his dedication he puts into his performances is phenomenal . Prince made sure that every moment in the movie was done perfectly . Anytime you hear a song play in the movie it 's in perfect sync with the situation at hand.<br /><br />Prince is in all a musical genius and he has proved it on many occasions . This movie is what really put Prince on the map officially and he has n't slowed down since . Anyone who has watched this movie or still ( unbelieveably ) has n't watched it yet , when you sit down and view this film you have have to watch it with intellect or you will miss the whole aspect of the movie . If you really love music this is definitely the movie to watch . Above what anyone else says I think it 's a great movie to watch and own .
1 When this movie first came out back in 1984 , Prince was one of the hottest acts around . Everyone wanted to see this movie , which was not much more than a extended music video . The acting was pretty bad , but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time ? Despite that , it was still a very entertaining film ! Morris Day and Jerome Benton provide some all time classic comedy , especially their rendition of " The Password " , which will make you think of Abbott & Costello doing their " who 's on first " baseball routine.<br /><br />Appolina ( who went by a single name then ) provided some beautiful breasts , so you had the brief nudity covered . Plus , she is very attractive . And of course , the soundtrack of the album is one of the best Prince ever recorded . Prince later on had a fallout with Warner Bros. and changed his name , but at this particular time in his career , he was at the top of his game.<br /><br />This movie does n't rank in the all time great category , but it is pretty entertaining .
1 I have to admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures . Purple Rain not only broke boundaries , it set a decade , the costumes , the music , the behavior , and the dancing ! To this day , my friends and I still jam to the Purple Rain soundtrack and pretend to be Prince and the Revolution.<br /><br />Now the movie itself , I just meant what I said in the title , because for the most part , this movie itself is made by the music . The acting ? Please do n't let me judge on that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures , because I know that it was not Oscar worthy by any means . But I think the duo that took this movie was Morris and Jarome , their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarious . I just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because I felt that it was what made the movie.<br /><br />Prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music . While the movie and acting is pretty bad , this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too . This movie defined the 80 's , so just have fun with it . Prince would want it that way , just to party on down ! Oh , boy , that sounded lame.<br /><br />9/10
1 Our imp of the perverse did good his first time out , that s for sure . The music is the best you may ever hear by any human , but you already know that , unless you have no taste or have a brain that is too small to understand greatness . A poor script that does n't flesh out much of a story , but at least it has its moments . the breathtaking concert stuff is worth seeing it . He deserved an Oscar for this s**t , even though he was at times an ego driven twit , with his towering bodyguard Chick Huntsbery always in front . A movie that made non - fans fans , Take it or leave it . Prince does need to stay clear of acting in the future though . He takes himself way to serious . He is a genius musician , but pleaseee .. Just enjoy the ride , my purple maestro .. Peace .
1 This film is outstanding and wonderfully scored . Prince 's Oscar for music was richly deserved ( many people do n't know he won one ) . I think this is one of the best films to watch as a couple late at night on DVD . A great surprise : Prince does a fine job acting , and is pretty good at conveying pain on camera . Morris Day , Wendy , and Lisa are good in their supporting roles . Very cool landmark film .
1 And I really mean that . I caught it last night on Vh1 , and I was not expecting it to be so good . This is now one of my favorites . I must add that it has a killer soundtrack .
1 Bar some of the questionable acting ( there musicians at the end of the day ) , this in the words of Quentin Tarrinno is " The best rock movie ever made ... period" < br /><br />Think 8 Mile , but without the rapping - a young musician , trying to prove himself to the local community , whilst struggling to cope with a broken home and a rival band . Throw in the sex interest and the truly exceptional performances , this is the real 8 mile.<br /><br />Prince provides a solid performance , as does Morris Day and Jerome Benton . Decent script , good direction , great plot , and spectacular performances . Not forgetting the some of the best rock / pop / funk music you will ever hear .
1 Purple Rain is so cool for the dad . We Are Tracking 921 callers from Minneapolis . Hudson Horstachio prepares to ride a motorcycle , take a ride with Franklin Fizzlybear in the caddy . Let 's go back to 1984 , it was a movie released and Prince tripped into stardom . You would think Hudson Horstachio will be a superstar for his new movie in 20th Century Fox Movie called " VP : Purple Rain " , starring Hudson Horstachio ( voiced by Dan Green , who played Max 's Dad , the Pokemon gym leader ) . 9 Tracks . Tina Turner 's Private Dancer and Billy Ocean 's Suddenly was headed for the album as Prince held more concerts . It is time we 've pulled the plug on the 1984 movies . Our 20th Century Fox Fans are not watching anymore . The Kid yells out " Look Out For The Deer ! " is such a danger in mind , Ralph Schuckett will be composing and conducting the new movie called " VP : Purple Rain " released on video . Tom Cruise jumps into his motorcycle , Brad Pitt jumps into his motorcycle and Hudson Horstachio jumps into his motorcycle . Thanks to Bette Midler from Beaches and the keyboardists . You Are Beholding The Heroic Horstachio , Hudson ! Bart is writing " I shall not watch Purple Rain " on the chalkboard , Go On The Bloomington Ferry Bridge and enjoy The Kid 's festivities . Hudson Horstachio is watching you !
1 Purple Rain is a great film if you are a 40-something music lover who partied to Prince music in the 1980s . The story is a much - used formula : Rising musical talent must overcome personal and professional hurdles to find his audience and self - respect . Prince is a bad actor , but his performance , especially of Purple Rain / I Would Die 4 U make it worth sitting through the film . He is himself and as a showman , as powerful on stage as Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson , circa Thriller . Apollonia Kotero , a former Prince protégé , is beautiful and shows some acting talent and chemistry with Prince , but her script does n't let her far . Morris Day and other supporting actors provide comedic elements .
1 SPOILERS CONTAINED IN ORDER TO MAKE A OBSERVATION.<br /><br />Twenty years on from 1984 , this film speaks loads about Prince 's future in the music industry.<br /><br />There is a scene that sums up Prince 's musical output of the last 10 years perfectly , which is if you took the best two songs off his last 10 albums you would have one fantastic album!<br /><br />The scene plays like this . Prince runs off to his dressing room after playing one song and the owner of the club enters the dressing room to give Prince an earful about his fall from grace during the 90 's and putting out albums that only the most hardcore fans would be able to tolerate and support his artistry.<br /><br />Club owner- " You 're not packing them like you used to . The only person that digs your music is yourself!" < br /><br />Spooky huh ! How about the musical underscore which makes Prince even more evil when he smacks Apollonia to the ground in two separate scenes ! It gave me chills that that was not the only scene women where mistreated in this film.<br /><br />I'm all for the comedy sparring 's between Morris Day and Jerome Benton as these two stole every scene they were in . But what was funny about throwing a woman into a trash can ? That was plain nasty ! The other nasty bit was the chalk outline of Prince 's father on the floor thoughtfully provided by the Minnieapolis police , which causes Prince to go even more loony ! ! FANTASTIC!!<br /><br />Purple Rain is an entertaining film overall , as it is the soundtrack of Prince songs that boosts it 's value by 110 % . But then again the film gives us another theory on Prince and his music , as the film tells us that Prince 's biggest song of the film is written by Wendy , lisa and Princes wife beating musical father!<br /><br />Are Prince and the filmmakers trying to tell us that Prince stole all his best songs from his father after finding his fathers music sheets of written songs ? Maybe that is why Prince started to run out of steam during the 90 's because he ran out of his fathers ideas??? ........... Hmmmm .....
1 This film speaks a universal language ; one can relate it to the self , community , society or the wider world . It has a way of not only opening up several questions but also setting one in pursuit of discovering and asking the right questions in order to get to that point of self conviction / ownership . The portrayal of the stereotypes within the film addresses the archetypes around us which must be recognised as being the repeating cycle of destruction , the opposing force of innovation , creativity and growth . The factors which disturb the natural flow of things must be made apparent and tackled . The Idea , is definitely a film to be experienced and not just viewed as it taps into one 's internal voice / conscience through the looking , it makes one feel as opposed to just watch .
1 Interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve . It also addresses the issue how we tend to ignore those among us who are not as outspoken and by doing this may miss out on a great opportunity . The injection of comedy also makes watching the film an enjoyable experience .. A must see for anyone who is interested in a reflective yet comical look at life . I am eagerly looking forward to your next product . Hope that you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment . Excellent work ...... Joanne
1 I saw this film with a special screening of the work of Owen Alik Shahadah . It is so interesting where did this guy come from . Now he is probably the key independent African filmmaker in the world . And I am not talking about black filmmakers I am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture . The idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of African themes , with his film 500 Years Later it is a African issue . But the Idea does n't fit that mold . Showing the artistic diversity . The film is an all African cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to . I just love the mild comedy in it . And the Kora of Tunde Jegede is just amazing , it is really a art - house gem .
1 This film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing . We as a people of African descent owe it to ourselves to make a change to this cycle of " all talk and no action " and start to realise in order to make a change , there needs to be less talk and more action . It is a powerful statement of the divisions of our people over small issues , and our failings to recognise the bigger picture and the need to unite in order to make a difference ... Despite its reference to the black community , all viewers can learn something from the message this film seeks to portray .
1 The idea is a very smart title the film has a serious tongue in cheek feel to it . But it is so subtle you do n't know how to read it ! Are these guys doing a full blown comedy or is there something else going on . The little dialogue the film has is n't very delicate and this adds to the power of the film . If all the sound was switched off from the film it actually would n't take anything away from the film . The physical actions or the art of showing is so strong that it on its own carries the entirety of the story.<br /><br />I is a blessing and with the blessing the emotion is followed by shame . I first say this film as part of a " black " film festival . After watching the film i was so impressed by the work . But then i asked myself what next ? Where can someone else see this work ? The common association of art without purpose is n't to be found here . You can see the intention in the design from the start to the finish . The usage of African music the style the casting everything seems planned and for a reason . The character development is amazing . The casting i think is the strongest aspect of the film ; the characters are easily defined within 2 minutes of the 6 minutes of actual film.<br /><br />We need to see more of these kinds of films , there really needs to be greater support for the development of short films across the board .
1 The idea ia a very short film with a lot of information . Interesting , entertaining and leaves the viewer wanting more . The producer has produced a short film of excellent quality that can not be compared to any other short film that I have seen . I have rated this film at the highest possible rating . I also recommend that it is shown to office managers and business people in any establishment . What comes out of it is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to , their voice is never heard . It is a lesson to be learned by any office that wants to go forward . I hope that the produced will produce a second part to this ' idea ' . I look forward to viewing the sequence . Once again congrats to Halaqah media in producing a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind .
1 Considering the lack of art with in African cinema ( or Black American Cinema ) . The Idea offers a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and dealers . But the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short . But it is the unstated assertion of independence from these themes that is most sticking . The genre is unique and not the typical expectation . It is almost this departure which first catches the eye , so watching it twice is critical . The film has an aesthetic quality which lends its self to the true art of cinema.<br /><br />And it is this true art that with an African voice that is extremely rare . The film does n't copy to attain its message , it innovates and provokes by pulling at subtle stereotypes ( not racial but character based stereotypes ) , From a writers perspective the film is brilliant . It carries multiply messages which include a very rapid character development . It must be remember this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish character very quickly . The usage of colour texture and music is also to be commended . But considering the director , Owen Alik Shahadah 's last venture 500 Years Later , music is to be expected . But from a theme point - of view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satire eludes indirectly to a social problembrilliant stuff !
1 Probably the first Portuguese film I have seen in my life , and I enjoyed it . The plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in Portugal in 1974 , to finally defeat the fascist government of Caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies , i.e. Mozambique , Angola , and Guinea ( Bissau)- Cape Vert . Most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup , of the oppressed people , who were very happy with this new development and the liberty , the resistance of Caetano 's men , and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials , including Spinola , who took over as the new president . The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers , but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should develop itself democratically , and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution . The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone ; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end .
1 Being half - portuguese does n't render me half - blind ( nor half - prejudiced ) when discussing portuguese films . Not that I get to do that very often anyway . But this film was such a rush of adrenaline ! Yes , that 's right - it was mostly accurate as far as history went / goes - but it pulled no punches on venturing beyond usual portuguese - film territory : things like using real locations in the middle of traffic - congested Lisbon and recruiting a real crowd to stand in for the real crowd of almost 30 years ago . And by God did they get it right ! OK , to sum it up : very emotional if you 've lived through it , but you 'll spot minor improvements that could have been made as well as plot necessities that were . If you 're just watching it randomly , you 're in for a good historical romp , only of the very recent History kind and a bit more thought - proving than usual . Even by European standards , yes .
1 " Capitães de Abril " is a very good . The story is n't a documentary about the 1974 revolution in Portugal . But it gives us an idea of how it was like . The fiction of the story is n't of great interest , but it does n't spoil the movie . The heroic actions of Captain Salgueiro Maia are n't exaggerations and the film is also a tribute for his deeds . Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the 25th of April Revolution.<br /><br />All the actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully . Lisbon looks beautiful as ever . Do n't miss it ! I liked this film very much .
1 You know ? Our spirit is based on that revolution , it 's asleep ... I can explain , I think ! ! Well ... Until that happen on 25th April 1974 , our freedom was limited , we did n't had liberty of speech , but when we got it at the revolution , it seems that Portuguese People lost his opinion , we do n't use our liberty of speech ! That 's all a consequence of the revolution ! I think that 's clear ! ... About the movie ... I think that it has a few mistakes on some character 's acting , but by the way I use to watch on Portuguese movies it 's quite good ! ! I like it very much !
1 Principally it is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution . It was easy to understand the contest , but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else , or they shows also the period before or after this fact , here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts . It could also be seen as a kind of documentary . The movie focalize to these two people , showing as normal they were , not like common heroes , because the revolution come from people . Although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just " capitaes " as the main characters . Nice colors and lights during the whole movie , excellent work for the director being her first movie , she does n't fall to the banal way . Well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd . The character of Maia ( main one)is well - made and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi , able to show Maia 's limits , this not - being an hero .
1 A true story about a true revolution , 25 of April ; a revolution against a repressive regime of 41 years , that was imposing a colonial war on it 's military 's , for maintaining an empire ( Angola , Mozambique , Guine - Bissau , Cabo Verde , S. Tomé e Principe ; the first and the last of the great colonial empire 's of Europe ) of 600 years , since it 's beginning in the conquest of Ceuta in 1415 ; a revolution by the army for the people , and for a democratic Portugal ; the most 's surprising fact in this revolution is that it were no people killed in it ( except those that died in the hand 's of PIDE , the political police of the State , during a brutal gunfire against an unarmed crowd protesting in front of it 's headquarters in the day of the revolution , in 25 of April 1974 , has it show 's on the film).And has all revolutions it has it 's heroes , one them of was Captain Salgueiro Maia , a returned soldier from the war , whose convictions along with the rest of the army , was that they were fighting ( since 1961 ) a hopeless war , and that sometimes a soldier has to disobey it 's country .
1 Several story lines are interwoven here around different women characters . The shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives . All are transformed at the end of the movie . Adela ( Antonia San Juan ) leads a brothel ; Her daughter Anita ( Monica Cervera ) is retarded and has a restricted life . Leire ( Najwa Nimri ) is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend ; Maricarmen ( Vicky Peña ) has lost her husband and now raises the children from his deceased former wife . Isabel ( Ángela Molina ) is a bored rich lady.<br /><br />Other characters are used to connect the five main women characters . In storytelling not everything is given away in the beginning : Some connections are established surprisingly late in the movie and that adds to the experience . The shoe - theme is driven to extremes : For example when Leire as a shoe - designer and working in a shoe store where she steals her shoes faints , she breaks one of her heels.<br /><br />In editing small connections are made between the scenes . A telephone rings , a cigarette is lit , a song , etc . are used to make the connection and fast cuts . Frequent change of storyline keeps it from being boring or reaching TV - levels . It is strongly music - driven to set tone and atmosphere . The cities of Madrid and Lisbon serve as the backdrop for the stories , and shots of those cities are used to extend the story beyond the characters . One of the more moving shots is when Anita , who makes the same walk every day , widens her walk and restricted life from the relative calm of her street to the busy main road : How the restriction of space is visually translated is well done . As with most Spanish movies a lot of storytelling is done visually , using the soap - like stories as the simple backdrop . There is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental but is still beautiful.<br /><br />As Ramón Salazar is too much in love with his own material it is overlong . Some scenes are kitsch and on the soap level , including the acting ( Adela 's love life , Isabel 's doctor ) . The shoe - theme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor.<br /><br />This is often compared to Magnolia because the structure is the same . But they are different . Magnolia is more technically competent , but somewhat mechanical . This has more the ability to translate emotion and atmosphere visually . After seeing this , you are inclined to immediately move to the new movie - city : Madrid .
1 Since I watched it for the first time , " Piedras " is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures I actually could watch over and over again . The great screenplay depicts the lives of a bunch of women ( all of them somehow interconnected ) with deep understanding and sensibility . Ramón Salazar achieved a compelling film in his directorial debut , and proves himself as an efficient actors ' director . < br /><br />Not that all performances are excellent , though . Of all leading ladies , they range from average ( Najwa Nimri ) to very good ( Vicky Peña ) , but the standing ovation should be directed to newcomer Mónica Cervera , who convincingly plays Antonia San Juan 's retarded daughter . Enrique Alcides is irresistibly charming as the girl 's male nurse , and there are nice small turns from Andrés Gertrúdix , Geli Albaladejo and the director himself , Ramón Salazar.<br /><br />"Piedras " is beautifully written and filmed , when I watched it I got so moved that I could n't stop thinking of it for days . I highly recommend it .
1 Women have never looked so attractive and pathetic as in Salazar 's film Piedras . Although editor 's cut here and there might help the film , it is exciting and enjoyable with an intense mark from Pedro Almodovar 's latest films . 5 different women are coping with their male partners and families . Beginning with several different stories bound to meet as the plot goes on , Salazar portraits his women characters in the same neurotic and border - line behaviour familiar to Almodovar . A kleptomaniac high society lady with a fattish to smaller shoes , a burlesque house madam taking care of her disabled daughter , a drug addict dancer obsessed with her former boyfriend and a taxi - driver taking care of her late husband 's disturbed kids , all roaming the streets of Madrid in well designed scenes . Using some of Almodovar 's familiar actresses , the director succeeds in it 's first film to give depth to all the characters sharing the film , and to create genuine sympathy with each of them . The women controls the plot line , and the men are bound to be left with each other , eventually ... Surprisingly good for a first film , and worth the time in any standard . It is noticeable that Salazar hesitated in some needed guidelines to the actresses , but an impressible act is shown anyway on the screen , especially by Monica Cervera , which played in his former short film.<br /><br />A must to all Almodovar 's fans , and enjoyable to all .
1 Well i do disagreed with the other comment posted . Piedras is much much better them Magnolia or any of the other films that were mentioned.<br /><br />specially about non real characters , i think that someone just wrote that only because he never lived in the Spanish society like i did ( and i 'm not Spanish ) , is a very real film with real characters , very well done by one of the best Spanish actress Antonia San Juan.<br /><br />about be a European film in contrast with an American film , well we different societies , personally i dislike American modern films a lot ( i like the classics and some of the Andy American films but they are very few).<br /><br />Is a film about the continuous Constitution of a person , liked or not we all make mistakes but some can learn about the mistakes .
1 In life , we first organize stones ( Piedras in Spanish ) such as a career , family , friendship , and love . In this way , we shall find space between these to fit smaller stones , our small necessities . If you act in an inverse way , you will not have enough room for larger stones . The five protagonists in this film are women who have not been able to organize the large " stones " in their lives . Ramon Salazar , a Spanish motion picture director defines his first feature Stones in this way . The film tells the parallel , conflicting trajectory of five women : Anita ( Monica Cervera , 1975- ) , Isabel ( Angela Molina , 1955- ) , Adela ( Antonia San Juan , 1961- ) , Leire ( Najwa Nimri , 1972- ) , and Maricarmen ( Vicky Pena , 1954-).All are endeavoring to remove the stones that insistently appear in their path or , worst , that are in their shoes . They are five Cinderellas in search of Prince Charming and a new chance in life . The best story of these five Cinderellas is that of Anita ( Monica Cervera ) who also stars in " 20 Centimeters , " " Busco , " " Crimen Ferpecto , " " Entre Vivir y Sonar , " " Hongos , " and " Octavia .

1 I saw this movie at the 18th Haifa film festival , and it is one of the best I 've seen this year . Seeing it on a big screen ( and I mean BIG , not one of those TV screens most cinemas have ) with an excellent sound system always enhance the cinematic experience , as the movie takes over your eyes and ears and sucks you into the story , into the picture.<br /><br />The movie presents a set of characters , which are loosely inter - connected . Their stories cross at certain points , and the multiplicity of story lines reminded me very much of the great Robert Altman and his exquisite films . But the true hero of the movie is obviously the city of Madrid , which provides the backdrop for the entire movie . It houses the characters , contains the pavements and roads on which they walk , and sets the background atmosphere for all the events , all in beautifully filmed scenes.<br /><br />The movie returns again and again to certain themes ( shoes , for instance ) , and in essence Salazar makes his metaphores more and more understandable to the viewer as the movie progresses . He combines the views of the city with the shots of the characters , and elegantly matches the feeling of the scene to the background . A set of talented actors helps him portrait a wide variety of characters . One excellent example is the scene in which Juaquin takes Anita across the street for the first time . It might not work on a small screen , but it gave me goose bumps easily on a big screen.<br /><br />The message of the movie is very positive , and accordingly the movie is light and funny at times . The music along the movie is usually pop , with a few instrumental pieces ( I hope to put my hand on the soundtrack one day , although I seriously doubt I will).<br /><br />All together , I came out of this movie with a sensational feeling , and I 'm not easily impressed ( you 'll have to take my word for it ) . For this and more I give this movie a solid 8/10 .
1 The movie begins a with mentally - challenged girl with bright yellow sneakers looking skyward on a Madrid street corner and being spellbound by a passing plane . The movie examines the life of five womenAdela , Leire , Maricarmen , Anita & Isabelwho have completely different lives and choices of shoes . Their shoes is the first superficial , yet affixed with some glancing meaning , clue we get at their fragile identities . In a theatrically embroidered and embellished way , a podiatrist tries to esoterically reveal the deepest secrets of a woman 's souls by the sole of her feet . The premise is risky and slightly contrived , but the tone and depth of the movie takes a daring plunge for the good.<br /><br />What may have been light - hearted and superficial , quickly switches gear with the a superb dysfunctional couple scene that leaves the viewer riveted for minutes , seeing the love or lack thereof , the pain , the confusion , the hope , the needs and escape mechanisms develop through minutes different rooms of the house and down to the street and eventually below ... What a scene ( ! ) , but there will be others as effective to follow and strengthen the strong characterization and directing displayed in this slice of life affair.<br /><br />Moving along , a woman has lost the husband she loved and inherited his kids and his taxi , while another has completely lost her husband emotionally , sexually , intellectually , but not physically . A ghost , a pending divorce   reproach , regret & remorse . A new love ? Can you love a mirage ? Can you love the person in the mirror ? Can you love someone you ca n't love ? Or think you ca n't love ? Can you love and live life even though it will always be somewhat hopeless ? Yet is n't it exactly these hopes and dreams that keep us here grounded and in a spectrum of relative happiness ? A lot of deep themes emerge and the final act brings people and ideas together to coalesce in an existential crisis with no clear cut solution , definitive decision or effective healing . Maybe a elusive thought , a fleeting feeling , but a lasting appreciation of life and of the artistry and intellect of the film . Live . Live again . Rewind the reel . Unveil the real , the important ; the big stones ( piedras ) of life . The rest is just details .
1 Spanish films are into a , if not Golden , definitely a Silver Age . Piédras is another example of a movie that takes people and their conflicts seriously . Although the feelings are strong or nearly at life or death - level , they still are n't really melodramatic . This could happen.<br /><br />There are different stories here , which become connected . One is about the retarded girl , who does n't dare to pass the street to the next block . One is about the middle - aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fetischist . Another is about the girl with drug problems who 's lover leaves her . Still another one is about the madame of a brothel who ( almost ) finds true love.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing . It 's in Spain the moviemakers take women seriously .
1 a pure reality bytes film . Fragile , beautiful and amazing first film of the director . Represented Spain on the Berlinale 2002 . Some people has compared the grammar of the film with Almodovar 's films ... Well , that should n't be a problem ...
1 Domestic Import was a great movie . I laughed the whole time . It was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations . The acting was great . Alla Korot , Larry Dorf , Howard Hesseman , and all the others did an awesome job . Because it is an independent film written by a first - time writer , it does n't have the clichés that are expected of other comedies , which was such a relief . It was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart - warming story . I heard it was based on a true story ? If so , then that is hilarious ( and amazing ! ) . I highly recommend this movie .
1 I gave this movie such a high mark because it was really cute , really funny , all while being unpretentious . I went to see this film when it was playing in the Philly area , and it was the centerpiece of a great night out with friends . The film is well written and well acted , and though it does feel a bit like a sitcom rather then a movie , that does n't take away from the film . You just do n't find comedies like this anymore , where you do n't have to shock people to be funny . The film centers around a Ukranian housekeeper that finds herself working for a young couple in need of help . Though at first she helps , soon she adds more craziness to their lives then the couple bargained for . Things get further and further out of control until .... you'll have to see ! The banter had me laughing , even after leaving the theater . This film just put me in a good mood . I ca n't wait until it is released on DVD because I want this movie in my collection .
1 Adorable ! I saw Domestic Import in Philly in October with my kids . We all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents . I have n't heard them laugh like that in years ! It was the first time that I can remember seeing a movie that my parents and my kids could enjoy . It 's really cute and we ca n't wait for it to come out on DVD . They need to make more movies like Domestic Import . It is refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy ( and not be embarrassed ) . I have not seen a movie this cute since My Big Fat Greek Wedding . I loved Mindy Sterling as the mother . She was also in Austin Powers . Howard Hesseman is in this too and he is hilarious . I remember him from WKRP .
1 A charming , funny film that gets a solid grade all around . I saw a screener of this film recently at work . It was so nice to see this film in contrast with all the crappy horror movies I see every day . So much so , that I figured I 'd write in . Not sure if this film is going to theaters , but I hope it does . Its a nice film to see with friends , its a charmer , and has some funny jokes . The acting was terrific ( especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf . The directing was pretty good ( not a film that needed to be over - directed ) . What really makes this film stand out I think is the writing . It was like Neil Simon , Seinfeldish , and the banter between characters is smart and has a nice rhythm . As an aspiring screenwriter , I notice those things ! ( I 'm a dork ) . Anyway , a really cute film that I recommend .
1 I saw this independent film when it was in Philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise . I left the theater with a smile on my face . One of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story -hilarious ! It has some great character actors in it too . Mindy Sterling is in it and is very good . I loved her in Austin Powers . Howard Hesseman is also terrific . I remember him from Head of the Class . I am tired of all the dark edgy movies that keep getting made . This is fun and light , and I can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed . I keep checking to see when it will come out on DVD . I will definitely buy it .
1 I am the parent of a special needs child and I enjoyed the the movie very much ! It was loving , warm and fun . I learned a long time ago to see the humor in things . I especially thought it was sweet how all the other characters worried about Frankie and who would take care of him after his grandmother died . I attended a focus screening of the film with other parents and siblings of special needs children before the film was edited . Everyone enjoyed the film and it actually inspired wonderful discussions . We talked about how our kids make us laugh and we also talked about how we worry about them . The screenwriter talked about how she work with autistic children and other special needs children as a volunteer for several years . She based the character on a real person . Our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has gotten us through some very stressful times . I give the movie two thumbs up ! ! !
1 I think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction . The way it shows the various communities leaving together in Thailand is very interesting ... The Portuguese , the Japanese , and the various communities being managed by the king . The plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of treason . The wardrobe is fine . The film is also done locally in Thailand in a reasonable production . The scene with the elefant as executors is very interesting . It is fun and I think that is also usable in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the European in Asia were subjects of the local kings in way very different from the traditional Hollywood perspective .
1 A fabulous film . With everything you could want in a film . Huge battle scenes and lots of other action . Suspense , and a romantic love story . < br /><br />Kind of like an old swashbuckler film . Totally entertaining from start to finish . < br /><br />The editing was fast and you are never bored for a second . The story is like a classic story of trouble in the Royal Household . The actors are beautiful and the sets magnificent . The costumes are spectacular and the stunt work is imaginative . The special effects are amazing too.<br /><br />Gary Stretch is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous to look at . He looks like a sure bet for Super Stardom . < br /><br />John Rhys - Davies is wonderful as he usually is . He is one of the great actors of our time.<br /><br />And Cindy Burbridge , Ex Miss Thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady , even doing an English accent with remarkable success . < br /><br />I found out that the film has won numerous awards , and i can see why.<br /><br />All in all this is an amazing Independent film . See it for sure . < br /><br />I highly recommend it . And give it a TEN + ! ! !
1 " Hollywood Hotel " is a fast - moving , exuberant , wonderfully entertaining musical comedy from Warners which is sadly overlooked . It should be remembered if only for providing the official theme song of Tinseltown -- " Hooray for Hollywood . " The score by Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer has a number of other gems , however , including the charming " I 'm Like a Fish Out of Water , " and " Silhouetted in the Moonlight . " The best musical number is " Let That Be a Lesson to You , " in which Dick Powell and company detail the misadventures of people who found themselves " behind the eight - ball , " a fate which literally befalls slow - burning Edgar Kennedy at the number 's end . The picture celebrates Hollywood glamour and punctures it all at once , as it gets a lot of comic mileage out of pompous and ego - maniacal actors and duplicitous studio executives . The cast includes a gaggle of great character comedians -- Allyn Joslyn as a crafty press agent , Ted Healy as Dick Powell 's would - be manager , Fritz Feld as an excitable restaurant patron , Glenda Farrell as Mona Marshall 's sarcastic Gal Friday , Edgar Kennedy as a put - upon drive - in manager , Mabel Todd as Mona 's goofy sister , and Hugh Herbert as her even goofier dad . The " racist " element mentioned in another review here is a ten - second bit where Herbert appears in black - face during a pseudo-"Gone With the Wind " sequence . It 's in questionable taste , but it should n't prevent you from seeing the other delights in this film , notably the Benny Goodman Quartet ( including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton ! ) in what I believe is the only footage available on this incredible jazz combo . The " Dark Eyes " sequence goes on a bit too long and comes in too late , but otherwise " Hollywood Hotel " is a gem , well worth your time and certainly a film which should be considered for DVD release .
1 " Hollywood Hotel " has relationships to many films like " Ella Cinders " and " Merton of the Movies " about someone winning a contest including a contract to make films in Hollywood , only to find the road to stardom either paved with pitfalls or non - existent . In fact , as I was watching it tonight , on Turner Classic Movies , I was considering whether or not the authors of the later musical classic " Singing In The Rain " may have taken some of their ideas from " Hollywood Hotel " , most notably a temperamental leading lady star in a movie studio and a conclusion concerning one person singing a film score while another person got the credit by mouthing along on screen.<br /><br />"Hollywood Hotel " is a fascinating example of movie making in the 1930s . Among the supporting players is Louella Parsons , playing herself ( and , despite some negative comments I 've seen , she has a very ingratiating personality on screen and a natural command of her lines ) . She is not the only real person in the script . Make - up specialist Perc Westmore briefly appears as himself to try to make one character resemble another.<br /><br />This film also was one of the first in the career of young Mr. Ronald Reagan , playing a radio interviewer at a movie premiere . Reagan actually does quite nicely in his brief scenes - particularly when he realizes that nobody Dick Powell is about to take over the microphone when it should be used with more important people.<br /><br />Dick Powell has won a Hollywood contract in a contest , and is leaving his job as a saxophonist in Benny Goodman 's band . The beginning of this film , by the way , is quite impressive , as the band drives in a parade of trucks to give a proper goodbye to Powell . They end up singing " Hooray For Hollywood " . The interesting thing about this wonderful number is that a lyric has been left out on purpose . Throughout the Johnny Mercer lyrics are references to such Hollywood as Max Factor the make - up king , Rin tin tin , and even a hint of Tarzan . But the original song lyric referred to looking like Tyrone Power . Obviously Jack Warner and his brothers were not going to advertise the leading man of 20th Century Fox , and the name Donald Duck was substituted . In any event the number showed the singers and instrumentalists of Goodman 's orchestra at their best . So did a later five minute section of the film , where the band is rehearsing.<br /><br />Powell leaves the band and his girl friend ( Frances Langford ) and goes to Hollywood , only to find he is a contract player ( most likely for musicals involving saxophonists ) . He is met by Allen Joslyn , the publicist of the studio ( the owner is Grant Mitchell ) . Joslyn is not a bad fellow , but he is busy and he tends to slough off people unless it is necessary to speak to them . He parks Powell at a room at the Hollywood Hotel , which is also where the studio 's temperamental star ( Lola Lane ) lives with her father ( Hugh Herbert ) , her sister ( Mabel Todd ) , and her sensible if cynical assistant ( Glenda Farrell ) . Lane is like Jean Hagen in " Singing In The Rain " , except her speaking voice is good . Her version of " Dan Lockwood " is one " Alexander Dupre " ( Alan Mowbray , scene stealing with ease several times ) . The only difference is that Mowbray is not a nice guy like Gene Kelly was , and Lane ( when not wrapped up in her ego ) is fully aware of it . Having a fit on being by - passed for an out - of - the ordinary role she wanted , she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest film . Joslyn finds a double for her ( Lola 's real life sister Rosemary Lane ) , and Rosemary is made up to play the star at the premiere and the follow - up party . But she attends with Powell ( Joslyn wanting someone who does n't know the real Lola ) . This leads to Powell knocking down Mowbray when the latter makes a pest of himself . But otherwise the evening is a success , and when the two are together they start finding each other attractive.<br /><br />The complications deal with Lola coming back and slapping Powell in the face , after Mowbray complains he was attacked by Powell ( " and his gang of hoodlums " ) . Powell 's contract is bought out . Working with photographer turned agent Ted Healey ( actually not too bad in this film - he even tries to do a Jolson imitation at one point ) , the two try to find work , ending up as employees at a hamburger stand run by bad tempered Edgar Kennedy ( the number of broken dishes and singing customers in the restaurant give Edgar plenty of time to do his slow burns with gusto ) . Eventually Powell gets a " break " by being hired to be Dupre 's singing voice in a rip - off of " Gone With The Wind " . This leads to the final section of the film , when Rosemary Lane , Herbert , and Healey help give Powell his chance to show it 's his voice , not Mowbrays.<br /><br />It 's quite a cute and appealing film even now . The worst aspects are due to it 's time . Several jokes concerning African - Americans are no longer tolerable ( while trying to photograph Powell as he arrives in Hollywood , Healey accidentally photographs a porter , and mentions to Joslyn to watch out , Powell photographs too darkly - get the point ? ) . Also a bit with Curt Bois as a fashion designer for Lola Lane , who is ( shall we say ) too high strung is not very tolerable either . Herbert 's " hoo - hoo"ing is a bit much ( too much of the time ) but it was really popular in 1937 . And an incident where Healey nearly gets into a brawl at the premiere ( this was one of his last films ) reminds people of the tragic , still mysterious end of the comedian in December 1937 . But most of the film is quite good , and wo n't disappoint the viewer in 2008 .
1 When we talk Hollywood Hotel we could be talking about one of three things , the actual hotel , the radio program , and this film which was partially inspired by the first two . Dick Powell was the host of the Hollywood Hotel program on CBS radio network in which Louella Parsons dished out the weekly scoop on the stars.<br /><br />Powell and Parsons debuted the Hollywood Hotel program in 1934 so by 1937 it had its fair share of the radio audience . Powell hosted , sang , and kibitzed with Louella and her movie star guests . With the power she had with her column , she was able to get the various stars to go on and plug their latest films for nothing.<br /><br />Then the American Federation of Radio Artists stepped in and demanded she pay wages accordingly and they won the case . That ended the Hollywood Hotel program in 1938 . Of course both Powell and Louella went on to other radio venues . The whole story is covered in the Tony Thomas book , The Films Of Dick Powell.<br /><br />But before the plug was pulled this film came out from Powell 's home studio of Warner Brothers inspired by the radio program . Powell plays a singer / saxophonist with the Benny Goodman band who gets signed to a Hollywood contract . But when he gets out to Hollywood he gets himself tangled up with an egotistical film star Lola Lane , her lookalike double real life sister Rosemary Lane , and a ham actor in Alan Mowbray.<br /><br />When Mowbray is called upon to sing in a Civil War epic he 's making with Lola Lane , it 's Powell 's voice they use . Then Mowbray develops a Lina Lamont problem when he 's asked to go on the Hollywood Hotel radio program , broadcast from the Hollywood Hotel . That 's got the studio in a tizzy . Let 's say the problem is n't solved the way it is Singing In The Rain , but Powell 's manager Ted Healy proves to be resourceful.<br /><br />Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer provide a really nice score for the film . The big hit song comes right at the beginning as the Benny Goodman band with scat singing Johnnie Davis sing Hollywood 's anthem , Hooray for Hollywood . My favorite however is Powell and Rosemary Lane singing , I 'm Like A Fish Out Of Water . Just listening to Johnny Mercer 's lyrics about Ginger Rogers running the Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand without her fan , it 's a compendium of American popular culture in the Thirties.<br /><br />Busby Berkeley does the choreography here and while the film does n't have the soaring imaginary stuff that his earlier work with Warner Brothers has , the numbers are well staged . Berkeley 's big moment is in a drive - in eatery where Powell and Healy have been forced to take jobs . The number starts with Benny Goodman broadcasting from the Hollywood Hotel doing Let That Be A Lesson To You and then at the drive - in Powell , Lane and the entire place start joining in song to the exasperation of owner Edgar Kennedy . And you know what you can expect from Edgar Kennedy exasperation.<br /><br />Benny Goodman gets to show why he was named the King Of Swing when the band with drummer Gene Krupa and xylophonist Lionel Hampton as part of his ensemble . That together with Frances Langford singing as well . And possibly the last surviving cast member of the group was a fellow who had a small bit as a radio announcer . He died in 2004 , but not before he became the 40th President of the United States . Ronald Reagan always credited Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien as being the two guys on Warner Brothers who were the most helpful to an eager young player looking to make his mark.<br /><br />Hollywood Hotel is one delightful and entertaining motion picture , dated , but charmingly so .
1 I 'm not a fan of Adam Sandler . In fact , I do n't think I 've ever liked him in anything I 've seen him in . The opening scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears . There was Adam Sandler , playing a somewhat ridiculous looking character riding around New York City on a motor scooter , looking pitiful and lost . Typical Sandler - type loser character again , I thought . I almost gave up then and there . But then , as I stuck with this , I actually discovered something I never knew before : Adam Sandler can act ! He is truly outstanding in this movie as Charlie , a lost and lonely figure , whose entire family ( including the dog ) was killed in one of the hijacked planes on 9/11 and who has apparently lost all touch with reality as a result . Don Cheadle plays his former college roommate who unexpectedly reconnects with Charlie and takes it on as his mission to help him get better . Of course , Cheadle 's Alan Johnson has his own problems and sources of unhappiness , and somehow these two men manage to help each other through their difficulties . The two of them made a completely believable team , and Sandler in particular made Charlie real , working through his emotions and feelings . This is not a Sandler comedy . If your looking for that go to some of his other , sillier , stuff . This is a pretty heavy movie - sometimes sad , sometimes hopeful and always engrossing . There are some funny parts in it . I loved the scene in which Charlie convinces Alan to confront his partners by reminding him of how tough he was in college , and then the conversation the two of them have afterward.<br /><br />I personally did n't think that Saffron Burrows added much to the movie as Donna , an obviously needy patient of Johnson 's . The only reason for the character seemed ( based on one flashback ) to be that she looked eerily like Charlie 's late wife , but that was never really developed , and I just did n't care that much for the character . Do look for the part of the judge , however , played by Donald Sutherland , who I thought nailed the part bang - on . As far as I 'm concerned , though , this is Sandler 's movie , and kudos to him for a great performance . Definitely his best in my opinion . 8/10
1 A powerfully wonderful movie . You are held in a death - grip once you let yourself get involved with the story . A successful dentist , Alan Johnson(Don Cheadle ) , is torn in a life crisis of balancing his career with his family . He notices his former college roommate Charlie Fineman(Adam Sandler)and wants to touch base . He finds that Charlie , who lost his wife and family in the 9 - 11 attack on America , is no longer in touch with reality ... choosing to involve his mind with his favorite music from the past and video games . The former roommates rekindle their friendship and strengthen their former bond . Johnson has his friend Angela Oakhurts(Liv Tyler ) , a psychiatrist , to try and bring Charlie out of his grief ... but it is Alan that accomplishes in getting his friend to emerge from his deep darkness . Jada Pinkett Smith plays Johnson 's wife . Writer and director Mike Binder plays the role of Charlie 's attorney / guardian . Also in the cast : Saffron Burrows , Donald Sutherland , Adell Modell and Robert Klein . Outstanding soundtrack featuring the likes of Bruce Springsteen , Graham Nash , Pear Jam and The Pretenders.<br /><br />NOTE : I have never been a Sandler fan ; but I found him outstanding in this role . In some of the scenes , I thought out loud ... why has he never been approached to play singer / songwriter Bob Dylan in a biopic .
1 Sandler is amazing again ... I have already become a Sandler fan . This movie is the saddest Sandler story . Its expression is fantastic . I cried more watching Click but there are some similar points . To consider the value of the family before losing it and to be able to say ' I love you ' are a few of the most impressive truths in life ... It is tough , it is real ... and actually there is a real owner of this success , Binder . I do n't think another director could give these emotions in such a way . < br /><br />Cheadle and Burrows are also amazing ... Cheadle is one of my favorites since Crash . Do n't expect laughing or much positive atmosphere ... If you are ready to face the realities of life , do n't miss this movie .
1 * * Possible Spoiler * * * Adam Sandler is usually typecast in Comedy , but in " Reign",gives a deeply moving performance . While there are people who showed Courage facing post September 11,2001,Sandler plays Fineman , a widower who is lonely and " lost in his own world".Johnson(Cheadle),a practicing dentist , encounters his old College buddy(Sandler)and wants to catch up on " Old times".We see , as in Rain Man(Dustin Hoffman),Fineman also gets emotional and withdrawn in stressful situations . Oldies music , appears to be a comfort and " Psychological " crutch for him to lean on.<br /><br />Johnson looks for , in Fineman , that certain pleasure and ease missing in his Family . He also feels unhappy and unsatisfied in his Job . In the same instance , He also wants to make sure his friend does not fall through the social " cracks".I came away from this movie , with a different outlook and more sympathetic Compassion for grieving families .
1 For those of you that do n't that reference , clubberin was 4 fists hitting one body ... <br /><br />Anyways , onto the review.<br /><br />I miss WCW Saturday Night . Some of my favorite wrestling moments took place on this stage . I remember watching Stunning Steve Austin , Rick Rude , Brian Pillman , Cactus Jack , Dustin Rhodes , Johnny B. Badd , DDP in his jobber days , Lord Steven Regal , Harlem Heat , Ricky Steamboat , STING ... I'd be here a while listing everyone . Point is WCW had an awesome roster in the pre Hogan days and they were producing entertaining television . Dusty Rhodes on commentary in it 's later years gave me a whole new reason to watch when I started smoking pot as a teenager ... I really wish Vince would put him on the mic for a show or two , maybe at the next Great American Bash ? They CLUBBERIN ! Here comes DA PLUNDA ! He was great.<br /><br />-DirrTy
1 True , the idea for this TV series may have sprung from the immense success which Ally McBeal is enjoying worldwide , even here in Germany . However , this said , Edel & Starck is very different from Ally McBeal in many ways.<br /><br />The two main characters work beautifully together . Felix Edel ( Felix Noble ) , played by well - known German actor , Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Starck ( Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong , get it ? ? ? ) , played by charming Rebecca Immanuel , exchange quick romantic repartees and continually spy on each other while engaging in sitcom - like criminal cases in Berlin and surroundings . Further , they are aided by a magnificent cast of co - stars , most notably their secretary , played by Isabel Tuengerthal , who is a rare gem with GREAT comic potential . Also the shady wheeler - dealer , Otto , and the noble childhood pal of Felix , Frank , work very well , not to forget Sandra 's best friend and room - mate , Patricia , played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer.<br /><br />All - in - all a joy to watch on Monday nites : no wonder that the series and its stars have received several prizes . Will Felix get Sandra ? < br /><br />I hope that we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out ......
1 This series it 's " something different " . Sometimes European series are less accurate than the USA ones , but this time authors have hit the right target creating a mix that works in a smoothly way . Edel & Starck is great , it has all : great plot , smart , witty , always well delivered lines , an amazing theatrical timing showed by all the stars and beautiful shots of Berlin , one of the most interesting city in the world . It 's entertaining to see how things works in the justice field in other countries than the USA and for once " feel " the old Europe way of dealing with life . Kudos to all the cast and crew for a well done comedy that is going to be a must to see in the years to come . Watching the series in German is super .
1 German private TV is ill - renowned for copying Dutch and  naturally  US formats . Well , in the case of Edel & Starck , the xeroxing only went as far as the basics : Screwball.<br /><br />You ca n't stand screwball comedy ? Do n't watch Edel & Starck . Seriously . If you expect yet another lawyers ' drama thingy similar to Law&Order or something , well , go somewhere else . ( Or watch Law&Order as it 's quite brilliant at what it does , but I digress . ) E&S is funny , often addresses thought - provoking themes , is funny , romantic , funny , funny , and witty , too.<br /><br />Frankly , I am quite dismayed the writers did n't get better deals after the serial 's final . And my cynical nature needs to readjust itself re : private German television productions . German residents will understand what I 'm talking about.<br /><br />In short : Watch it . I do n't have the foggiest what the English synchronisation is like , but hey , it 's worth learning German just to watch them four seasons . Pseudo - happy end included .
1 Anna ( Ursula Andress ) is brought in as an official R.N. by ex - lover Benito Varotto ( Duilio Del Prete ) , ostensibly to nurse an aging widower , Count Leonida Bottacin ( Mario Piso ) , back to health after a heart attack . But Benito is actually leading a group of heirs and businessmen , including American entrepreneur Mr. Kitch ( Jack Palance ) , with ulterior motives , reflected by what Anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the Count . He has a history of , well , liking women , and would be actually a bit more " vulnerable " as he is cured . The bad guys get derailed as Anna does not go along and grows closer to the Count . The ending might be said to be ironic , but it is probably better described as predictable . < br /><br />But so much for plot -- this film is totally an erotic comedy , from start to finish , and oh how good . There are many nude scenes , including ones of Anna and Jole , one of the malevolent heiresses , played by Luciana Paluzzi . Both Ursula and Luciana are noteworthy continental ex - Bond women , and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers . As she did in Thunderball ( remember Fiona Volpe ) , Luciana plays a femme fatale , sort of , although less elegantly.<br /><br />Perhaps the best scene is Anna 's ( slow ) complete strip and jump in bed with the young Adone , the " other patient " ( who incredibly is resisting ) , in an attempt to find out what he knows about the plot . But even at this point she is already two - faced ( for the better ) , for she has decided not to go along . However , Benito is more than a two - timer with women , having had lengthy flings in the past with both Anna and Jole , and the rival best erotic scene follows an invective - filled ( to put it mildly ) argument between him and Jole . This is a standing - up encounter in which Luciana is down to black panties only . Another nice one is Ursula swimming fully naked in the estate 's pool . The Count is free , as the client , to put his hands wherever he wants to on Ursula , and he takes advantage . Hey , somehow I 've gone back to the actresses ' names in my descriptions . Erotic scenes involving other women include an amusing naked wine cellar chase . " The Sensuous Nurse " is compact , 77 minutes , but it does n't need to be -- it is enjoyable without interruption , start to finish . Definitely recommended.<br /><br / >
1 The Sensuous Nurse ( 1975 ) was a Italian sexual comedy that starred the one time Bond girl Ursula Andress . Man was she hot in this movie .. She was stacked and built like a * @#% brick house . Ursula was smoking hot in this movie . I have never seen a nurse 's outfit that filled out before . < br /><br />Ms . Andress stars as a nurse who is hired to take care of a rich elderly man . Even one in the house seems to be knocking the boots . One night , the nurse decides to take the grandson 's temperature and give some needed T.L.C. to her ancient client . The old man takes to his nurse and this angers the rest of the family . What kind of job did the family hire her out to do ? Will the geezer fall for her car giver ? How can she deal with the octogenarian crone and the rest of the family ? To find out you need to find a copy of the SENSUOUS NURSE ! ! Italian but badly dubbed into English.<br /><br />Highly recommended .
1 Having lived in Ontario my whole life , in the same town that Marlene Moore grew up in , I 've heard stories of her from my parents , grandparents and family members . So when I found out that they would be filming a movie about her , and that the beginning would be shot on my street , and her house quite close to mine I was excited.<br /><br />If you read the book Rock a Bye Baby , which is about Marlene Moore you get quite the different image of her as a person , she was considered awkwardly beautiful by people who really had the chance to know her with the exception of her own family who frequently abused her as a child , with the exception of one of her brothers . Also , if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school you 'd find out that she was truly wounded before she even set foot in an institution , she was always defensive and what would seem like an unwillingness to learn in a school environment was actually embarrassment over the fact that she was unable to.<br /><br />Marlene did not deserve the life she was given , with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive . It was the government and the people around her that aided further in her death by not attempting to understand her needs and why she did what she did . I still find myself angered that she was put in jail for self - defense from a man who tried to rape her . As her brother once said , " They did n't know what to do with her so they locked her away and it killed her . " I believe in that with all my heart.<br /><br />Rest in peace Marlene , you deserve it so much .
1 This is a great film . Touching and strong . The direction is without question breathless . Good work to the team . I feel so sorry for Marlene , By the grace of God go you or I
1 This film was on last week and although at that time of the day ( around 6 pm ) the quality of the movies is almost never good ( at least here on Mexican TV ) , I could n't switch the TV off . The story about Madelene Moore really touches you . She does n't come across as a very sympathetic character at first , but seeing the whole film , you just want her so succeed . This film really leaves you thinking . And i think that basically due to the great acting of Brooke Johnson . I had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film , but this was great great acting . Compliments to Brooke . I hope to see her in another film soon .
1 " Dangerous Offender " is the story of a seemingly anti - social girl , and how she got that way . It 's based on a true story , and though I was irritated by the one - note depiction i.e. ever scowling , of the title character , and the hard - to - believe dedication of her lawyer , I 'm forced to accept that life does imitate art , and that there are people out there like that.<br /><br />The movie succeeds , for me , because , although there 's little softening of the title character 's demeanour until almost the end , one is gradually moved to sympathy for her , as the movie shows how she got to her present state - which proves to be self - destructive , rather than anti - social.<br /><br />Truly a moving movie , which will bring a lump to your throat , when you think on it - which will be often.<br /><br />Despite its many flaws,(including that it 's hard to watch , sometimes , because of bodily functions , and suicide attempts)this is another production that I 'm proud to call Canadian .
1 I have seen The Perfect Son about three times . I fail to see how this film is a gay film , I am not even gay , but I do n't see it as a gay film . It is a film with a gay character , I ca n't see why every film with a gay character should be strictly a film about being gay . I find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death , the death of someone who is your kin . I think Theo turns his life around fairly quickly after rehab because he wants to and watching his brother dying in front of him makes him reassess his life . I found the dialog in the scene when Theo tells Ryan he is going to be a father to be very moving , Ryan states that he does n't want to know about the things he is never going to see or share with anyone . Is n't that horrific and sad ? I highly recommend the film .
1 The Perfect Son is a story about two 30-something brothers , one who is seemingly " perfect " and the other who is basically a screw - up , frequently landing himself in drug rehab centers . After the death of their father , the two are brought together after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalry resurfaces . It is n't until the " perfect " brother makes the startling revelation that he has AIDS that the irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to get his life in order , and take some responsibility.<br /><br />The movie does a nice job of chronicling the younger brother 's " comeback " , though it may seem a bit far - fetched at times ( beating drug addiction is never so easy ) . What makes the film more tender is the treatment of AIDS , a topic that has become somewhat passe in cinema over the last 5 - 10 years . And also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two formerly feuding brothers is very believable and well - done . The two main actors were both very competent , if not terribly charismatic.<br /><br />A solid first feature effort from director and writer Leonard Farlinger whose own brother died of AIDS . The ending is nicely done as well.<br /><br / >
1 I am writing this after just seeing The Perfect Son at the 2002 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney , Australia.<br /><br />When their Father dies , two estranged brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying from AIDS , they enter on a heart warming journey of reconciliation . The two leads do a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds up between them as the movie progresses . I do have one qualm about the movie though - whilst the brother who is dying acts sick , he does n't look it . A person of 0 T4 cells would look quite ill - not even a make up job to make the actor look ill was employed . A small gripe , but one that makes it a bit less realistic . Despite that one small gripe , The Perfect Son is a wonderful movie and should you have the chance to see it- do . I 'm hoping for a DVD release in the near future !
1 I have to be honest and say I bought this movie , not because of the content , but because David Cubitt is in it ; I know ... shallow , or what ? - but , come on , Mr Cubitt is a fantastic actor to put it mildly.<br /><br />I really did n't know what to expect from watching this movie , I 'd read the other write up , and those on other sites but I have to say I was drawn into the world of the brothers almost from the get go . David Cubitt as Theo , and Colm Feore as Ryan are so believable as the two estranged brothers , the film moves through their relationship as they start to try getting to know each other again after their fathers death . The scene where Theo finds out Ryan is gay was played brilliantly , he literally walks in on a scene and tries to leave without Ryan noticing - which of course he has.<br /><br />The film has been very well researched and is therefore incredibly sad , moving , uplifting and a celebration of life in parts . I came away from this feeling sad at what Ryan went through but also with the knowledge that he was given hope and unconditional love by the ex drug addict brother Theo . I agree with the other reviewer who finds the scene where Theo says he will be a father moving , and I 'd go a little further to say I actually vocalised my thoughts at Ryan when he cruelly says to Theo ' What makes you think you can be a father ' and Theo says simply ' You . ' Theo walks away then , but that small exchange of dialogue speaks volumes to the almost self pitying aspect of Ryan who is brought up sharply by the simple retort.<br /><br />A brilliantly conceived movie on all counts , the acting , directing , writing etc are all so well done . I ca n't really find anything else to say about this movie , except to say that it is very hard dealing with the death of a loved one but this is done superbly , to the infinite degree . The respect for the subject matter and the outpouring of love ( without being contrite and mawkish ) speaks volumes in this rather selfish world we live in today . Well done to all concerned.<br /><br />Not many movies bring me to tears and give me pause to think about life in general , and also to be glad for all the things I have and not be sad for the things I do n't , but this movie did , it was unbelievably uplifting considering the subject matter .
1 I have found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I 'd give it a try.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor ( Colm Feore and David Cubitt ) who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away . Ryan and Theo at first argue about who did what . But later , Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness . So , Ryan and Theo spend their time patching up their differences.<br /><br />This is such an incredible film . I have only seen Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24 but he was phenomenal in this . David Cubitt , an actor I have NEVER heard of before did a phenomenal job as well.<br /><br />I would recommend this to those who are interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre . This is one movie you do n't want to miss.<br /><br />I give this film 10 stars out of 10 . Excellent film !
1 I 've read a few of the reviews and I 'm kinda sad that a lot of the Story seems glossed over . Its easy to do because its not a Book , its a movie and there 's only so much that can be done in a movie- US Or Canadian- or anywhere.<br /><br />Colm Feore does , at least for a recovering " F@g - Hag " like myself , a great job of not only playing the ' friendly neighborhood ' gay man- but playing sick . I mean , the man really ca n't get much more pale ! Though , you might never know it from the strip down near the ... um , end.<br /><br />If you need decrepit , there are a few SKing movies you might like.<br /><br />Being the daughter of a Recovering Alchoholic , the druggie brother { David Cubitt } was the trick for me . I 'm going to give him cred , he grew up quick- and believe me that 's good . And , as an Aspiring writer , moimeme , I can dig a lot of his insights and overviews . But I 'm more prosy than poetic.<br /><br />I may be easy to please , but I enjoyed it . A nice story pretty well put together- by Canadians , quelle surprise . Just toed the line of the ' Movie of the week , ' missing it by not being as drawn out , GREATLY Appreciated . And it was rather cleverly portrayed .
1 For me this movie was powerful . I do n't want to be a spoiler , but I had a friend years ago ; we were like brothers . This movie brought back some vivid memories.<br /><br />For some reason , I could n't place my vote for this movie which would have been a 10 . I kept getting a message like " No votes have been placed .... " And yet I saw in the stats that there were . Will try again tomorrow ( Monday).<br /><br />Minor flaws I overlooked . It was the relationships between the characters that got me . Beautifully acted and real situations . I 've been in a couple of them.<br /><br />A small gem of a movie . Just like " Spring Forward " is another overlooked gem . I 'm very glad movies like these are still being made ; about relationships between people , well written , sensitively unfolded with first - class acting and direction . After all , is n't that what it 's all about ?
1 I´m glad that someone has made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart for a second time . Or third . This movie is exactly what it promises to be - lovely , amusing and it gives you this good feeling around your heart when it ends . The plot might be not very inventive , but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not been all used yet . The cast is perfectly selected although Scott Wolf does not look like a father of an eight year old not even when he is wearing a suit . So , the sparks are on all the right places , supporting cast is lovably supporting and although you could probably predict the whole movie you would not want to switch the channel . It is just the right sort of entertainment for a Sunday evening .
1 As romantic comedies go , this was a cute and winning one . I thought that the writing could have been stronger to build up the final connection a bit better , but that is not a huge tripping point . But , Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf give nice performances and are as charming as ever . These are two of my favorite actors , and I was just glad to see them cast as romantic leads . I hope to see them cast in more projects soon.<br /><br />Overall , this movie wo n't change your life , but is is sweet , warm and winning . Not a bad thing to be at all .
1 An MGM MINIATURE Short Subject.<br /><br />The editor of the Cole County Clarion must decide what is the real IMPORTANT NEWS for his readers : an impending frost which may spell disaster to their crops , or the sensational shooting - down of a notorious gangster on their small town main street.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable little one - reeler , featuring a good performance by comic Charles ` Chic ' Sale . Today 's viewers will perhaps be more interested in the appearance of uncredited James Stewart , as Sale 's nephew / assistant . Slow talking & somewhat goofy , Stewart shows many of the attributes which would make him a huge star in a very short time.<br /><br />Often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two - reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something like writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . Economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios ' feature films .
1 ....... Playing Kaddiddlehopper , Col San Fernando , etc . the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream . I love watching him interact w/ Amanda Blake , or Don Knotts or whomever -- he clearly was having a ball and I think he made it easier on his guests as well -- so long as they Knew ahead of time it was n't a disciplined , 19 take kind of production . Relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there.<br /><br />He reminds me of guys like Milton Berle , Benny Hill , maybe Jerry Lewis some too . Great timing , ancient gags that kept audiences in stitches for decades , sheer enjoyment about what he was doing . His sad little clown he played was good too -- but in a touching manner.<br /><br />Personally I think he 's great , having just bought a two DVD set of his shows from ' 61 or so , it brings his stuff back in a fond way for me . I can remember seeing him on TV at the end of his run when he was winding up the series in 1971 or so.<br /><br />Check this out if you are a fan or curious . He was a riot .
1 Red Skelton was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with ease.<br /><br />His shows certainly brought a laughter to the American households of years back.<br /><br />He would begin the show with an opening monologue . Afterwards , we would have a variety of characters . Remember Gertrude and Heathcliff in the monologue ? How can we ever forget San Fernando Red ? I remember one episode where as a king Red introduced his queen by referring to her as your fatness.<br /><br />Go know that Red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life . He lost a son to leukemia at age 11 or so . His wife , Georgia , died by suicide .
1 I 've seen this film criticized with the statement , " If you can get past the moralizing ... " That misses the point . Moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder , as it were . This is a decent film with a standard murder mystery , but with a distinct twist that surfaces midway through . The resolution leaves the viewer wondering , " What would I have done in this position ? " And I have to believe that 's exactly what the filmmaker intended . To that end , and to the end of entertaining the audience , the film succeeds . I also like the way that the violence is never on stage , but just off camera . We know what has just happened ; it 's just not served up in front of us , then rubbed in our faces , as it would be today with contemporary blood and gore dressing . Besides , the violence is not the point . The point is the protagonist 's moral dilemma , which is cleverly , albeit disturbingly , resolved .
1 Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason , a civil attorney who takes on a criminal case in " The Unknown Man , " a 1951 film also starring Ann Harding , Barry Sullivan , Keefe Braselle , and Richard Anderson . A great believer in justice , Pidgeon accepts a pro bono case defending a young man , Rudi Walchek ( Braselle ) accused of murder and gets him acquitted . Shortly afterward , he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood . He is advised by the DA ( Sullivan ) that Rudi is small change , that to wipe out the organized crime , one has to find the top man . Mason finds the top man , and is faced with a dilemma.<br /><br />"The Unknown Man " is a small , black and white film that manages to hold the viewer 's interest with its various plot twists , though the plot is somewhat contrived . It 's really the story of a good man seeking his god , justice , and what he is willing to do in order to attain it . And that 's the most contrived part of all . I suppose there was a time before O.J. , the Menendez Brothers , etc . , etc . , when people believed in justice and the integrity of attorneys . For this viewer anyway , those days are long over.<br /><br />Walter Pidgeon does an excellent job -- his handsome , elegant demeanor and declamatory voice show us a successful , confident man but also a deeply caring one . Pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning 60 years but never really rose to superstardom . He was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did . It may be because by the time he was getting leads , he was well into his thirties and missed being a matinée idol ; or it could be he lacked that certain something ; or that he was typed early on as second lead to a big female star like Greer Garson . Hard to say . He gives an honest and touching performance here.<br /><br />Very good movie with good performances .
1 Prominent attorney Walter Pidgeon takes a murder case pro bono , wins an acquittal and discovers that his client ( Keefe Braselle ) was not only guilty but part of an extortion ring reaching to the highest eschelons of the city . Panged by his own complicity , he undertakes an investigation , stumbles onto the identity of the " unknown man " who heads the syndicate , and murders him.<br /><br />The ironies engage when Braselle is charged with this second murder and Pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another " unknown man " -- himself . Though somewhat short of urban grit and long on rhetoric , the Unknown Man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by its acknowledgement of the pervasive corruption of American municipal politics that came to light in the postwar years .
1 Only saw this show a few times , but will live in my memory . < br /><br />It is very frustrating that it is so difficult to find this anywhere to purchase and yet there seem to be endless repeats of stuff like Friends ! Especially even more difficult to obtain being in England I guess .. ?<br /><br />They say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from the Bakersfield PD themselves ? Maybe it was just too clever for certain people ? < br /><br />Anyhow , just about the one comedy I would love to see again but is almost impossible to find . I hear it is being or has been repeated on another network ? But alas not over here!!<br /><br />Summary : Ingenious .
1 I liked this show a lot - we got the first and only , it would appear , series in the UK on channel 4 . The characterisation was right on the money - a bit like the Simpsons in that all the different facets of small town populace were represented.<br /><br />There was no laughter track - I had n't seen this on an American TV comedy at the time except for on Larry Sanders and it really worked well here , heightening the suggestion that these wacky cops were really like that , and not just hamming it up for the cameras.<br /><br />All in all , a quirky little number that tickled me just right : I ca n't help but think that maybe it missed it 's mark with certain audiences . I think it would have been a cult hit in the UK had it been shown at an acceptable hour.<br /><br />I'll round this off with my standard comment : Where the hell can I get hold of this to watch it again ? Any ideas ?
1 I love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors . I like raptors because they are scary . My favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the Friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana.<br /><br />I really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it 's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and I think it 's got a good ending even though I did n't really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings I figured it out over time and that 's the important part . The other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you 're watching it the first time.<br /><br />THIS IS BEST MOVIE .
1 This was the worst movie I 've ever seen , yet it was also the best movie . Sci Fi original movie 's are supposed to be bad , that 's what makes them fun ! The line , " I like my dinosaur meat well done ! " is probably the best quote ever ! Also , the plot sounds like something out of a pot induced dream . I can imagine it now , the writers waking up after a long night of getting high and playing dance dance revolution , then putting ideas together for this : Space marines got to alien planet , which is infested with dinosaurs and has medieval houses in it , to protect a science team studying the planet . Best idea ever ! In fact , in fits the complete Sci Fi original movie checklist : guns dinosaurs medieval times space travel terrible acting < br /><br />So go watch this movie , but do n't buy it .
1 wow , how can I even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes ? It was surely the highlight of my year -- nay -- my life . As if the raptor graphics were n't amazing enough , the award - winning editors continued to use the exact same shot throughout the entire movie , even when the background did n't actually match up with the setting of the scene . Wow , what genius . And while the movie is full of plot - holes ( for instance , a few clips of a t - Rex type animal where a raptor should be and one key moment where Pappy finds a torture chamber , screams " Colin 's a girl ! " and runs out ) I will never forget the brilliance that is Raptor Planet . Thank you Sci - Fi for another classic .
1 dear god where do i begin . this is bar none the best movie i 've ever seen . the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best . why the script writers for this movie are n't writing big budget films i will never understand . another is the cast . it is great . this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure . i know some of you out there are probably thinking " no way he has plenty better " but no your wrong . raptor island is a work of art . i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors . i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing EVER .
1 If you are used to seeing Gabriel Byrne in serious roles such as Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton in The Usual Suspects I recommend you take a look at this film . Even if you are not a fan of Gabriel Byrne in particular , all the actors in this film give really great performances . If you 've got about eleven bucks ( that is close to nine quid ) I say order it online , or rent it from you favorite movie rental place . Guaranteed to make you laugh , whether or not you normally like gangster type movies . Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is one of those movies you never forget , and find yourself watching over and over . You will talk about it so much your friends will be begging to borrow it .
1 Not a movie for everyone , but this movie is in my top 10 . I am a lover of black comedy . With a cast including Richard Dreyfus ( Vic ) , Jeff Goldblum ( Mick ) , Larry Bishop ( Nick ) and Gabriel Byrne ( Ben ' Brass Balls ' London ) in the leads , the lines ca n't help but be dry . The supporting cast is nearly dead center . Counting the minor flaws in the movie : Ellen Barkin 's make - up gave her face has a washed out look ; there were a couple of gimme cameos by Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor that served no purpose , and Michael J. Pollard 's screen time was too short . Over all , the cast was just incredible without egos to wreck a fine script . If you have seen Larry Bishop 's ( writer , director ) film , Underworld ( a dark crime flick ) , you will enjoy this one . His next outing ( writer , director , actor ) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino .
1 The world is a terrible place . But this movie is farce and it 's fun . And if you do n't like it ... you do n't get it ... and if you do n't get ... it does n't matter . It 's up to you if you want to play along . Every actor in this one had fun . It 's only a joke . And that 's good enough for me . Gabriel Byrne is priceless . Byrne and Paul Anka doing MY WAY is , as " Vic " puts it , " ... the best version ever " . Okay ... it 's no masterpiece , but it 's not bad . I was warned against seeing it , but I 'm sure glad I did ...
1 This a superb self - contained work that is unconnected with anything before or after . Brat Pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice , but in this law - free world they make an alluring ambiance . The film is packed with Our Guys , distinctive actors who add distinction to this work with winning performances . The dialogue is a joy . In fact it 's a new vernacular . One of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with deepening appreciation.<br /><br />Highpoints include Billy Idol 's British loutishness , Ben London 's vulturine brassware , Kyle 's squirmishness , and the survey of ad hoc philosophies .
1 This movie is great . Simply . It is rare that you find a comedy with levels , and this is a bloody good example of such . When I saw this movie first , as the credit rolled , a friend and I looked to one another and asked ... ' did you just catch that ? ' For those doubters , look at the levels . See the comparisons between Vick and the people in the club , the DNA ! See the diverse characters , each jostling for position , and if you see nothing else , see the connection between the cure of Vick and the path through the film . IT 'S ALL IN VICK 'S HEAD ! The opening line about Vick 's world . The closing scene with the camera going into Vick 's head , and inside , a whole universe ! Thoroughly quotable , wonderful cartoon gangsters , beautiful , beautiful , beautiful !
1 When seeing this movie you should take notice to that it´s not a normal movie . It has no real story just characters , a bunch of gangster characters who come together in a perfect harmony . The dialogue is wonderful , you can just lay back and listen . The movie stands out that s why it´s hard to find a right way of describing it.<br /><br />Thats why the user comments on this movie is so mixed.<br /><br />I for one love the movie and recommend it to all who love one - liners and things that differ from the " normal " . You can´t really put the finger on what´s so wonderful about it it´s just a comical world where gangsters rule . A place of love and danger . A movie that you can see more than one time .
1 Most of the comments have been positive but I would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets . The set designer used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings , stairs , doors , furniture and so forth . It is worth paying attention to . The movie is driven by characterization and symbolism which is very rich . All the gangster actors were cast - it was like seeing old friends and it was a treat . The dialog was amusing at times but stilted at times and I suppose it was meant to be that way . This is a film buff 's film . It was made by people , for people who love the medium . Do n't miss this one .
1 I originally saw this very dark comedy around 2000 or so on cable TV . What a surprise and delight ! Everyone is covertly armed in this movie ! Dreyfuss plays the " mental " don ( remember the New York don who was supposed to be schizophrenic ? Art imitates life or vice - versa ? ) . Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are at their most beautiful and NOT to be toyed with ! Thus proving that beauty and toughness DO go together ! Then there is the great " bullshit " scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum ( Rita and Mickey ) where they verbally play off the world " bullshit . " This film is both subtle and bald . For all the shooting , it can be a very quiet film . And , you have the opportunity to see several actors in their final or near final roles . Joey Bishop . Richard Pryor . Henry Silva . It is not a film for everyone . But , if you like a film that has a lot of word play and keeps moving without blowing up everything in sight , this is the film for you . Roger Ebert dumps on this film . He 's flat wrong . THIS is a fine , fine film ! Maybe just not one for Ebert . I consider it as a 10 because of how well it is done and how funny the script can be , while not really being a straight comedy kind of film . I like it so well that I bought it on DVD because it just does n't get shown very much on cable TV . Now , it 's all mine !
1 I do n't know much about the Rat Pack , and Frank Sinatra always seemed a bit too self - consciously full of himself to me . So when I call this one of my all - time faves , it 's nothing to do with a tribute - band mentality . As another reviewer says , Mad Dog Time is about symbolism , not realism . It 's kafkaesque ( a pity Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd , when he was so good as Josef K ) , it 's stylish , knowing , sardonic and slick . Jeff Goldblum is navigating his way around a variety of characters , trying not to get shot and acting deftly rather than dorkily , trying to stay abreast of what he knows and others do n't , whom he can outshoot and whom he ca n't . Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss ( his best performance ) have a ball , and the supporting cast look spot - on . The symbolism , the settings ( the one outdoor motion shot with Jeff Goldblum walking down the steps seems really weird after so much lounge lizardry ) , the dialogue ( style , not practicality , is the order of the day ) , it 's all about characters interacting , not really gangsterism . Fun to watch , must 've been fun to do . What the critics were up to is really a mystery ...
1 Loopy , but shrewd and formidable mob boss Vic ( an excellent performance by Richard Dreyfuss ) gets released from a mental hospital . Several of Vic 's fellow criminal cohorts who include volatile henchman " Brass Balls " Ben London ( a gloriously manic and over - the - top hammy portrayal by Gabriel Byrne ) , the smarmy Jake Parker ( a perfectly smug Kyle MacLachlan ) , and vicious rival " Wacky " Jacky Jackson ( a neat turn by Burt Reynolds ) all try to bump Vic off . Meanwhile , laid - back and self - assured hit - man Mickey Holliday ( nicely played with low - key confidence by Jeff Goldblum ) finds himself caught in the middle of all this deadly lunacy . Writer / director Larry Bishop brings a supremely hip , quirky , and original idiosyncratic sensibility to this deliciously dark and deadpan pitch - black comedy about betrayal , loyalty , and ruthless ambition run dangerously amok . The bang - up cast have a field day with the colorfully grotesque rogues ' gallery of blithely amoral and treacherous hoodlums : Ellen Barkin as tough , sultry moll Rita Everly , Henry Silva as Vic 's reliable right - hand man Sleepy Joe Carisle , Gregory Hines as philosophical smoothie Jules Flamingo , Diane Lane as Vic 's sweet , perky mistress Grace , Billy Drago as the slimy Wells , and Christopher Jones as brutish rub - out artist Nicholas Falco . Bishop makes the most of his juicy secondary role as lethal and laconic ace assassin Nick . Popping up in nifty bits are Billy Idol as a blustery thug , Michael J. Pollard as the ill - fated Red , Joey Bishop as mortician Mr. Gottlieb , Rob Reiner as a jolly chauffeur , and Richard Pryor as Jimmy the Gravedigger . Byrne 's delightfully insane duet with singer Paul Anka on " My Way " rates as a definite sidesplitting highlight . A tense and amusing climactic Mexican stand - off likewise tickles the funny bone something hysterical . Frank Byers ' slick cinematography , the outrageously nutty dialogue , Earl Rose 's jazzy cocktail lounge score , and a choice soundtrack of vintage swinging golden oldies all further enhance the engagingly peculiar charm of this immensely entertaining one - of - a - kind curio .
1 Simply , one of the funiest movies i 've ever seen . It 's a parody of crime - life , parody of everything that represents the Chicago 1930.- There is no realy need to underestimate this movie because rating is under 5 . Its a opinion of a mass , and mass is hypnotized . Who decide to watch it - it will regret , Who decide not to watch it - will regret more .
1 This has to be one of my favourite movies of all time . The dialogue , with the constant use of puns is very tight , the cast are superb , and the plot is highly original.<br /><br />Don't take my word for it - watch this movie and enjoy it for yourself .
1 I love this movie . It 's wacky , funny , violent , surreal , played out in a madman 's head , and definitely not your usual comedy . < br /><br />If you do n't find the film amusing then I guess it 's just not for your tastes , so this is a tough one to write a review for.<br /><br />For reference , some other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski , The Princess Bride , and Zoolander ( that one only got me the second time around ) . There are others , but my taste is definitely for the unusual , and I am willing to accept that most people just do n't tend to like that kind of thing . I make no apologies for having an unusual sense of humour - at least I have one.<br /><br />The scenes and characters of this particular movie are well put together , the verbal humour is hilarious , the situations are intriguing , the acting is very good ( as you would expect of the cast ) , though the acting demands made of the cast by the script are not particularly high . The overall package makes for fun , funny , watchable yet violent entertainment .
1 It was hard for me to believe all of the negative comments regarding this all - star flick . I laughed through the entire picture , as did my entire family . The movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedy -- the players were hysterical -- I'll bet they had a good old time while making it . Of course Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great -- and how about those Everly sisters , each of the two Falco 's , and the divine music throughout . Rob Reiner made a great laughing limo driver , and Gabriel Byrne a laughable neurotic . Not to mention Gregory Hines , Burt Reynolds , the Sleepy Joe character and the whole mortuary and grave digger references . Paul Anka was his usual entertaining self , with the added attraction of running scared after Byrne decided to make a duet of his " My Way " welcome home to Vick performance.<br /><br />I am of the opinion that this movie was a comical tribute to Frank Sinatra and friends ; Dreyfuss imitated him well . I am also of the opinion that no one , of any age , would even think of imitating the actions which occurred in this movie -- it 's a joke -- not a terrifying " gangsta " film . The cars and clothing were impressive , as was the decorative , " Vic 's Place." < br /><br />Truly , I think of " Mad Dog Time " as a musical comedy , less harmful than many cartoons , TV crime dramas , and talk shows . I would recommend the video for an evening of family entertainment .
1 Before I start , I should point out that I know the editor of this film . We 've never met , but we belong to the same fanzine(those things which came before message boards ) , and we have talked on the phone , so I do have a bias here . Anyway ... <br /><br />Somehow , it 's ironic how while the " Rat Pack " culture of the late 50 's and early to mid-60 's made a comeback in the mid-90 's , this movie , from the son of one of the original Rat Pack , and which was made in a similar fashion , was a flop . Not only that , it was a critical flop ; I believe Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was the only one who did not savage this(he gave it a mixed review , as I recall ) . And while I do n't think this is the greatest film in the world , and I am not a fan of the Rat Pack , or " cocktail , " culture , I do think this is worth seeing.<br /><br />For one thing , this looks stylish , and moves right along . For another , the core performances are all good . Richard Dreyfus is surprisingly restrained here as the head gangster coming back from a sanitarium , and has a droll edge to him . Jeff Goldblum goes back to the quietly ironic performances he gave in his pre - blockbuster days , like THE BIG CHILL . And while Ellen Barkin is only required to vamp in this movie , she does it entertainingly . Admittedly , it 's not a great film ; the dialogue is mostly made up of puns , and a lot of them do n't work(like the whole " Zen of Ben " speech ) . And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are awful here . Still , I was entertained , and if you like gangster films , you might be too .
1 Hint number one - read the title as " the Time of the Mad Dog , " or perhaps dogs . This is a pretty good ensemble piece ( look at the cast and rent it - you know you 're curious already ) , and first - time director Bishop gives them their chance , taking his time , letting the characters interact and chew the scenery as they wait - not enthusiastically - for the return of " the big boss " and whatever revenge ensues.<br /><br />For some of us , the highlight is seeing Christopher Jones after his self - imposed exile from films ; he remains a commanding film presence . And yes , with Christopher Jones , Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor involved , this IS the " Wild in the Streets " reunion party !
1 If you like film , do n't miss this one . If you prefer action , or horror , or romance , then you 'll wonder what 's happening . Everyone here is stuck in a gangster film . And what happens is transcendental murder.<br /><br />There are few similar films . No doubt it will see limited release , and be hard to find . But the search will be worth it . If you want to study a mileu as a potential symbol , then this is indeed a film to study.<br /><br />You ca n't watch it once . If you do you 'll never see what 's happening . Dark City is better . Joe Vrs . The Volcano is more fun . But Mad Dog Time could convert the gangsta crowd to symbolism . . .or at least to think twice before shooting again .
1 An interesting look at Japan prior to opening to the West . John Wayne as America 's first consul to Japan arrives in accordance with agreements resulting from Perry 's gunboat diplomacy . He is not welcome . Wayne eventually wins his meeting with the Shogun after bring a cholera epidemic , introduced by an American ship , under control . There follows a colorful procession to the capital bearing gifts for the Shogun , including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot . The meeting with the Shogun , the debates among the Japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibit present an interesting look at the politics of the period . Altogether a rather enjoyable movie and besides how often do you get to see the Duke lose a fight to a guy half his size .
1 This is very much not the sort of movie for which John Wayne is known . He plays a diplomat , a man who gets things done through words and persuasion rather than physical action . The film moves with a quiet realism through its superficially unexciting story.<br /><br />For the open - minded , the patient and the thoughtful , this movie is a rich depiction of an intriguing part of history.<br /><br />There are two intertwining stories . The big story is of internalised , isolationist Japan and externalised , expansionist America clashing when their interests conflict . The small , human , story is of an outsider barbarian ( Wayne ) and a civilised Geisha 's initial hostility and dislike turning to mutual respect and love . The human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nations.<br /><br />The movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well . The two lead roles are performed to perfection . John Wayne is excellent as Townsend Harris , striking exactly the right blend of force and negotiation in his dealings with the Japanese . Eiko Ando is likewise excellent as the Geisha of the title , charming and delightful . The interaction between her character and John Wayne 's is particularly well portrayed . This is exactly how these two individuals ( as they are depicted in the film ) would have behaved.<br /><br />The script is very well written . It lacks all pomposity . and is a realistic depiction of the manner in which the depicted events may have occurred . The characters are real people , not self - consciously " great " figures from history . Furthermore , the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety . Indeed , the clash of a traditionalist , and traditionally powerful , isolationist Japan and a rising , newly powerful nation from across the ocean is summarised very well in one exchange between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron . Wayne complains that shipwrecked sailors are beheaded if they land in Japan , and that passing ships can not even put into port for water . The Baron responds that Japan just wants to be left alone . Wayne 's character replies that Japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international shipping , and that if things continue as before the nation will be regarded as nothing more than a band of brigands infesting an important roadway . A very real summary of the way in which the two countries each saw themselves as being in the right , and saw the other as being in the wrong . The resultant clash between two self - righteous peoples with conflicting interests has its reflections throughout history , a continuing theme that echoes into the present and on into the future.<br /><br />Cinematography and the depiction of mid - nineteenth century Japan , before the accelerated growth towards industrialisation that was to follow later in the century , is excellent . A visual treat , and an enlightening insight into Japan 's ancient civilisation.<br /><br />I highly recommend anyone , whether a John Wayne fan or not , to watch this film if you get the chance . Just be aware that it is n't an action film . It is a representation of an interesting place and time in history , and a slow - boiling love story which ( much to their surprise ) comes to dominate the personal lives of the two main characters . Watch this film on its merits , without preconceptions , allow yourself to be immersed in its story , and you will thoroughly enjoy it.<br /><br />All in all , an excellent film .
1 In THE BARBARIAN AND THE GEISHA , John Wayne plays Townsend Harris , a real envoy from the United States who was responsible for truly opening up Japan to International relations in the late 1850s . Before him , Commodore Perry basically pushed into Japan with gunboats and forced a treaty upon the Japanese in 1853 . Harris , who arrived just a bit later , worked through the details and helped ensure compliance -- as many of the Japanese felt no particular inclination to honor the first treaty . All this is true and shown in the film . According to some other sources I found , the romance between Harris and a Japanese Geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this film ( hence , the title).<br /><br />My first reaction the first time I saw this movie was one of surprise . John Wayne as a diplomat ? ! When he 's being diplomatic in most films , he says please and thank you as he pummels people ! ! ! ! So seeing him playing a man who is NOT a man of action and is able to play the diplomatic game seemed very odd indeed . In fact , I ca n't think of too many actors in 1958 who would have been more unusual for this role . By the way , I 've seen photos of Harris and Wayne has practically no resemblance to him at all.<br /><br />However , despite the story taking a lot of liberties with the truth and the strange casting , the film is still very watchable . The color cinematography is nice , the film shows some nice insights into Japanese customs and culture and the acting is n't bad . All in all , a likable and watchable film despite it 's odd casting.<br /><br />PS -- Read through the trivia for this film . You find out a bit more about the real life characters as well as a supposed fight between Wayne and the director ( John Huston ) where Wayne apparently knocked him out ! ! Based on what I 've read about Huston and the way he got along with actors , this is an incident I tend to believe . And , it 's also a nice example of John Wayne " diplomacy " .
1 I found this to be a surprisingly light - handed touch at a 1950 's culture - clash movie . John Wayne would hardly be one 's first choice as a cultural attache , being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull - run in Harrods . But this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona , and he accomplished his task with style . The Duke was a guy who really could act well . His facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle.<br /><br />Despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time , he failed to dominate this movie . Many of his good intentions came a cropper . He had authority over nobody , and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian.<br /><br />The story of American attempts to curry favour with an isolationist Japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell - for - leather battles . I can not comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the Oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well . There was a great deal of minutely - choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props . The set pieces were complex and detailed . A lot of money and thought had been applied to it.<br /><br />The fractured romance between Wayne and his geisha added a little extra element , and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag - waving effort . Script was good without being too wordy . There was a great deal of Japanese dialogue , but the lengthy periods of translation did n't interfere with the narrative . It was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set . Whether or not they were Japanese , I could n't say . But anyway they looked the part . At least the leads were not played by cross - dressing Caucasians , unlike other efforts such as ' Blood Alley ' ( yes , I know they were Chinese ) ' The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness ' or even ' The King And I'.<br /><br />Frankly , I enjoyed this more than any of those other movies . The script was better for a start . I never liked the songs in ' The King And I ' , and was n't impressed by the heavy - laden anti - communist subtext of ' Blood Alley ' . I confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of The Duke 's more popular outings.<br /><br />Recommended .
1 Several young Iranian women dress as boys and try to get into a World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain . When they 're caught , they 're penned in an area where the match remains within earshot , but out of sight . The prisoners plead to be let go , but rules are rules.<br /><br />Given the pedigree of its director , Jafar Panahi , it was disarming to discover that Offside is a comedy , and a frequently hilarious one . In 1997 's The Mirror , Panahi presents two versions of Iranian girlhood and leaves the audience to wonder which one is " real " . In 2000 's The Circle , several Iranian women step outside the system ; their transgressions are different , but they all end up in the same tragic place.<br /><br />However , thinking now about Offside , it 's hard to imagine it as anything other than a comedy , because the situation it presents is so obviously ridiculous . As the women demand to know why they ca n't watch the soccer match and their captors struggle to answer , the only possible outcome is comedy.<br /><br />What makes Offside most affecting is that the young women are not portrayed as activists attacking the system . They are simply soccer fans and patriots , and despite the fact that they are clearly being treated unfairly , they never lose their focus on the match and the historic victory that is within their nation 's grasp .
1 I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival . Filmed during an actual qualifying match for the 2006 World Cup , Offside works brilliantly as both a comedy and a tragedy . The film follows the fortunes of a group of young women who are caught trying to sneak into a football match at Tehran 's Azadi Stadium . The country 's Islamic religious leaders have decreed that women may not sit with men at sporting events , lest they be exposed to cursing and other morally questionable behaviour . This has n't stopped the country 's young female fans , who continue to sneak in using various tricks . But Panahi focuses on a small group who have been caught and are being detained agonizingly close to the action . They beg the bored soldiers guarding them to let them go or at least to let them watch the match . The soldiers tell them they should n't have tried to get in , that they could have watched the game at home on TV . They banter back and forth in almost real - time as the game continues , just off- camera.<br /><br />There is one very funny sequence where a young soldier accompanies one of the girls to the restroom . Since there are no female restrooms at stadiums , he has to clear the room of any men before he can allow her to go in . Plus , he makes her cover her face so no one can see she 's a woman . This is accomplished using a poster of Iranian soccer star Ali Daei as a mask , with eye holes punched out.<br /><br />You get a real sense that even the soldiers are baffled by the prohibition , and are only carrying out their orders so as to hasten the end of their compulsory military service . One soldier complains that he was supposed to be on leave so he could take care of his family 's cattle in the countryside . Little by little , the girls and the soldiers talk to each other , and there are numerous small acts of kindness on both sides to show that these are basically good people living in terrible circumstances . However , the soldiers ' constant reminder that " the chief " is on his way lends a sense of menace , since we do n't know what sort of punishment the women will face.<br /><br />Unlike most Iranian films , which are known for their strong visuals , Offside is filmed in a realist style with no artifice . In fact , the film was made during the actual qualifying match against Bahrain that took place on June 5 , 2005 . The " plot " in many ways was determined by the result on the pitch . If Iran won the match , they would qualify . If they lost , they would not . Since the World Cup has come and gone , I do n't think it is a spoiler to say that Iran won the match . The scenes of celebration at the end of the film were real and spontaneous , which gave the film a real authenticity . Seeing how much this meant to the people of Iran was deeply touching.<br /><br />As well , one of the young women makes reference at the end of the film to seven fans who died during the Iran - Japan match on March 25 , just a few weeks before . They were trampled to death after police began to spray the crowd with water to move them in a certain direction . Knowing that this was a real - life tragedy added another level of poignancy to the celebrations.<br /><br />I do n't want to go off on a long political tangent , but this film gave me real hope that there are those in Iran who are hoping for change and working at it . Iran is a nation of young people , and it is only a matter of time before they take the place of their elders in the political sphere . Films like this one show the proud spirit of the Iranian people in spite of their present difficulties , and it 's my sincere hope that there is a brighter future for them .
1 Finally ! An Iranian film that is not made by Majidi , Kiarostami or the Makhmalbafs . This is a non - documentary , an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the ' system ' in its ass . It 's all about football and its funny , its really funny . The director says " The places are real , the event is real , and so are the characters and the extras . This is why I purposely chose not to use professional actors , as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness . " The non - actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a. your heart is made of stone b. you are blind . Excellently scripted , the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness . It has won the Jury Grand Prize , Berlin , 2006 . Dear reader , it 's near - perfect . WHERE , where can I get hold of it ?
1 This film is being described as a comedy , but it was n't a comedy at all . Like any Panahi film , it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social inequity and hypocrisy . But it was very funny ; much lighter than the director 's dark and serious The Circle ( my favourite Iranian film ) . The resourcefulness of the girls and the banter between them and the soldiers was both completely believable ( as if it were a documentary ) and completely hilarious.<br /><br />The filming the actual match and aftermath was astonishing . It added a realism much like Australia 's Kenny , of course a very different film.<br /><br />The performances from all the non - professional actors  soldiers and girls  were very credible . It was very moving to see the passion , disappointment and excitement of these girls . Anyone in this country who thinks Muslim girls wearing a chador are any different to their own daughters should go see this film  it will be a real eye - opener.<br /><br />To me , the soldiers represented the current paradigm . They started out with stock - standard official policy responses to all the pleas of the girls . As the film progressed , they found it more and more difficult to maintain this stance . When what seems like all of Teheran breaks out into wild celebration , everyone is caught up in it , and the ridiculousness of the current policies is obvious to one and all.<br /><br />It was a very moving and unexpected ending , and gave the film a really nice blend of emotions , frivolity , drama and social commentary . Though it 's adult cinema , I think mature - minded children from about seven onwards would really appreciate this film ( as long as they can read subtitles).<br /><br />It is remarkable that a repressive country like Iran is able to produce films of such quality by the likes of Panahi and Kiarostami . Perhaps the constraints there force directors to be extremely resourceful . Australian ( and other ) film makers could take a leaf out of their book .
1 In Iran women are prohibited from attending live sporting events because of the fear that they will be " corrupted " by bad language , close proximity to thousands of men , and the fact that there are no toilet facilities for women in the antiquated stadiums . Based on an actual incident involving the daughter of the director , Jafar Panahi 's Offside follows six girls , disguised as men , who are refused entry into the soccer match in 2005 between Iran and Bahrain , a match that will decide whether or not Iran goes to the World Cup . In a departure from the bleak , minimalist films we have been accustomed to from Iran over the last ten years , Offside is an exuberant comedy that has a patriotic fervor and a universal appeal but contains enough subversive social commentary to warrant its prohibition from screenings in Iran.<br /><br />Shot with a digital camera using non - professional actors who are more than up to the task , the girls try to sneak into Azadi Stadium in Tehran but are arrested and placed in a holding area outside of the stadium . They are guarded by three young army conscripts ( Safdar Samandar , Mohammed Kheir - abadi , and Masoud Kheymeh - kaboud ) who express ambivalence about their task but are pledged to follow the rules . The women are soccer enthusiasts , not political activists and cheer for Iran 's victory but this does not deter the soldiers from detaining them while they wait for the girls to be transported to the Vice Squad and an uncertain future.<br /><br />Outspoken rather than acting like victims , they continually question the soldiers about the rationale behind the restrictions , making their absurdity quite obvious . Although they can hear the crowd noise , the women can not see the action but achieve a minor victory when they persuade one of the soldiers to provide a running commentary on the game . One of the funniest sequences takes place when a female " prisoner " is escorted to the men 's room by a soldier . The young recruit then must cope with a near riot when he has to prevent anyone else from using the facilities while the girl is still inside.<br /><br />Little by little , to paraphrase Adlai Stevenson , that which unites them turns out to be greater than that which divides them and the unlikely antagonists rally behind their country and root for the victory that will send Iran to the World Cup . Although the point is made early and often and the film sags a bit in the middle , Offside makes a telling point about a society where a political elite with a medieval social mentality has to contend with an growing group of educated and politically astute citizens . One can only hope that world pressure and the awakening of its own people will force the Ayatollahs to come to terms with the 21st century .
1 In Iran , women are not admitted to soccer games . Officially it 's because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience . But of course it is about sexism . Women are lower forms of human beings.<br /><br />Some brave girls oppose this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks . They are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage , until the police will come and pick them up.<br /><br />Despite the insane situation , this is a film with lots of humor . It 's also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression . You 'll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs . Good job by director Jafar Panahi . This is in many ways a heroic comedy .
1 I do n't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this . In fact , it 's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.<br /><br />The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time , one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that 's going on behind the walls of the stadium.<br /><br />It makes you feel like you are in the movie and you 're one of the characters , and while watching the movie , as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the football match . You will feel exactly the same excitement and sentiments as those female actors in the movie . It 's gripping in a way that you wanted to see the ending , you will want to find out the verdict , you 'll be dying to see what will happen to the girls.<br /><br />I like the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee . It 's like venus VS mars , it really shows the difference in the thinking of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran.<br /><br />This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen ( the first being Crimson Gold ) and am looking forward to watching some more.<br /><br />Am already hooked with Iranian movies and this one is a must - see !
1 In Iran , women are officially banned from men 's sporting events . In June 2005 , the Iran 's national soccer team has an important game against Bahrain in the Azadi Stadium for the qualification of the World Cup . A group of Iranian girls and lovers of soccer dresses like boys and unsuccessfully attempts to enter in the stadium being arrested.<br /><br />Soccer ( and Flamengo 's team ) , beach and movies are my greatest passions ; therefore I loved this little gem about a group of girls and their passion for soccer . The director Jafar Panahi , from " The White Balloon " , " The Mirror " and " The Circle " , shot this movie on the day that Iran defeated Bahrain and qualified to the World Cup in Germany . The dramatic and funny adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most delightful movies I have ever seen . My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available
1 Jafar Panahi 's comedy - drama " Offside " portrays some women trying to enter a Tehran sports arena from which women are banned . The official reason : lots of foul language , and the soccer players have their legs showing . But of course , it 's really a case of sexism . So , most of the movie consists of mild comic relief as the women try to ask the men serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium , and one woman even comes up with her own scheme to defy the men.<br /><br />As I understand , all of Jafar Panahi 's movies ( this one included ) are banned in Iran . The real tragedy is that the CIA 's 1953 overthrow of the prime minister and subsequent backing of the brutal shah gave Ayatollah Khomeini an excuse to use his narrow interpretation of the Koran to establish a chauvinistic society , and that George W. Bush 's current policy towards Iran gives Mahmoud Ahmadinejad an excuse to act the cowboy and tighten censorship.<br /><br />Above all , this is a neat look at people coming up with ways to challenge the system . Not a great movie , but worth seeing . Considering that all Jafar Panahi 's movies are banned , I wonder how he 's able to even make them .
1 In The White Balloon and Crimson Gold , the two other films by Jafar Panahi that I 've seen , the director mines surprising amounts of depth in subjects that seem , on the surface , slight . In Offside , Panahi 's seriocomic tribute to Iranian women standing up for their rights , I do n't think he 's as successful . Not that what he 's saying is n't important , of course ( and it 's too bad that , like pretty much every other Panahi film , Iranians ca n't see it ) . But , after a while , the film feels a tad flat , and it feels long even at 90 minutes . Not saying I did n't like it , though . The actors are all fantastic , and the celebration at the end of the film is infectious . But it 's not an important work , in my opinion .
1 " Cinema is dead , long live the cinema ! " said Peter Greenaway , one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors , at the last year 's Romanian film festival Anonimul , which got to the third edition and takes place in the Danube Delta . This year the direction prize went to Jafar Panahi 's " Offside " . I got to see it this evening in Bucharest at the festival 's retrospective . Cinema is dead but still very lively . Panahi 's film tells in a compelling manner how Iranian society looks . Digitally filmed , " Offside " is a story inspired by a real - life event happened to Panahi 's daughter : the trouble and risk took when decided to attend a football match . This is forbidden in Iran as we are informed . What Panahi manages to do is to render with few means , but with , probably , a lot of work , intelligence and humor the cultural patterns in a society that places women at a distinct level . The absurdity of the laws becomes comical . The film has a happy end , after all because Iran 's team goes to the World Cup . What I appreciated most was the concept , the idea behind this film . I would be very interested to see Panahi 's other films that were forbidden in Iran as well . I guess that he can be thought as an activist director .
1 The US State Dept . would not like us to see this movie , because they have a beef with the Iranian govt . However , it shows us just how civilized Iran really is , despite the content of the film , which centers on the struggle of women there for equal rights in the simplest of terms : the ability to watch a soccer game at the stadium , which is strictly limited to male audiences alone . The film is hilariously funny , and in and of itself is proof of freedom of speech and expression in Iran . I enjoyed this movie intensely . Five girls try to penetrate the police border at the ticket gates to a soccer match between Iran and Bahrain . The ensuing comedy is too funny to describe , from the bus trip to the stadium , to the interceding of the police and subsequent detention of the girls , to the resulting end . Do n't miss this classic film . Its a MUST see . One of the best foreign films I 've seen in years .
1 Panahi , whose previous films such as The Circle and Crimson Gold have seemed to range from dour to grim , has produced in his new Offside a funny , obstreperous , joyously chaotic ensemble piece that ends on a note of liberation and heartfelt fun  yet the movie deals with material quite as challenging and relevant as anything else he 's done . By focusing on a group of ardent girl soccer fans caught sneaking into the pre - World Cup Bahrain - Iran match in Tehran stadium , Panahi brings up issues of national spirit and independent - mindedness , and the contradictions  and sheer absurdity  of the regime 's religious gender apartheid in a world of modern competition with a majority youth population and urban girls who increasingly think for themselves.<br /><br />As the film opens we breathlessly join one of the girls in a bus , with a father pursing a lost daughter . This one has a disguise and has national colors as warpaint , but we cringe with her in the knowledge of what 's going to happen : she 's still easily spotted . The thing is , most of the men around do n't really care . Still , rules are rules , and once they try to make it through the various checkpoints on the way into the big stadium the would - be soccer girls , or some of them anyway , get rounded up and held in a little compound upstairs in the stadium by some mostly young , green , and rustic soldier - cops who have no idea how to deal with these big city girls ' independent ideas and would rather be watching the game  whose roar we constantly hear in the background  themselves . Each girl is different  represents a different set of reasons for wanting to break the rules and different ways of doing it . One wore a soldier 's uniform and got into the officers ' section . One is tough and masculine and mocking and provocative ( she could pass for a pretty boy , and teasingly hints at that : " Are you a girl or a boy ? " " Which would you like me to be ? " ) . One does n't care very much about soccer but went to honor a dead comrade . One ( Aida Sadeghi ) is an ardent soccer player herself  and so on . These Tehrani girls are stubborn and smart and they walk all over the uptight rural lieutenant in charge of them ( Safar Samandar ) . One of the rural cops ( Mohamad Kheirabadi ) takes the girl soccer player to the men 's restroom ( of course there 's no ladies ' ) , forcing her to wear a poster of an Italian football star as a mask . A comedy of errors and chaos follows in which the girl escapes.<br /><br />Later a spiffy looking van comes with an officer who directs the cops to take the girls to the Vice Department  violating sexual segregation rules qualifies as vice . A male gets mixed in with them  a kid who 's chronically guilty of smuggling fireworks into the games . The van turns out not to be so spiffy : the radio aerial is broken . But one cop holds it in place so they can listen to the increasingly heart - stopping reportage . Cops and prisoners are all joined in a common excitement now . There 's no score , the game goes to penalty kicks , and the winner will go to Germany.<br /><br />In the background through all this is a real game , a real stadium , and real masses of young men crazy about the outcome of this event . The excitement is tremendous , and the streets are jammed with cars and flags and a milling mob of supporters praying for an Iranian win and united in their excitement.<br /><br />What makes this film so good , as may be clear by now , is that it 's shot during the evening of an actual game with a real finale that turns everything around . This , in contrast to Panahi 's previous highly calculated narrative trajectories , is spontaneous vérité film - making that improvises in rhythm with a captured background of actual events and sweeps you into its excitement in ways that are quite thrilling.<br /><br />The essence of Offside is the disconnect between modern world soccer madness and retro - Islamic social prohibitions repressing women  the latter existing at a time when young Iranian women are becoming part of a global world in which females participate in sport and share in the ardor of national team spirit . How exactly do you reconcile the country 's ambition to become a modern global power with social attitudes that are medieval ? A lot of Offisde is astonishingly real , including the way everybody tries to talk their way out of everything . The director 's decision to inject young actors into an actual sports mega - event leads to a stunningly effective blend of documentary , polemic , and fiction that is too energetic to seem to have a bone to pick , and that ends in a way that 's brilliant and moving.<br /><br />I've had reservations about Panahi 's films before , but this one kicks ass . Panahi does something remarkable here . He critiques his society , presents an unusual drama , and touches our hearts with a sense of a nation 's aspirations .
1 Another fantastic film from a country , where due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes , has no problems in creating passionate subject matter . Panahi takes a different approach this time around with a blend of ironic comedy and an endearing , non - professional cast . While still getting across his message of what he sees as being inherently wrong with his country , he does so without the need of a heavy storyline . It is a positive take on a country , in particular its people , that the Iranian population desperately need . The greatest pity is it wo n't be released domestically . The insular , paranoid Iranian government assert that this fine film maker is only successful overseas because he is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them . After growing up amid revolution and watching the academics , artists and educated ' disappear ' over the last 25 years he shows great bravery in continuing to put his work out there . The realism achieved by shooting at the actual world cup qualifier really transports you to the event . The fact he shot it on 35 mm is amazing as most would only attempt this project using a digital format . It looks fantastic . His insistence in only using non - professional actors also really works in this film . Fine performances all round . After watching many films showing the problems Iran has and also the news media reporting the facts we can tend to demonise the people as well as the government . This film does the opposite . It shows us they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law that maybe a change for the better is n't too far away . Some call Panahi a feminist film maker but I think he just fights for the most oppressed demographic in Iran . Young , independent women .
1 In Iran , the Islamic Revolution has shaped all parts of life , including everyday things . But people still go on living their lives , generally just doing the things you 'd expect , like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it 's in the running to qualify for the World Cup . Except women are n't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game.<br /><br />A frequently funny little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium . The absurdity of the situation , the simple wish of these women to cheer on the team ( nothing subversive there ) , and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a fine comment on humanity versus the ideology.<br /><br />Amateurish acting , good script and dialogue , a really enjoyable film . Bend It Like Beckham , sort of - a warm heart and a joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people .
1 This was the first of Panahi 's films that I have seen , I saw it at Melbourne film festival . I was totally absorbed by the different characters that he creates and how differently they react and behave compared to Aussie kids and yet on other levels how similarly . I think perhaps if more people could see movies like this , they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be fueled by the fear of the unknown . There are the obvious large political differences between Oz culture and Iranian culture , but I found the more subtle differences between the characters , that this film fleshes out so successfully on screen , extremely fascinating . There are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem to me , so unique . I found it made the characters compelling viewing .
1 That 's what one of the girls said at the end.<br /><br />Is the soccer game a metaphor for a qualifying game between the girls ( or more broadly , a free - thinking group ) and the authority ? " To Germany " means to a future that 's of hope ? < br /><br />It 's one of the most unforgettable cinematic experience I 've ever had -- despite the crude cinematography and plot , and mild over - acting ( though I like the cast -- they 're lovable and well above the expectation for amateurs ) . The ridiculous situation is well captured . I can feel the deep frustration being denied to a game ( being female and a soccer fan ) and I can not stop thinking how to make a convincing disguise . I wonder why there 's no women 's section in which protection from dirty language and bad behavior can be provided -- defeating the flawed reasons for the deny.<br /><br />The movie is very cleverly made -- the amazing title , the filming during the actual game , the spontaneity , and various methods to put the viewers into the shoes of the characters -- the game that 's so important but inaccessible ( not shown ) , the luring light and cheering sound from the stadium , the confinement of the van , and the uselessness of it when those inside connect with the celebrating crowds outside . I can feel the comfort coming from the radio , the drinks and the food , and of course , the kindness and consideration from each character to others . During the end credits , I am amused that no character has a name -- he 's just any " soldier " and she 's just any " girl " or " sister " .
1 I have to point out , before you read this review , that in no way , is this a statement against Iranian people ... if you really want to read something into it , than hopefully you see , that I 'm against politicians in general ... but if you 're looking to be offended ... I ca n't help you!<br /><br />Not in Iran as this movie is banned there ( see IMDb trivia for this movie ) . Which is a shame , because the movie is great . Would it not be for " Grbavica " , this movie would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlin.<br /><br />Rightfully so ( it was the runner - up , or second place if you will ) . Why ? Because it is a movie about oppression . It 's not even that this is a complete women issue . It is about the government trying to keep the people down . An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie . But by banning it nothing is resolved and/or can they make this movie disappear ! < br /><br />Another reviewer had a great summary line : " Comedy about a tragedy " , that sums it up pretty well !
1 I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret Ballot ( 2001 ) . Now I know about four times as much ( I doubt I learned a whole heck of a lot from Not Without My Daughter ( 1991)).<br /><br />Offside is a splendid budget Iranian comedy about a group a girls ( working individually ) to attend a decisive soccer match for their country 's place in the World Cup . Women are not allowed to attend soccer matches , so the nation 's armed forces have been mobilized to save any women who try to enter from themselves . Some ( teen ? ) girls try to crash the party by dressing as boys , but are caught . The movie is mostly set at this holding pen where the girls are detained by soldiers , awaiting some unspecified punishment ( although , the girl who dressed as a soldier claims that she was one insignia away from being executed!)<br /><br />The movie explores the absurdity of the situation . The thinking that bars women from football matches comes down to it being too raunchy an experience for the fairer sexa philosophy not unknown in the west less than 100 years ago . This farce comes to a head when a girl needs to go to the bathroom , so a soldier escorting her demands that she cover her eyes so she ca n't see the graffiti . The conflict is not entirely about the battle of the sexes : at one point some friction arises between a solider who is rural and the girls who are urban.<br /><br />Fortunately , this movie was not too culturally esoteric that the comedy was lost on this neighbour and cultural cousin of the Great Satan . You have to be in the mood for it , but no one should avoid this movie because they think that they wo n't get it .
1 On the face of it a film about women wanting to see a football match would n't appeal much to somebody with little interest in football such as myself however this is n't about football it is about discrimination and the women 's enthusiasm for the sport they love.<br /><br />The film opens on the day of a crucial World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Bahrain , a girl is trying to get in to Tehran 's Azadi Stadium by dressing like a boy , it looks like she will get in until a soldier tries to search her . Once caught she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium where there are a handful of women who had already been caught , here they are guarded by a small group of conscript soldiers who 's leader would rather be back home tending his livestock . We never learn the character 's names but we get to know them as people as the girls plead with the guards to let them watch though a nearby gap in the wall and when refused try to get them to at least provide a commentary.<br /><br />As well as making an important point about the rigid gender segregation in much of present day Iran the film contains many hilarious moments such as the " disguise " one of the girls is made to wear when going to the toilet and the girl who disguised herself as a soldier and was only caught because she chose to watch the match from a seat reserved for a senior officer . The girls enthusiasm for the game is such that by the end the viewer is likely to be on the edge of their seat hoping that Iran will win and thus get to go to the finals in Germany . The soldiers are n't shown as fundamentalists , they are just conscripts who are there because they have to be and when explaining to the girls why woman ca n't watch men 's sports do n't seem that convinced by their own arguments.<br /><br />It is a shame that this film ca n't be seen in Iran itself but it is good that the wider world can see it and thus see that ordinary Iranians are n't a bunch of fanatics desperate to wage war on the west but normal people with the same passions and concerns as people everywhere . The cast did a great job in making their characters seem like real people rather than mere caricatures .
1 Not a bad film . Somehow I was made to actually root for the Iranians to win the game played in the movie even though I do n't know anything about soccer and am not a fan . The ending on the bus was exhilarating.<br /><br />The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran , and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear . Despite this law , some women try to sneak in , but many of them get caught and detained . It 's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender . In an interview , Panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices , and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how Iran once lived . One hopes that future will come sooner rather than later .
1 Ah , the best and funniest movie about female football fans , only slightly better than the 1982 saga of teenage delusion set in North London ( qv ) . By the way , I just watched this on Film 4 [ 2008 - 12 - 21 ] and am ruing my inability to set the PVR).<br /><br />This is easily my second favourite football movie after " Mike Bassett : England Manager " , but this time with the added twist of looking like a guerrilla piece of movie - making from a team who apparently keep making movies which are banned in the country in which they are made ( just think about the bit where the girls are taken from the stadium just as the Sun is setting : fast reactions all round ) . < br /><br />It is rare for a movie to make me laugh out loud , but when the rural soldier escorted one of the girls into the lavvies while forcing her to wear an inpromptu mask made from a poster of Ali Daei , I could n't stop waking the others in the house with my snorts , especially when the young soldier misunderstood the grandfather 's calls for assistance ... < br /><br />Speaking of the toilets , I just wish I could speak Farsi so that I could work out the writing on the toilet walls ( yes , there were a few scribblings in Roman script , but they mostly referred to wanky American rock bands).<br /><br />Also , on the rural - and - Farsi theme , do n't you reckon that Omid Djalili sounds like a yokel when he talks Farsi ? Listen to the custody sergeant in this movie and then go " Yup." < br /><br />I'm not going to bore on about the sexual politics of Iran , and I 'm not going to bore on about the dubious acting ; my love for this movie comes from the script and the editing : top notch stuff.<br /><br />Here 's a list of my top favourite football movies : 1 . Mike Bassett , England Manager 2 . Offside 3 . Those Glory Glory Days 4 . A Shot at Glory 5 . The Arsenal Stadium Mystery
1 Different film directors from different countries have contributed to the film medium a lot by their thoughts . As a result , we have experienced different genres when the medium is concerned . Jafar Panahi , unlike J.L. Godard or F. Truffault , believes in simple story telling ; Schematic Narratives is one of the main traits of his directorial job . He has trust upon the automatic as well as critical intelligence of the viewer ; he does not feel any necessity to go for Alienation or such things to reach to the viewers . He is equally effective despite being conventional . Offside ( 2006 ) , is another schematic creation from him , where Gender Subordination of Middle - East Asia gets gradually clear to everybody as the simple but catchy tale of the movie progresses . Now - a - days , when all of us are shouting on the issue of Rights of Women , this movie very calmly creeps into our mind and ultimately becomes a hump for our critical intelligence by conveying the message that the Egality of Human Rights is nothing but an illusive good , an utopia . Paternity will never let the women to be empowered . An important soccer match where the nation is participating , a teenage girl who understands the game well , loves her nation does not have the rights to enter into the stadium to cheer for her country . She is merely permitted to listen to the live commentary . Her alias could not work for her . As a result , she had to undergo several humiliating situations . From the very beginning her worried father ran here and there for her daughter . At the end of the day , celebration came as the nation won the match which the girl could not see as she was detained in the outer side of the stadium during the match time . But the celebration can not suppress the question of Rights of Women which remain in every corner of the world in different format . Jafar Panahi has most successfully pointed to this issue of Gender Abuse from with in the frame of conventional film making and patriarchy as well . A Global Tragedy has been dealt with ease and some times with humour which , in turn , teases our being constantly .
1 In Iran , women are not permitted to attend men 's sporting events , apparently to " protect " them from all the cursing and foul language they might hear emanating from the male fans ( so since men ca n't restrain or behave themselves , women are forced to suffer . Go figure . ) . " Offside " tells the tale of a half dozen or so young women who , dressed like men , attempt to sneak into the high - stakes match between Iran and Bahrain that , in 2005 , qualified Iran to go to the World Cup ( the movie was actually filmed in large part during that game).<br /><br />"Offside " is a slice - of - life comedy that will remind you of all those great humanistic films ( " The Shop on Main Street , " " Loves of a Blonde , " " Closely Watched Trains " etc . ) that flowed out of Communist Czechoslovakia as part of the " Prague Miracle " in the mid 1960 's . As with many of those works , " Offside " is more concerned with observing life than with devising any kind of elaborately contrived fictional narrative . Indeed , it is the simplicity of the setup and the naturalism of the style that make the movie so effective.<br /><br />Once their ruse is discovered , the girls are corralled into a small pen right outside the stadium where they can hear the raucous cheering emanating from the game inside . Stuck where they are , all they can do is plead with the security guards to let them go in , guards who are basically bumbling , good - natured lads who are compelled to do their duty as a part of their compulsory military service . Even most of the men going into the stadium do n't seem particularly perturbed at the thought of these women being allowed in . Still the prohibition persists . Yet , how can one not be impressed by the very real courage and spunk displayed by these women as they go up against a system that continues to enforce such a ridiculously regressive and archaic restriction ? And , yet , the purpose of these women is not to rally behind a cause or to make a " point . " They are simply obsessed fans with a burning desire to watch a soccer game and , like all the men in the country , cheer on their team.<br /><br />It 's hard to tell just how much of the dialogue is scripted and how much of it is extemporaneous , but , in either case , the actors , with their marvelously expressive faces , do a magnificent job making each moment seem utterly real and convincing . Mohammad Kheir - abadi and Shayesteh Irani are notable standouts in a uniformly excellent cast . The structure of the film is also very loose and freeform , as writer / director Jafar Panahi and co - writer Shadmehr Rastin focus for a few brief moments on one or two of the characters , then move smoothly and effortlessly onto others . With this documentary - type approach , we come to feel as if we are witnessing an actual event unfolding in " real time . " Very often , it 's quite easy for us to forget we 're actually watching a movie.<br /><br />It was a very smart move on the part of the filmmakers to include so much good - natured humor in the film ( it 's what the Czech filmmakers did as well ) , the better to point up the utter absurdity of the situation and broaden the appeal of the film for audiences both domestic and foreign . " Offside " is obviously a cry for justice , but it is one that is made all the more effective by its refusal to make of its story a heavy - breathing tragedy . Instead , it realizes that nothing breaks down social barriers quite as efficiently as humor and an appeal to the audience 's common humanity . And is n't that what true art is supposed to be all about ? In its own quiet , understated way , " Offside " is one of the great , under - appreciated gems of 2007 .
1 This is a totally delightful and unexpected film . You start by following a young person who hopes to get into the qualifying football game between Bahrain and Iran . If Iran win they will get into the 2006 World Cup in Germany . The problem is the young person is a girl and girls ( or women for that matter ) are not allowed into football matches to " sit with men " . What follows is a wonderful comedy , played with consummate skill by a small ensemble cast . The film explores the absurdity of restrictions on the freedom of women ( and for that matter the young soldiers who have to corral them ) . There are some excellent set pieces , not least when one of the girls must go to the toilet and , of course , the stadium has no toilets for women . The camera work is of the simplest and in some ways this story could have been told as a stage play . Yet it is the small scale that gives the film its bite . Great cinema ? No , probably not ; great entertainment - for sure .
1 Offside is the story of teenage - girls who tried to sneak in the stadium to watch final world cup qualifying soccer match in Tehran that may lead Iran to the 2006 world cup in Germany . Females are forbidden to go to stadium by law in Iran , although many of them dress like boys and sneak in . Stadium guards search every one at the entrance to make sure no one carries fireworks and of course ; no girl gets in.<br /><br />Like most of Panahi 's work , his armature cast 's performance was superb . You actually think that you are watching a documentary . The dialogs between the girls and the privates were executed delicately and astonishingly believable . The film depicts the interactions between captives and the drafted guards who themselves are serving mandartory away from their family and friends in a funny sort of way . At the end , the audience realizes that there is not such a difference between the girls and the guards who were just following orders .
1 Which do you think the average person would know more / less about : Iranian cinema or Iranian football ? Interestingly , the two come to the forefront of controversial Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi 's latest film entitled ' Offside ' , a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around one 's right to do something or go somewhere and an individual 's right to extend that courtesy if and when they 'd like to . The odd thing is , you do n't come away from Offside having learnt about Iranian football or too much about Iranian cinema ( unless it 's an education in Panahi 's controversial style ) , but you do come away feeling enlightened , that at least someone from Iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like Iran , and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it.<br /><br />I can remember the 2006 World Cup , I 'm sure many people can . It was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the slog that was my first year , a summer of World Cup football acted as a nicely timed tonic . Needless to say , I saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid incidences as seen in Spain ' 82 when it was thought West Germany and Austria transpired to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of Algeria.<br /><br />Anyone in Britain that was watching the BBC 's broadcast of the Iran  Mexico game , both nations ' first of the tournament , may remember that at the top of the show , the BBC 's football anchorman Gary Lineker let off a snide comment to introduce the match . It went something like : ' We 've seen giants Germany , England , Argentina and Holland play but now we get to see ......... Mexico and Iran battle it out ' . The emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore . It 's a shame because there are people , and films like Offside present them , who are really willing to see Iran play to the point where they risk their well - being to achieve it and it 's sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they deem ' inferior ' when there are others who 'd do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage.<br /><br />When immediately thinking of the words ' Iran ' , ' football ' and ' World Cup ' , my mind flies back to the France ' 98 game between said nation and America . Here is a film about a World Cup game of sorts involving Iran but where some or indeed most Iranian filmmakers may well have opted to present a tale revolving around Iran 's famous victory over The United States and what that meant to them , director Panahi chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are barred from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense magnitude . You can imagine a heavy handed film detailing Iran 's ' victory ' as a lumbering propaganda film designed to exploit as they ' defeat ' a Western power or ' enemy ' at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in.<br /><br />A couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the unbeatable at their own game are 2001 Indian film ' Lagaan ' , in which the Indian peasants defeat the ruling British at cricket . Similalry , 2005 's ' The Game of Their Lives ' sees the Americans defeat the English at a football match only this time in the 1950 World Cup . The differences between these films and Offside are immense ; Offside is looking at a situation behind a state 's mentality and dares to explore an essence of Feminism as the girls , trying to see their beloved Iran defeat Bahrain and qualify for the World Cup , are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude purgatory mere feet from a barred window that would allow them to see the game . The reasoning is to do with the foul language the men ' may ' , not will , but ' may ' use during the game . The film presents Iran as so incompetent that they can not take away a man 's right to swear and ban the bad language but must ban a woman 's right to see the game all together  it is no wonder Panahi 's film was itself banned in Iran.<br /><br />But Panahi remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke cigarettes and use mobile phones , two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body / mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match . Panahi pays special attention to the title of his film ' Offside ' which itself is a ruling within football detailing when an ' attacker ' is ' caught ' trying to gain an advantage in the field of play . The parallels run with the womens ' position in the film as these advancing ( supposedly without right ) individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team ; that being the state itself.<br /><br />I think Offside is one of the better films to come out of the Middle East and surrounding Gulf area that I 've seen . It 's a tense but humbling film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the IMDb and thus , the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo - realist aura to it all . The immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrong - doers who dared to defy the state is wonderful . I also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons I 've mentioned shows a distinct level of callous , either that or you work in the Iranian government .
1 There are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious , political and societal means . Not to diminish the films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights , as well as wage inequality , and marginalization in society , all in the name of Allah or God or some other ridiculous justification , but sometimes it is helpful to just take another approach and shed some light on the subject.<br /><br />The setting is the 2006 match between Iran and Bahrain to qualify for the World Cup . Passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to get into the match.<br /><br />The women who were caught ( Played by Sima Mobarak - Shahi , Shayesteh Irani , Ayda Sadeqi , Golnaz Farmani , and Mahnaz Zabihi ) and detained for prosecution provided a funny and illuminating glimpse into the customs of this country and , most likely , all Muslim countries . Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who were guarding and transporting them , both city and villagers , and the father who was looking for his daughter provided some hilarious moments as we thought about why they have such unwritten rules.<br /><br />It is mainly about a paternalistic society that feels it has to save it 's women from the crude behavior of it 's men . Rather than educating the male population , they deny privilege and rights to the women.<br /><br />Seeing the changes in the soldiers responsible and the reflection of Iranian society , it is nos surprise this film will not get any play in Iran . But Jafar Panahi has a winner on his hands for those able to see it .
1 It was simple and yet so nice . I think the whole sense of sex segregation in society , which can be bitter , was shown very delicately . It had a bitter kind of hummer in it . The fact that most of the actors were not professionals , made the movie more tangible and more realistic . There was a " documentary " side to the movie too . The best scenes were those that all the girls , banned from watching , were listening passionately to the soldier , who is supposed to keep an eye on them , broadcasting the game . If you are an Iranian , the familiar cheering and dancing in the streets after a game won , fills you up with National pride ! ! If you are not Iranian , you 'll still love it all the same !
1 I felt this movie was as much about human sexuality as anything else , whether intentionally or not . We are also shown how absurd and paradoxical it is for women not to be allowed to such a nationally important event , meanwhile forgetting the pasts of our respective " advanced " nations . I write from Japan , where women merely got the right to vote 60 years ago , and female technical engineers are a recent phenomenon . Pubs in England were once all - male , the business world was totally off - limits for women in America until rather recently , and women in China had their feet bound so they could n't develop feet strong enough to escape their husbands . Iran is conveniently going through this stage in our time , and we get a good look at how ridiculous we have all looked at one time or another . Back to the issue of sexuality , we are made to wonder what it may be intrinsically about women that make them unfit for a soccer game ( the official reason is that the men are bad ) . Especially such boyish girls , a couple so much so that you even get the feeling that lesbianism is on the agenda as well . I think one point is that not all women are the same , and the women the police are trying to " protect " are not the ones who would try to get in in the first place . The opening scenes of the approach to the stadium makes you appreciate the valor of the young women trying to get in -- and each one separately -- at all . It is a brutish man 's world . Any woman brave enough to try to go should be allowed ! The world of sexuality is not one - size - fits - all.<br /><br />Meanwhile , the apprehended criminal girls bond inside the makeshift pen awaiting their deportation to who - knows - where , and in a much more subtle way , begin to bond with the guards keeping watch over them . These had definite ideas about women and femininity , which were being challenged head - on . The change in attitude is glacial , but visible.<br /><br />Since the movie is pure Iran from the first moment , it takes a little easing - into for the foreigner , but the characters have a special way of endearing themselves to you , and you end up getting the whole picture , and even understanding the men 's misunderstandings and give them slack . The supposed villain is the unseen patriarchy of the Ayatollahs , which remain unseen and unnamed , and likely unremembered.<br /><br />Knowing that this movie was filmed during the actual event of the Iran - Bahrain match gives me a feeling of awe for all involved .
1 Is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story ? Maybe , hell , you know how the formula works by now , pretty woman is introduced in to a picture , someone has to fall in love with her.<br /><br />I think this film does follow some typical story lines , but that does n't say anything about the content . There are great scenes with Crispen Glover , Dennis Hopper , and Gary Busey , although short . Some things did n't make sense , such as the need to get in to random fights , but it is entertaining to watch , the fights were actually well done.<br /><br />This is definitely a comedy foremost , but it does have a lot of good feel to it . The humor is well balanced , you wo n't hurt your stomach on this , but you will keep a smile.<br /><br />There is a little bit of steamy action , so not one for the kids .
1 My wife and I have watched this movie twice . Both of us used to be in the Military . Besides being funny as hell , it offers a very realistic view of life in the Navy from the perspective of A Navy enlisted man , and tells it " like it really is " . We 're adding this movie to our permanent collection !
1 If you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor , then you will enjoy this flick.<br /><br />I do n't understand why anyone would n't enjoy this one . Take it for what it is : a vehicle for Dennis Hopper to mess with your head and make you laugh . It ai n't Shakespeare , but it is well done . Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one - Better than any episode of Baywatch - and shows a knack for subtle humor . Too bad she has n't had many opportunities to expand on that.<br /><br />Tom Berenger fits his role of " real Navy " perfectly and William McNamara does a solid job as a hustler.<br /><br />Throw in a walk - on by Hopper in the middle of the chase for " the Cherry on this Sundae " and you 've got a movie that kept my attention and kept me laughing . I bought this one as soon as it was available.<br /><br />Brain - candy .
1 no movie with dennis hopper , gary busey , erika eleniak , tom berenger , dean stockwell , marilu henner deserves a rating under 5 on here . This is a poor mans version of movies like 16 blocks or the timeless Midnight run except the prisoner being transported here is the very easy on the eye Ms . Eleniak . Tom Berenger plays another gruff , maverick military type well and William Mcnamara plays his rookie - about to be discharged foil well . The plot on the face of it is absurd because I lost count of the times Eleniak should have and could have escaped but this is an entertaining feel - good movie and there are good cameos from all of the above actors that keep the movie rolling . This is n't really a family movie as there is some swearing and a rare nude scene with eleniak but this is a lot better than some of the other guff that came out around this time .
1 Well , the movie is n't exactly " funny." < br /><br />Okay , I admit , there are a few HUMOROUS lines , but definitely nothing that is laugh - out - loud funny . For example : Right before a steamy sex scene between Eleniak and one of her male costars , sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he can not remove her shirt . Before leaving the room to retrieve the key , he tells her , " Okay , do n't go anywhere." < br /><br />See , humorous , but not funny.<br /><br />The plot and acting are pretty good.<br /><br />But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show . She 's hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one ca n't help but rewind and re - watch.<br /><br />There are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines.<br /><br />Overall , 5 stars . I 'd only give it three if not for Erika Eleniak .
1 I have seen this film on countless occasions , and thoroughly enjoyed it each time . This is mostly due to the lovely Erika Eleniak- a great actress with incredible looks . Plus , any film starring Tom Berenger and Dennis Hopper is bound to be entertaining .
1 what can i say ? , ms Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever , and like a Italian American , fan number one of female beauty i ca n't forget this movie.<br /><br />you know i really do n't remember a lot about the plot , or the situations or the other actors . i only can remember about drop dead gorgeous Erika and that in this film she looks better than ever , i really do n't care if it was a bad movie or a good movie , i only care the nice moments i had been a teenager in Brooklyn just contemplating Erika 's beauty.<br /><br />Well just to conclude if you are an Erika Eleniak 's beauty fan like me definitely this film is for you .
1 Clark Gable plays a con man who busts into the life of hard - boiled dame Jean Harlow . He tries to sucker her while she brushes him off with her tough - gal attitude . Despite their cynicism and cons they fall in love . When Gable accidentally kills a man during a sting he runs out leaving loyal Harlow to women 's prison where she discovers she 's pregnant . Anita Loos ' and Howard Emmett Rogers ' writing is excellent throughout with many well - drawn and surprising characters ( including a Jewish socialist woman inmate and a black woman inmate and her preacher father played with hardly a trace of stereotype ) . Gable and Harlow show their mettle as actors adding telling nuances and quirks to their characters that send them beyond the typical Gable and Harlow roles . And the direction is much better than you 'd expect from Sam Wood . One beautiful shot has Harlow being inducted into the prison , then led out into a surprisingly snowy courtyard as the camera tracks after her . This is one of the best of both the " criminals in love " and " women 's prison " genres and has some of the best hard - boiled dialogue ever written .
1 This movie is witty , watchable and utterly touching . And now often do you get to see Jean Harlow ( or any actress of this era , for that matter ) give another woman a swift punch in the jaw ? ( Twice!)<br /><br />After Harlow 's Ruby is sent to a reformatory after getting mixed up with Gable 's Edward Hall ( he of that cheesy yet endearing crooked smile ) , her predicament becomes all the more complicated when she discovers that she is pregnant , and she 's convinced that this rake has abandoned her , but in fact , her love has reformed him and he comes to see her , despite the fact that he will be arrested , and from the help of a minister , are married.<br /><br />The wonderful relationship that Harlow shares with her fellow inmates is second only to her electric chemistry with Gable , who was her most frequent leading man . Her cynical character is a perfect match for Gable 's smooth - talking crook . What 's not to like?<br /><br />"You know , you would n't be a bad looking dame - if it was n't for your face ! " Ruby cuttingly remarks to Gypsy , her rival . " If you 're going to get that close to me , I 'll have to open the other window!" < br /><br />Priceless ! ! !
1 Hold Your Man finds Jean Harlow , working class girl from Brooklyn falling for con man Clark Gable and getting in all kinds of trouble . The film starts out as his film , but by the time it 's over the emphasis definitely switches to her character.<br /><br />The film opens with Gable pulling a street con game with partner , Garry Owen and the mark yelling for the cops . As he 's being chased Gable ducks into Harlow 's apartment and being he 's such a charming fellow , she shields him.<br /><br />Before long she 's involved with him and unfortunately with his rackets . Gable , Harlow , and Owen try pulling a badger game on a drunken Paul Hurst , but then Gable wo n't go through with it . Of course when Hurst realizes it was a con , he 's still sore and gets belligerent and Gable has to punch him out . But then he winds up dead outside Harlow 's apartment and that platinum blond hair makes her easy to identify . She goes up on an accomplice to manslaughter.<br /><br />The rest of the film is her 's and her adjustment to prison life . Her interaction with the other female prisoners give her some very good scenes . I think some of the material was later used for the MGM classic Caged.<br /><br />Harlow also gets to do the title song and it 's done as torch style ballad , very popular back in those days . She talk / sings it in the manner of Sophie Tucker and quite well . < br /><br />Gable is well cast as the con man who develops a conscience , a part he 'd play often , most notably in my favorite Gable film , Honky Tonk.<br /><br />Still it 's Harlow who gets to shine in this film . I think it 's one of the best she did at MGM , her fans should not miss it .
1 I expected this film to be a run - of - the - mill 1930 's romance . Boy meets girl , they fall in love , boy loses girl , boy wins her back in the end . It was n't like that at all . Clark Gable plays con artist Eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow raising . He is hiding out from the cops when he bursts into Ruby ( Jean Harlow ) 's apartment , to find her covered in bubbles in the bathtub , no less . Instant chemistry . She plays hard to get for a while , but a girl can only resist that grin for so long . The heat between them is evident , and there are some scenes that are definitely pre - production code ! When a blackmail job goes bad and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for " troubled girls " , she is miserable and , thanks to the ragging her roommate gives her , begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her . Harlow plays the hard - nosed , fast talking Ruby perfectly . She never lets Gable get all the good lines ! There is an especially moving scene with her playing " their song " on the piano that is acted perfectly . The last fifteen minutes have me crying every time . A truly sweet romance .
1 One of the great mysteries of life , suffered from daily , is why nice girls so often are more interested in the jerks and heels than in the nice guys.<br /><br />Worse , when the nice guys even want to marry those girls , the girls STILL prefer the jerks and heels , even after the jerks and heels have shown their contempt , have shown they 're just interested in using the girls.<br /><br />Stu Erwin is the nice guy , who continues to be nice after being lied to and cheated and even after losing the girl completely.<br /><br />Clark Gable is the jerk , and he is perfect in the role , rather a sad note to his fans.<br /><br />Jean Harlow comes across as a more slender Mae West , even sounding like La West in some of her cynical throwaway lines.<br /><br />Somewhat puzzling is that so many of the other characters , intended to be bad guys -- I mean , heck , they 're locked up , so they must be -- are so obviously nice people.<br /><br />In fact , there are lots of nice people here , people who , in a lesser film or story , would be snarling and back - stabbing but here go out of their way to help someone else.<br /><br />So , maybe the story is rather clichéd , at least by modern standards , but ultimately the viewer will be glad to have watched.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I have is that so many really good actors are not given credit . Once again , we can say a fervent " Thank You " to IMDb.com .
1 Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were a great on screen team and this may be their best movie together.<br /><br />Yes , Hold Your Man can be cheesy and predictable , but that 's not what I love about the movie . I love seeing Harlow and Gable together and in this film they are simply wonderful . It is obvious that they really enjoyed working together and that is part of what makes this such a wonderful film.<br /><br />The witty dialogue , great script and attention to detail are the other things that make this such a good movie . I loved this movie the first time I saw it and on each subsequent viewing I always notice at least one new detail . To me , that is a mark of a great film.<br /><br />The dialogue and script are better than most movies from this time period ( early 30 's ) . I adore classic movies , but I admit that most of them are just average and at times do n't hold my interest . Hold Your Man is one of the exceptions.<br /><br />This has a lot to do with the fact that Hold Your Man is a ' pre - code ' movie . ( The Hays code was not enforced until a year after Hold Your Man . ) This movie could not have been made under the code . Well , it could have been made , but it would have been an entirely different story . Thank goodness the code was not enforced until 1934 . Otherwise , we would have missed out on this gem .
1 If you only read a synopsis of the plot , this movie would sound like quite a typical one of the 1930 's . The story would seem quite contrived , the subject matter maudlin . The strength and beauty of this film is in the direct , earthy performances of the cast . I have seldom seen Jean Harlow display such a range of feeling , rich and subtle nuances float over her face . If you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel , there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal characters . The raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed , so true . The final sequence is almost unbearably poignant : when Clark Gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son , lifts him up and proudly says , " My kid ! " , I could n't help remember that Mr. Gable 's own son was born to him posthumously . This is one of the finest examples of Depression era cinema .
1 Do n't listen to the many acerbic and derisory comments heaped upon this film ..... simply put , as regards ninja movies , this my friends is about as good as it gets ! < br /><br />Yes it 's silly , yes the acting and script are admittedly absolutely atrocious , but by gum - it 's so much bloody fun ! In fact , as is often the case with B - Movies , the horrendous ' acting ' ( which in the case of the movie in question , is truly amongst the worst I have ever had the joy to behold ! ) and ridiculous ' plot ' actually only serve to elevate the enjoyment level ten fold.<br /><br />Obviously the fight scenes are the main attraction in this though and for the most part I 'm pleased to say , they 're very well choreographed , especially the final showdown ( during which we witness that ninja are not ostensibly constrained by the normal laws of gravity .... ) < br /><br />Trust me on this , if you are a fan of ninja movies and you have not yet seen Sakura Killers , then you are truly missing out on what is in my opinion , one of the true jewels in the crown of the genre .
1 It 's hard to rate films like this , because do you rate it on production or just fun?<br /><br />I saw this film back in about 1988/89 or so when I was a boy and I 'm sorry to say it started a life long fascination with ninjas . The plot is fairly dire and the acting is of course terrible , but there is a certain mystique surrounding the ninjas in this film which makes for quite a good atmosphere . What is important are the fight scenes , while a ' little ' sparce , are really good.<br /><br />I must say it was better when I was a boy , only now can I see the glaring points of unbelievable nonsense in the film , but as a " sit back with a few beers " martial arts film I ca n't fault it , it delivers and is much better than the mountains of " American Ninja " Style rubbish that was churned out in the 80 's with hundreds of guys in black suits but really not very good fight scenes.<br /><br />In an interesting note , Dusty Nelson , the writer and director of Sakura Killers did another ninja film under the Bonaire movie flag called " White Phantom " I have no idea if this was meant to be a sequel to Sakura Killers " but the Sakura clan is once again a main feature , including the same logo and similar story only this time including a White Ninja . This too , while being mostly dire , had a small sense of atmosphere but the fight scenes are even more sparce and to be frank , are pretty awful.<br /><br />So , if you are a martial arts fan then give it a blast to kill a few hours !
1 Hey people , what 's up . It 's me man , the one and only Mike " Sonny Sakura KIller " Kelly . You know ........ you ca n't really write a review on the script of Sakura , cause there we did n't have one . As far as I know , the story was just made up as we went along . I had the best time of my life making that film , and got so much stank that I ran out of Jism ........... fun times . So glad that you all enjoyed the film . I really did n't get to do the fights that I had envisioned . Every time I set up some moves , the fight director kept changing them . Still , I had a blast and met some really great people . Especially the purple female Ninja who has seem to fall of the film - making scene .
1 Found this flick in a videostore , it cost $ 2 to buy . The whole movie stinks really bad ! The so - called colonel , who would the hero here if the cover could have been trusted , must be in his eighties and is barely able to walk . He nevertheless manages to shoot some of the dumbest ninjas in the world . Then the story leaves the colonel , which makes sense given the old man 's inability to DO anything worth mentioning , a now two terrifyingly eighties - looking guys take over , in what must have been some sort of story . I got lost a hundred times but did n't mind , because the movie is so bad , it 's real fun to watch . Zero - Budget trash with actors not deserving that name . Go check it out !
1 As I said in my comment about the first part : These two movies are better than most Science Fiction Fans confess.<br /><br />The scenario in the second movie is not that moving as we do n't see the destruction of human civilization , but the aftermath , thousands of refugees fleeing in tiny space cans , protected by only one powerful spaceship.<br /><br />But when Battlestar Pegasus appears , the story heats up , carrying the battle back to the Cylon Planets . Okay , it has a little bit of Mad Max because all they fight for is fuel for their spaceships to travel on to find the distant Earth , but it works for me . It is thrilling Science Fiction entertainment featuring fine actors and decent special effects ( even though those tend to repeat themselves , to say the least :-) ) .<br /><br />I would have loved a continuation with Starbuck and Apollo on board . Instead , we got a second sequel with no name characters who proved that the story had worked before especially because the feature characters were so well - chosen ... <br /><br />So thumbs down for the productions of 1980 , but thumbs up for the two movies from 1978 .
1 Although others have commented that this video is just an edited version of the two shows : " Fire in Space " and " Living Legend " , if you watch the original shows you 'll find that dialogue from this video edition was edited out . I found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it . I would say if you want to see the show in its original version , see the video versions on VHS . They have more to offer the fan than the original episodes being offered on DVD now . Another good video is Conquest for the Earth , which had more scenes from Galactica 1980 than did the actual broadcasts themselves . Overall , I rate this as a 10 because it gives you more to enjoy than what the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers .
1 This movie is pretty good . Half a year ago , i bought it on DVD . But first i thought that it was the original film . I have seen the series and it is a good film , but here , they have put " The Living Legend , part1 and 2",and " Fire in space " together . The same as they did with the first film , but with other episodes . But still , it is a pretty good film . Only the ending is strange ( you do n't see what happens with the Pegasus ) . But I still think that it is pretty good . The actors and special effects were good . If you have n't seen it , go see it . Starring : Richard Hatch , Dirk Benedict , Lorne Greene , Herb . Jefferson Jr. , Tony Swartz , Terry Carter , Lloyd Bridges , Jack Stauffer .
1 Let 's think people , quit bad - mouthing the original , for it 's time the original Battlestar series was a masterpiece , even still with all the stars , story lines and art . Lorne Greene was great as Adama and Richard Hatch was perfect as Apollo and Dirk Benedict was funny as Starbuck , but I dare say , not as pretty as Katee as Starbuck . < br /><br />I loved the episode with the Pegasus and Greetings from Earth was good John Calicos was great as Baltar , War of the Gods , the best was Experiment in Terra , I thought that was a tribute in a way to Heaven Can Wait , then you had the women of Battlestar , not to compare them to let 's say Tricia who is outstandingly beautiful as Number Six , but Jane Seymour 's beauty could not be compared to . Let alone Loerrta Spang as Cassiopea was fantastic .She had beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassed by . I loved the original as much as the new .<br /><br />Can you imagine if John Calicos had a number six ? : ) < br /><br />Thankyou for listening .
1 Flavia the Heretic is an undeniable work of art and probably my number one recommendation to state that the euro - exploitation cinema is severely underrated and not to be ignored . This is an intelligent and complex film , beautifully realized and  surprise  pretty damn accurate ! This is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and it 's about time those prudish film committees who categorize Flavia as forbidden trash reckon this as well . Flavia is a beautiful 14th century adolescent , forced to live the life of an obedient nun in a strict convent . She refuses to accept her being inferior just because she 's female and she curses her fellow sister for being so tolerant about this . After a fruitless attempt to escape , she befriends another rebellious nun and she even guides a troop of bloodthirsty Muslims into the walls of the convent.<br /><br />Flavia is a downright mesmerizing film ! Almost impossible to believe that director Gianfranco Mingozzi managed to make it appear so realistic and so disturbing . I challenge you to come up with a title that centers on the topic of pioneer - feminism more intensely than Flavia does . Several sequences are quite shocking ( on the verge of nightmarish , actually ) as the camera zooms in on brutal rapes , torture and mutilation . Yet all this raw footage is n't just used to satisfy perverted gorehounds , mind you . I 'm strongly convinced that they 're part of the statement ' Flavia ' is trying to communicate : Humanity ( the Catholic Church in particular ) historically proved itself to be a hypocrite and discriminating race and there 's no use in denying it any further . Films like " Flavia , the Heretic " have the courage to question and openly condemn our precious ancestors and I truly admire them for it . Flavia is an outstanding and fundamental exploitation film because of its substance , but it 's even brought to an higher level by the wondrous cinematography , the glorious costumes & scenery and a breathtaking musical score by Nicola Piovani . Florinda Bolkin is very convincing as the ambitious and headstrong nun but it 's María Casares who steals the show as Sister Agatha . She 's a man - hating and loud - mouthed nun who likes to urinate in the open field ! Amen , sister !
1 Reportedy based on actual historical events , this disturbingly violent , bloody , and shocking period epic sustains viewer interest by creating a verisimilitude missing in the majority of films set in a remote era . Ms. Bolkan 's portrayal of the rebellious nun is a tour de force . Her gradual transformation in character from an obedient if unwilling complicitor in social injustices of her day is adeptly evidenced by telling sequences : her witnessing of the hated local Duke 's casual rapist activity , her forbidden love affair with a Jew , her criminal defection to the invading Moslem forces of the sensual Prince Ahmed ( Anthony Corlan ) There are some painfully realistic gory sequences ( human flaying ) in this film that are not for the squeamish , but viewers with strong stomachs and an interest in medieval history should find ample interest . Deserves to be seen , if only as an antidote to Hollywood depictions of the medieval world .
1 Flavia(Florinda Bolkan of " Do n't Torture a Duckling " fame)is locked away in a convent of carnal desires by her father . Tired of all of the sadism she sees around her(rape of a young woman in a pigsty , sexual cravings , horse castration)Flavia decides to run from the convent with her Jewish friend from the outside , Abraham . The two do n't get very far before they are captured and then brought back to be tortured and forced to repent . After punishment she joins up with a band of Muslims called the Tarantulas , who had invaded the convent prior and leads a crusade that turns into nothing short of a bloody battle behind the convent walls."Flavia the Heretic " is a well - directed and fairly notorious piece of Italian nunsploitation . The film is slightly gruesome and sleazy at times . The acting is great and the characters are well - developed . Overall,"Flavia the Heretic " is a genuinely moving and intelligent movie with plenty of nudity and gore . You ca n't go wrong with it.8 out of 10 .
1 Too many sources routinely lump this thought - provoking period drama in part based on historical fact together with the superficially similar " nunsploitation " which was a mainstay in ' 70s Euro trash cinema , overlooking the righteous anger that drives the whole endeavor . Perhaps coincidentally it was also director Gianfranco Mingozzi 's singular attempt at narrative film - making outside of many well - received documentaries.<br /><br />Safely set within a historical context , FLAVIA charts the growing rebellion of an early 15th century Italian nun ( Florinda Bolkan 's career performance , even surpassing her sterling work in Lucio Fulci 's devastating DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING ) , locked away in convent by her not so nobleman father in a desperate attempt to curb the girl 's budding sensuous nature . Wondering why women are relegated to secondary roles at best in life as in holy scripture , she is confronted by ways in which male domination can rupture female lives , inspiring revolt fueled by the ranting of semi - crazed older Sister Agatha ( indelibly portrayed by veteran actress Maria Casarès from Marcel Carné 's LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS ) and - more constructively - by a Muslim invasion . Joining the oppressors and perhaps unwittingly manipulating them to do her bidding , Flavia truly becomes the outcast she already felt herself to be , with expected tragic results.<br /><br />With its breathtaking widescreen compositions by Alfio Contini , who shot Michelangelo Antonioni 's ZABRISKIE POINT , this is an uncompromising and austere account of one woman 's fierce yet ultimately futile fight against patriarchal society which allotted her no rights beyond childbearing or whoring as Sister Agatha wryly remarks . A lengthy drug - induced fantasy sequence clearly modeled on Ken Russell 's otherwise far more flamboyant DEVILS notwithstanding , the movie turns out relatively stingy in the skin department , making something of a mockery out of its semi - porn reputation . This is a serious work deserving rediscovery and restoration of its unjustly tarnished reputation .
1 FLAVIA THE HERETIC is a strange entry in the nunsploit genre - equal parts sleaze , feministic journey , and " history " as we follow Flavia on her strange trip.<br /><br />We start off with Flavia in a convent ... she ai n't too happy there cuz she does n't believe in all the male - dominated " rules " and macho - ism of the world around her and escapes from the convent with her Jewish pal , Abraham . They are both eventually caught and Flavia is brought back to the convent where she joins another " non - believing " nun in hastening a Moslem invasion . Flavia hangs out with the Moslems who take over the convent and get " busy " with the nuns in a strange set of scenes . Eventually the Moslems roll - out and Flavia is punished as a traitor to Christianity in another singularly brutal scene ... <br /><br />This one has pretty much all the stuff that I like to see in a 70 's era exploit film - some good gore , including nipple - removal , and a nice leg - skinning scene , some decent nudity - including the requisite full - frontal , and a decent storyline as well . I will say that it sorta dragged in a few points , but not enough to get truly bored with it . I would definitely recommend this one to nunsploit/70 's exploit fans ... 8/10
1 There is so much that can be said about this film . It is not your typical nunsploitation . Of course , there is nudity and sex with nuns , but that is almost incidental to the story.<br /><br />It is set in 15th Century Italy , at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians at Otranto . The battle between the Muslims and the Christians takes up a good part of the film . It was interesting when everyone was running from the Muslim hoards , that the mother superior would ask , " Why do you fear the Muslims , ; they will not do anything that the Christians have done to you ? " Certainly , there was enough torture on both sides.<br /><br />Sister Flavia ( Florinda Bolkan ) is sent to a convent for defying her father . In the process , she witnesses and endures many things : the gelding of a stallion , the rape of a local woman by a new Duke , the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the Tarantula Sect , and a whipping herself when she ran off with a Jew . The torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun , and her nipples cut off.<br /><br />Sister Flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male - dominated society in which she lives . She even asks Jesus , why the father , son and holy ghost are all men.<br /><br />Eventually , she joins the leader of the Muslims as his lover and they sack the convent . Here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time . But , tragedy is to come . She manages to exact sweet revenge on all , including the Duke and her father , but finds that the Muslim lover treats her exactly the same . She is a woman and that is all there is to it.<br /><br />I wo n't describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end , but it predates the torture of Saw or Hostel by decades.<br /><br />Nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats , but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to digest .
1 " Flavia , la monaca muslmana " aka . " Flavia the Heretic " of 1974 is a truly disturbing and uncompromising piece of Italian Exploitation cinema that , to a certain extent , follows a somewhat feminist premise ( though the level of sleaze and brutality would probably disgust the majority of feminists ) . Set mostly in a convent , and with a nun as the eponymous central protagonist ( great performance by the wonderful Florinda Bolkan ) , " Flavia the Heretic " may be referred to as a ' Nunsploitation ' film . However , this film differs quite drastically from the typical Nunsploitation flicks from the time , as it does n't so much focus on the nunsploitation elements such as lesbianism , sadistic lesbian punishments , etc . Personally , I saw more similarities to the Hexploitation flicks of the time , such as " Mark of The Devil " , ( even though this one does n't treat the topic of witch - hunts ) , which focus on the brutal execution of Christian fundamentalism in the middle ages and early modern period.<br /><br />Italy around 1600 : After witnessing her despotic father behead a wounded Muslim soldier , young Flavia is forced to become a nun in a convent . When her father condemns a fellow nun to a torturous death for a small misdemeanor years later , Falvia 's disgust with male violence against women turns into hatred against the despotic church , and she joins a band of Arabic scavengers ... <br /><br />One thing is for sure , " Flavia the Heretic " is not for the faint - hearted , and neither is it for those who want happy endings . Director Gianfranco Mingozzi obviously tried to make his film as realistic and disturbing as possible , especially in its nasty scenes . The many torture- and execution - scenes are extremely disturbing , with skinnings , spikings and other gruesome scenes in explicit detail , the most shocking scene probably being the torture of the young nun quite in the beginning of the film . The violence here is never superfluous , however . After all , this gruesome methods actually were reality in the time the film is set in . The film is very well - made , with realistic costumes , fantastic settings an elegant cinematography and a great score by Nicola Piovani . The stunningly beautiful and great Florinda Bolkan has proved her talent in many great Italian cult - productions ( including Lucio Fulci 's Giallo - masterpiece " Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino " of 1972 ) . She delivers another great , charismatic performance here , and I could n't imagine another actress fitting as well in the role as she does . The film has some minor inconsistencies ( E.g. why does the rigid church let bizarre cult - followers into convents in the first place ) . However , it is overall amazing how realistic this film is . " Flavia the Heretic " should definitely not be missed by my fellow fans of Italian Exploitation Cinema . This is a great Exploitation flick overall , though it definitely is a deeply depressing one and therefore should be watched in the right mood . Highly recommended to fans of disturbing exploitation cinema . 7.5/10
1 Expecting to see another Nunsploitation movie with a mean Mother Superior abusing and torturing her charges , Flavia turned out to be MUCH more than I had anticipated.<br /><br />It actually has a feminist storyline , though I do n't think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set . It certainly was n't practiced . Women ( and the Jews and the poor ) are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society . Throughout the story , Sister Flavia ( Florinda Bolkan ) witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just ca n't sit there any longer and actually does something about it , albeit with disastrous results.<br /><br />The pre - credit sequence has Flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield . She sees an injured " evil " Muslim soldier ( one of the few still alive ) and tries to assist him . Before she can , her hate - filled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face ( great family dynamics , huh ? ) . After this , her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice . Though scenes do involve violence , rape and nuns , I would consider this more of a historical drama than Nunsploitation . < br /><br />Indeed , many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there , but the acting , camera - work , storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level . Most " nun " films I 've seen usually have the basic premise of : A good girl somehow winds up in a convent , where the Mother Superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and/or make their lives a living hell.<br /><br />Flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her . Much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong - spirited ( but slightly loony- she likes to pee outside like me , but it 's a lot easier for guys ) Sister Agatha . When a group of Muslims attack their abbey , Flavia and Agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns . Their attackers actually function as their liberators ( of the cruelty and near - slavery of the abbey ) . In fact , it is a Christian , not a Muslim invader , that impales dear Sister Agatha . < br /><br />It is Agatha 's death that sends Flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her ... Her father treats her like dirt . Her Muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time . I do n't want to give out too much of the rest of the story , but be prepared to be shocked , devastated and saddened at the conclusion . This is a great film , so do n't be put off by its ( undeserved ) reputation as a trash epic . Plus , how on Earth could a movie featuring Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli go wrong ? I am not familiar with María Casares ' other works , but Sister Agatha is a hell of a character.<br /><br />I have read many great reviews of the Synapse ( US ) release , but I love my German X - Rated Kult DVD copy . It is n't anamorphic/16:9 , but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than Synapse 's release.<br /><br />And there are also many great , wise or funny lines of dialogue ( many from Sister Agatha)<br /><br />"Why is God male ? The Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit   They 're all male ! " -Flavia < br /><br />"These men are afraid- look at them , Sister- Afraid their power will be taken away from them ! " -Sr . Agatha ( regarding Christians fleeing after the Muslims arrive)<br /><br />"Woman , where are you going ? The Moslems can do nothing to you that the Christians have n't done ! Ha Ha Ha ! " -Sr . Agatha ( to a group of fleeing Christian women)<br /><br />"Lord bless these Moslems- For putting fear into these pompous Christians . " -Flavia < br /><br />"Does it take the mere sight of a Moslem to make you $ h!t your underclothing ? " -Sr . Agatha < br /><br />Closing message : " Flavia Gaetani , not yet a Muslim - no longer a Christian - was punished as a runaway nun . The idea for the film came from events which occurred during the Musalman invasions of Italy culminating in what even today is remembered as THE MARTYRDOM OF THE 800 AT OTRANTO "
1 Post - feminist depiction of cruelty and sadism.<br /><br />Spoiler alert ! < br /><br />This underrated gem of a film tells the story of Flavia , a Fifteenth Century girl of Noble birth walled up in a convent after defining her father and indeed the whole of Medieval Christian society by viewing a fallen Islamic warrior as a human rather than demonic figure.<br /><br />Unable to accept the patriarchal rule of the convent ( explicitly stated in a scene where the Bishop arrives flanked by soldiers and monks ) Flavia begins to explicitly question the society in which she finds herself and , through butting up against a whole system of subjugation , repression and violence , inevitably brings a tragic end not only to herself but all those around her.<br /><br />Billed as a piece of nunsploitation this is far from the truth . This is a film depiction the consequences of violence , the effects of patriarchal dominance , the nature of rebellion and the corruption of the human spirit.<br /><br />I described it in the title of this piece as ' post - feminist ' and in the end Flavia 's triumphs must always be corrupted , compromised and perverted by men . Even Flavia 's gruesome end is perpetrated by men for men ( the women turn away and only the monks look on without horror.<br /><br />As to the much discussed violence : this is a depiction of the effects of violence and the horrors of a world driven mad by religious excess . To have shied away from the violence would have limited the film 's impact , would have cheapened the film and allowed it to be assimilated within the Patriarchal discourse it is exposing . In addition it is a realistic portrait of medieval society.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed , brilliantly acted ( notably by Florinda Bolkin and Maria Casares ) , containing a wonderful score by piovani and still challenging after all these years Flavia is a classic of European Cinema .
1 I 'd read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for many years , but I only got to see it early last year , when I went on an insane movie - buying binge , and , for whatever reason , it has been on my mind lately , though it 's been some months since I watched it.<br /><br />It 's a striking film , set in Italy somewhere around the 15th century . Definitely Medieval - era ( though I do n't think any specific year is ever given ) . This being the time of Christian ascendancy , the age is a time of utter madness , and the movie captures this very well.<br /><br />Flavia , our protagonist , is a young lady who encounters a fallen Muslim on a battlefield . He seems a warm and intriguing fellow , and she 's immediately taken with him . Her father , a soldier of a a family of some standing , comes along , almost immediately , and murders the wounded man right before her eyes . But she 'll continue to see him in her dreams.<br /><br />Her father ships her off to a convent that seems more like an open - air insane asylum -- the residents , so harshly repressed by unyielding Medieval Christianity , slowly go mad . Flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns . But in a mad world , only the sane are truly mad , and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the insanity around her . Her take on the times in which they live strikes a chord with Flavia , who , being young and apparently sheltered , is beginning to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped.<br /><br />The movie is unflinching in its portrayal of that world , showcasing a lot of unpleasantness . We see a horse gelded , a lord rape one of the women of his lands in a pig - sty , the pious torture of a young nun . Through it all , Flavia observes and questions , rejecting , eventually , the Christian dogma that creates such a parade of horrors in terms that would gain the movie some criticism over the years for seeming anachronistic . I disagree with that criticism . Flavia 's views , though sometimes expressed in ways that vaguely mirror , for example , then - contemporary feminist commentary ( the movie was made in 1974 ) , revolve around what are really pretty obvious questions . It is , perhaps , difficult to believe she could be so much of a fish out of water in her own time , but that 's the sort of minor point it does n't do to belabor . Flavia is written in such a way to allow those of our era , or of any era , to empathize with her plight . Getting bogged down on such a matter would be missing the forest for the trees.<br /><br />Flavia is heartened when the Muslims arrive , invading the countryside , and she finds , in their leader , a new version of the handsome Islamist who still visits her dreams . Smitten with her almost immediately , he allows her to virtually lead his army , becoming a Joan of Arc figure in full battle - gear , and directing the invaders to pull down Christian society , and wreak vengeance upon all those she 's seen commit evil.<br /><br />Is she the herald of a new and better world ? She may think so , but Muslims of that era were n't big on feminism , either , as she soon learns the hard way . As they say , meet the new boss ... <br /><br />This is really just a thumbnail of some of the things that happen in FLAVIA THE HERETIC . The movie is quite grim , and with a very downbeat , rather depressing ending . Not a mass - audience movie at all , to be sure . It 's quite good , though , and does n't belong on the " nunsploitation " pile on which it is often carelessly thrown . I think there 's much value in the final film , and I 'm glad I saw it .
1 Bo Derek 's beauty and John Derek 's revolutionary direction make this film worthwhile . < br /><br />Bo , looking more gorgeous than ever , is a recently widowed woman who is experiencing visitations from her ' dead ' husband ( Anthony Quinn ) . He has a plan . Bo must procure the body of a young man so that her ghost of a husband can make his transformation from spectre back to corporeal life . Can she find a fitting candidate ? How will she do him in so Tony can do his thing ? < br /><br />With Bo 's attributes , John 's unique direction , Quinn 's film presence , and , thanks to John , a very pretty exotic look to the entire film , this movie is pleasant viewing .
1 This movie is visually stunning . Who cares if she can act or not . Each scene is a work of art composed and captured by John Derek . The locations , set designs , and costumes function perfectly to convey what is found in a love story comprised of beauty , youth and wealth . In some ways I would like to see this movie as a tribute to John and Bo Derek 's story . And ... this commentary would not be complete without mentioning Anthony Quinn 's role as father , mentor , lover , and his portrayal of a man , of men , lost to a bygone era when men were men . There are some of us who find value in strength and direction wrapped in a confidence that contributes to a sense of confidence , containment , and security . Yes , they do not make men like that anymore ! But , then how often do you find women who are made like Bo Derek .
1 Ashanti is a very 70s sort of film ( 1979 , to be precise ) . It reminded me of The Wild Geese in a way ( Richard Burton , Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa ) . It 's a very good film too , and I enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />David ( Michael Caine ) is a doctor working in Africa and is married to a beautiful Ashanti woman called Anansa ( Beverley Johnson ) who has trained in medicine in America and is also a doctor . While they 're doctoring , one day she is snatched by slavers working for an Arabic slave trader called Suleiman ( played perfectly by Peter Ustinov , of all people ) . The rest of the film is David trying to get her back.<br /><br />Michael Caine is a brilliant actor , of course , and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back , but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff . He 's helped out first by a Englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on ( Rex Harrison ! ) , then briefly by a helicopter pilot ( William Holden ) , and then by an Arab called Malik ( Kabir Bedi ) . Malik has a score to settle with Suleiman ( he is very intense throughout , a very engaging character ) , and so rides off with David to find him and get Anansa back - this involves a wonderful scene in which David fails miserably to get on his camel.<br /><br />Then there 's lots of adventure . There 's also lots of morality - questioning . The progress of the story is a little predictable from this point , and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster , but it 's all pretty forgivable . The question is , will David get to Anansa before Peter Ustinov sells her on to Omar Sharif ( yes , of course Omar Sharif is in it ! ) ?
1 There have been far too few mainstream films set in post - colonial Africa , and the ones that have are a mixed bunch . This one , with its altruistic pretensions to expose slavery in the 1970s , shows the best and worst values of Africa , which turn out not to be too different to the values of humanity as a whole . It also has shortcomings , given the undue influence of western pre - conceptions of Africans and , especially , Arabs.<br /><br />Dr Anansa Linderby , the beautiful African - American wife of the English doctor David Linderby , is captured by Arab slave - traders , along with a teenage Sanufu girl and a young boy . The lead slave - trader , Suleiman , is every bit the stage Arab , with his flowery and sometimes humorous rhetoric , and gestures to match - which would not be out of place on " Carry On Follow that Camel " but are not up the standard this film deserves . Peter Ustinov of course had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script , and he rescued what could otherwise have been a woeful one - dimensional character.<br /><br />Continuing the stereotypical theme , all three of Suleiman 's Arab employees are unintelligent and one has paedophilic tendencies towards the boy , which thankfully are not portrayed on the screen.<br /><br />One of David 's first ports of call is the local police officer , a stereotypical pompous and incompetent African bureaucrat . David then meets two stereotypical white ex - pats , an Englishman ( Walker , played by Rex Harrison ) and an American ( Sandell , played by William Holden ) . Sandell is a mercenary with " conventional " views on mixed - race relationships , who initially refuses to help unless David provides payment up front . Won over by David 's love for Anansa , and conscious of his own inability to find love , he agrees to take David up in his helicopter to help search for Anansa . They find Suleiman and his captives crossing the border and are unable to pursue them into the neighbouring territory - as a result of Sandell 's hesitation and David 's lack of experience with firearms , his helicopter is shot down but David survives.<br /><br />We then see David introduced to Malik ( Kabir Bedi ) , an African who has lost his family to Suleiman and is now only driven by vengeance . They find the Sanufu girl with a group of Tuareg and know they are on the right track to find Suleiman.<br /><br />In one of the most heart - rending scenes they kill a party of slave traders only to find that it was not Suleiman 's group , and have no choice but to send their captives to the Tuaregs they met earlier.<br /><br />Later on we discover that the young boy who had been raped is a witch doctor and , in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones , he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleiman 's henchmen . Anansa on her part - and despite the scepticism of the boy - manages to engineer the demise of Suleiman 's two other employees.<br /><br />By this time Suleiman and his slaves are within days of reaching the slave market.<br /><br />Suleiman , now in no doubt that Anansa is " trouble " , attempts to sell her to an obscenely wealthy Arab prince ( Omar Sharif ) who is corrupt but intelligent . On discovering that Anansa is an American working for the U.N. , the prince rather unwisely decides to carry on with the bargaining without considering the consequences . The scene where the two men haggle is one of the best in the film.<br /><br />At the slave market , the young boy is sold to a middle - aged German paedophile , and we are left to guess whether the boy will still be considered " wunderbar " when his owner is on the receiving end of his witch - doctoring skills.<br /><br />David and Malik finally confront Suleiman and there is a bitter - sweet ending from Malik 's point of view.<br /><br />Ultimately , David and Anansa are re - united , and Malik , whose life is in ruins , can console himself with having seen the task he set himself completed.<br /><br />The overall plot of the film is excellent but it loses marks for its stereotypical portrayal of nearly all the leading characters . Credit must go to all the leading actors for addressing many of the shortcomings of the scripting .
1 Once again , I was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $ 4.88 . Fifty - percent of the time the movies I find in the bin are pure crap ( I mean horrible beyond belief ) but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good . This movie is much better than I expected . I found it very engaging , though it was obviously made by an amateur.<br /><br / > The direction is nothing special , but the story is intriguing with some good thrills . I expected it to be more of a comedy , but I was n't too disappointed.<br /><br / > For a thriller , this movie is surprisingly good - natured . There 's no bloody violence , no profanity , no nudity , no sex . Usually , these movies require all four of those elements . The PG rating is well - deserved -- not like " Sixteen Candles " where the " f " word is used twice and there 's a brief gratuitous nude scene.<br /><br / > I just wish the romance between Corey Haim and his love interest could 've been developed more . The film does tend to be plot - heavy , and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side . Instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them , we end up watching a careless three - minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors . They end up kissing at the end , but there 's so little chemistry that it seems forced.<br /><br />"The Dream Machine " is no gem , but it 's good , clean entertainment . It 's quite forgettable -- especially with a cast of unknowns , except for Haim -- but it 's also much better than you 'd expect.<br /><br / > My score : 7 ( out of 10 )
1 A delightfully unpretentious send up of Romeo and Juliet . Approach with no expectations other than having a good time and you will enjoy this one . A talented group of comic actors let go and have a riot in this light - hearted performers ' vehicle . Bad reviews were due to a snobbishness about treatments of Shakespeare . Some people feel that all film must be " important " ---If you share those views , do n't bother . The credits read " introducing " Angelina Jolie , which is not even close to being true , but she is astoundingly beautiful as the Juliet character , and , as always , her acting is wonderful--- and , considering her age at the time , even her dialect is pretty good . Recreating this classic tale with feuding Italian families in the catering business in New York results in great fun . See it in the right frame of mind and you will laugh out loud .
1 The movie itself made me want to go and call someone so they could enjoy it too . It was extremely funny . Angelena Jolie was wonderful as Juliet . The parents are hilarious . They are caterers as well as enemies . The kids play the parts of Romeo and Juliet in the church play . They fall in love and their parents try to keep them apart.(Spoiler Ahead . I think ) They sneak off after a party and do it . Surprisingly they still want to get married in the end of the movie . If you do n't like stereotypes and the defilement of classic literature do n't watch . If you do n't mind those you will have a blast watching this one .
1 First off , let me say I have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because I knew Angelina Jolie was in it and I love her . But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie . Anyhow , no video stores carried it but low and behold the local library did . I watched it and absolutely loved it . Yes there were Italian stereotypes but it was done well and funny . It was not degrading in any way.<br /><br />Every actor and actress did a superb job . I laughed very hard at the sexual humor . Overall , I think this movie is well worth seeing if you can find it . It is adorable and just plain fun to watch . I rarely rank movies as a 10 but I give this one a 10!!!<br /><br />Go find it and watch it !
1 This truly funny movie has a zany cast of characters , just about every voluptuous middle - aged female in Hollywood , and a touching , funny love story . The Capomezza 's and the Malacici 's are rival caterers in an Italian neighborhood in New York . They are also at opposite -- extreme -- ends of the taste scale . Their children are cast in the lead roles of a church production of Romeo and Juliet . Naturally , they fall in love . On stage ! The mayhem and confusion that this causes , as the parents feud with each other and their kids , is played out for us against the backdrop of the Capomezza 's magnificently tasteless home , and their magnificently tasteless catered weddings.<br /><br />Besides the four over - the - top parents and the charming young lovers , the characters include a vaguely wise priest , a plain - speaking grandma , a lady who waves a wand and passes on spiritual advice she receives from a medium called The Blessed Roscoe , a motel with beds shaped like the back seat of a car , and two doves . There is not a sight gag or a punch line that does n't click in this fast paced movie.<br /><br />Even the family names of the two families are part of the fun . " Capomezza " could be interpreted as " low - brows , " and " Malacici " could mean " stuck - up snobs . " < br /><br />If you are sensitive about Italian stereotypes , you may not like this movie . If Bette Midler embarrasses you , you may not like it , because all of the women in this movie make Bette Midler look like Martha Stewart . The rest of us should love it !
1 Stupid , Stupid , Stupid . I think that Angelina Jolie is probably one of the most talented actress ' today , but a movie like this is n't just worth her time . She deserves better , and so does everyone else in this movie . Talent is just wasted . Sorry , but i do n't feel like writing a review for this.<br /><br />I give it NO stars out of * * * * * .
1 Steve Carell plays Dan Burns , newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father to three girls . At a large family homecoming Dan meets his perfect woman , only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother.<br /><br />What 's a man to do?<br /><br />I rather liked " Dan In Real Life " , but I would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept Steve Carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained , rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful . If you can not accept it , fear not , " Get Smart " will be along later in the year , but for the record I thought he was very good.<br /><br />"Dan In Real Life " starts off like your typical , incidentally amusing , family drama , but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and Carell 's frustration with his situation grows . It 's not massively original ( but if you only saw movies with original ideas , cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed , would n't they ? ) , but " Dan In Real Life " is entertaining , and a good cast ( who would n't fall in love at first sight with the luminous Juliette Binoche ? ) make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love.<br /><br />I hope that Steve Carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again .
1 I 'm not a Steve Carell fan however I like this movie about Dan , an advice columnist , who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brother 's girlfriend . Its a story that s been told before , but not like this . There are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be . The cast is wonderful , and even if Carell is not my cup of tea , he is quite good as the widower who 's suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you . At times witty and wise in the way that an annoying Hallmark card can be , the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film . Worth a look see
1 There is a scene in Dan in Real Life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first . The answer to one of the clues is Murphy 's Law : anything that can go wrong , will go wrong . This is exactly the case for Dan Burns ( Steve Carell , the Office ) a columnist for the local newspaper . Dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life , yet he comes to realize that things are n't so picture perfect in his own . Dan in Real Life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy , tragedy , and beauty of them all . Besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious.<br /><br />The death of his wife forces Dan to raise his three daughters all on his own ... each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life : the first one anxious to try out her drivers license , the middle one well into her teenage angst phase , and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood . Things take a turn for Dan when he goes to Rhode Island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstore.<br /><br />Her name is Marie ( Juliette Binoche , Chocolat ) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations ... which is precisely what s in store when they get thrown into the Burns Family household.<br /><br />If you 've seen Steve Carell in The Office or Little Miss Sunshine , you 'd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well . Steve Carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life : the frustration and sincere compassion . The family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax . The movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes , yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability : which is an irony within itself.<br /><br />Dan in Real Life is definitely worth seeing , for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life , and I 'll most likely enjoy it a second time , or even a third . Just " put it on my tab . "
1 I saw a special advance screening of this today . I have to let you know , I 'm not a huge fan of either Dane Cook or Steve Carell , so I really had no expectations going into this . I ended up enjoying it quite a bit.<br /><br />Dan in Real Life is the story of a widower with 3 daughters who goes to spend a weekend with his family . While at a bookstore , he meets the woman of his dreams , only to find out that she happens to be his brother 's girlfriend.<br /><br />This movie is pretty well made- the soundtrack , cinematography , and acting are all top - notch , especially Steve Carell . My problem with it was mostly that there seemed to be a lack of character development , mostly with Dane Cook 's character . We never really get a close look at the relationship between Dane and Steve 's characters , and I felt that it could have helped a bit in showing what Dan 's inner conflict about being in love with Dane 's girlfriend was like . Other than this though , Dan in Real Life is definitely a solid , sweet film- definitely a nice break from all the horror and action movies we 've been getting this year .
1 I was drawn to DAN IN REAL LIFE from the excellent reviews and the thirst for a Dramedy that was well written - thank you Peter Hedges - and because when Steve Carell stars in the film , you know an audience is going to find like in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE , a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding . DAN IN REAL LIFE delivered that promise.<br /><br />The film is so real to many families world wide that have lost a member and yet have gone on with their lives in search of something that will give them the magic back before their loss . With Steve Carell and the wondrous Juliette Binoche , their relationship was so beautifully done and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and to their journeys . The cast , sets and story made DAN IN REAL LIFE one to remember as we head into the holidays ahead .
1 Dan , the widowed father of three girls , has his own advice column that will probably go into syndication . After his wife 's death , he has taken time to raise his daughters . Having known no romance in quite some time , nothing prepares him for the encounter with the radiant Marie , at a local book store in a Rhode Island small town on the ocean , where he has gone to celebrate Thanksgiving with the rest of his big family . After liking Marie at first sight , little prepares him when the gorgeous woman appears at the family compound . After all , she is the date of Dan 's brother , Mitch.<br /><br />It is clear from the outset that Dan and Marie are made for one another , and although we sense what the outcome will be , we go for the fun ride that Peter Hedges , the director wants to give us . Mr. Hedges , an author and screenplay writer on his own , has given us two excellent novels , " What 's Eating Gilber Grapes " , and " An Ocean in Iowa " , and the delightful indie , " Pieces of April , which he also directed . It 's just a coincidence that both movies deal with families during Thanksgiving reunions.<br /><br />The best thing in the film was the natural chemistry between the two stars , Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche . Mr. Carell , in fact , keeps getting better all the time . In many ways , he remind us of Jack Lemmon , in his take of comedy and serious material . What can one say about Ms. Binoche , an intelligent actress , and a bright presence in any film . She proves she is right up to doing comedy , convincing us about her Marie.<br /><br />The only sad note is the waste of talent in the picture . John Mahoney , Diane Wiest , Norbert Leo Butz , Jessica Hecht , Emily Blunt , Allison Pill , Amy Ryan , have nothing to do . They just serve as incidental music for decoration . Dane Cook , who is seen as brother Mitch , fares better because he gets to recite more lines than the others.<br /><br />"Dan in Real Life " is a delightful film that will please everyone .
1 Steve Carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices , family and pressure . By judging on the plot and cover art of the movie I was expecting a flat - out comedy , lots of laughs and unrealistic elements , but I guess I was wrong . Sure the movie had some comedy , but it felt much more of a light Drama to me and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance . The movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found . But , the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable . Through - out , the cinematography was great , the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important . Though , it came down to old , flat and predictable ending . I 'd reckon if different choices were made at the end of the movie ( perhaps for the bad , even ) this movie would get better publicity . Still a fun movie .
1 The widower family man Dan Burns ( Steve Carell ) writes the column " Dan in Real Life " giving advices for families in The New Jersey Standard and raises his three daughters alone . Jane ( Allison Pill ) , the older , has just got her driving license but Dan does not allow her to drive ; Cara ( Brittany Robertson ) has a crush on his high - school mate Marty ; and the young Lily ( Marlene Lawston ) misses her mother . When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion , he meets Marie ( Juliette Binoche ) in a bookstore and they spend hours talking to each other . They feel attracted for each other , but Marie receives a phone call and leaves Dan , giving her phone number first . Dan immediately falls in love for Marie , but when he return to his parent 's home , he finds that Marie is the girlfriend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns ( Dane Cook ) , who is also in love with her . Along the weekend , the attraction between the clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to take a decision.<br /><br />"Dan in Real Life " is a great surprise and a delightful movie , with comedy , romance and drama . The chemistry of the gorgeous Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is awesome and it is very easy to know why everybody loves Marie . The trio Allison Pill , Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston is fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments of this story . The screenplay is wonderful and the performances of the talented actors and actresses are stunning , with a realistic behavior of a family meeting . Follow the advice of Dan 's column and plan to be surprised with the reunion of the Burns ' family . My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Eu , Meu Irmão e Nossa Namorada " ( " Me , My Brother and Our Girlfriend " )
1 I loved " Dan in Real Life " . A wonderful journey - to - love story like You 've Got Mail or While You Were Sleeping , but not ridiculously full of sight gags and crude jokes , and not so romantic it makes you wanna throw up . < br /><br />Dan Burns ( Steven Carrell ) is a popular advice columnist who ca n't seem to get things in his own life straightened out . Until one day , on a family gathering / trip , he meets and instantly connects with Marie ( the always beautiful Juliette Binoche)a radiant specimen of a woman who seems to be framed in a hazy filter hearkening back to the starlets of classic cinema . Chemistry happens over a cup of tea and muffin , but Marie must be off for a previous engagement , and they must part ways . < br /><br />Later we are treated to Dan 's tight - knit , fun - loving relatives who not only have big breakfasts together but also enjoy using the intelligent and sweetly dorky Dan as the butt of many bachelor jokes . What I liked so much was that although the family 's characteristics could be seen as obnoxious to some , I thought it was a great portrayal of a big family that does n't venture into parody or crude exaggeration . The Burns family is simply a close , loving group of people who are truly interested in the best for Dan . There are wonderfully awkward family moments that are n't unrealistic . The family is nosey , but never mean - spirited or gossipy ; quirky , but never outlandish.<br /><br />And then Dan falls in love with his brother 's girlfriend he 's brought to the family gathering . And thus begins a roller - coaster of restrained longing and funny love - budding . < br /><br />I could go on but I just thought this movie was simply awesome . It 's not particularly " hip " or " clever " , never too wordy and obsessed with dry humor or biting wit as many comedies are in modern cinema . There is a nice balance of storytelling visuals and funny - but - real dialogue . in fact , early in the movie , the initial spark of love begins with whimsical discussion in a classic Hollywood - style conversation where the characters say what they 're thinking out loud.<br /><br />So I 've probably rambled and repeated myself , but I highly recommend " Dan in Real Life " . It 's a great date movie , trust me , you 'll laugh , and only if you 're a geek like me you 'll get a bit teary - eyed . Filled with fun and magical love , " Dan in Real Life " wo n't disappoint.<br /><br />=================== 3.5 out of 4 stars Grade : A
1 Clean family oriented movie . I laughed , I cried ... I loved it . I was worried I would n't be able to see Steve Carrell as anything but goofy Michael from The Office . Boy , was I wrong . He should win an Oscar for his performance . I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out . My husband enjoyed it and he is n't into movies of this " type " . I saw it with 2 other couples in the 30 year old range and we all agreed it was the best movie we had seen in a LONG time and certainly the cleanest . Only 1 cuss word ! Not even sure why it was PG13 . I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy , drama , romance and more !
1 Steve Carell stars as a person who you can relate to(sort of ) in Dan in real life , a film which I expected not to like but ended up liking it . Not that the movie is laugh out loud funny it 's just that it has a big heart . We all like Steve Carell , this is n't what fans of The Office would expect to see from him , but you know what , I liked this movie . < br /><br />Carell stars as Dan Burns , a widowed father who 's daughters do n't really like him . One weekend , him and his daughters travel down to see his family . While there , he goes to a bookstore and falls for a woman . When he gets back to his house , he finds out that his brother Mitch(Played by Dane Cook ) is dating this woman(Played by Juliette Binoche).<br /><br />Dan in real life , at times , I found a bit unbelievable . Are the Burns family really the kind of people who do exercises together and play board games together and do a bunch of other family things ? I would highly doubt that . I do n't know any family who is like that . Is that stopping me from giving it a thumbs up ? No.<br /><br />Dan in real life:***/ * * * *
1 I loved the story . Somewhere , a poster said there are no families like the one portrayed in this film . Well maybe there ought to be . I thought everybody seemed really human and believable . What a top notch cast . What great music on the soundtrack . What a nice this , and what a nice that , but most of all , I will say two words to recommend this film.<br /><br />Steve Carell.<br /><br />He really showed a nice , subtle depth that touched me . He was truly commanding as a widower who had dedicated himself maybe a little too much to being a good dad first , at the cost of denying his own needs.<br /><br />Did he act like a petulant ass ? Why , yes he did.<br /><br />And you see , that 's what was perfect about this film . The actor who played this character made me believe he was FEELING something , and not simply ACTING like he was feeling something , and he conveyed to me perfectly what it was that he was feeling , and what he was feeling was denied.<br /><br />Denied happiness.<br /><br />Denied fulfillment.<br /><br />Denied love.<br /><br />Losing your love is painful beyond belief , and many who do so will never feel something like that again.<br /><br />Beautiful film.<br /><br />I gave it an eight out of ten .
1 I watch romantic comedies with some hesitation , for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting . Typically in a Romantic Comedy , there is a girl and there is a guy , both fall in love , then have troubles , and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever . But , this movie is a different story , it is really very different from the Romantic Comedies I have seen of lately . < br /><br />There is a widowed guy(Dan ) , there is a girl(Marie ) . Dan meets Marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime , after sometime Marie has to leave . Dan develops something for her , and when this something starts to turn meaningful , we get a twist . Marie is the girlfriend of his brother . Unheeded of the circumstances , Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her , and even Marie loves him , but their love would not just be possible . How it is made possible forms the rest of the story . < br /><br />Steve Carell performs well , Juliette Binoche is good as Marie . And every other stuff is done well . It is a good movie , watch it .
1 This is a sublime piece of film - making . It flows at just the right pace throughout . The accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear . The humorous parts are hilarious and made even more so by the largely depressingly tragic nature of the film.<br /><br />However , despite much comment about the inherent tragedy of the storyline it was anything but depressing for me to watch . I thoroughly enjoyed it in a way that I have n't experienced for a long time . That is to say , it is superb and yet without all the common trappings of modern films such as ; sex , violence and unnecessary special effects . < br /><br />'Dan In Real Life ' lacks nothing for being without the regular vices . It has a fully matured plot that just does n't require , and indeed would be ruined by , any further embellishment . At the same time , the theme is entirely adult . It 's a piece of art in and of itself that encapsulates you entirely and you want for nothing more than it already offers.<br /><br />There are some scenes that feel a bit ' Waltons ' but these actually make perfect sense in the long run as they contrast the more dysfunctional moments . The rosier makes way for the tragic which then gives over to the idyllic which turns to the darker etc . This undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium - like stability . The peaks and troughs are gentle but more than adequate in the pleasure they instill.<br /><br />I highly recommend watching this film regardless of what genre you normally enjoy . Put aside any prejudices because this is a must see !
1 How can you sum up just exactly how feelgood and right and touching this film is ? ? For several weeks this DVD leaped off the shelf at me every time I went in the store - having seen Steve Carrell in a couple of films previously , I did n't want to smear my thought process of him - so I resisted and resisted , until finally I grabbed it up with a ' What the hell ! ' attitude ! And how surprised was I ! I just wish I had purchased it earlier . Having watched it three times in two days I am still smiling at how the portrayal of a widower struggling with three daughters , yearning for that which is missing since the passing of his beloved wife , who thus meets an intriguing woman , charming her in such a profound and interesting ( dare I say bookish ? ) way , throws a whole different light onto life that makes him realize she is what he has been searching for.<br /><br />The snag of that woman being his brothers girl complicates matters - which portray Dan comically shy and with a heartfelt chagrin , seeing his " someone special " bringing such fun and enjoyment into the family home as well as his brothers life . You just really begin to feel for him.<br /><br />Then when the blind date occurs with Ruthie Draper - that is the turning point in Marie 's estimation of Dan ! ! The look she gives him when he repeats her comment , about not liking Ruthie - sheer Green - Eyed Monster ! Triggering an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor ! This sequence is one of the most well - crafted as Dan starts to loosen up with regard to Marie.<br /><br />Other gut - wrenching scenes - Dan returns from the Book and Tackle Shop , confronted by his brothers , begins to describe what has just occurred .... when Dan 's face drops it brings a sharp intake of breath!!<br /><br />His youngest daughter Lilly making the present celebrating their love for Suzanne , his late wife , brings a little heartfelt warmth and a little gulp as Dan realizes just what he has lost in life.<br /><br />When Dan plays guitar and sings at the Talent Show .... his voice cracking slightly as he reprises the song .... absolute gem ! < br /><br />The acceptance of what occurs late in the film by his daughters ... they all three love their father and want to see him happy , will not let him deny his love for Marie ; the desperateness of Dan not to fail his daughters because he is their rock , their stronghold ... and tell him so much more than that with just a few words.<br /><br />I could go on and on but I will leave it for now - maybe return and add more comments here in the near future .... but I will end by saying .... <br /><br /> .... if you want to watch a film that is just so damn good , with twists of comedy to lighten up the drama , that never feels forced or crass , that comes over as a genuine portrayal of a man discovering new life - not just with a woman but also with his extended family , then look no further.<br /><br />DAN IN REAL LIFE - 9 out of 10 for such a well - rendered cinematic experience with a score by Sondre Lerche , that intimately takes you there throughout whilst never being intrusive , with fine performances by the ensemble cast . I can not wait to re - watch this again ! !
1 Unlike many other films , which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness ( Man Bites Dog ) or their sheer violence ( most Peckinpah films ) , Deliverance shocks by its plausibility . Certainly , the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness , but the film 's effect derives far more from its slow build - up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads , both before and after everything starts to go wrong . The moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge , who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with , let alone show any sign of human affection towards them , is among the most sinister in modern film . The tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip , and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters ' ordeals horrifically real . The movie 's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads , particularly Ned Beatty and Jon Voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively . Burt Reynolds , too , has never been better . The film 's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to ' banjo territory ' - perhaps only Get Carter has done such an effective hatchet - job on a region 's tourist industry . I can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of Se7en is the best comparison I can think of . Although so much of it is excellent of itself , Deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique .
1 ' Deliverance ' is a brilliant condensed epic of a group of thoroughly modern men who embark on a canoe trip to briefly commune with nature , and instead have to fight for their sanity , their lives , and perhaps even their souls . The film has aged well . Despite being made in the early Seventies , it certainly does n't look particularly dated . It still possesses a visceral punch and iconic status as a dramatic post-'Death of the Sixties ' philosophical - and - cultural shock vehicle . There are very few films with similar conceits that can compare favourably to it , although the legendary Sam Peckinpah 's stuff would have to be up there . Yes , there has been considerable debate and discussion about the film 's most confronting scene ( which I wo n't expand upon here ) - and undoubtedly one of the most confronting scenes in the entire history of the cinematic medium - but what surprises about this film is how achingly beautiful it is at times . This seems to be generally overlooked ( yet in retrospect quite understandably so ) . The cinematography that captures the essence of the vanishing , fragile river wilderness is often absolutely stunning , and it counterbalances the film as , in a moment of brief madness , we the viewers - along with the characters themselves - are plunged into unrelenting nightmare . ' Deliverance 's narrative is fittingly lean and sinewy , and it is surprising how quickly events unfold from point of establishment , through to crisis , and aftermath . It all takes place very quickly , which lends a sense of very real urgency to the film . The setting is established effectively through the opening credits . The characters are all well - drawn despite limited time spent on back story . We know just enough about them to know them for the kind of man they are , like them and ultimately fear for them when all goes to hell . The conflict and violence within the movie seems to erupt out of nowhere , with a frightening lack of logic . This is author James Dickey 's theme - that any prevailing romanticism about the nature of Man 's perceived inherent ' goodness ' can only wilt and die when his barely suppressed animal instincts come to the fore . There are no demons or bogeymen here . The predatory hillbillies - as the film 's central villains - are merely crude , terrifyingly amoral cousins of our protagonists . They shock because their evil is petty and tangible . The film has no peripheral characters . All reflect something about the weaknesses and uncertainties of urbanised Homo Sapiens in the latter 20th century , and all are very real and recognisable . Burt Reynolds is wonderful in this movie as the gung - ho and almost fatally over - confident Survivalist , Lewis , and it is a shame to think that he really could n't recapture his brief moment of dramatic glory throughout the rest of his still sputtering up - and - down career ( ' Boogie Nights ' excluded , perhaps ) . Trust me , if your are not a Reynolds fan , you WILL be impressed with his performance here . John Voight is his usual effortlessly accomplished self , and Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox both make significant contributions . This is simply a great quartet of actors . To conclude , I must speculate as to if and when ' Deliverance ' author James Dickey 's ' To the White Sea ' will be made . For those that enjoyed ( ? ) this film , TTWS is a similarly harrowing tale of an American Air Force pilot 's struggle for survival after being shot down over the Japanese mainland during WW2 . It 's more of the typically bleak existentialism and primordial savagery that is Dickey 's trademark , but it has all the makings of a truly spectacular , poetic cinematic experience . There was the suggestion a few years ago that the Coen brothers might be producing it , but that eventually came to nothing . Being an avid Coen - o - phile it disappoints me to think what might have been had they gotten the green light on TTWS , rather than their last couple of relatively undistinguished efforts . Returning to ' Deliverance ' , it 's impossible to imagine a movie of such honest , unnerving brutality being made in these times , and that is pretty shameful . We , the cinema - going public , are all the poorer for this .
1 In what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time , four city guys confront nature 's wrath , in a story of survival . The setting is backwoods Georgia , with its forests , mountains , and wild rivers.<br /><br />The director , John Boorman , chose to use local people , not actors , to portray secondary characters . These locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history . No central casting " actors " could ever come close to these people 's remarkable faces , voices , or actions . I do n't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful . As much as anything else , it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing.<br /><br />Another strength is the film 's theme . Nature , in the wild , can be violent . How appropriate that the setting should be the American South . Very few places in the U.S. are , or have been , as violent as redneck country . In a story about Darwinian survival of the fittest , the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature , not separate from it.<br /><br />"Deliverance " is very much a product of its time when , unlike today , Americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness . The film 's magnificent scenery , the sounds of birds , frogs , crickets , and the roar of the river rapids , combined with the absence of civilization , all convey an environmental message . And that is another strength of the film.<br /><br />At an entertainment level , the tension gradually escalates , as the plot proceeds . Not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme , and then never lets up , not until the final credits roll . Very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot.<br /><br />Finally , the film 's technical quality is topnotch . Direction and editing are flawless . Cinematography is excellent . Dialogue is interesting . And the acting is terrific . Burt Reynolds has never been better . Ned Beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job . And Jon Voight should have been nominated for an Oscar . If there is a weak link in the film , it is the music , which strikes me as timid.<br /><br />Overall , " Deliverance " almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure . Even for those who do n't , the gritty characterizations , the acting , and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film , one of the finest in cinema history .
1 Deliverance is the fascinating , haunting and sometimes even disturbing tale by James Dickey , turned into a brilliant movie by John Boorman . It 's about four businessmen , driven by manhood and macho - behavior , who 're spending a canoeing weekend high up in the mountains . Up there , they 're faced with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery ... poverty , buggery and even physical harassment ! These four men intended to travel down the river for adventure and excitement but their trip soon changes into an odyssey through a violent and lurking mountain - land , completely estranged from all forms of civilisation . All these elements actually make Deliverance one of the most nightmarish films I 've ever seen . Just about everything that happens to these men , you pray that you 'll never find yourself to be in a similar situation . Pure talking cinema , Deliverance is a very important movie as well . John Boorman 's best ( closely followed by Zardoz and Excalibur ) was - and still is - a very influential film and it contains several memorable scenes that already featured in numberless other movies . Just think about the terrific " Duelling banjos " musical score and , of course , the unforgettable homosexual " squeal like a pig " rape scene . All the actors deliver ( haha ) perfect acting performances . Especially Jon Voight . A must see motion picture ! !
1 After having seen Deliverance , movies like Pulp Fiction do n't seem so extreme . Maybe by today 's blood and bullets standards it does n't seem so edgy , but if you think that this was 1972 and that the movie has a truly sinister core then it makes you think differently.<br /><br />When I started watching this movie nothing really seemed unusual until I got to the " Dueling Banjos " scene . In that scene the brutality and edge of this film is truly visible . As I watched Drew(Ronny Cox , Robocop)go head to head with a seemingly retarted young boy it really shows how edgy this movies can get . When you think that the kid has a small banjo , which he could of probably made by hand , compared to Drew 's nice expensive guitar , you really figure out just how out of their territory the four men are.<br /><br />As the plot goes it 's very believable and never stretches past its limits . But what really distinguishes this film , about four business men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip , is that director John Boorman(Excalibur ) breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes . So as the movie goes into full horror and suspense I really cared about all four men and what would happen to them.<br /><br />The acting is universally excellent . With Jon Voight(Midnight Cowboy , Enemy of the State ) and Burt Reynolds(Boogie Nights , Striptease ) leading the great cast . Jon Voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable . Unlike Reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start , Voight 's character transforms over the course of the movie . Ned Beatty(Life ) is also good in an extremely hard role , come on getting raped by a hillbilly , while Ronny Cox turns in a believable performance.<br /><br />One thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any I had ever seen . Bill Mckinney and Herbert " Cowboy " Coward were excellent and extremely frightening as the hillbilly's.<br /><br />Overall Deliverance was excellent and I suggest it to anyone , except for people with weak stomachs and kids . 10/10 . See this movie .
1 John Boorman 's " Deliverance " concerns four suburban Atlanta dwellers who take a ride down the swift waters of the Cahulawassee   The river is about to disappear for a dam construction and the flooding of the last untamed stretches of land   < br /><br />The four friends emphasize different characters : a virile sports enthusiast who has never been insured in his life since there is no specific risk in it ( Burt Reynolds ) ; a passionate family man and a guitar player ( Ronny Cox ) ; an overweight bachelor insurance salesman ( Ned Beatty ) ; and a quiet , thoughtful married man with a son who loves to smoke his pipe ( Jon Voight).<br /><br />What follows is the men 's nightmarish explorations against the hostile violence of nature  It is also an ideal code of moral principle about civilized men falling prey to the dark laws of the wilderness   < br /><br />Superbly shot , this thrilling adult adventure certainly contains some genuinely gripping scenes 
1 As Peckinpah did with STRAW DOGS , and Kubrick with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE , director John Boorman delivers an effective film about Man 's violent side in DELIVERANCE , arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970s . Burt Reynolds , Jon Voight , Ned Beatty , and Ronny Cox portray four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia before it is dammed up into what Reynolds calls " one big , dead lake." < br /><br />But the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these " city boys " carousing through their woods . And the following day , continuing on down the river , Beatty and Voight are accosted and sexually assaulted ( the film 's infamous " SQUEAL ! " sequence ) by two vicious mountain men ( Bill McKinney , Herbert " Cowboy " Coward ) . Thus , what started out as nothing more than a lark through the Appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism.<br /><br />James Dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best - selling book , and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker . Often known for its " SQUEAL ! " and " Dueling Banjos " sequences , DELIVERANCE is also quite a pulse - pounding ordeal , with the four leading men superb in their roles , and McKinney and Coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times . A must - see film for those willing to take a chance .
1 I watched this movie in the wee hours of the morning when I should have been asleep . This , in itself , was testimony that Deliverance was a spell - binding movie . I think Boorman did a wonderful job on directing this film . How expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the dueling banjos was done . It showed so well and early on how inherently reserved and simple the people of the area were . Case in point - near the end of the " duel " , the banjo - playing boy was smiling ( loved his banjo ) , but when Drew tried to shake the boy 's hand after the " duel " , the kid was too reserved to respond . The river trip never left you bored , for sure . The rape scene was brutal , but necessary to show just what the group was up against in this backwoods area of Georgia . I think Beatty 's traumatic shock afterward was well done . Some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal . I disagree - if you really payed attention , he was unresponsive during the entire action immediately following , in which Reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they chased off the toothless guy . It was confusing when Ed killed the other guy later , at the top of the cliff . It almost appeared that the arrow was shot while Ed was curled up and expecting to die , but then you realize the arrow he had shot earlier had finally taken effect.<br /><br />Anyway , a great movie , and I was wavering between an 8 and 9 on my vote , but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave it a " 1 " , I gave it a " 10 " . This individual 's reasoning seemed based on personal bias , rather than an objective viewpoint , and his vote was obviously a non - correlating attempt to lower the rating .
1 This was , undoubtedly , the most disturbing movie that I have ever seen . The first part of the movie , though strange , has a light and amusing quality to it . The journey begins on such a peaceful note , detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the hills of Appalachia . But that is misleading beyond belief . The obvious social problems ( inbreeding ) and the deformities of the countryside 's inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the movie . I can still hear Bobby moaning in pain , and I shudder at the thought . Lewis 's leg made me wince . Yet , while the movie was , on the whole , very disturbing and distressing , it posed some interesting questions . When is it moral , or right to take another individual 's life ? What can morality drive us to do , or not do , in some cases ? And are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself ? Whatever conclusions one may draw from the film , it is an achievement in its own right ( despite certain aspects that were chillingly real and gruesome ) .
1 Engrossing drama of four men on a canoing weekend down a remote river . They are pacifist Ed ( Jon Voight ) , adventurous , violent Lewis ( Burt Reynolds ) , obnoxious Bobby ( Ned Beatty ) and nice guy Drew ( Ronny Cox ) . The first 40 minute are great -- there 's the incredible dueling banjos sequence , interesting interplay among the characters and just stunning widescreen cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond . Then two hillbillies attack Ed and Bobby . One of them rapes Bobby ... and the trip becomes a nightmare.<br /><br />Just unbelievable . The scenery is incredibly beautiful yet this horrific violence is taking place . To be truthful , Beatty 's rape has never bothered me -- I'm very aware it 's being faked despite the good acting . This movie also shows how the characters change -- Ed has his pacifism tested , Lewis becomes weak , Bobby is violated by one of the people he mocked earlier on and Drew tries to keep himself sane . Direction by John Boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood immensely.<br /><br />The acting is mostly good . Voight is just OK in the lead -- he 's been better . Beatty is also just OK -- but it is his debut film and he has guts for taking such a risky role . Cox is very good especially when things start falling apart . And Reynolds is just superb -- one of his best acting jobs EVER ! How this was n't even nominated for an Academy Award escapes me . Also Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are way too believable as the hillbillies.<br /><br />A powerful film -- NOT for children . Try to see an uncut version -- the TV version is butchered . Also letter - boxed viewing is essential to capture the breathtaking images .
1 James Dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author . When one reads " Deliverance " , one is instantly transported into the lush backwoods of the Deep South . When one watches John Boorman 's film version of the book , one realizes just how accurately he captures the essence of the book . The camera is as descriptive as the narration . The characters are fully realized , and the portrayals are fantastic . I first saw this movie in 1992 , after my freshman year of college . I was in a phase where I was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in 1973 . Among them were " Patton " , " Papillon " , and " All the President 's Men " ; fine films , all of them . This one was easily the class of the group . That says a lot .
1 This is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever seen . The first time I saw it I was about 9 or 10 years old . I began looking sometime before the rape scene . And when I saw it I was really shocked thinking " What kinda sick movie is this ? " . Today I 've seen it from the beginning and really understood how great this movie really is . It 's exciting , frightening , shocking and in it 's own unique way disturbing . But the best thing about it is the ending where the audience is shown that this experience will haunt the characters for the rest of their lifes . It 'll torture their conscience and they will worry for the rest of their lifes about the bodies being found in that river . And there is nothing they can do about it , it 's something they have to live with . This ending is one of the most unhappy endings in movie history and very smart , brilliant and horrifying < br /><br />And the acting is also great , especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds . Magnificent acting in this movie . All in all , John Boorman has created one of the best movies throughout movie history based on Dick Chaney 's novel . A must see for all the movie lovers
1 * * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * Packed with memorable moments ( such as the quote above , immortalized by Primus ) , Deliverance tells the story of four guys who take a trip to the wild woods to go white water rafting and get away from the big city for a while only to find that their fun soon takes a bad turn . This is not a Hollywood film . There are virtually no special effects whatsoever , the setting is extremely realistic , and nothing at all is sugarcoated or made pretty . The city boys look like city boys , and even the tough guy Louis , portrayed with precision by Burt Reynolds , is clearly at the mercy of the wild on this trip . This is a perfect example of a what - if film . What if a few friends went river rafting in an area of the woods that none of them were familiar with , and ended up desperately trying to avoid being tried and convicted for murders that they were forced to commit to save their own lives?<br /><br />There is clearly a very strong element of the film that deals with societal and class structure and the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rural and urban peoples . When the four guys arrive in the woods early in the film , they clearly do not quite know how to interact with the people who live out there , and they speak to them as though they are unsure whether they will understand or be able to communicate . This communication block is most memorably illustrated in the dueling banjoes scene , in which they are trying to gas up the car and truck and get someone to drive the vehicles downriver for them . While Drew and the obviously inbred and probably mentally deficient boy on the porch are dueling with their guitar and banjo ( one of the best scenes in the film ) , Louis is having some difficulty buying the gas , and Bobby makes a comment about genetic deficiencies and how pathetic it all is . When the boy turns away from Drew , who had offered to shake his hand after their stupendous jam session , Bobby tells him to give the kid a couple bucks , knowing that none of them are quite sure how to react.<br /><br />This is the kind of thing that we see in Deliverance that sets up so much of the tension that is to follow . This great scene where a lot of fun was had ( including the funniest ' redneck dancing ' scene until O Brother , Where Art Thou ? ) ended with everyone awkwardly unsure what to do around each other . These people are apples and oranges , and they live by completely different rules of life . The people that Louis , Bobby , Drew and Ed encounter in the hills grew up separated from modern society and modern laws , and live by the rules of nature , which do not include thou shalt not kill . Confused by their awkward behavior , the four friends set out on the river , hoping for the weirdness to end and for the adventure to begin.<br /><br />(spoilers ) When they are briefly separated from each other and Ed and Bobby run into the hillbillies beside the river who quickly turn unpleasant , the uncertainty about the way that these people live - which was established by the scene above - comes into play to create the most tension during the scene . I think that a good sign of a quality thriller like this is that the tragic element of the film , namely the assaults and actual murders , takes up a very small amount of screen time but remain some of the most memorable parts of the film . There is no gratuitous violence here , it 's all there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a startlingly powerful effect.<br /><br />The move is about the violent clash of two very different kinds of people , and what can happen when they inadvertently find themselves at war with each other . The trip down the rest of the river after the assault , which takes up the majority of the film , delivers some spectacularly effective tension , and keeps you on the edge of your seat while not bombarding you with so much happening that you become numb . It is surprisingly effective when we find out that Ed may very well have killed the wrong man up there on the cliff , and the tension in the film does n't even let up when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river , because they deliver a questionable explanation to the police about what happened up there on the river and why the deputy 's brother - in - law is missing.<br /><br />This is a very disturbing film , which is a testament to its success , because it 's pretty obvious that a film like this is meant to shake people up a little bit . The hillbillies are the human ( i.e. more realistic ) version of the sub - human rednecks seen in childish but fairly similar films like Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2 , neither of which could possibly ever be compared to a timeless film like Deliverance . When we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the woods , the natural element is so real and we get to know the men so well and in such a subtle fashion that it 's almost like we , as individuals of the audience , are really a fifth member of the team . It 's not often that a film is able to come across that way .
1 It 's a shame that Deliverance is mainly known as the redneck rape movie and for Dueling Banjos . Even people that have seen the film ca n't get their mind off of that rape scene . It 's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction . It 's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie . People tend to miss the power of the film that contains the infamous buggery scene.<br /><br />The acting , plot , cinematography , and soundtrack of Deliverance all lend a hand to it 's brooding charisma . The backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter . The actors both major and minor make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them . < br /><br />The thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of dread that it inspires . Not many films can make you feel this creeped out . Bottom Line : This movie is a classic . I ca n't really say much more than that .
1 Deliverance is a stunning thriller , every bit as exciting as any good thriller should aspire to be but also stomach - churningly frightening . Though it is not a horror movie , it is just as terrifying as any classic horror film . The very thought of being a normal red - blooded male enjoying an adventure weekend miles from any form of civilisation , only to be captured and sodomised by a couple of violent hillbillies , is surely the worst nightmare of 99.9 % of the world 's population . It would have been easy for Deliverance to slip into exploitation territory , but John Boorman has cleverly avoided the temptation to go down such a route and has made a film that explores , questions and challenges the very meaning of masculinity . With so many films , you come away wishing to heaven that you could step into the hero 's shoes , performing heroic deeds and saving the day and getting the girl .... but with Deliverance , you come away praying to God that you 'll never have to experience what these four protagonists go through.<br /><br />Four city guys - Ed ( Jon Voight ) , Lewis ( Burt Reynolds ) , Drew ( Ronny Cox ) and Bobby ( Ned Beatty ) - head out into the wilderness to spend a few days canoing down a soon - to - be - dammed river . The guys are riding the rapids in pairs , and Ed and Bobby inadvertently get a little too far ahead of the others so they pull in to the riverside and await their pals in the adjacent woodland . Here , they fall foul of two local woodlanders ( Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward ) , who tie Ed to a tree , while one of them strips and rapes Bobby instructing him , perversely , to " squeal like a pig " . Lewis and Drew arrive unseen and Lewis , being a fair archer , kills the rapist while the other hillbilly beats a hasty retreat into the forest . Under great emotional stress , the four canoeists decide to conceal the event and get out of the area . But they find the river increasingly dangerous to negotiate as they journey downstream , and the risk to their lives heightens when the surviving hillbilly returns to take shots at them with his rifle from some unseen vantage point in the rocky cliffs beside the river.<br /><br />Deliverance is very powerful as a survival tale , but even more powerful ( and disturbing ) as a study of macho attitudes being torn apart and left in humiliated tatters . Though all the performances are remarkable , one must take particular note of Beatty 's efforts in a role that many actors would 've turned down . The film is very similar thematically to the 1971 film Straw Dogs - both films deal with terrifying sexual violence in isolated locales , and in both the eventual violent revenge exacted by the victim does not result in any sense of satisfaction . The backdrop of the rugged countryside in Deliverance is beautiful to look at , but it also adds to the tension by placing the four canoeists in a setting where they are at the mercy of the hillbillies and the landscape , with nobody to rely on other than themselves . This truly is suspenseful film - making at its finest .
1 The makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters , as they suffered through this horrible ordeal . The horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors , playing parts . I have never gotten so immersed in a film as I have this one . Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were never better on screen , as well as fine performances by Ned Beatty , Ronny Cox , Bill McKinney , and though he appeared only briefly , James Dickey , the man who authored the book upon which the film is based , as the sheriff of Aintry . It is somewhat disturbing , and kids , of course , should be shielded from it , but this is great , dramatic cinema .
1 " Deliverance " is one of the best exploitation films to come out of that wonderful 1970 's decade from whence so many other exploitation films came.<br /><br />A group of friends sets out on a canoe trip down a river in the south and they become victimized by a bunch of toothless hillbillies who pretty much try to ruin their lives . It 's awesome.<br /><br />We are treated to anal rape , vicious beatings , bow and arrow killings , shootings , broken bones , etc ... A lot like 1974 's " Texas Chainsaw Massacre , " to say that " Deliverance " is believable would be immature . This would never and could never happen , even in the dark ages of 1972.<br /><br />"Deliverance " is a very entertaining ride and packed full of action . It is one in a huge pile of exploitation films to come from the early 70 's and it ( arguably ) sits on top of that pile with it 's great acting , superb cinematography and excellent writing.<br /><br />8 out of 10 , kids .
1 Before watching this film I had heard a lot about it and certain scenes in the film , but listening was n't doing it for me so I planned on watching it and wow ! Ned Beatty , Ronny Cox , Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds make for an interesting group of individuals who are hell bent on canoing down the Cahulawassee river and the unfortunate series of events that transpires upon them all . The character development takes some time in enveloping the viewer with a better understanding of each person , but eventually you know these guys like they were your friend . The acting , dialogue is very very real , as close to reality as you can get for Hollywood acting . Reynolds character " Lewis " was interesting as a guy who comes off very tough but underneath the manly veneer lies a very soft and broken man ( I was impressed with his performance ! ) Jon Voight seems to be the character that s on the spotlight the most , the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him at every corner really mold and caste him into a different man at the end ( his character transition was excellent ) . Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really seem like the silly lunkheads that just like to joke around and do n't seem to get too awful serious unless they have too , and they did ... I really was amazed at Director Boorman 's vision of Dickey 's novel , very impressed . You can not go your whole life without watching this film . I give it eight out of ten stars , extremely impressed .
1 This is one of the greatest films ever made . It 's an all - time classic . The character played by Ned Beatty undergoes one of the greatest on screen transformations ever portrayed . He is a shallow , almost useless , overweight insurance salesman . He is proud of his ignorance , and yet judges the " backwards hicks " to be the ignorant ones . When he compliments the old man on his hat , and the old man responds , " you do n't know nothing ' , " the tone is set . It 's true . He really does n't " know nothing ' . " But one backwoods anal rape later , the man is practically a warrior . His shallow fake bravery is toned down into serious resolve . The old self is forever dead , left in some far off woods , soon to be under hundreds of feet of water . And what of Lewis , our intrepid guide ? Lewis is a philosopher / hunter / warrior , and he 's just about nuts . Burt Reynolds proved himself as an actor way back in 1972 in this film , completely giving himself in to this wonderful role . Who would n't want to have a friend like Lewis if one was to venture into the dangers of a forgotten / soon to be left behind world like the one our hapless travelers find themselves in . This film speaks to us on so many levels . The story feels real . It works as a complete action / adventure , with wonderful cinematography , and deliberate , grinding pacing . It works as a bit of a horror film , with the danger and almost surrealism of the encounter with the vile rednecks who objectify their " sow " Ned Beatty . But it also works as an art film , using incredible amounts of symbolism to convey truths that go to our very core . I have seen this film at least fifty times , and every time it comes on , I find I have to watch it . You have to watch it quite a few times to even begin to comprehend it . This is one deep movie . This is one well - acted movie . And this is one hell of a story . I gave it a 10 out of 10 , and put it in my 10 all time greatest films ever made , along with Schindler 's List , Casablanca , Taxi Driver , and Sling Blade , among others . Movies that make you think . Movies that take you beyond having to think . Movies that use a STORY to make their point , without trying to preach to you . If you think you know Deliverance , you might , but again , you might not . It really is that good .
1 When a movie shocks you with it 's disturbing , brooding atmosphere , and grabs you by the throat with it 's stunning cinematography , you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat , masterpiece of a film . Although with most modern movies , extremely enjoyable as some are , those that really shock you into focus are the strongest , and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly , stick with you for a life time . I say , proudly , that I am a fan of movies that disturb , not just horror movies , but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding . Movies like Breakdown and The Missing , that send a chill down your spine , making you think " holy crap , that could happen to me " , and visually entice you , are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie . Because I am only 21 , I did not grow up with actors like Burt Renyolds , Jon Voight and Ned Beatty , albeit I am familiar with them , I did n't watch them grow and proceed as actors , as opposed to actors now like Shia LaBouf and Justin Long . I must say , after the long hype and witnessing Deliverance for the first time , I was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago , and still lives it 's terror up in competition to modern movies . Burt Renyolds plays Lewis , the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made , filling the whole wilderness in water . Renyolds ' character is an experienced adventurer , sort of no nonsense , and filled with machismo . Witnessing him portray the tough guy , made me think differently about him as an actor , as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician . The dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader . Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty play as the novice adventurers , Drew and Bob respectively , joining in for the fun of a canoe trip . The actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was Jon Voight , once again I have only seen him as an older actor , however , unlike Renyolds , I have quite liked Voight 's acting ( and i do n't regard Anaconda when I say that ) , for example the national treasure movies . Voight plays Ed , whom , like Lewis , is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character , a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks Lewis ' machismo . The film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside . You immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to , like the imbred kid who plays the infamous " Duelling Banjo 's " at the start of the film with Ronny Cox 's character Drew ; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene . As with all atmospheric movies , from this moment on , dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form . The canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature 's odds for survival . The film 's cinematics do not let up , and I back that comment up with the scene in which Ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow . As Ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him , cocks his rifle , only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck ; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting I have seen in a film . In wrapping up , Deliverance is one film , who 's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date , remains one of the best films in cinematic history .
1 " It 's all up to you , Ed ? " " Now you get to play the game . " The day my father left my mother , he took me to see this film with his new girlfriend , on opening day at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood . I was but fourteen years old . I was n't even entirely sure what I was seeing , but I will never forgot it , especially the scene with Ned Beatty.<br /><br />Watching it today , thirty - six years later , it still gives me quivers.<br /><br />My father was a huge Burt Reynolds fan , hence the reason for standing in line for almost an hour in to watch what was supposed to be an ' action movie . ' I had seen two films at the Dome prior to this : " Grand Prix " and " The Song of Norway . " Well this was n't exactly Mario Andretti or The Brady Bunch . After leaving the theater , I was shell - shocked.<br /><br />But even at that tender age , I appreciated the artistry ... and after seeing again today , am I surprised I was still standing after witnessing this highly disturbing , yet extremely well - crafted film.<br /><br />Suffice it to say it was a traumatic experience for a fourteen year - old that had yet to kiss his first girlfriend . I do n't blame my father for taking me , but it was a bit much for a child to witness.<br /><br />As an adult , I still find it quite disturbing , yet I am still very impressed with the quality of the film - making.<br /><br />Burt Reynolds as an absolute wonder , as are all the principles ... from Billy Redden as the inbred guitar wonder , to Ronny Cox as the terrified insurance salesman ... everyone does an admirable job . The sound quality is second to none , from the chirping birds to the ticking clocks . The photography , cinematography ... all the technical aspects of this remarkable film are first rate.<br /><br />The moral questions raised , from murdering the sexual assaulters to the aftermath of dealing with killing a human being , remain as profound today as they did when this groundbreaking film was released . And the classic sequences of attempting to survive in the wilderness after dealing with such unforeseen brutality are life - altering . These four men , city men , suddenly confronted with a situation with never imagined , raise the bar from action to horror.<br /><br />It 's a classic to be sure . And the phrase " you have a pretty mouth " has been quoted endlessly , from Saturday Night Live to off - the - cuff comments around water - cooler at work , this movie is without a doubt a huge part of our societal pop culture ... as much as " Make my day " or " I 'll be back " ever were.<br /><br />So what would YOU do if you found your friends being sexually assaulted at gunpoint by mountain men far away from your life in the city , cozy bed , wife and kids ? And if you took the measures Burt Reynolds did ( and I would have done the same ) would you bury the body beneath the soon - to - be - lake , or stand trial and take your chances ? The bottom line is : Deliverance delivers . You can take that to the bank . If this movie does n't get under your skin , then you are not human.<br /><br />Even if you have seen this before , rent it again and ask yourself the above question.<br /><br />My favorite part of the film remains the same : Ed failing to kill the deer ... then changing . Life and it 's unpredictable circumstance can change a man . And I suppose that 's what this film is all about Jon Voight , in particular , as Ed , gives the best performance here . And he remains one of the more gifted actors in Hollywood history , from Midnight Cowboy to his highly underrated performance as Franklin D. Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor , his acting lifts the movie to another level . Climbing the rocks at dusk , terrified and determined to make it right It needs to be seen to be believed . I guarantee your heart rate will elevated to a new level.<br /><br />Briskly paced , tense , taut and tightly drawn as a as a banjo string , this is a morality play that asks questions that remain today . Times have changes , but our choices as human beings have not.<br /><br />Ten out of ten stars .
1 Deliverance is John Boorman 's 1972 horror / thriller movie about a group of four Atlanta businessmen ( Burt Reynolds , Jon Voight , Ned Beatty and Ronnie Cox ) , that undertake a canoe trip down the Cahulawassee River before the river is dammed . Along the way , a raft ( no pun intended ) of unpleasant things happen to the men . Despite the nasty happenings in this picture , Boorman captures the natural beauty of the river nicely . The location was really chosen well . Indeed , this would still be a very nice film to watch , had the canoe trip gone smoothly . The lush forests and gentle landscape only make the horror more horrible . Not only is the location scenic , but also beautifully shot thanks to cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond . It has been said that Burt Reynolds ' performance as the outdoorsman , Lewis , is the star acting role in this film . I reckon however , that Jon Voight steals the show with his role as the suburban family man , Ed , who is rapidly forced to change his demeanour in order to survive . In fact , the scene in which climbs the cliff was not a stuntman . It was Voight himself . To cut costs the filming was n't insured and the actors did their own stunts . The soundtrack is particularly noteworthy . Eric Weissberg 's and Steve Mendel 's performance on guitar and banjo as part of the Duelling Banjos sequence remains one of the most awesome pieces of soundtrack in the history of cinema for the sheer intensity of its performance . At a couple of other points in the movie , we are treated to more , softer , banjo music which provides a very pleasant accompaniment to the trip down the river For all the good points of this film , I did find it a little lacking in purpose . It does n't build suspense very well and it is n't really as gruesome as we have been led to believe . The plot itself is somewhat poor and it does n't really go anywhere . Nevertheless , this movie has enough good points to get my recommendation . I did like it but for fans of gore , there is n't really much of it . None really , in fact . It is n't so much a horror film as an adventure film that turns a little bit sour . Think of it like Rambo : First Blood meets Three Men In A Boat . Look out for a very young Charley Boorman as Ed 's son . I did like this movie , the soundtrack , cinematography and acting earns it a well deserved 7 out of 10 .
1 I recall seeing this film on TV some years ago and not paying full attention , maybe even missing the first half , so I came to the conclusion that it was dull and over rated . I decided to revisit it last night to see if I had missed anything the first time . I certainly did . This is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and it has clearly had much influence on films today and probably will forever . I ca n't believe I thought this film was boring ! < br /><br />A young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds give the performances of their careers and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox . This story will leave you with a sense of disgust and dread long after you watch it , it is truly horrifying . Oh , and did I mention that the theme song is great , as well ? Well it is , and this movie should be seen by movie fans everywhere.<br /><br />Everyone should see this movie for the experience . Just do n't expect a picnic .
1 Impactful film of four city slickers in crisis in Appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity . Each of four businessmen face their darkest fears when they tackle a challenging whitewater trip , on a river about to be replaced by a dam . When locals along the way decide to " have their way " with the interlopers it leads to several deaths and loads of trauma for the survivors . Each of the travelers is outstanding , although Voight gives the lead and strongest performance . The rural scenery and culture is well - captured , including the breathtaking dueling banjos sequence . I saw this on a date when it came out , not exactly the perfect date movie ( although we both enjoyed it ) . I sort of remember this as a break - out dramatic performance for Burt , Voight was already established . Not the sort of movie you could watch every week but it has a strong punch and is beautifully filmed .
1 * SPOILERS * Four men , Ed ( Jon Voight ) , Lewis ( Burt Reynolds ) , Drew ( Ronny Cox ) and Bobby ( Ned Beatty ) , decide to go on a rafting trip on the Cahulawassee river , before it is flooded.<br /><br />They wanted to have fun , to have a nice weekend in the nature.<br /><br />But when two mountain men cross their path and rape one of them ( Bobby ) , everything begins to go to Hell in a Handbasket , and this ' nice weekend ' will even cost one of the four 's life ... <br /><br />'Deliverance ' , which in Italian is stupidly titled ' Un Tranquillo Weekend Di Paura ' ( ' A Calm Weekend Of Fear ' ) , is the Grandad of movies like ' Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' , ' The Hills Have Eyes ' , ' Wrong Turn ' , ' Last House On The Left ' and all the other ' Evil Nature / Revenge ' subgenre films , and one of the scariest , right next to ' The Hills Have Eyes'.<br /><br />Based on a book by James Dickey ( who appears in the movie as Sheriff Bullard ) , it 's a chilling story on how someone can go into a situation thinking he knows everything , when he doesn't.<br /><br />And the image of the dead man 's hand raising from under the water , or the hands holding the rifle from the one - sheet are haunting images that will never leave your mind.<br /><br />Deliverance : 9/10 .
1 and this IS a very disturbing film . I may be wrong , but this is the last film where I considered Burt Reynolds an actual actor , who transformed the role , and delivered a message.<br /><br />Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also excellent . They are unassuming and unaware ; businessmen wanting to enjoy the country . Little did they know what would happen next.<br /><br />The photography and sets are realistic and natural . This was before the days of Wes Craven.<br /><br />What is most disturbing about this film is the fact that places like this still exist . In America , country folk still detest city people ; it is almost a century and a half since the Civil War.<br /><br />You will enjoy this film . It was filmed in the rural sections of South Georgia , which still exist . Just do n't drive past that to Mobile , Alabama ; That area still has not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina . 10/10 .
1 I am a member of a canoeing club and I can tell you the truth that Deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience . As we put our boats into the water , banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind . This movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of human 's place in nature and technology 's effect upon man 's relationship with nature . We see it in the bow fishing . We see it in the home made tent . There is also city man 's disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman " cracker " . The fact that the Banker from Atlanta ( Ned Beatty ) has " bad teeth " is meant to put him on the same level with the woodsmen who also have bad teeth . Ultimately , the struggle of life and death supersedes " civilized man 's " suppositives about " The Law " . This canoe trip ends too soon for the viewer , but alas Not Soon Enough for the characters .
1 This movie is a classic in every sense of the word . It is very entertaining and also very disturbing . The acting in this movie is well done . The story itself is believable , suspenseful , and well thought out . Character development is also done well , the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film . The villains in this movie are very threatening , from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something . This movie shows how a human being , when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods , facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and feral as the animals that inhabit it . Not everyone is going to like this film , there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable . It is definitely worth watching . This movie is a masterpiece .
1 One of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from Atlanta . The idea of living the Chulawasse river before it 's turned into a lake comes from Burt Reynold 's Lewis , who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare . But if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie , the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story , with our men forced to make a decision that ( they know ) will change their lives forever . In very bad ways . At the end of the movie , each person is gon na be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite week - end on the river but muted into a fight for survival . The movie ( except some pretty evident goofs ) is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath . The photography is excellent as well . Voight , Reynolds , Cox and Beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake .
1 " Deliverance " is a dead - on example of what wonderful movies came out of the ' 70s . While your jaw is dropped during a " Terminator " movie , are you really sacred ? I do n't think so , because you are there to see what new CGIs have been strung together - plot matters not.<br /><br />So many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all , because there are so many people involved in daily living - like a trip to the market ..... or a walk down a dimly - lighted street . " Deliverance " is SO frightening , because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heart - beat . Venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun ? Anyone who has that notion does not read the papers , watch the daily news , nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of " trespassing " into territories where outsiders are not welcome . It is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on " Deliverance " did n't inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic , and " squeal like a pig " was n't a part of " Deulling Banjos".<br /><br />I hate the term " hillbillies " , because - as some " users " wrote - that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how - without the interference of modern life . Much is made of " inbred " - that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods . " Chinatown " should teach us that lesson . However , city - slickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude . I know lots of " hillbillies " - they are moral people , when left to themselves . Their " justice " can be brutal when they feel threatened or humiliated , just like the " justice " in city streets . They do n't need any part of the city - the city should take its canoe - ing and camping to legal sites.<br /><br />"Deliverance " was the last film I found Jon Voight to do any real acting - I hope I 'm wrong . He was extremely underpaid for " Midnight Cowboy " , because he was unknown , but demonstrated that he could do that role at the drop of a hat . His acting in " Deliverance " was superb . It gave us a clear demonstration ordinary people can move mountains , if it 's necessary - but who wants to be thought - of as " ordinary " today ? His stifled sob at the dinner was brilliant . Wow ! for Burt Reynolds ! ! ! One must ask what led him into those other tacky films ? His manliness , although misguided , in this film set the pace for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness - not only in the backwoods , but the wilderness of everyday - life . Ned Beatty was stellar - his underwear may not have had " Versace " stitched on it , but his shell - shocked performance was perfect . As noted , he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie . Ronny Cox played the moral guy to the hilt - every man should have his determination to do what is right . Several " users " have theorized he was shot , or lost his balance when he pitched - into the river - my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey , he committed suicide . No gunshot was heard during the scene and Voight and Beatty did not find a wound.<br /><br />James Dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale , and was great as the sheriff - it is said he was so terrified of acting he came to the set drunk every day . His character could see the three canoe - rs were guilty of surviving , but also knew they did n't stand a chance against a jury of the local people , no matter how kindly they were treated in " Aintry " . He was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel . Justice ? - " do n't come back up here again " . Not many " users " knew " hillbillies " were used in the film where ever it was possible - what actors could portray them better ? The " mountain - men " WERE actually mountain - men ....... <br /><br />Every detail of this movie was perfect - no doubt it was dangerous to play in . Play in ? Better " fight - for - your - life " in . I 've experienced some near - dangerous incidents , and am content to live outside of the fray - you guys who feel your manhood raging can have my part.<br /><br />That we have absolutely killed - and continue to do so - irreplaceable areas of this country in undeniable . To be able to view its grandeur on any media is enthralling , but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it . Los Angeles , where I live , is a perfect example : it 's built - up right into the territories for wild animals , and steadfastly believes humans come before animals . Those are their rightful habitats - we should leave them be just that . Any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighborhoods ? They 're theirs.<br /><br />In some less threatening way , we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from " Deliverance " - to understand our advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy . I thank all those city - slickers who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic , so that it can scare the heck out of me when I watch it . You can have the thrill of danger - I 'll stick to the TV . 30-out - of-10 .
1 This is one of the funniest series ever ! I laughed till my sides split and rolled around on the floor . If only someone would release in America . Region 0 or 1 - Non - PAL please . < br /><br />I know it being released in the UK but that 's Region 2 and PAL besides ! Let 's give this series its fair shake . America must know this series . Moffat is a genius . I loved Tracie Bennett 's quirky , goofy role in this . Of course I liked Fiona Gillies ! But Tracie was a treasure!<br /><br />Release this show in America ! or Show it again on the PBS stations . I need to laugh and laugh again ! Please indulge us , please ! Please!<br /><br />Thanks for reading .
1 A super comedy series from the 1990s ( Two series were made in total ) that suffered in the UK ratings due to poor scheduling . When you are up against established comedies like ' Minder ' , even the best new comedies are going to struggle to get noticed.<br /><br />Luckily , I caught the series from episode one and followed it avidly . I mentioned it to friends and family at the time , but everyone seemed to have been watching something else . Very , very frustrating.<br /><br />Anyway , I loved both series and never forgot it.<br /><br />Then I looked it up on the internet and found that an ultra - fan was trying to get both series released ' on his own'.<br /><br />Well , both series are now available on DVD.<br /><br />http://www.replaydvd.co.uk / joking_apart_S1.htm
1 For me this is Ealing Studio 's most perfect film - as fresh and relevant half a century later as it was the day it was released.<br /><br />As a satire on economic notions of ' growth ' and the commercial need for in - built obsolescence , it could scarcely be more up - to - the - minute . And of what other film can it be said that the hero literally wears the plot?<br /><br />Oddly , there are parallels with Jurassic Park , in which messing with the environment will literally turn round and bite you . But Spielberg shied away from the book 's brilliant central conceit to tack on some nonsense about ' children ' . Hmmm.<br /><br />In The Man In The White Suit , Alec Guiness plays an idealistic young scientist who comes up with a cloth that never gets dirty and never wears out . Suddenly workers and capital at the northern English mill where he is working are united as never before in protection of their livelihoods.<br /><br />Of course , being Ealing , it 's a comedy , but it need n't have been . The complex interplay of vested ( should that be suited ? ) interests plays out beautifully , as one by one all parties realize that ' progress ' is a threat , and that disposability and waste are what keep the looms turning.<br /><br />But , yes , this is a comedy - albeit a pointed one - and amid the political ironies are delicious performances , and some good old - fashioned knock - about laughs.<br /><br />Nonetheless , it 's the biting satire that endures - dazzling and white .
1 I ca n't say whether the post - WWII British comedies produced at the Ealing Studios are an acquired taste or not , but I am completely addicted , and The Man in the White Suit is one of the best . No need to go into the well - known plot about the threat posed to both the textile industry and the textile unions by an indestructible , dirt - resistant fiber . Suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by the naively idealistic Sidney Stratton in pursuing his polymer vision make for a comedic delight . Many of the well - known faces from the world of British character actors - the nervous Cecil Parker , the suavely devious Michael Gough , and the bluntly ruthless Ernest Thesinger - put in wonderful performances . Guinness - as always and forever - is superb , and Joan Greenwood is delectable as Daphne ( just the way she enunciates the word " Daddy " , makes the entire movie worth seeing).<br /><br />"Knudsen ! ! ! ! ! ! ! "
1 When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness ' death , this was the first of his many films I thought of re - seeing . What a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years . And Guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame . His eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears . Both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites .
1 Contains * spoilers * - also , my quotes may not be exact.<br /><br />Everyone always notes the satire in social commentary and economic parallels - how true . But to me , I see this movie as much more than that . I love the symbolism of this guy in a glowing white suit . There is so much confusion and filth in the world around him , but it wo n't stick . Alec Guiness was the perfect guy to play this - his boyish grins and eternal curiousity are so appropriate:<br /><br />"That 's ingenious - can you tell me , what is the ratio of ink to petrol?" < br /><br />The only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention has n't worked after all - standing there almost naked . Yet , more than shame is the simple disappointment that " it did n't work . " He 's never really intimidated by people . Remember,<br /><br />"But Sidney , we want to stop it too." < br /><br />Barely a moments hesitation before he 's off trying to get away again . Does he show any sign of the pain such a betrayal must 've caused ? No.<br /><br />Also notable is Dapne 's role . She is sick and tired of money and power . She thinks she 's finally found love , outside of her father 's company . At first she does n't really care about Sidney anymore than anyone else . But that moment when he falls off her car and she goes back to see if maybe she killed him - and yet he is still thinking only of the beauty of his invention . She 's finally found something she thinks is worth living for . The funny thing is that it 's not even romance . It is friendship , but of such an ephemeral nature that the title almost does n't fit . It 's more admiration , and perhaps even inspiration.<br /><br />Upon her discovery that Michael has no real love for her , and that her father is completely incompetent to take care of her , she gives into cynicism and tries to temp Sidney . Fortunately she finds that there really are people in this world living for more than power , money and lust . What a refreshment:<br /><br />"Thank you Sidney . If you would 've said ' yes ' I think I 'd have strangled you." < br /><br />I love the very end , when all of this crazy business seems to have come to nothing . But then , the bubbly , quirky beat starts up and Sidney goes off , his stride matching the tune : dauntless . Where is Daphne ? We do n't really know - but they were n't really in love and she was n't really a scientist . He got help escaping and she got " a shot in the arm of hope . " ( Pollyanna ) A cont'd relationship would 've been nice , but as Billy Joel says " it 's more than I 'd hoped for ... " < br /><br / >
1 The Man in the White Suit is one of those delightful comedies that Ealing studies made so well in the 40 's and 50 's . The plot of this one follows a man that invents a cloth that neither gets dirty nor breaks . Of course , this is a huge breakthrough in the world of textiles . However , things are not that simple as the cloth will threaten the way of life of many people , including cloth manufacturers , the cloth mill 's workforces , and even an old lady that does her washing every week . The Man in the White Suit is a film about scientific advances , and the way that they do n't always help ; as the old woman says at one point in the movie , " Why ca nt you scientists just leave things alone?" < br /><br />Like a lot Ealing comedies , this one stars Sir Alec Guinness . Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor ; he has the ability to light up the screen with his presence ( and he does in this film , literally ) , but he also manages to portray his characters in a down to earth and believable way . He is suitably creepy in this film , and he captures just the right atmosphere for his character ; an intelligent and ambitious , but slightly naive scientist . Along with Guinness , The Man in the White Suit also features Joan Greenwood , the deep voiced actress that co - starred with Guinness in the simply divine " Kind Hearts and Coronets " and Michael Gough , a man that would go on to get himself the role of Alfred in the Batman films . The acting in the film is n't always great , but it is always decent , and it 's fits with the film.<br /><br />The Man in the White Suit is an intelligent , thought - provoking and witty comedy with a moral . The comedy is n't always obvious , and it does n't always work , but the film is not meant to be a film that provokes belly laughs , so that is forgivable . I recommend this movie , basically , to anyone that is a fan of movies .
1 This Alec Guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry , and a light eccentric character study as well.<br /><br />The pacing is a bit slow for a comedy , and none of it is really rolling - on - the - floor type funny , except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments . But it does have its amusing moments , and it is very deft in its execution . The big explosions segment is probably the most farcical element.<br /><br />The union procedures are quite droll , very reminiscent of I'M ALL RIGHT JACK ; especially the feminine socialist with a light romantic crush on Guinness ' character . The political machinations actually carry the story . Ernest Thesigner is very notable as a heavy.<br /><br />I do n't think this one works quite as well as THE LADYKILLERS , or KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS ; but even light Ealing comedy is better than nothing .
1 I 've had this movie on tape for years and started watching it again this morning ( while waiting for my laundry --- how ironic ! ) mostly because I wanted to hear Benjamin Frankel 's title music again . I ended up sitting through about the first half hour , entranced by how wonderfully assured the direction , writing , and performances are . The movie is like a who 's who of 50s British character stars : Cecil Parker , Michael Gough , Miles Malleson , Duncan Lamont , and particularly Ernest Thesiger , great as the dessicated old giant of the textile mills . Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood , not character players as such but charming , charismatic leads . This is science fiction in its purest form and droll comedy as well . An all - time classic , and I hope no one ever tries to remake it !
1 An unassuming , subtle and lean film , " The Man in the White Suit " is yet another breath of fresh air in filmic format from Ealing studios . While I suspect some modern viewers may initially find it obscure , I doubt many would fail to be charmed by the expert way the plot , the themes and characters are languidly relayed during the film 's course.<br /><br />The genuinely great Alec Guinness gives another fine characterization in a film perhaps not as obviously virtuoso as Ealing 's inspired " Kind Hearts and Coronets " from 1949 . This time , he merely plays one character rather than eight , but as the unworldly inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton , he always finds the correct tone and expression . Along with Guinness ' subtle , expressive performance , the rest of the cast are effective . Of the main players , Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger do stand out . Thesiger is compellingly absurd as the crippled but influential business grandee , while Parker is dependable as the ineffectual yet pivotal mill owner and father . Father , that is , of Joan Greenwood , the deftly delectable comic actress , who is at her insurmountable peak in this film . Resplendent and seductive of aspect and diction , she is quite sublime in this film , a fine contrast with the similarly unusual , but more maladroit Guinness . The scene where she seemingly tries to tempt him is played so adeptly by the pair that it is both deeply poignant and amusing ... <br /><br />The themes are handled very effectively , with no easy morals drawn . The complexities of the relationships between science , business and the workforce are insightfully and enjoyably examined . Expertly helmed by Alexander Mackendrick , this film is technically adept in all areas ; evocative photography , fitting sound effects and music and a wistful script , all quietly impress . A thoroughly satisfying film , with Guinness and Greenwood magnificent.<br /><br />Rating:- * * * * 1/2/ * * * * *
1 THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT , like I'M ALL RIGHT JACK , takes a dim view of both labor and capital . Alec Guinness is a scientific genius - but an eccentric one ( he has never gotten his university degree due to an ... err ... accident in a college laboratory ) . He manages to push himself into various industrial labs in the textile industry . When the film begins he is in Michael Gough 's company , and Gough ( in a memorable moment ) is trying to impress his would - be father - in - law ( Cecil Parker ) by showing him the ship - shape firm he runs . While having lunch with Parker and Parker 's daughter ( Joan Greenwood ) , Gough gets a message regarding some problems about the lab 's unexpectedly large budget problems . He reads the huge expenditures ( due to Guinness 's experiments ) , and chokes on his coffee.<br /><br />Guinness goes on to work at Parker 's firm , and repeats the same tricks he did with Gough - but Parker discovers it too . Greenwood has discovered what Guinness is working on , and convinces Parker to continue the experiments ( but now legally ) . The result : Guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic bonds within it 's molecular structure so that ( for all intents and purposes ) the fiber will remain in tact for good . Any textile made from it will never fade , get dirty , or wear out - it will last forever.<br /><br />Guinness has support from a female shop steward , but not her chief . He sees Guinness as selling out to the rich . But when he explains to them what he 's done , they turn against him . If everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes ! Soon Parkers ' fellow textile tycoons ( led by Gough , Ernest Theisinger - in a wonderful performance , and Howard Marion - Crawford ) are equally panic stricken by what may end their businesses . They seek to suppress the invention . With only Greenwood in his corner ( although Parker sort of sympathizes with him ) , Guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public.<br /><br />In the end , Guinness is defeated by science as well as greed . But he ends the film seeing the error in his calculations , and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after all.<br /><br />It 's a brilliant comedy . But is the argument for suppression valid ? At one point the difficulties of making the textile are shown ( you have to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually enable the ends of the material to be united . There is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat ( or contract if the owner gets thin ) . Are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever ? What happened to fashion changes and new styles ? And the cloth is only made in the color white ( making Guinness look like a white knight ) . We are told that color dye would have to be added earlier in the process . Would n't that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the textile ? < br /><br />Alas this is not a science paper , but a film about the hypocrisies of labor and capital in modern industry . As such it is brilliant . But those questions I mention keep bothering me about the validity of suppressing Guinness ' invention
1 One of the things that makes this Ealing comedy so outrageously funny is the clever editing . Shots that would be considered absolutely essential to most modern comedies are deliberately left out . ( This is what was known as British understatement . ) < br /><br />Three instances : A comic fight is edited like this . Alec Guiness has invented a new cloth that will ruin the industry . Half a dozen businessmen invite him to their office to try to get him to sign a contract relinquishing his control of the cloth so that production can be suppressed . When he catches on to this , Guiness stands up and turns to walk to the door . Two men block his way . " Excuse me , " he says quietly , taking a step forward . The two men move between Guiness and the camera . Cut . A secretary is sitting outside at her desk . There is silence until the buzzer begins signaling her frantically . She takes up her notebook and opens the door to the inner office where a full - fledged noisy Donnybrook is in progress and the room is half wrecked . Guiness dashes out the open door.<br /><br />The following example would be unthinkable today . During the research phase of his invention Guiness sets up an elaborate chemical apparatus but instead of converting the experimental liquid into the new cloth , the device explodes . Again and again it explodes . The laboratory is cleared of all other work . The blasts continue . Ceilings fall down . Windows are blown out . The director of research is seated at his desk in a tiny office cluttered with debris , a bandage on his head . When the door behind him opens he jumps a foot in the air . " Sit down , " he tells his visitor , " there 's another one due at any moment . " It is excruciatingly amusing -- and there is not a single shot of any explosions . This would be unimaginable now without a fireball , and maybe a building collapsing in slow motion.<br /><br />Last example , consisting of a series of quick , relentless cuts , put together precisely . Guiness is being pursued and is cornered in the lobby of an office building by people who want him to sign the contract . Faced with two men about to grapple with him , Guiness backs up with a determined expression . He bumps against a pedestal with an iron bust on it . The bust topples backward and bumps against the wall . There is a shot lasting about one second of the bust hitting the wall . Another brief shot of a metal shield hung above the bust being jarred loose and falling down . Quick cut to Guiness 's head rising into the frame . Cut to the two men staring into the camera while horrible brass banging and thudding sounds are heard off screen . Cut to Guiness flat on his back . Nobody today would have the cojones to NOT show Guiness being crowned by that shield.<br /><br />I wo n't go on with this . It 's a comedy alright but a pretty bitter one underneath all the hilarity . In solving one set of problems , Guiness has created dozens of others . He is opposed both by management and labor , neither of which is shown to much advantage . And of course the economic implications have to do with more than cloth . " What about that car that runs on water with a pinch of something or other in it ? " one of the workers asks . " Vested interests , " comments another worker , as Thorstein Veblen nods in his grave . What WOULD happen if our problems with energy were solved overnight ? If I owned shares of Exxon -- and I think I do -- I 'd shudder at the thought . Where would the oil industry be if there were no more need for oil ? For that matter , where would the police force and the FBI be if crime were to suddenly disappear ? This is a thoughtful and very amusing movie , superbly directed and edited . The roster of performers is peerless . Joanne Greenwood with that husky voice . The blithering Cecil Parker . The wheezing mummified Ernest Thesiger . < br /><br />A first - rate job all around .
1 Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars , Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of work -- particularly in the 1940s-1950s -- ranging from dramas to quirky comedies . I particularly love his comedies , as they are so well - done and seem so natural and real on the screen -- far different from the usual fare from Hollywood.<br /><br />This being said , this was the film that sparked my interest in these movies . It 's plot was so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhere -- except for Ealing Studios -- which had a particular fondness for " little " films like this one.<br /><br />Guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company . He wants to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible , though he is not working for the company as a researcher but for janitorial work ! So , he tends to sneak into labs ( either during the day if no one suspects or at night ) and try his hand at inventing . Repeatedly , he is caught ( such as after he blew up the lab ) and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds ! Then , despite the importance of the discovery , he sets off a completely unanticipated chain of events -- and then the fun begins.<br /><br />The film is a wonderful satire that pokes fun at industry , unions , the government and people in general .
1 In my mind the best of the Ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time . The theme of workers v. management ( with lots of talk of unions and rights ) perhaps dates the film a bit now as it 's no longer a subject discussed all that much but that does n't stop " White Suit " from being a show stopping classic.<br /><br />The plot , about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil , does n't sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true Ealing comedy . The fabric repels dirt and can never wear out ! The titular white suit that Alec Guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences , such as Guinness being able to use his indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall ! The script itself is full of dry wit - " Is he all right ? " " Yes . " " Pity . " - and characterisation is first rate . I 'm always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well . Comedies of later eras would adopt a " point the camera at the actors and let it roll " mentality but the Ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations . This film is no exception.<br /><br />Of course , it 's the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights . Alec Guinness gives a fantastically understated performance , with eyes that convey wonder , joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it . Stratton is a man oblivious to everything except his work . Such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating but Guinness effortlessly makes him likable , so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as Stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything he 's ever worked for . Joan Greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual , as are befuddled Cecil Parker and slimy Michael Gough ; everybody gets laughs without even trying to . It 's comical British understatement at its finest.<br /><br />"The Man in the White Suit " is 81 minutes of sheer brilliance , with a great plot , great cast , sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism . Absolutely top notch .
1 When I saw this film in the 1950s , I wanted to be a scientist too . There was something magical and useful in Science . I took a girl - friend along to see it a second time . I do n't think she was as impressed as I was ! This film was comical yet serious , at a time when synthetic fibres were rather new . Lessons from this film could be applied to issues relating to GM experimentation of today .
1 Sidney Stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories . Stratton 's experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric , one that never gets dirty , never wrinkles , or wears out . When Stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers ( who will lose their jobs ) and the owners ( who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights ) , so Stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in England . The film is ideal and only Ealing could have made it so . Guiness ' performance ( and a great supporting cast such as Greenwood , Thesiger , and Parker ) and Mackendrick 's direction make the film a delight , but the real hero is the story itself , a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama , romance , and suspense . Rating , 8 .
1 I enjoyed this film . But I was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy . It was amusing at times , but really , it was n't very funny at all . If I 'd been expecting it to be a comedy , I might have been disappointed with the film , but , going in with no expectations , I found it to be enjoyable and engaging . Maybe it was because , as an engineer , I identified with the protagonist . I was less concerned with satire of capital or labor , and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention . A man who 's less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production . He 's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention . So I find it interesting that people here have compared it to Jurassic Park ; me , I compare it to The Fountainhead .
1 A chemist develops a fabric that never gets dirty or wears out , but it is seen as a threat to the survival of various industries . In this delightful Ealing Studios comedy , Guinness is marvelous as the mild - mannered but persistent chemist . Greenwood , with her sensual voice , plays the love interest ; Parker is her harried father . Thesiger is amusing as a patriarch of the fabric industry . While telling an engaging story , the film also raises some intriguing questions about science , the economy , and politics . It is adeptly directed by Mackendrick , who would go on to make " The Ladykillers " and the sublime " Sweet Smell of Success " later in the 1950s .
1 Often tagged as a comedy , The Man In The White Suit is laying out far more than a chuckle here and there.<br /><br />Sidney Stratton is an eccentric inventor who is n't getting the chances to flourish his inventions on the world because nobody pays him notice , he merely is the odd ball odd job man about the place as it were . After bluffing his way into Birnley 's textile mill , he uses their laboratory to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that not only never wears out , but also never needs to be cleaned!. He is at first proclaimed a genius and those who ignored him at first suddenly want a big piece of him , but then the doom portents of an industry going bust rears its head and acclaim quickly turns to something far more scary.<br /><br />Yes the film is very funny , in fact some scenes are dam hilarious , but it 's the satirical edge to the film that lifts it way above the ordinary to me . The contradictions about the advent of technology is a crucial theme here , do we want inventions that save us fortunes whilst closing down industries ? , you only have to see what happened to the coal industry in Britain to know what I 'm on about . The decade the film was made is a crucial point to note , the making of nuclear weapons became more than just hearsay , science was advancing to frighteningly new proportions . You watch this film and see the quick turnaround of events for the main protagonist Stanley , from hero to enemy in one foul swoop , a victim of his own pursuit to better mankind ! , it 's so dark the film should of been called The Man In The Black Suit.<br /><br />I honestly ca n't find anything wrong in this film , the script from Roger MacDougall , John Dighton , and director Alex Mackendrick could be filmed today and it would n't be out of place such is the sharpness and thought of mind it has . The sound and setting is tremendous , the direction is seamless , with the tonal shift adroitly handled by Mackendrick . Some of the scenes are just wonderful , one in particular tugs on the heart strings and brings one to think of a certain scene in David Lynch 's Elephant Man some 29 years later , and yet after such a downturn of events the film still manages to take a wink as the genius that is Alec Guinness gets to close out the film to keep the viewers pondering not only the future of Stanley , but also the rest of us in this rapidly advancing world.<br /><br />A timeless masterpiece , thematically and as a piece of art , 10/10 .
1 Ealing Studios , a television and film production company based in West London , claims to be the oldest film studio in the world . Though it has been consistently churning out films and television programmes since the 1930s , its golden age was most certainly between 1948 and 1955 , when it produced a string of comedy masterpieces , many starring the great Alec Guinness . Such well - known titles include ' Whisky Galore ! ( 1949 ) , ' ' Passport to Pimlico ( 1949 ) , ' ' Kind Hearts and Coronets ( 1949 ) , ' ' The Lavender Hill Mob ( 1951 ) , ' ' The Titfield Thunderbolt ( 1953 ) ' and ' The Ladykillers ( 1955 ) . ' One of Ealing Studio 's most beloved films , ' The Man in the White Suit , ' was released in 1951 , and starred Alec Guiness as Sidney Stratton , a brilliant inventor who engineers a remarkable fabric , an invention that unexpectedly makes him more enemies than friends.<br /><br />Sidney Stratton is poor and unappreciated , but he has scientific talent in great abundance . Due to his under - qualification , the only jobs he is able to get are as a janitor or labourer at any of the large textile factories , where he secretly undertakes his own experiments using the company 's own money and equipment . After being found out and ejected countless times , Sidney is convinced that he is only weeks away from a momentous scientific discovery that will revolutionise the textiles industry . Encouraged by his daughter Daphne ( Joan Greenwood ) , textile mill owner Alan Birnley ( Cecil Parker ) takes a keen interest in Sidney 's exploits and agrees to finance any further work . After numerous failed attempts and quite a few earth - shattering explosions , Sidney eventually unveils his amazing creation : an almost - luminous white fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out.<br /><br />If Sidney thought that his invention would make him a hero , then he was sorely disappointed . The all - powerful bosses of textiles industry , headed by the frail Sir John Kierlaw ( Ernest Thesiger ) , unite to ensure that the revolutionary invention , which could completely cripple their businesses , never goes into full - scale production . Likewise , the humble labourers in the workers ' union hear of Sidney 's creation and also set out to erase it from existence , fearing for their jobs . The inventor , however , is convinced that the ever - lasting fabric will bring relief and happiness to many , and refuses to give in to the demand of others , despite being threatened with violence and offered ₤250,000 in compensation . Throughout all his troubles to announce his invention to the media , only one person offers Sidney her complete sympathy and support , Birnley 's daughter Daphne , who is engaged to be married to somebody else but falls in love with Sidney 's plight anyway.<br /><br />'The Man in the White Suit ' is a clever and hilarious comedy , made great by a witty script ( written by John Dighton , Roger MacDougall and director Alexander Mackendrick ) and a quirky and charismatic performance from an inimitable Alec Guinness . There are also a few good - natured swipes at capitalism , and of how big industries can hold back progress for the sake of their own monetary situations , though we can certainly see the arguments for either side of the debate .
1 Other commentators have detailed the plot and the social parables and commentary as well ( or better ) that I could , but I would like to join in my admiration for this little jewel of a film . It holds up very well indeed more that 50 years later in every category - screenplay , acting , photography , set design , sound design ... it really is a classic of sorts . This was my first exposure to the " young " Alec Guinness , and it 's obvious from the first frames what made him so special as to eventually receive a knighthood . < br /><br />I only rate it an " 8 " because it 's essentially a rather lightweight parable that examines human nature but does n't really skewer it ; and because the plot takes the easy way out at the end , rather than actually resolving conflict between the inventor and the mill workers and industrialists who are chasing him all over town . Also , a couple minutes of thought reveals the basic flaw in the logic of the screenplay - wear and tear is hardly ever the determining factor in buying new clothes ( especially dress clothes ) ; children grow up , people change sizes , gain and lose weight , and go with the latest fashions all the time , and have as long as looms have woven cloth . And if nothing else , the manufacturer would make a fortune providing indestructible material for military uniforms ( especially BDUs ) . < br /><br />Still , this is a great film . If you get a chance to see it on a classic movie channel , you should .
1 While Hollywood got sort of stagnant during the few years after WWII , England developed a very prolific film industry . In " The Man in the White Suit " , inventor Sidney Stratton ( Alec Guinness ) creates a suit that never gets dirty . Unfortunately , this means that certain other businesses are now likely to go out of business ! How can Sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity ? This is an example of one of the great movies in which Alec Guinness starred before he became Obi Wan Kenobi . It 's a good look at the overall absurdity of the business world . If you 're planning to start any kind of business , you might want to consider watching this movie .
1 " They were always trying to get me killed , " Alec Guinness once wrote of The Man In the White Suit 's technicians . " They thought actors got in the way of things . " He went on to describe how he 'd been given a wire rope to climb down and , assured it was safe , narrowly avoided serious injury when it suddenly snapped mid - descent.<br /><br />"People get in the way of things " might be a maxim tailor - made for White Suit inventor Sidney Stratton ( fittingly played blank slate - fashion by Alec Guinness ) in Alexander Mackendrick 's definitive Ealing film of 1951 . Certainly , he cares only about his work , its realisation - and sod the consequences . And similarly , with the exception of a couple of peripheral characters , there 's almost nobody to root for in this chilly satire on capital and labour.<br /><br />Told in flashback , the film concerns Stratton 's invention of a dirt - resistant , everlasting fibre ( fashioned into the white suit of the title ) , and subsequent attempts by the clothing industry and its unions to suppress it.<br /><br />While the industry fears the bottom will drop out of the market , the shop floor stewards worry about finding themselves out of a job . Abduction and bribery attempts follow , with both money and an industry chief 's daughter on offer ( Daphne , the delectable , 4-packs - a - day - voiced Joan Greenwood ) , to the tragi - comic end.<br /><br />"What 's to become of my bit of washing when there 's no washing to do ? " bemoans Stratton 's landlady near the close . A notion Stratton had n't even considered - and has disregarded again by the movie 's ambiguous coda.<br /><br />A superior , if decidedly downbeat comedy , expertly performed - and pretty much answering the oft - raised question of whatever happened to the everlasting light bulb and the car that ran on water ...
1 " The Man in the White Suit " is another feather in the cap of expert Scottish director Alexander Mackendrick ( Whisky Galore ! , Sweet Smell of Success ) . The star of the film is Alec Guinness ( whose comedies include Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Lavender Hill Mob ) . Guiness brings his usual class to the film , and makes it much more than a typical comedy.<br /><br />In fact , the comedy is n't entirely overt . By the end of the picture , it 's nearly become a complete drama . It 's the sort of Ealing studio comedy that is calculated not to produce laughter , but a sense of general amusement , like the best British comedy of the time.<br /><br />The whole idea of the suit is n't very original , but the way it is executed is . The film is highly original , and recommended to any fan of Guiness or Britsh comedy.<br /><br />7.6 out of 10
1 I saw this movie only after hearing raves about it for years . Needless to say , the actual experience proved a bit anticlimactic . But still , Alec Guiness energetically leads a wonderful cast in a jolly , if formulaic , romp through industrial post - WWII England.<br /><br />This is the familiar tale of the woes of inventing the perfect everyday product . Remember the car that runs on water ? Remember the promise of nuclear energy ? In this case , it 's a fabric that does n't wear out , wrinkle , or even get dirty ! Of course , fabric manufacturers and their workers are horrified at the prospect of being put out of business , and so the plot gets a bit thick.<br /><br />Guiness makes the whole enterprise worthwhile , and watching him blow up a factory research lab over and over again is quite a blast ! ( Those Brits ... always the stiff upper lip when under fire . ) The film might chug along exactly like Guiness 's goofy invention , but it 's a good ride all the same .
1 What a wonderful movie , eligible for so many labels it never gets : Science fiction , film - noir , with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated , cultured audience ..... the kind of English language movie only done in pre-1960 England ( and shown only in USA art movie houses when it first arrived ) , and never , ever done in the USA.<br /><br />Main characters in The Man In The White Suit(1951 ) starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood routinely use polysyllabic , science reference words like " polymer " and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like " long chain molecules " and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him.<br /><br />The Man In The White Suit ( 1951 ) is the opposite of the video - game explosion movies which now ( 2009 ) dominate world cinema , and certainly dominate major USA cinema ....... it 's a carefully acted , intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated English actors ( who play educated , accomplished people ) , and it 's all done with comedy , charm , pathos , and sense of irony which ancient Greek dramatists would have approved of.<br /><br />Everybody should see this movie , and someday , somehow , some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it.<br /><br />It 's wonderful .
1 If The Man in the White Suit had been done in America , ca n't you see either Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying on Alec Guinness 's Sidney Stratton on for size?<br /><br />This is one of the best of Alec Guinness 's films and certainly one of the best that Ealing Studios in the United Kingdom ever turned out . It 's so perfectly fits within the time frame of the new Labour government and the society it was trying to build . It 's amazing how in times of crisis capital and labor can agree.<br /><br />Alec Guinness this meek little schnook of a man is obsessed with the idea that he can invent clothing that will never need cleaning , that in fact repels all kinds of foreign matter the minute it touches the garment . < br /><br />He 's a persistent cuss and he does succeed . Of course the implications have n't really been thought through about the kind of impact clothing like that will have on society . In the end everyone is chasing him down like they would a fugitive , almost like Peter Lorre from M or Orson Welles in The Stranger or even Robert Newton in Oliver Twist . < br /><br />It 's the mark of a great comedy film that a potentially serious situation like that chase as described in some of the serious films I 've mentioned can be played for laughs . Poor Guinness 's suit is not only white and stain repellent , but it glows like a neon sign.<br /><br />Other than Guinness the best performances are from Cecil Parker as yet another pompous oaf , Joan Greenwood as his siren daughter and Ernest Thesiger the biggest clothing manufacturer in the UK > < br /><br />Come to think of it , did Paramount borrow that suit from Ealing and give it to John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever ?
1 This is a film I saw when it first came out , and which I have seen a few more times over the years . It 's always enjoyable.<br /><br />One thing is that the comedy does not take sides : it skewers labor and capitalists equally . Only Sid seems outside the classic struggle , even though he 's responsible for it . < br /><br />Spoiler warning : do not read further if you have n't seen the film < br /><br />This is a fantasy , though presented fairly plausibly . Ask yourself : could someone support most of his or her weight in a single strand of fabric ? It would cut through almost any support.<br /><br />Also , when cornered in an alley , Sid uses a garbage can cover like a knight 's shield . Cute symbolism.<br /><br />Someday , I 'll get this on DVD .
1 This is an excellent modern - day film noir .... "excellent " in that it 's interesting , start - to - finish . There are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief ..... but I have n't found anyone who did n't get caught up in this story . The movie has the right amount of action , suspense , plot twists and interesting characters . In addition , it sports some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar - based soundtrack . < br /><br />I labeled this crime movie a " film noir " because it 's gritty and the all the characters are no good . Even the only supposed - good guy , played by Nicholas Cage , gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair he should't have . He also does something at the end which is n't right , but I 'm not going the spoil it by saying . Suffice to say , however , that the rest of the characters are so bad they make Cage look good!<br /><br />Speaking of " bad guys , " does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper ? Not many . At least in the " deranged " category , he 's tough to beat . Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons . J.T. Walsh gives another great supporting performance , too.<br /><br />This is one of those films that never got much publicity , but it should have . You 'll have fun watching this . By the way , try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without messing it up !
1 Vaguely reminiscent of great 1940 's westerns , like " The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre " ( 1948 ) , " Red Rock West " is a story about conscience , greed , and betrayal . Michael ( Nicolas Cage ) is a down and out , but honest , young man from Texas who goes west in search of work and money . He finds both , but not in the way he had expected.<br /><br />The film 's screenplay contains plenty of surprises and plot twists . Excellent cinematography , adroit film editing , and moody western music add tension and suspense . The expansiveness of the big sky country provides a wonderful setting . And the acting ranges from good to excellent , with great performances from Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh . Dwight Yoakam 's specially recorded country / western song provides the film with a strong finale.<br /><br />Correctly labeled as neo - noir , " Red Rock West " strikes me as being something else , as well . The plot is full of amazing coincidences and improbable timing , so much so that others may regard the screenplay as flawed . Ordinarily , I would agree . In this case , however , when combined with the moody atmosphere , and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems almost empty of normal daily life , the coincidences and unlikely timing suggest a story that , beyond " noirish " , is ... surreal . It 's almost as if fate deliberately intervenes with improbable events so as to force Michael to come to grips with himself . From this point of view , the coincidences are not script flaws at all . They are necessary plot points in a nightmarish story of a young man who must confront his own demons ... disguised as other characters.<br /><br />All we need here is Rod Serling , in a postscript , explaining , in his always clearly enunciated voice , that ... a young man , searching for himself , stops in a small , almost deserted town a thousand miles from nowhere . It 's his final layover in a journey to ... the twilight zone .
1 In any number of films , you can find Nicholas Cage as a strong , silent hero , Dennis Hopper as a homicidal maniac , Lara Flynn Boyle as a vamp / tramp , and the late , lamented J.T. Walsh as the heavy . These are the types of roles these four can play in their sleep , and they have done so often enough that to see them playing them again borders on cliche . What a relief , therefore , that John Dahl , a master at getting a lot of mood out of a little action , directed this nuanced noirish thriller . Hopper manages to keep from going over the top , Cage shows a little more depth than his usually - superficial action heroes , Boyle is by turns sultry , innocent , and scheming , and one gets a sense of the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character , Wayne . Dahl 's direction gives a sense of the emptiness of the Big Sky country where the story takes place while also being intimate enough to show how a wrinkled brow can indicate a radical change of plot in store . The plot twists are top - notch , and one of the other great twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they have brains . It is n't often that minor characters like deputy sheriffs have more brains than their headlining superiors . But with a director as smart as Dahl , you should n't be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected with this film . An excellent movie .
1 If you like plot turns , this is your movie . It is impossible at any moment to predict what will happen next . Nothing is as it appears or ends as you think it will . The characters are all gritty and engaging . Cage is at his best . Dennis Hopper again shows his delightfully sinister side . JT Walsh is perfect in his last performance . Laura Boyle sizzles . Dwight Yoakum makes a film debut superbly in a cameo . I categorize this movie as " I am having a really , really , really bad day " film . Not a slow minute in this film . A real sleeper . This movie is underrated and , sadly , overlooked .
1 " Red Rock West " was far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90 's with a superb script ( by John and Rick Dahl ) that kept you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat for most of the film . It was brilliantly directed by John Dahl and featured a marvellous cast including Nicolas Cage , Dennis Hopper , Lara Flynn Boyle and especially J. T. Walsh ( in a memorable performance ) making this a riveting and captivating thriller not to be missed . The film never had much publicity on release ( in fact I first caught up with it on TV ) and is therefore one of those special little gems that you have to seek out but this unique film is now slowly gaining a cult following.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams who is broke and out of work when he finds himself in the small town of Red Rock . Mistaken for a contract killer named Lyle from Dallas he is shocked to be offered $ 10,000 to murder the wife of bar owner Wayne Brown ( the excellent J. T. Walsh ) . He plays along with the plan and decides he should go and warn Brown 's wife Suzanne ( Lara Flynn Boyle ) but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists , turns and surprises - and double dealings - that Cage is thrown from one crisis to another and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation he ca n't drag himself out of ! Then just to complicate matters even further the real Lyle turns up to carry out the contract killing ( played by everyone 's favourite heavy Dennis Hopper ) . When Hopper discovers what has happened he goes after Cage but no one could forsee the surprising events that follow.<br /><br />Some favourite lines from the film:<br /><br />Nicolas Cage ( to Lara Flynn Boyle ) : " I hate to see an innocent woman get hurt but it 's an awful lot of money".<br /><br />J. T. Walsh ( to Cage ) : " Michael Williams . Well , Michael , you 're going to be spending some time with us till we get to the bottom of this".<br /><br />Boyle ( to Cage ) : " You 're not a killer ? " . Cage : " That 's right , no . But the guy I 'm supposed to be just rode into town so you got ta get out of here".<br /><br />Boyle ( to Cage ) : " O.K. How you 're going to explain impersonating a hired killer and taking $ 10,000 from my husband?".<br /><br />An extraordinarily entertaining little thriller ( just 98 minutes ) with a storyline that never lets up and powerful acting by all the principals . Any film featuring J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book and " Red Rock West " was one of his best . How sad it was that this exceptional actor 's career was cut tragically short by a heart attack in 1998 . The most prolific period for " film noir " was without any doubt the forties but " Red Rock West " is a good modern example of the genre and has jumped right into my " Top Ten " list of all time favourite films . I look forward to more like this from director John Dahl . 10/10 . Clive Roberts.<br /><br / >
1 Some movies you just know you 're going to love from the first few seconds . This is one of those movies . Tracing it 's roots back to " Double Indemnity , " and " The Postman Always Rings Twice " in the 40 's - this was a great example of Modern Film Noir in the 90 's . Nick Cage plays the " down on his luck " main character who gets entangled in a husband - wife murder plot - and his luck goes from bad to worse to even worse as he tries and tries to get away from the people , town , violence and threat of Red Rock West . Lots of twists and turns , great performances by Cage , Hopper and Walsh , an hypnotic slide - guitar musical backdrop , and seamless directing make this a real joy . Favorite Line : When Cage looks at the empty gas gauge in the get - away car , shakes his head and says : " F***in ' story of my life . "
1 I came home late one night and turned on the TV , to see Siskel and Ebert summarizing their picks of the week . I did n't hear anything about " Red Rock West " , except two thumbs up and see it before it went away . It would n't stay in theaters very long because of the distributor 's money problems and lack of promotion , but they said it deserved better.<br /><br />The next afternoon , I followed their advice . They were right , it was some of the most fun I have ever had at the movies . As some readers point out , there are a few plot holes and the last 10 minutes do n't ever seem to end . But it 's well worth it , for the fine craftwork that went into the first hour . It 's the best role that I have ever seen for Nicholas Cage , but almost everybody seems perfectly cast . Dennis Hopper goes almost over the top , which gets silly but reinforces how well everything else works . The sets and the music contribute a great deal to almost every scene.<br /><br />When I rented it later for my family , it did n't work as well . The long scenes that built the tension in the theater were difficult to appreciate , with the distractions at home . It deserves your full attention ; turn off the phone , make sure you wo n't be disturbed , watch and listen to every scene , especially in the beginning .
1 Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here . Cage and Boyle are fine , but what gives this neo - noir its juice is Hopper 's creepy , violent character and JT Walsh 's sneakiness.<br /><br />A drifter gets mistaken for a hit - man , and tries to make a little dough out of it , but gets in over his head.<br /><br />I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie , when Cage walks into a trailer in Wyoming to get drilling work , with the help of his buddy ... and the opening scene in Brokeback Mountain , when the character does the same thing ! But that 's another story.<br /><br />Dennis Hopper is at his best here ... cocky , one - step - ahead villainous , seething and explosively violent . JT Walsh ( RIP ) is also great as the man with a dark past , trying to live legitimately ( well , almost).<br /><br />There are only 4 real characters of note here , with the exception of the hard - working deputy in the town of Red Rock , Wyoming . The first twist hits early on , and from there it 's a nice neo - noir adventure in some sleepy little town . Satisfying . 8 pts .
1 This movie started me on a Nick Cage kick . It is a story full of twists and turns- a movie of motives and moves . Of , course , Dennis Hopper was a ham , but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect pair to catch the unsuspecting man who has fallen into their web . Everything about this movie is good - cinematography , story pace and most of all the end . Cage excels at what he does best- it 's not to be an action hero but to be an everyman caught in the snares of life .
1 Red Rock West ( 1993)<br /><br />Nicolas Cage gets embroiled in a deadly crime without at first knowing it , and the dominos lead to increasing peril , adventure and misadventure in the wild forlorn American West of the 1990s . Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes hilarious , and Cage pulls off the mixture with his usual sardonic wit and wary ease . < br /><br />Is the plot over the top ? Yes . Is Dennis Hopper perfect as a crazed , almost likable killer ? Yes . Does Cage stand a chance ? Well , you have to watch and see . It never lets up , and it took me by surprise the first time I saw it . On second viewing yesterday , I was surprised at how well it held up , how well constructed it was , and how macabre and funny it was at the same time.<br /><br />Director Ron Dahl ( who also helped write ) is known more for his TV work , but with Rounders and this film he shows a deft hand with sensational plots . It 's saved by its humor by the way , and by the caricatures . The bar is sleazy , the cops questionable . And do n't miss a really inspired cameo by Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver .
1 Much to your presumable happiness fair readers , Cage and Hopper did meet and fortunately not in a Lynch moviebecause RED ROCK WEST is way better than any Lynch movie  . Nicolas Cage is a thirdrate actor , the porcelain babe is a surrogate femme fatal , only daddy Hopper is as mean as ever  . RED ROCK WEST is , despite the trite cast , one of my favorite American thrillers ; in a word , a thriller with some twists.<br /><br />One notices mainly the gusto , the awesome pace , the thrills , the nice suspense , Lara Flynn Boyle 's cute tight small ass , Cage 's enviable physical shape ( though undeniably ugly , with sharp , bird features , thick eyebrows and thin , rare hair , Cage displayed a fine overall shape  ) , Hopper 's consummate routine , some moderately but truly funny moments , Cage 's play with his intended persona , Hopper 's rigid , psychopathic allure , Lara 's meanness , Cage seems a roamer , the archetypal gloomy roamer of the noir cinema , hungry , tough if needed , naive , dirty , tired . Lara Flynn Boyle performs as the cold mean seductress , Walsh as her heartless husband , and Hopper as the Lynchian hit - man he 's already done before.<br /><br />Cage looks indeed rather groggy or dizzy or very confused and having a severe hangover . But this might be his regular look .
1 As others have commented , I checked this out after Siskel and Ebert listed this as one of their top 10 movies of the year . What a gift . I then went out to buy it , just so that I could loan it out.<br /><br />Best quote ? Dwight Yoakum stops his truck when he realizes that someone ( Cage ) is on top of his cab . When Cage peers down , he apologizes . " I 'm sorry if I scared you . " Yoakum thrusts his pistol in Cage 's face with " Does THIS look like I 'm scared ? " Great bit of humor after an exciting ( and temporary ) escape.<br /><br />There really was a sense of fun to this . The constant sighting of the " Welcome to Red Rock " sign elicits a groan and a smiling head shake . The music created a hunting , eerie quality to the film reminiscent of " Twin Peaks " . Unlike " Twin Peaks " , though , it does n't spoil things by going too far into the outlandish , needing to " top " itself.<br /><br />I admit watching the credits 15 - 20 times . You see , they had Yoakum 's " Thousand Miles from Nowhere " ( perfectly chosen ) playing as a freight train curved around down to the desert floor . . with snow - capped mountains in the distance . This was incredible , fluid framing . Further , I 've never seen a better unification of sight and sound on film . Also , it totally fit the story .
1 What we have here is a damn good little nineties thriller that , while perhaps lacking in substance , still provides great entertainment throughout it 's running time and overall does everything you could possibly want a film of this nature to do . I saw this film principally because it was directed by John Dahl - a highly underrated director behind great thrillers such as The Last Seduction , Rounders and Roadkill . I figured that if this film was up to standard of what I 've already seen from the director , it would be well worth watching - and Red Rock West is certainly a film that Dahl can be proud of . The plot focuses on the overly moral Michael ; a man travelling across America looking for work . He ends up finding it one day when he stumbles upon a bar in Red Rock County - only catch is that the job is to murder a man 's wife . He 's been mistaken for a killer named Lyle , but instead of doing the job ; he plays both sides against each other and eventually plans to make a getaway . However , his attempts to escape are unsuccessful and he finds himself in a bad situation when the real Lyle turns up ... <br /><br />John Dahl appears to enjoy setting thrillers on the road ; he did it three years earlier with Kill Me Again , and again almost a decade on from this film with Roadkill . It 's not hard to see why Dahl chooses this sort of location , as it provides a fabulous atmosphere for a thriller the likes of this one . Dahl also provides his film with a ' film noir ' like atmosphere , as the plot mainly focuses on the central character and the word he is plunged into is full of dark and mysterious characters . The acting is largely very good , with Nicholas Cage doing an excellent job in the lead role , and getting A - class support from Lara Flynn Boyle , J.T. Walsh and , of course , Dennis Hopper ; who once again commands the screen with his over the top performance . It has to be said that the second half of the film is n't as gripping as the first , but Red Rock West certainly is never boring and the way that Dahl orchestrates the grand finale is excellent in that all the central characters get to be a part of it . Overall , Red Rock West is a film that you 're unlikely to regret watching . It 's thrilling throughout , and you ca n't ask for much more than that !
1 Red Rock West is a perfect example of how good a film can be with practically no budget . All you need is a smart script , good actors and loads of atmosphere . RRW delivers all these and more.<br /><br />Nic Cage plays an ex - marine , injured in Lebanon , who is down to his last 5 dollars after being refused a job on an oilfield because of his bad knee . He roles into Red Rock and is mistaken by bartender Wayne ( JT Walsh , not quite as his most menacing - but still evil ) for a hit - man from Texas.<br /><br />He pays him to kill his wife and make it look like burglary . Only when he gets there , just to check her out . She offers him double to kill Wayne . Cage just wants to get the hell out of town with his free money and leave the sparring lovers be . But a series of mishaps and setbacks results in him yo - yoing in and out of Red Rock , back and forth . Eventually this leads to a run - in with Lyle from Dallas ( a cheeky and somehow sympathetic Dennis Hopper ) , the REAL hit - man from Texas who offers to help without knowing he 's making the plot more complicated.<br /><br />RRW never had a big release , thus most of it 's audience discovered it on video or on cable TV showings . Viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a TV movie but it 's bigger than that . The slick , slowly - timed direction , moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the DVD on a big HDTV.<br /><br />The only weak point of the movie I can think of is Lara Flynn Boyle 's boring femme fatale with the nasty dyke - ish hairdo . I certainly would n't fall for her but if you assume that Nic Cage 's character is in to militant lesbians then you 'll accept it nonetheless .
1 An excellent example of " cowboy noir " , as it 's been called , in which unemployed Michael ( Nicolas Cage ) loses out on a job because he insists on being honest ( he 's got a bum leg ) . With really nothing else he can do , he decides that for once he 's going to lie . When he walks into a bar , and the owner Wayne ( the late , great J.T. Walsh ) mistakes him for a hit - man whom Wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife Suzanne ( Lara Flynn Boyle in fine form ) , Michael plays along and accepts Waynes ' money . * Then * he goes to Suzanne and informs her of her husbands ' intentions , and accepts * her * money to get rid of Wayne ! If that did n't complicate things enough , the real hit - man , " Lyle from Dallas " ( Dennis Hopper , in a perfect role for him ) shows up and Michael is in even more trouble than before.<br /><br />"Red Rock West " gets a lot out of the locations . Director John Dahl , who co - wrote the script with his brother Rick , was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes . It 's also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation . It 's an appreciably dark and twist - laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt , have at least been morally compromised like Michael . The lighting by cinematographer Marc Reshovsky is superb in its moodiness ; even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing . Even if the writing is n't particularly " logical or credible " , the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in.<br /><br />Cage does a good job in the lead , but his co - stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greed - motivated characters . Hopper , Boyle , and Walsh are all fun to watch in these parts . Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor are fine as Walshs ' deputies ( in one especially good twist , Walsh is also the local sheriff ) , and there 's an entertaining cameo role for country & western star Dwight Yoakam , who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tune.<br /><br />It 's quite a good little film worth checking out . It moves forward at an impressive pace , and if nothing else is certainly never boring.<br /><br />8/10
1 From the director of movies ' Last Seduction ' and ' Kill me again ' , comes another movie in the noir style . John Dahl created a niche for himself by making movies on the themes of adultery , blackmailing in the early 90s . Though I did not have much of an opinion in regards to last seduction . But nowadays Mr Dahl has resorted to directing television shows . Its a shame since the man had talent.<br /><br />***SPOILERS * * This is quite an impressive movie which revolves around a drifter Cage ) that comes in to the town of Wyoming for a job . However he does not prove lucky and becomes mistaken for a hit - man from Texas by bar owner J.T Walsh . He is given the task to kill his wife ( Boyle ) . But Cage decides to split after taking the upfront payment without doing it . On the way out of town he accidentally hits a guy on the road , who he then takes back to the local hospital . At that point Cage coincidently meets Walsh again , who also appears to be the local sheriff . After that Cage escapes from his clutches but meets in to the real hit - man that happens to be Dennis Hopper.<br /><br />John Dahl has co - written and directed this movie . Therefore it goes to show that a project can turn out decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen . The direction is of good standard , however while watching the movie I got a made for TV movie feeling . There were too many close up frames . However this does not deter the movie from being an enjoyable experience . The movie had good pace and the structure was perfect . Dahl written the script with good duration of lenght.<br /><br />Cage portrayed the role as a drifter realistically , though to me his performance seemed somewhat restrained . His facial expressions were on the mark . Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale . Her hairstyle was far out and can make any guy go on his knees . Hopper played his part well . But I feel he was miscast for this role . He did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit - man . The role was not written keeping his personality in mind.<br /><br />While viewing one will get deja vu of previous movies like ' The Hot Spot ' and ' A Perfect Murder ' . Due to the fact that some sub plots are similar . Overall if you are a fan of noir movies , then this one is for you . Worth recommending . 7/10
1 Red Rock West is one of those tight noir thrillers we rarely see anymore . It 's well paced , well acted and does n't leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions so typical in this genre.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage stars as Michael , an unemployed Texas roughneck , desperate enough for a job to drive all the way to Wyoming for potential employment . He is honest to a fault , but always on the dark side of fate.<br /><br />After failing to obtain gainful employment , Michael stumbles into the Red Rock bar where the owner Wayne ( J.T.Walsh ) mistakes him for a contract killer he summoned from Dallas , hired to do in his lovely but lethal wife Suzanne ( Lara Flynn Boyle).<br /><br />Wayne gives Michael the necessary details and a down payment for the hit on the adulterous Suzie . With no intent on following through , Michael accepts the money and then sets out to warn Suzanne of her impending demise . He also mails a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and splits.<br /><br />As fate would dictate , Michael is not going to be rid of the situation that easy . While leaving in a violent rainstorm , he runs down Suzannes lover . Of course Michael being Michael , he takes him to the local hospital where it 's discovered that he 's also been shot.<br /><br />The sheriff is summoned and as luck would have it , Wayne is also the local law . Michael manages to escape while being taken on that last ride and is subsequently picked up by the real " Lyle from Dallas " played with murderous glee by the quirky Dennis Hopper . After discovering that they 're fellow marines , Lyle insists that Michael join him for a drink at , where else , the Red Rock bar . There Wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and Lyle are in hot pursuit of Michael who falls willingly into Suzannes waiting arms.<br /><br />As the pace picks up we learn that Wayne and Suzanne are really wanted armed robbers , on the lam for a multi million dollar theft . Getting the money now becomes the films central focus with a series of betrayals , double crosses and murders.<br /><br />The film was very well cast . Nicolas Cage was typically low key , Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye assumed their respective roles with more than ample ability . The best performance was by the late J.T. Walsh who was menacing without appearing to be . Walsh was a great character actor who left us much too soon.<br /><br />Marc Reshoskys photography utilized many unique angles which added to the suspense and plot development . The film was further enhanced by John Dahl 's tight directorial style and Morris Chestnut 's rapid fire editing .
1 A drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small Wyoming town , leading to all kinds of complications . Cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he ca n't escape the title town . Hopper does what he does best , playing a psycho known as " Lyle from Dallas , " the real hit man . Walsh as a crooked sheriff and Boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast . The script by brothers John and Rick Dahl contains delicious twists and turns , and John 's direction creates a terrific " neo noir " atmosphere . Witty and very entertaining , it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up .
1 A lovely old - fashioned thriller coming on like a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch,"Red Rock West " follows the misadventures of injured veteran unemployed oil worker Mr N.Cage as his luck turns from bad to worse after he ends up with an empty gas tank and barely enough money for a cup of coffee in a one ute town in the back of beyond . It has been established right from the start that Mr Cage might be down but he is not out , and he might be broke but he will not steal , not even in his present dire circumstances . Consequently when he is mistaken by Mr J.T. Walsh for the man he has commissioned to murder his wife , Mr Cage calls on the wife to warn her of her husband 's intentions . In turn she , in the person of Miss L.F.Boyle , offers him even more money to murder Mr Walsh . Mr Cage decides to leave whilst he is still in front but as he is driving out of town he hits a man in the road . Tempted as he might be to drive on , he takes the man to hospital , where it turns out he has been shot . Mr Cage is detained by the Deputies who call the sheriff who turns out to be Mr J.T.Walsh . Events take a further complicated turn when , escaping from custody , Mr . Cage narrowly avoids being run over by the real hit - man on his way to fulfill his commission . About now you might be forgiven for thinking " enough already",but as it happens on the screen it seems a completely logical turn of events , the narrative flow of the movie at this point seeming unstoppable . Mr D.Hopper is comfortably cast as the hired killer , like Mr Cage a USMC veteran . This little piece of serendipity keeps Mr Cage alive long enough out - think the murderous trio and survive , a little more battered but still unbowed . It is a tribute to everybody involved that what sounds on paper remarkably like a piece of nonsense is in fact a tense exceptionally well made picture with fine performances all round . " Red Rock West " is a movie - lover 's movie . Within five minutes you know you are going somewhere you 've been before on plenty of occasions , but you 'll be very happy during the trip .
1 The more I watch Nicholas Cage , the more I appreciate him as an actor . Watching this movie now ( in 2005 ) , I can see that it does n't really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s . I do n't really think it can be considered a film noir , but it is pretty dark at times , due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters.<br /><br />Typical performances from each of the three main actors , who all did a good job with their roles . I thought , however , that Hopper and Boyle 's characters were left undeveloped , as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it . Hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy . The plot is really good , and although I found some parts to be very unrealistic , there were parts where I had to hand it to the director ( i.e. when he first sees the sheriff ) . All in all , this movie is definitely worth watching . * * * 1/2
1 Dahl seems to have been under the influence of Wenders ' The American Friend . Innocent Nick Cage gets recruited for a hit . Dennis Hopper plays a real Hit Man . Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous . The Hero gets more entangled the more he tries to extricate hisself . And small town America does not seem all that safer than the Big City . Like it 's predecessor mentioned above , this movie has lots of plot twists and turns that seem improbable , but all lead to the cathartic self discovery .
1 A surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad . A great cast mixing it up with an intriguing plot overseen by a Twin Peaks - ish influence in director Dahl . Nicholas Cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrayal of a man in a bind looking for the right thing to do . J.T. Walsh ( RIP to a great actor ) is always a wonderful villain , as is Dennis Hopper . It 's such a shame he never made to a higher profile in the biz . I 'm sure he has his followers , though . In all , this is a great film that shows you that you do n't need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining film .
1 This is a ' sleeper ' . It defines Nicholas Cage . The plot is intricate and totally absorbing . The ending will blow you away.<br /><br />See it whenever you have the opportunity .
1 Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star , he was a great actor . This lesser - known movie is where Cage gives one of his best performances . " Red Rock West " was a low - budget , almost un - known film , but is one of my favorite movies of all time . I discovered it walking down the video store aisle , and wanted to see Cage and Hopper ( Who also is great in the movie ) appear together . Go get this one , and I 'm sure you wo n't be disappointed .
1 This modern film noir with its off beat humour and dizzying succession of plot twists delivers a story full of surprises , dangerous characters and excellent entertainment from start to finish . It 's impossible not to empathise with the honest , unassuming hero or to be gripped by the ways in which he tries to navigate his way out of the terrible predicaments that he finds himself in , so all you can do is fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />The story of an ordinary guy who makes a poor decision and then finds that the repercussions propel him into an uncontrollable sequence of events from which he is unable to extricate himself is pure film noir . The same is true of the themes of murder , deceit , corruption and duplicity which are pervasive throughout . Many of the familiar noir visual motifs are also present , such as the way in which cigarette smoke is lit , the rain soaked roads at night , the heavily shadowed interiors and the lines of shadow ( created by louvred doors ) across people 's faces.<br /><br />Michael Williams ( Nicolas Cage ) , an injured war veteran without money or a job , stops off at a bar in Red Rock , Wyoming and is mistaken by the proprietor Wayne Brown ( J T Walsh ) for a hit man that he 's arranged to employ to murder his wife Suzanne ( Lara Flynn Boyle ) . Michael , a naturally reticent person , does nothing to disabuse Wayne of his misapprehension , especially as he could use a job and at first does n't realise what he 'd be expected to do . After having been told what his mission is and been given a $ 5,000 advance , he goes to see Suzanne and warns her about Wayne 's plan . She does n't seem overly concerned about the danger she 's in and offers Michael double the fee Wayne had offered , for him to eliminate her husband.<br /><br />Michael decides to take the money he 'd received from both parties and leave town . His plan fails however , when he accidentally drives into a man who is standing in the middle of the road and decides to take him to hospital to receive treatment for his injuries . At the hospital , things get more complicated when it emerges that the patient is Suzanne 's lover and he has two bullets in his stomach . This leads to the local law enforcement officers getting involved and the revelation that Wayne is the Sheriff ! ! From this point on , things get even more complicated and also decidedly more dangerous especially when the real hit man , Lyle from Dallas ( Dennis Hopper ) arrives on the scene.<br /><br />"Red Rock West " has some great moments of suspense , ( an example of this is the scene in which Michael makes his escape from Wayne 's bar ) and also some great performances from its very strong cast . Nicolas Cage 's expressions are extremely natural and convincing as he reacts to a variety of situations with anxiety , surprise or uncertainty and J T Walsh is also particularly good as a deceptive character who 's always concealing more than he 's actually saying . Dennis Hopper is intensely threatening as the vicious contract killer ( a role he plays with great gusto ) and Lara Flynn Boyle looks suitably cold and calculating as the femme fatale . Dwight Yoakam also provides some good support and moments of humour in his cameo role as a no nonsense truck driver.<br /><br />Incredibly , " Red Rock West " was originally destined to be denied a general cinema release but has justifiably emerged from its modest beginnings to eventually be recognised as the great movie that it really is .
1 Like many of you I am a great fan of the real thing - the 1940s noir films - but Red Rock West was a real treat for all of us longing for the past . The term ' neo - noir ' has been so often used inappropriately in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and its impact . John Dahl 's film on the other hand , truly deserved to be described as such . The casting is perfect all around and would have felt right at home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur . The plot is so tight that you are hooked within the first fifteen minutes . James M. Cain would have appreciated it . Many contemporary films leave me wondering why they do n't make them like they used to , and I 'm not even that old . Movies such as Red Rock West give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past .
1 Red Rock West is one of those rare films that keeps you guessing the entire time as to what will happen next . Nicolas Cage is mistaken for a contract killer as he enters a small town trying to find work . Dennis Hopper is the bad guy and no one plays them better . Look for a brief appearance by country singing star Dwight Yoakam . This is a serious drama most of the time but there are some lighter moments . What matters is that you will enjoy this low budget but high quality effort !
1 One thing I always liked about Robert Ludlum thrillers is just when you think you have it figured out , it goes in a completely different direction . There are so many twists and turns in this film that I have a sore neck from watching.<br /><br />One thing I also like about director John Dahl ( Kill Me Again , Rounders , Unforgettable ) is that he can be depended upon to direct and , in this case , write ( with his brother Rick ) a good story.<br /><br />Now , add Nick Cage , Dennis Hopper , Lara Flynn Boyle , and J.T. Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will keep your interest even if they are playing characters that all of them have perfected . Dahl seems to bring out the best in folks , and this will keep you interested , and guessing , until the very end .
1 I had never heard of this film prior to seeing it , I wondered if it was an independent film , and I was correct , but with a good cast I decided to chance it . Basically drifter Michael Williams ( Nicolas Cage ) is in the town Red Rock , Wyoming , looking for a job , and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown ( Pleasantville 's J.T. Walsh ) he is given a large sum of money , mistaken for a hit - man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne ( Lara Flynn Boyle ) . He does not correct him , takes the money , and goes to warn Suzanne , and after she makes him a counteroffer , he decides he needs to leave . When Wayne knows his real identity , he chases Michael shooting a big gun , until he gets in a car with Lyle from Dallas ( Dennis Hopper ) . But things get complicated when Michael realises Lyle is the hit - man he was mistaken for , and he makes a quick retreat . He goes back to Suzanne , and knowing they are both in danger , they plan to leave town together , and add another complication by falling for each other . Before they leave however , Suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe . Of course things are n't going to go smoothly , and Wayne and Lyle catch up to them , and Lyle forces them and now tied - up Wayne to go and get the buried money . In the end , Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve , Michael and Suzanne do get on a moving train together , but it is obvious she cares more about the money , and she gets what she deserves too . Also starring Craig Reay as Jim , Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson , Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack , Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard . The performances , apart from maybe a lame Boyle , are all fine and dandy , and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller . Very good !
1 This movie is proof that film noire is an enduring style , and extremely worthy of stay alive . For me , it is he best example of film noire since Chinatown.<br /><br />It will , unfortunately , never get the recognition it deserves . It was never promoted properly when it was first released and has had to build its cadre of fans through venues like Vanguard Cinema and word of mouth rental referrals.<br /><br />I highly recommend that people looking for something more than mindless entertainment rent this movie and delved into its highly convoluted plot .
1 I just got back from a screening a couple of hours ago , and I was very happy with the movie when I left it . It 's very intense , and the closest I 've come to crying in a movie in quite some time . That is a credit to Adam Sandler , who delivers a magnificent performance on many levels , and who probably deserves an Oscar nom for it , were it not coming out so early in the year . Don Cheadle gives his usual superb performance playing the straight man to Adam 's disturbed.<br /><br />There is some humor , but most of it is really only funny in comparison to the tearjerking moments , as Adam deals with his loss and Don struggles to help him . Adam plays two levels very well ... when he is mentally stable he is funny and likable , but when he is , well , less stable he 's powerful and dark.<br /><br />I recommend it for anyone who likes intense mental dramas about difficult friendship and loss .
1 It 's not very often a movie can literally make the entire audience laugh , and five minutes later fill their eyes with tears . Many movies try to do this , but few can deliver the emotional impact that this film did . Adam Sandler practically drags you in with his heated and often violent outbursts , but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past is n't pulling him down . I 'm not going to ruin anything , but there is one scene in particular that should have your eyes watering and lip quivering . Even the most macho of men would have to be heartless bastards to not feel something while watching this movie . Don Cheadle gives another great performance , but is out - shined by Sandler . Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give solid performances , but nothing in the line of the two leading roles . Sandler 's humor is still present , which actually saved this film from being border - line depressing . There are several laughs to be had , but do n't think you will stay there long , because it gets serious again without much warning.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how well this movie hit on just about every emotion the human body contains , but I will cut this one short . I feel there is no need to tell you anything more . Do yourself a favor and take the time to see this movie . Even if you have to wait until it comes out on DVD , it 's 100 % worth the time . A deeply moving film sure to put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless of course ... you are a heartless soul .
1 This film screened last night at Austin 's Paramount theater as part of the SXSW Film Festival . We were graced with the presence of director Mike Binder and stars Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle who took audience questions after the film . It is a remarkable and powerful film about what it is like to lose yourself and begin to find your way back . The performances are phenomenal and the story manages to be both tragic and funny in a way that is all too rare . ( The trailer for the film tries a little too hard to emphasize the comedic aspects.)<br /><br />This is a breakout role for Adam Sandler . While he has begun to transition to more dramatic roles with Punch - Drunk Love and Spanglish , this role is a significant step forward for him as a dramatic actor . He deserves an Oscar nomination as he continues down to transition to more dramatic roles as Tom Hanks did and Jim Carrey is also doing . In this role , he seemed to be trying to channel Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man . Although playing an autistic man is certainly very different than Sandler 's traumatized character , both characters for different reasons are trapped in their own worlds of child - like isolation and confusion.<br /><br />Don Cheadle 's performance is less surprising , but just as good . After Hotel Rwanda and Crash , we 've come to expect remarkable nuanced performances from Cheadle . He has the qualities of sincerity and honesty that comes through in this role . But he , too , is also broken and struggling if not in the such profound ways as Sandler 's character . Cheadle is struggling with difficulties in both his marriage and in his professional life as a dentist . Together the characters played by Cheadle and Sandler struggle to heal each other in the way that true friends often do ( in a way that reminds me of Matt Damon and Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting ) . They are both searching for that part of the themselves that they have lost and trying to find again.<br /><br />Reign over Me is one of the best major studio films to be released this year . The soundtrack , which is almost another character in the plot is wonderful . The filming in the streets of New York - a city that suffered a great tragedy and has also had to heal itself - is also quite beautiful . The supporting roles by Jada Pinkett Smith , Liv Tyler , Saffron Burrows ( in a very odd role ) , Donald Sutherland , and Mike Binder himself are all quite good.<br /><br />Writer / Director Mike Binder has really delivered a story that so many will be able to connect with on numerous levels . This is a story about grief , family , healing , male friendship , mental health , and the meaning of love . Reign over Me does not disappoint . The film is almost hypnotic as it draws you into the lives of its characters . Hollywood would have a much better reputation if it made more character - driven charming films like Reign over Me .
1 I saw this at a screening last night too . I was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what I expected . Not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion.<br /><br />I wo n't bother rehashing the plot too much because I think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better . But I will say that Adam Sandler 's performance was really refreshing and real . He was funny , and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies . Don Cheadle was believable as always.<br /><br />This movie is n't funny like Borat or Billy Madison but it has a good pace about it . I 'd say 90 % of the audience laughed for most of the film . Midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together.<br /><br />I also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friend / white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves .
1 Love hurts . That , I think , is the main message Mike Binder 's newest film Reign Over Me brings across . Whether that love has caused your relationship to become stagnant , or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years , or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world , love hurts . The great thing about this film , however , is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past heartbreaks go , but in the eventual restart of new bonds for the future . No one in this drama is perfect ; they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they ca n't free themselves from alone . There is some heavy subject material here and I credit Binder for never making the story turn into a political diatribe , but instead infusing the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay character - based and small in scale compared to the epic event that looms overhead . What could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how 9 - 11 effected us all , ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret.<br /><br />This is a new career performance for Adam Sandler . I like to think that my favorite director Paul Thomas Anderson was the first to see the childish , pent - up anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically . The juvenility of a character like Billy Madison allows for laughs and potty humor , but also can be used to show a repressed man , shy and shutout to the world around hima man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell . Anderson let Sandler do just that in his masterpiece Punch - Drunk Love and Mike Binder has taken it one step further . Sandler plays former dentist Charlie Fineman whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the World Trade Center on 9 - 11 . That one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result , he became reclusive and started to believe he could n't remember anything that happened before that day . He really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the charade in his head while those around him , those that love him , try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds . Always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his perished family , he goes through life with his iPod and headphones , shutting out everything so as not to be tempted remember.<br /><br />Reign Over Me is not about Charlie Fineman though , it is about dentist and family man Alan Johnson . A man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have stagnated into monotony , Johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate Charlie does . Played perfectly by the always brilliant Don Cheadle , Johnson has lost his backbone to try and change his life . He has no friends and when he sees Charlie , by chance , one day , his life evolves into something he has n't felt in 15 years . He revels in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family . Cheadle 's character wants to revert back to the college days of hanging out and Sandler 's does n't mind because all that was before he met his wife . The two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of solitude that used to rule their lives . Once they begin opening up though , it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the façade they have created for themselves.<br /><br />The supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads . Jada Pinkett Smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely , but it is her final scene on the phone with Cheadle that really showed me something different and true . Liv Tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist , but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the miscasting , perfect casting . The many small cameos are also effective , even writer / director Mike Binder 's role as Sandler 's old best friend and accountant , ( my only gripe here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere , considering it is his film ) . Last but not least is the beautiful Saffron Burrows . She is a great actress and plays the love- crushed divorcée trying to put her life back together wonderfully . A role that seems comic relief at first , but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to come.<br /><br />Binder has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies I have seen in a long time . The direction is almost flawless , ( the blurring between cuts and characters in the fore/ background really annoyed me in the beginning ) , the acting superb , and the story true to itself , never taking the easy way out or wrapping itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion . Even the music was fantastic and used to enhance , not to lead us emotionally , ( why after two great uses of the titular song by The Who did Binder feel the need to use the inferior Eddie Veddar remake for the end , I do n't know , but it did unfortunately stick out for me ) . Reign Over Me is a film about love and how although it can cause the worst pain imaginable , it can also save us from regret and allow us to once again see the world as a place of beauty and hope .
1 This Movie was amazing , it is the kind of movie where you watch it and rather than look at other movies by actor you look at other movies by director/ writer . Sandler did a good job working a character outside of his comfort zone and the always good Cheadle did a great job too . This movie is great for a mature intelligent audience . The acting was fantastic and can only be surpassed by the Writing and directing of the film . This film focuses on the real Americans , the past generation , no stereotypes or Racism just people who have come together and realized the true meaning of life . This film is about loss and coping . Instead of picking on Psychiatry , it defines it , not as someone who heals you magically , but rather through the necessity of talking out your feeling to an impartial someone you can trust will not judge you , but rather will guide you though your thoughts . This movie is all round amazing !
1 Greetings again from the darkness . How rare it is for a film to examine the lost soul of men in pain . Adam Sandler stars as Charlie , a man who lost his family in the 9/11 tragedy , and has since lost his career , his reason to live and arguably , his sanity . Don Cheadle co - stars as Sandler 's former Dental School roommate who appears to have the perfect life ( that Sandler apparently had prior to 9/11).<br /><br />Of course the parallels in these men 's lives are obvious , but it is actually refreshing to see men 's feelings on display in a movie ... feelings other than lust and revenge , that is . Watching how they actually help each other by just being there is painful and heartfelt . Writer / Director Mike Binder ( " The Upside of Anger " , and Sandler 's accountant in this film ) really brings a different look and feel to the film . Some of the scenes do n't work as well as others , but overall it is well written and solidly directed.<br /><br />Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent . Sandler 's character reminds a bit of his fine performance in " Punch Drunk Love " , but here he brings much more depth . Cheadle is always fine and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries ... just by watching him work a jigsaw puzzle.<br /><br />Support work is excellent by Jada Pinkett Smith ( as Cheadle 's wife ) , Liv Tyler ( as a very patient psychiatrist ) , Saffron Burrows ( in an oddly appealing role ) , Donald Sutherland as an irritated judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler 's in - laws.<br /><br />The film really touches on how the tragic events of that day affected one man so deeply that he is basically ruined . In addition to the interesting story and some great shots of NYC , you have to love any film that features vocals from Chrissy Hynde , Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder impersonating Daltrey . Not exactly a chipper upbeat film , but it is a quality film with an unusual story .
1 Reign Over Me ( titled after the who song ) is a movie that is sure to bring a tear to almost everyone 's eye . It was a moving story of a guy ( sandler ) that lost his family in the 9 - 11 world trade center attacks . Years later , he runs into an old college roommate ( cheadle ) that he does n't even recognize due to the post - dramatic stress ensued by the loss of his family . The two rekindle their old friendship and Cheadle 's character , Johnson , realizes that he must get Sandler 's character , Fineman , some help before it 's too late.<br /><br />This was the first movie that has made me cry in a long time . It 's completely worth watching and after seeing it , I 'm positive the viewer will appreciate his or her family much more .
1 Let me start by saying at the young age of 34 I was suddenly widowed . I was devastated as he was NOT sick--- he died unexpectedly basically of a coronary--- his carotids blew out-- he died behind our house . There was a lot of speculation from police , cause he fell on something and it bashed his head in . I was a suspect for murder until the autopsy came back . < br /><br />My children were as traumatized as I was , so in love with a good father figure as he . I had three small children , no education , no financial support . I took it very , very hard . < br /><br />Within two years my in - laws attacked me verbally , physically , emotionally and spiritually demanding I grieve not in front of the children , and put on masks and showed people what they wanted to see , not show them my pain during holidays ... Nobody stood up for me and my choice to sit out one holiday , except of course , the grief therapist I was seeing that had advised me to follow my heart and soul . My in - laws did n't get it ! It changed FOREVER my relationship with them , and I have never been back for a holiday . This is only one example of how my grief was disrespected ! My own ( new ) husband has seen me fall apart talking about the trauma when I shared from my soul . I collapse , can not breathe , hyperventilate , and generally am defunct for a few days if I even try to convey the hidden pain . < br /><br />Now about this movie ... <br /><br />Today , my soul was stirred , my heart broken . My fears and pain re - surfaced from the real demons this movie presents ; how one grieves compared to how others expect us too and the demons within . Adam Sandler portrayed perfectly the horrendous agony you face , overcome and most of all , work through on your own time ! This movie dredged up all the pain that I have tried over the years to deal with . You see , when something harms your soul so profoundly , so deep that utterances are all that come from your mouth in moments of thinking , you can not deal with it without wishing you were dead and walking through life , in a dead state . < br /><br />The bible has a scripture , Romans 8:26 that I have clung to , that when my mouth and soul know not what to pray for , that God 's Holy Spirit carries that agony to the feet of God-- I need not speak . Sandler portrayed that to perfection ! < br /><br />There is a scene where he has been hauled into a court hearing , for mental health commitment purposes , and he goes back in to face his in - laws--- ( familiar to me)--- and he tells them the stunning truths that he has been possessed by , per Se , that he ca n't get over . It 's a profoundly strong , and mighty performance . I started bawling and had a hard time after wards getting up to walk out from the theater feeling my legs too weak to do so . My son was with me and saw it first hand , my precise motions while trying to hold it all together ; a lesson for him , my youngest who barely remembers his daddy . It 's been 13 years for me but this movie brought me back to the moment of losing my in - laws forever when they demanded a mask on my emotions and my surrendering to their desires , instead of respect to my own . < br /><br />I write this , so that if you are a griever , you are prepared for this movie , but recommend it highly in the 1000 star performance Sandler gave . < br /><br />If you are not yet a griever , please take a lesson from his movie and just listen and accept people 's choices in their grief , letting them find peace in their own time ! Sometimes , the soul can not utter the words to convey our pain . < br /><br />Go see this movie with tissues and not without preparing to take it in ... to your soul !
1 The feel of this movie was amazing . Adam Sandler 's performance was very inspiring . As he played a very rattled and fragile character , he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role . His character was really interesting . I can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as Sandler made me . For someone who plays primarily comedy roles , he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and input . I especially loved the scene in which Adam and Don 's characters rode the motorized scooter around the city . I familiarized with the moment , because it seemed like Don was witnessing one thing Adam does to get away from it all . With his video games , music , and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past , riding his scooter with his headphones on seemed like an escape from his thoughts . This movie is definitely worth the watch .
1 Reign Over Me is a success due to the powerful work by Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle . While comedic actors going dramatic has been seen as somewhat of a distraction , Sandler is no stranger to playing more serious roles . Most of the characters he portrays have an unstable temperament and a vulnerability that can burst at any moment . He might even be typecast for characters with such hidden anger problems . However , this performance has some considerable dramatic weight , unlike his roles in less comedic fare like Punch - Drunk Love and Spanglish.<br /><br />In the film , Alan Johnson ( Cheadle ) runs into his old college roommate , Charlie Finerman ( Sandler ) , whom he has n't seen in several years . Five years before , Charlie suffered the overwhelming loss of his wife and three daughters in a plane crash . Charlie barely even recognizes Cheadle 's character due to the repression of his memories and consequent reclusive childish lifestyle since the accident . It is n't until Alan persists in engaging him in conversation that Charlie remembers who he is . Their renewed relationship that follows will allow Finerman to have a friend who does n't speak about his loss , eventually enabling him to confront the thoughts and feelings he has suppressed on his own terms.<br /><br />Though writer - director Mike Binder does n't show much sense of an individual style and some of his shots and transitions are a bit awkward , he does have a knack of getting decent to great performances from his actors while being a talented and funny writer . He shot this film with a digital camera , as more and more filmmakers are doing today , enabling the crew to shoot the night scenes with limited lighting . This kept the colorful backgrounds of New York City in focus , but resulted in creating frequent digital grain , which resembles blue specks scattered and moving on the screen.<br /><br />Almost every main character in Reign Over Me gives a great performance . Jada - Pinkett Smith and especially Liv Tyler are memorable in their respective roles as a frustrated wife to Cheadle 's character and a psychiatrist . However , it is Sandler and Cheadle that give some of their finest work to date . They completely owned this movie . Sandler actually plays a character that does n't outwardly resemble or act like himself at all , partially credited to his Bob Dylan - esquire wig . Though Cheadle 's character has more screen time than Sandler , they both should be considered to be leading roles , as they equally support and help each other throughout the film.<br /><br />Music also plays a great part in this film , especially the title song " Reign Over Me , " or " Love , Reign O'er Me " by The Who , and later covered by Pearl Jam . In one of the most powerful moments of the film , Binder shows Sandler using music to shut out his feelings and memories , but this particular song provokes such intense emotion that rather than diminishing his anger , it incites his emotions . All an all , Reign Over Me is an enjoyable , sad , yet many times funny film , driven by its amazing leading performances .
1 In New York , the family man dentist Alan Johnson ( Don Cheadle ) meets his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman ( Adam Sandler ) by chance on the street . Charlie became a lonely and deranged man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic September 11th while Alan has problems to discuss his innermost feelings with his wife . Alan reties his friendship with Charlie and they become close to each other . Alan tries to fix Charlie 's life , sending him to the psychologist Angela Oakhurst ( Liv Tyler ) , but Charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is send to court.<br /><br />"Reign Over Me " is a good drama about loss , friendship , family and loneliness . The September 11th is irrelevant to the plot ; it could be a car accident , a fire or any other tragedy , as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar , played by the gorgeous Saffron Burrows , to Alan . But the family drama works , supported by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle . Liv Tyler is quite impossible to be recognized , I do not know whether she is using excessive make - up to look older , but her face is weird . My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Reine Sobre Mim " ( " Reign Over Me " )
1 There may be spoilers!<br /><br />Charlie Fineman ( Adam Sandler ) , who lost his family in a tragedy , ( the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 ) , still grieves over their deaths . He runs into his former college roommate , Alan Johnson ( Don Cheadle ) , and the two rekindle their friendship . Alan vows to help his old friend come to terms with the terrible loss . This is a simplification of the basic story of Reign Over Me . < br /><br />This movie is , however , a story of how fate intercedes in our lives when we ourselves may be powerless do any thing about our own states of being . Alan is stuck in a life that he knows is no longer fulfilling . He feels friendless and out of touch with his own reality . He is unable to communicate with his wife and his associates at work . He ca n't express his feelings and as a result feels lost and distant from his own world . He chances upon Charlie on the streets of Manhattan while driving from his job . Eventually he meets and discovers that Charlie , ( who originally does not remember Alan ) , is living in a false reality of his own . Charlie has gone back to a time in his life when he had no family . He lives as if he were still a student playing in a rock band , collecting vinyl records of the 60s and 70s bands , and playing video games . He has escaped to a better and safer time in his life where there are no bad guys and he has a lot less to lose . Everyone in this movie is affected in some way by the tragedy that has affected Charlie and his remission to a formerly different and better ( ? ) place . His landlady is his protector and great enabler . His in - laws are subtracted from his life because they would take him back to the reality that his family is now gone from his life . And Alan is most affected by him because Alan wants to , ( in at first a selfish desire to escape from his own reality ) to be with Charlie as a means to subtract himself from his own stifled reality and then he wants to find a way to help Charlie begin to recover from his self - induced guilt and denial of loss . It is through this relationship that not only is Charlie able to begin to heal himself but that Alan , in fact , learns to communicate and sate his true desires with his associates at work and , eventually , is able to admit to his wife he has not been able to communicate his real feelings to her but that he strongly wants to because he does love her . It is in fact a poignant moment in the film when the stuff has hit the fan and Charlie is being confronted with the reality of being put away that he and Alan are talking about the situation together over " Chinese " that Charlie states that he is in fact worried about Alan and not himself . < br /><br />This movie will , if you let it , take you through a river of emotions and leave you thinking . It will have you laughing at how Charlie uses his words , like people really do in everyday life , to make a comical statement of fact about a real situation . It will leave you on the verge of tears , ( in my case actual tears ) , when Charlie confronts his grief and begins to come to grips with his tremendous loss . And that in fact the tragic reality is his guilt and loss has really never left him and he dealt with it in the only way he knew : denial . It will make you curse at the cold , unthinking actions of a young prosecutor trying to win his " case " , ( as I actually did at Charlie 's hearing ! ) And it will make you smile at the commonsense of a old and wise , stern judge , ( Donald Sutherland who is great at his short distinct role and gives the best performance of a wise , stern person in the legal profession since Wilford Brimley played an Assistant Attorney General in Absence of Malice.)<br /><br />This movie was also amazing to me for a few other reasons : ( 1 ) I never looked at my watch once during the showing of the film . Which means it had me from the beginning to the end , ( 2 ) Although the cast was interracial , this fact was not important to the playing out of the roles of the characters in the film . Race was a non - factor to the performance of the roles in this movie . Amazing people can actually interact with out this fact being brought out ! and ( 3 ) the only real reference to 9/11 is when Charlie 's financial attorney refers to the tragedy of Charlie 's loss as "  what Charlie had become on 9/12 " . Time will be the true test of how this movie will stand out in the future but if the purpose of a movie is not to just entertain but to make one think and have that movie stay with you long after you leave the theatre then Reign Over Me succeeded phenomenally as far as I am concerned . I have not yet forgotten this wonderful thought provoking film and I will wait impatiently for the day I can purchase it as a DVD .
1 Time and time again , it seems that the comedic actors of Hollywood are surprising me with their talents as dramatic performers : first it was Robin Williams { ' One Hour Photo ( 2002 ) ' } , then it was Jim Carrey { ' Eternal Sunshine   ( 2004 ) ' being one example } , then Will Ferrell { ' Stranger than Fiction ( 2006 ) ' } and now Adam Sandler . Yes , that 's absolutely right : the guy who has based an entire career on making brainless , goofball comedies { I 'm not complaining ; I 've always been a fan } has finally given me a performance of which he can be proud . Of course , some readers may be wondering whatever happened to ' Punch - Drunk Love ( 2002 ) , ' but I can only assure you that it 's a film I 'm currently taking measures to see as soon as possible , since I 've heard it 's terrific . My first film from director Mike Binder , ' Reign Over Me , ' is an intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship . Though it does occasionally stray into all - too - familiar territory , the somewhat predictable storyline proves surprisingly deep and moving , with both Sandler and Don Cheadle giving memorable performances.<br /><br />Alan Johnson ( Cheadle ) is a successful dentist with a good family , though he finds himself unable to communicate adequately with his wife ( Jada Pinkett Smith ) and so his marriage is a little shaky . Charlie Fineman ( Adam Sandler ) is Alan 's ex - college roommate , a man who lost his entire family in the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and who is still confronting his overwhelming feelings of grief . A disheveled figure with messy hair and downcast eyes { often likened in appearance to Bob Dylan } , Charlie has abandoned his career in dentistry , and spends his time in solitude : listening to music with headphones that cut out all sound from the outside world , driving around Manhattan in his motorised scooter , immersing himself in fantastical video games and repeatedly redecorating his apartment kitchen in accordance with his deceased wife 's final wishes . When Alan and Charlie meet for the first time in years , the latter does n't even recognise an old friend , having completely abandoned any memories prior to his life - crippling experience . Indeed , at first he does n't even acknowledge the existence of his family , and abruptly loses his temper whenever anybody suggests that he seek counselling.<br /><br />Initially , it may seem a bit exploitative for the filmmakers to be using the September 11 attacks as a storytelling device . Afterall , would n't it be just as devastating if Charlie 's family had died in an ordinary , everyday car accident ? However , if you consider that the director 's intention was to demonstrate the enormous pain caused to ordinary citizens by the tragedy , then ' Reign Over Me ' does a very good job . It 's easy to get so caught up in meaningless statistics that you neglect the emotional costs of the terrorist attacks ; this is the first 9/11-orientated film I 've seen that truly dealt with the suffering of those who were n't even involved , whose only anguish was caused through losing those whom they loved . Adam Sandler shows surprising range in a difficult role , one which would have crumbled to pieces had he not been up to the task . Snapping instantly between cheerfulness , anger and depression , Charlie Fineman is a man with whom we can deeply sympathise , a hollow soul who , thanks to the companionship of an old friend , can finally glimpse light at the end of a dark , bleak tunnel .
1 As someone who has never condescended Adam Sandler in terms of talent , as is done to him and many comic actors like him , I walked in to Reign Over Me expecting a great film , not simply because of his presence in the movie but because I thought that it looked very good overall . Even someone who already thought that Sandler could deliver an effective dramatic performance is writing here that I was surprised at how fantastic he is in it . He will make you weep , especially in his purposefully sudden and unexpected monologue . What 's amazing about his role is that it 's a character it 's hard to say we 've seen before . We 've seen many emotionally scarred characters , many mentally retarded people , many loners , many passionate self - centered artists , but Sandler 's Charlie Fineman is none of these . He may have a taste of each of them in some ways , but his character is truly unpredictable and completely individual . It 's a joy for the audience to be drawn in emotionally by him and be tugged every which way by someone whose problems , mindset , and provocations are completely different from most characters like him.<br /><br />Don Cheadle delivers an interesting performance on a completely different level . He is every man . He is the most normal possible person in the world , so much so that you will hardly find many characters like his either , or at least any that are played the way he plays Alan Johnson , whose name is even found on the assembly line . Cheadle is brilliant in that he is funny , jolting , smart , and stupid the way so many normal people are.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is populated by actors and actresses who 've hardly done anything in awhile in smaller but quite colorful roles . Jada Pinkett - Smith is the overly refined upper middle class wife , Donald Sutherland is the impatient but surprising judge , Robert Klein is Sandler 's desensitized father - in - law.<br /><br />Mike Binder 's script is quite brilliant because it says something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all of its guises . It 's much more subtle than , say , Babel , and has a much more close - to - home ideal.<br /><br />The camera is only interested in the reality of its images as opposed to the mere style . This film struck me as sort of a sendback to the kitchen - sink style of the 1970s . Cinematography was grainy and unfastened , but that was its charm . It was n't about attracting us to the camera itself and the gloss that would 've diluted its stories with such.<br /><br />The music , which plays a major role in the film , and its title , is very powerful . Near the beginning , you feel like you 're in for another About Schmidt or Little Miss Sunshine sort of soundtrack , but you soon realize you 're in for more than that . In fact , the film is packed with lots of music that stimulates a lot of the most emotional scenes.<br /><br />Reign Over Me is a major statement not only for society but also for film itself . It goes to show that even the director of Blankman is capable of wonders .
1 REIGN OVER ME ( 2007 ) * * * Adam Sandler , Don Cheadle , Jada Pinkett - Smith , Liv Tyler , Saffron Burrows , Donald Sutherland , Robert Klein , Melinda Dillon , Mike Binder , Jonathan Banks , Rae Allen , Paula Newsome . At times affecting and at times middling dramedy about a thoroughly depressed man who lost his family on 9/11 ( Sandler in his best role since " Punch - Drunk Love " ) who winds up re - united with his old college roommate and friend ( Cheadle continuing to do impressive work with every role to date ) , a well - to - do dentist who seems to have it all  family , wealth , happiness  but really sees an ally in freedom with his troubled friend 's own personal life offerings . Written and directed by Binder ( who co - stars as Sandler 's former - best friend and acting accountant ) with equal parts humor and genuine heartache the film works best when the two stars share the screen until the last act falls into an almost movie - of - the - week treacle with to tidy a solution to the matters at hand .
1 Most people , especially young people , may not understand this film . It looks like a story of loss , when it is actually a story about being alone . Some people may never feel loneliness at this level.<br /><br />Cheadles character Johnson reflected the total opposite of Sandlers character Fineman . Where Johnson felt trapped by his blessings , Fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective . Jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and Sandler pulls tears . Cheadle had the comic role and was a great supporter for Sandler.<br /><br />I see Oscars somewhere here . A very fine film . If you have ever lost and felt alone , this film will assure you that you 're not alone.<br /><br />Jerry
1 On September 11th , 2001 , millions were killed ; but 2,819 lives ended in an especially gruesome manner . They were the victim of a plane hijacking by extremists whose sole mission was to destroy buildings , but more importantly , people . This film takes an in - depth look at four people whose lives were cut short by this disastrous event and one man whose life was shattered by the loss of their lives.<br /><br />Charlie Fineman ( played by Adam Sandler ) , a former dentist living in New York , loses his wife and three children on September 11th as they were on their way to Los Angeles . Emotionally annihilated by the events , he eventually loses touch with everyone who reminds him of his former life ; including his in - laws and his best friend ( played , respectively , by Robert Klein , Melinda Dillon , and Mike Bender ) . He goes into completely denial and does his best to forget about his former life . This continues until he runs into his old college friend Alan Johnson ( played by Don Cheadle ) who Fineman does n't seem to remember . The two begin to catch up , but Fineman believes Johnson was sent by people from his former life to persuade him into finding help . Slowly , but surely , Fineman regains his trust for Johnson.<br /><br />While all this is happening , Alan Johnson 's life is going down the wrong path . He is a self man ( dentist ) who helps start a dental practice . One day , a patient of his named Donna Remar ( played by Saffron Burrows ) attempts to make a move on him , telling him that she would like to perform oral sex for him . This is an unwelcome surprise to Dr. Johnson since he is a married man with two children . As he is coming home from work on a particular workday , he sees his old friend ( Fineman ) and tries to flag him down . He is unsuccessful , but he gets another opportunity and persuades Fineman to get a come of coffee with him to catch up , despite the fact that Fineman does n't know who he is.<br /><br />One of the most interesting things about this movie is its use of music as a motif . One of Fineman 's physiological crutches is music , particularly Springsteen and other classic rock artists . When Fineman is asked to open up about his past or to talk about things he finds unpleasant , he puts on his earphones and drowns out the world with things his music.<br /><br />When the film was over , I had me thinking : how would I cope with the loss of my family ? How would I deal with such a tragic events . It 's something we do n't really think about too often . We always think they 'll be there and we often take them for granted , whether we intend to or not . We usually realize how important they are when it 's too late ; and a blow like that can destroy someone physically , emotionally , and physiologically . I really do n't know how I would be able to deal with something like that . Would I face the problem head on , cope , and move on with my life or would I just put my headphones on and block the world ?
1 let me say that i love Adam Sandler , watching reign over me i was paying close attention to his acting < br /><br />when he raises his voice , i ca nt help but think of happy gilmore yelling at a golf ball , then i snap back as Adam Sandler sucks me in < br /><br />Reign over Me is a great film , a film that comes off slow at first with you expecting emotion in every scene < br /><br />Don Cheadle always does a great job and is no exception here with some truly great lines and is worthy of an Oscar in any movie he does < br /><br />adam sandler was amazing in so many ways not only was this his most dramatic / best acted film of his career . but i can recall laughing out loud at many parts of this film < br /><br />The supporting cast was great also with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith < br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie its got tremendous acting beautiful shots of NYC great comedy great drama And a new found respect for Adam sandler if you ever doubted him or a reassurance at how great Don Cheadle is
1 I did n't really go into " Reign Over Me " knowing exactly what to expect either from the director or the story . The plot was easy enough to understand , I suppose . This guy 's whole family died in 9/11 , and he shuts the world out of his life . Alright . I did n't know if it was going to use the attachment of terrorism as a platform to speak on that or other issues relating to it , and it really does n't on a very obvious level , so if you 're scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours , I would n't worry about it . I think the writing even made a point never to explicitly mention " September the eleventh".<br /><br />Overall , I was impressed . It was a very moving picture . The movie has a sense of humor , and it is very sharp , but it is definitely a drama where it counts . I typically do n't like to think that comedic actors are incapable of actually acting , but sometimes , let 's be honest , they are . Adam Sandler is definitely capable of it ( and though I think so , you may disagree , Jim Carrey is also very well - rounded .. sometimes ) . Sandler 's portrayal of Charlie Fineman took a character that on the surface seems completely unreal and makes it become absolutely believable . I read many reviews that criticized the writing of Alan Johnson 's ( Don Cheadle in another excellent role , if not one that seems similar to a few of his more recent pictures)wife , who is played well by Jada Pinkett Smith , calling her static and dull , but that is completely untrue.<br /><br />She has depth , but some of it gets hidden behind the main story , which does drift in and out of focus occasionally . ( Which also brings to mind some very unusual transitions done early in the movie , with a weird " Make everything out of focus " fadeout . After about the first 40 minutes , they are n't used anymore . Maybe it 's significant for the characters outlook , artistically , or maybe they just realized how irritating it was . ) The film gradually begins to reveal to us the point ( one of several , but definitely the most explicit ) of the story , which is that sometimes people have to deal with grief in their own way . Maybe it seems unorthodox to us , maybe it seems downright unhealthy , but maybe what some people want more than anything is just to forget . To just exist . The films soundtrack was excellent , and it used music to pursue and amplify moods , rather than establish them , which gives credit to the actors and the writers.<br /><br />The movie takes it 's name from the song " Love , Reign O'er Me " , off of The Who 's rock opera , Quadrophenia . The song itself is fairly insignificant to the actual story , but it is used powerfully in the movie over the course of the climax , and at the very end . The movie is paced well , and does not feel like it 's dragging anywhere in it 's length , which is a little over 2 hours . If you can accept Adam Sandler 's portrayal of this deeply heartbroken and broken down man , you will enjoy the movie . You will become entangled in the story , and you will genuinely feel for the characters in every minute of it . It is not the best movie of the year , and there 's nothing groundbreaking or positively amazing in it , but it 's a very enjoyable , watchable movie , all in all .
1 What we 've got here is a Situation . A man is found to be in distress and people want to help him -- in contrasting ways . At the end they are forced to let it go . You ca n't fix people . And though in various aspects Reign Over Me is conventionally Hollywood , that message isn't.<br /><br />This story is not about Charlie Fineman ( Adam Sandler ) , a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9/11 plane who 's gone into a nearly psychotic state of PTSS since . It 's about what meeting Charlie does to Alan Johnson ( Don Cheadle ) , a dentist in New York who was his roommate in dental school and , knowing about his tragedy , spots him on the street and reconnects . Charlie is riding around on a little toy motorized scooter -- a pretty fanciful contraption for negotiating Manhattan traffic -- with big headphones on over a mass of unruly hair . The hair is Sandler 's chief prop to show he 's deranged . And the use of music as an escape must hit home to every iPod - wielding subway rider.<br /><br />Charlie is a disaster , but paradoxically Alan , stuck with a controlling wife ( Jada Pinkett Smith ) , soon begins to envy him . Charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund ( insurance money from the tragedy ) , and starts dragging Alan off to " hang out , " " eat Chinese , " buy records , or watch a Mel Brooks marathon at a rep house . Charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a mean landlady , redoing the kitchen over and over , collecting old vinyl of Springsteen , the Who , etc . , and playing a video game called Shadow of the Collosus on a giant screen in a big empty living room.<br /><br />Charlie 's in - laws are deeply concerned about him , but also somehow resentful , as we learn later . Alan has a new patient who is propositioning him . Charlie 's desperation makes us see Alan 's . Trying to help Charlie partly permits Alan to escape from his own stifling realities but partly just makes him more acutely aware of them.<br /><br />Cheadle and Sandler make an odd couple , but that does n't matter , because it 's convincing that they might both need each other . Charlie is desperate for the companionship of a friend who never knew his family , because to escape his loss , he is pretending he never had one . And so what if as a roommate Charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste ( no Motown ) ? Alan wants an escape from his tidy , emasculating life . He 's under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners , who lord it over him though it 's he who set up the practice . They 're white , by the way , and he 's black.<br /><br />There 's also the lascivious patient from hell , who seriously disrupts things at the dental offices , but starts looking different when Charlie comes by and notices she 's a babe . His libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute . He 's also drawn to the breasts of Liv Tyler , a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who starts trying to treat Charlie when he admits he might need help.<br /><br />Sandler 's mad scenes are a little too theatrical , as are a lot of the plot devices ( in fact this movie feels like a play at more than one point ) , but he has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in ways that are deeply touching.<br /><br />Charlie 's not just delusional and sad , but dangerous and violent , and all these efforts to help him start to backfire . The movie is admirable in the way it conveys a sense that people ca n't be made right . This is an interesting movie -- sometimes a touching one -- and it 's the first time 9/11 has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering . But there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times , many of the people are too broadly drawn , and the overly grand Hollywood interiors have dreadful décor ; only the Manhattan streets look real . There 's a courtroom scene that is preposterous , and Donald Sutherland is a judge who 's too good to be true . Alan 's family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call . And yet this is worth watching for the acting -- the control and subtlety of Cheadle , and Sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in P.T. Anderson 's 2002 Punch - Drunk Love , though that 's clearly a better movie , in fact a much better one .
1 Most who go to this movie will have an idea what it is about ; A man loses his entire family and even his dog in a flight from Boston that fateful morning of September 11 , 2001 . What you probably wo n't know before seeing this film is this : How that would feel ; What do you do with that ; and how would that affect you and the way you relate to every waking day ? The story unfolds painfully slow from the gate and then warms up nicely as it gains a little speed while the recently renewed relationship between dentist Alan Johnson , ( Don Cheadle ) and ex - college roommate Charlie Fineman , ( Adam Sandler ) solidifies and begins to take shape . Characters appear in this film whose presence initially seem obligatory and not well developed but in fact , stay with this story , and you find that the simplicity of each character is what makes this story believable - and accurate . Real people inhabit a real situation whereby they can do little but stand aside while one amongst them disintegrates . The pain inside Charlie 's soul is subtly evident from first introduction and grows as we learn more about his character brilliantly revealed by Sandler , as layers of an onion  one layer at a time with lightness and weight combined . It 's so subtle a performance that he sneaks up on you and gets inside your head while you are watching him on screen . Cheadle 's Alan Johnson is equally subtle and very Don Cheadle . Always watchable , the ease that 's apparent when Cheadle 's on screen speaks to his consummate acting skills . Alan 's relationship with Charlie Fineman is delicate in texture , just as the situation would demand . Fineman does n't want friendship , nor anybody intruding into his cloistered life and yet , the likable quality that Alan owns is simple and honest enough to intrigue even a recluse like Charlie . It is Alan who has the task of gingerly opening up Charlie 's carefully sealed life . There is inherent danger in the process . The more Alan nudges Charlie to open up , going so far as engaging the services of friend and psychologist Angela Oakhurst , ( Liv Tyler ) the nearer the danger of pushing Charlie over the edge . It 's an abyss that Charlie teeters on each and every waking moment and one he has learned to navigate through sheer dint of denial . He has denied everything that priorly existed for him in order to exist with his loss . Unfortunately , his grief is one thing he can not deny . Sandler withdraws so deeply into his character 's pain during the story 's unfolding that , by the time he meets his demons head - on , the viewer shares his pain almost equally . Alan stands beside Charlie throughout this exacting process at the risk of lousing up his own perfect home - life - run with admirable grace and efficiency by wife Janeane . ( Jada Pinkett Smith ) While tending to Charlie 's recovery , Alan looks inward and recognizes his own silent screams at the death of the independence he once owned and the boy he has lost becoming a man . His reward for helping Charlie is helping himself reconnect with what he has lost . The theme is much like The Fisher King ; another story of a man who isolates himself to the point of madness from sorrow and loss . Like The Fisher King , the story concludes with the traditional , there is someone for everyone theme . Reign Over Me 's Lidia Sinclair , ( played by the wonderful Amanda Plummer in The Fisher King ) is Donna Remar , ( Saffron Burrows ) a woman on the verge of breakdown and sketchy patient of Johnson 's , who turns out to be the just unstable enough to complement Charlie 's borderline insanity . It 's a good ending to the story , but the one element probably least likely to ring true . Then again , maybe there really is someone for everyone . Devorah Macdonald Vancouver , BC
1 If you did n't enjoy this movie , either your dead , or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle.<br /><br />An Excellent cast , all of who gave good performances . This movie proved that Adam Sandler is good actor , despite what critics say . Adam Sandler is becoming a very well respected actor . It all started with his performance in Big Daddy , then he did a couple bad movies , then he broke through with terrific performance in 50 First Dates , The Longest Yard , then Click , and now Reign Over Me.<br /><br />Back to the movie . Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything . The closest thing to family he has are a mother - in - law and father - in - law . After his old college roommate ( Cheadle ) ran into him , he seems to turn his life around . I will say no more , because I do not want to ruin the movie , but I strongly recommend this movie . One of the best movies of 2007 .
1 Alan Johnson ( Don Cheadle ) is a successful dentist , who shares his practice with other business partners . Alan also has an loving wife ( Jada Pinkett Smith ) and he has two daughter ( Camille LaChe Smith & Imani Hakim ) . He also let his parents stay in his huge apartment in New York City . But somehow , he feels that his life is somewhat empty . One ordinary day in the city , he sees his old college roommate Charlie Fireman ( Adam Sandler ) . Which Alan has n't seen Charlie in years . When Alan tries to befriends with Charlie again . Charlie is a lonely depressed man , who hides his true feelings from people who cares for him . Since Charlie unexpectedly loses his family in a plane crash , they were on one of the planes of September 11 , 2001 . When Alan nearly feels comfortable with Charlie . When Alan mentions things of his past , Charlie turns violent towards Alan or anyone who mentions his deceased family . Now Alan tries to help Charlie and tries to make his life a little easier for himself . But Alan finds out making Charlie talking about his true feelings is more difficult than expected.<br /><br />Written and Directed by Mike Bender ( Blankman , Indian Summer , The Upside of Anger ) made an wonderfully touching human drama that moments of sadness , truth and comedy as well . Sandler offers an impressive dramatic performance , which Sandler offers more in his dramatic role than he did on Paul Thomas Anderson 's Punch - Drunk Love . Cheadle is excellent as usual . Pinkett Smith is fine as Alan 's supportive wife , Liv Tyler is also good as the young psychiatrist and Saffron Burrows is quite good as the beautiful odd lonely woman , who has a wild crush on Alan . This film was sadly an box office disappointment , despite it had some great reviews . The cast are first - rate here , the writing & director is wonderful and Russ T. Alsobrook 's terrific Widescreen Cinematography . The movie has great NYC locations , which the film makes New York a beautiful city to look at in the picture.<br /><br />DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen ( 2.35:1 ) transfer and an good - Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound . DVD also an jam session with Sandler & Cheadle , an featurette , photo montage and previews . I was expecting more for the DVD features like an audio commentary track by the director and deleted scenes . " Reign Over Me " is certainly one of the best films that came out this year . I am sure , this movie looked great in the big screen . Which sadly , i have n't had a chance to see it in a theater . But it is also the kind of movie that plays well on DVD . The film has an good soundtrack as well and it has plenty of familiar faces in supporting roles and bit - parts . Even the director has a bit - part as Byran Sugarman , who 's an actor himself . " Reign Over Me " is one of the most underrated pictures of this year . It is also the best Sandler film in my taste since " The Wedding Singer " . Do n't miss it . HD Widescreen . ( * * * * 1/2 out of * * * * * ) .
1 I have to admit , this movie moved me to the extent that I burst in tears . However , I always think about things twice , and instead of writing a eulogy that would define the film as flawless and impeccable , I prefer taking the risk of a closer look.<br /><br />First what 's first : The movie has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts out and continues as a slow - paced movie that does n't try to blow you away with the actual scenes from 9/11 . Thumbs up for this stroke of genius , because , unlike Stone 's WORLD TRADE CENTER this film fortunately does n't focus on the attack itself but on the fallout which , similar to the fallout of a nuclear explosion , is hardly visible but nonetheless dangerous and devastating . The psychological impact , the sheer devastation that 9/11 caused and the havoc it wreaked on the American people is almost palpable in this movie . I think Binder managed an astute observation of the American post 9/11 society and Sandler in my opinion sky rocketed from an average comedy actor to a real talent who delivers a performance worthy of an Oscar.<br /><br />However : In the film BLOOD DIAMOND , the Di Caprio character says and I quote : " Ah , these Americans . Always want to take about their feelings " . Now , I do n't want to belittle their sufferíngs , but I sure would like to make a comparison . Ever since 9/11 the entire world is confronted with mementos , memorials and commemorations of 9/11 . The Hollywood industry and writers such as Safran Foer more than allude to 9/11 in their works . Now , this huge amount of cultural products , dealing with 9/11 , turn the death of 3000 people into the biggest tragedy of this young century . The number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject , and I say this with all due respect , blow the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat out of proportion.<br /><br />Fact is : People die every day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people . We have a war in Iraq , in Afghanistan , in Birma and lots of other countries . On a daily basis , we forget about the poverty the African people suffer from and we tend do empathize with them to a lesser degree than with the American victims of 9/11 simply because they are black and because their lives do n't have much in common with our Western lives . Africa neither has the money nor the potential to commemorate their national tragedies in a way America can . So , what I am saying is this : The reason why we feel more for the 3000 victims of 9/11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9/11 . Not a day goes by without a newspaper article , a film or a book that discusses 9/11.<br /><br />In conclusion : I commiserated with Charlie Fineman , but I was n't sure whether I had the right to feel for him more than for a Hutu who lost his entire family in the Rwandan civil war.<br /><br />You catch my thrift ?
1 I saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival , and there was not a dry eye in the house . It is incredible to see not only what a great person Darius is , but how admirable the rest of the team is too and at such a young age.<br /><br />It also made me think how disgusting MTV was , and how on being given an opportunity to involve and inspire in a positive way , they declined . Shows you whether they really care about the youth and their viewers at all.<br /><br />It 's a wonderful and heart warming true story ... take your tissues but it 's great to see how caring and inspiring youth of today can be .
1 I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet - now I 've seen the film ! ! What a ride ! And what a trip to finally get to know Darius Weems ! Such a courageous , wise , funny and talented spirit ! And what a Crew ! To listen to Darius laughing from being in the water at Panama City , to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in Louisiana , the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon , the excitement of rafting through some rapids , the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi , and the phone calls home , and as always - boys will be boys . This film needs to be seen by everyone - young and old alike . Darius and his mother are models of strength and courage . And the Crew members are testaments to the heart of the younger generation . They got Darius a new wheelchair ; they documented accessibility problems ; they took Darius on the trip of his life ; and they touched many , many lives . By raising awareness of DMD and encouraging funding for research , this film will help accomplish the final goal of Darius Goes West - a cure for DMD .
1 This is a must - see documentary movie for anyone who fears that modern youth has lost its taste for real - life adventure and its sense of morality . Darius Goes West is an amazing roller - coaster of a story . We live the lives of Darius and the crew as they embark on the journey of a lifetime . Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy , a disease which affects all the muscles in his body . He is confined to a wheelchair , and needs round - the - clock attention . So how could this crew of young friends possibly manage to take him on a 6,000 mile round - trip to the West Coast and back ? Watch the movie and experience the ups and downs of this great adventure - laugh and cry with the crew as they cope with unimaginable challenges along the way , and enjoy the final triumph when they arrive back three weeks later in their home town to a rapturous reception and some great surprises !
1 This movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men , and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer . Few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence , and I can think of no other movie -- documentary or drama -- that achieves it . There is no other movie in which I have both laughed so much and cried so much . Yes , it is about DMD and accessible travel ; on those issues alone , it is a worthwhile venture , but it is more . It is about friendship . It is about life itself , about living every day that you 're alive . And it 's a great , fun , adventurous narrative . This is why God created the cinema ! See this movie ! ! !
1 In the beginning of this film , one of the commentators says that he was told that he has two strikes against him : he is black and male . But in addition to that , he has a third strike : he 's gay . " You 're going to have to be stronger than you ever imagined , " he is told . " Paris is Burning " is a documentary about gay black and Hispanic men who are tranvestites or transsexuals.<br /><br />The miracle of " Paris is Burning " is that director Jennie Livingston takes a subject that could have very easily become a freak show and allows the people in it their humanity . We learn their views of homosexuality , men , women , their hopes , their disappointments , their dreams . Some of these dreams are so unattainable it 's tragic . Many of the people are seriously in denial;<br /><br />This is not a film for everyone . There are shots in this movie of nude transsexuals . If you have a problem with homosexuality , then this movie is n't for you . But if you do see this movie you 'll realise " Paris is Burning " is n't really about men wearing women 's clothes , it 's about a group of people who are routinely marginalised and put down by society at large , and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives.<br /><br />I've watched this movie four times since it was released in 1991 , because it says so many things : it 's a commentary about materialism in our culture , about gender roles , about rich and poor people , about the media and what it celebrates , about fame and adulation . " Paris is Burning " is one of the most humane , and one of the saddest , movies I 've ever seen .
1 While many unfortunately passed on , the ballroom scene is still very much alive and carrying on their legacy . Some are still very much alive and quite well , Octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever , Willi Ninja is very accomplished and gives a great deal of support to the gay community as a whole , Pepper Labeija just passed on last year of natural cause , may she rest in peace . After Anji 's passing Carmen became the mother of the house of Xtravaganza ( she was in the beach scene ) and she is looking more and more lovely as well . Some balls have categories dedicated to those who have passed , may they all rest in peace . There is currently another project underway known as " How Do I Look ? " , you can check out the website at www.howdoilooknyc.org .
1 First of all I am a butch , straight white male . But even with that handicap I love this movie . It 's about real people . A real time and place . And of course New York City in the 80 's . I had many gay friends growing up in New York in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them . No matter what the consequences . That 's courageous . You have to admire that . This is a great film , watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant African American or Hispanic Gay man in the New York of the eighties . It 's real life . Bottom line it 's real life .
1 This film came out 12 years years ago , and was a revelation even for people who knew something of the drag scene in New York . The textbooks on drag performance say nothing of these vogueing houses . Anthony Slide 's ' Great Pretenders ' says nothing . Julian Fleisher 's " The Drag Queens of New York : An Illustrated Field Guide " with its flow chart of influence that pulls together Julian Eltinge , Minette , the Warhol queens , and the 90s club scene - and postdates the film - ignores the houses completely . Even Laurence Senelick 's " The Changing Room " - the closest thing that we have to a definitive book on drag performance rushes quickly past the film and does not give the background information that one would have expected from it.<br /><br />I understand from the film itself , and various articles I found on the web that this house system goes back decades . The major film performance by a house member prior to 1990 seems to be Chrystal La Beija in " The Queen " , 1968 . The historical context is the biggest missing part of " Paris is Burning".<br /><br />The film is valuable because it focuses on a scene otherwise being ignored . It is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989 . The unfortunate fact that Venus Xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending , but this is not the only film about transsexuals to include a real - life murder . As we now know , Dorian Corey had a mummified corpse in her literal closet , but this did not come out until three years later.<br /><br />Of historical importance , but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary film that provides more context .
1 An excellent documentry . I personally remember this growing up in NYC in the early 80 's . This movie is for anyone that was n't around during that time period . This shows the one thing the African American Gay Underclass felt was solely theirs and the love and camadrie you see is real . The people are real and sadly few are still alive as this is being written . The balls are still held but not to the extent that they were in the the nineteen eighties . That time is gone forever . This is a good pre " homo thug " movie . When Queens were really proud to be extroverts . Goodbye to Storyville this is another era gone but greatly documented all hail film !
1 Documentary starts in 1986 in NYC where black and hispanic drag queens hold " balls " . That 's where they dress up however they like , strut their stuff in front of an audience and are voted on . We get to know many of the members and see how they all hold together and support each other . As one man says to another--"You have three strikes against you -- you're black , gay and a drag queen " . These are people who ( sadly ) are not accepted in society -- only at the balls . There they can be whoever and whatever they want and be accepted . Then the film cuts to three years later ( 1989 ) and you see how things have changed ( tragically for some ) . < br /><br />Sounds depressing but it 's not . Most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations . They 're well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor -- just as they should . We find out they all live in " houses " run by various " mothers " and all help each other out . The sense of community in this film is fascinating.<br /><br />When this film came out in 1990 it was controversial -- and a big hit . It won Best Documentary Awards at numerous festivals -- but was never even nominated for an Academy Award . Their reason was " Black and hispanic drag queens are not Academy material " . Fascinating is n't it ? Homophobia and racism all together . < br /><br />Seen today it 's still a great film -- and a period piece . It just is n't like that anymore -- the NY they show no longer exists . The balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here . Also drag has become more " accepted " in society ( for better or worse ) . And I 've heard the houses are gone too . That 's kind of sad . I WOULD like to know where these characters are now -- I know two died of AIDS but I have no idea about the others . And what DID happen to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown ? < br /><br />Still , it a one of a kind documentary -- fascinating , funny and riveting . A must see all the way ! A definite 10 . Where 's the DVD ? ? ?
1 Growing up in NYC in the late 80's / early 90 's club - scene , I can personally say this is one of the most important documentaries made in covering that place in this time period . No Madonna did not come up with the idea of Voguing but this is where she got it from ! Instead of taking out violence on each other or in bitchy cat fights , voguing allowed people to " fight " within the confines of everything short of touching each other ( which would warrant an automatic disqualification ) . Seeing these kind of extraordinarily talented / well orchestrated " throw - downs " in the clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names from back in the day are here ... Pepper La Beija , Paris Duprée , Xtragavaganza , etc ... all commemorated in the likes of such period - pieces as Malcom McLaren 's song " Deep in Vogue" ... it did n't matter who you were , or where you were from because when you walked through those doors into this " magic kingdom " of sorts , you became part of something bigger than yourself / you were important / and most importantly the creation of your own moves and imagination ... and anybody from anywhere could become King ( or Queen ) as the case may have been . The words and wit were just as sharp as the moves on the floor . All of the tension , excitement , and magic of that very urban NYC energy is captured in this film . BRILLIANT ! ! ! PLEASE RELEASE ON DVD for the world to see ! ! ! Thank You !
1 When Paris is Burning came out , I totally dismissed it . I was not into the whole Madonna and vogueing phenomenon . I thought it was going to be campy and silly . How wrong I was about this movie . I watched it after the movie had been out for ten years and I ran out and bought it . It took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement . I felt as though I knew all of the characters personally . The 80s were spectacular and the movie captured the essence of the gay culture . What a terrific job ! I went on the internet and found out what some of the original casts members were doing now but I have not been able to locate all of them . If any one has any information on any of the casts members please let me know . < br /><br />I hope they make another documentary . I LOVED IT
1 Fifteen years later and Paris Is Burning is still aflame . This is a classic in black gay films , right up there with the other honorary black gay films , The Color Purple and Mahoganoy . This seminal work captures underground and underclass ( i.e."underserved ) black and Latin gay culture and community like no other work before or since , including all the sentimental Harlem Rennaissance gay retrospectives and renderings . They 're good , but this is the best ( dare I say the only " real " ) film you 'll find on the subject . It 's Relentlessy Cunty ( the classic house music invention)comes to Hollywood , non - stop , hilarious camp ( like only we do it ) and dead - on social critique . All this by a white female director ( who obviously must have been a Sister Gurl or Mizz Thing in a former life . ) I could go on , but I think you get the point by now : I love this movie !
1 The film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in . It is well made and very powerful . The persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological perspective . I believe it give great insight into a sub - culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society . It is shocking at times and more powerful because of it . Some parts were difficult to watch , as most reality is , but it is not over done . Its good the first time you watch it , but it becomes even better the second or third time around ; because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge .
1 Wonderfully put together .. I wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost ... there should be a part two .. a real one . It was great .. the film was n't long enough .. I would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up ! ! this is so important to the community period .. well if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this sort ... I am really tired of hearing from naive writers how AIDS and Men go together when they do n't ; actually its the hetero 's that we need to look into .. this film did n't even bother to mention HIV or AIDS and I was so glad for that .. I really appreciated the break downs and definitions too . Thank you s much for allowing this film to exist .
1 Yeah this films is tops . Ca nt recommend it more . Gay or strait its a great doco for anyone who likes film . Very funny , sad and interesting . Never dull . Great access . A film made with passion and interest in the subject matter . Some of the performances and just amazing . If you only find this film on VHS it is still very worth watching . Great . 10 out of 10 . I got to see part of this doco years about ten years ago and did not understand what I was watching . The interviews are very revealing about egos of the performers who are like heavy- weight boxers trying to punch their way out of the ghetto . The filmmaker was apparently a first timer so what an achievement . Cool . Track it down .
1 I waited a while to post a review of this documentary because when I first saw it over 10 years ago , I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write . < br /><br />I found from a documentary standpoint that this is a darned good documentary . It did what it set out to do , show me something I had no idea about and kept me interested in this world it explored . I knew nothing of the Drag world and finding out about them and the " Balls " was just spectacular to me . These folks were just so talented with what they do and how they do it , for competition . The catty folks , the complainers ( even I was angry when someone told the judge that the coat the Drag Queen was wearing was n't a man 's coat ! ) , the jealous , it 's all there like in every other competition . LIKE EVERY OTHER COMPETITION like it . Which I felt was a point.<br /><br />You had the older drag queen talking about how the Balls " used " to be compared to the newer drag queens who have changed the Balls and made more competition categories -- and even those who looked on knowing that the future of Balls would change even more when they were ready to walk the runway . It was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were living out on the street two minutes before the ball but came to compete , it was that important to them ! Then there was sad stories , stories of who 's " house " and " house mother " brought out the best and the brightest in competition . It was interesting.<br /><br />Now to add after 10 years of seeing this film , I lived through the so called ' Madonna ' craze . I spotted a few familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with Madonna during her " Vogue " phase and rightfully so . If not for those individuals , Madonna would n't have HAD a " Vogue " phase , I know that now . Credit should be given where credit is DUE . Makes me wonder , if anyone else from mainstream America would watch this documentary , they 'll learn they 're not as " mainstream " as they think .
1 After growing up in the gritty streets of Detroit , MI , and having friends who traveled to New York balls , I fell into the lifestyle of being a House member . I joined the House of Theieves . We adapted the same rules as most houses , but we were professional crooks that would boost and commit credit card fraud to obtain the fabulous jewels and clothes we desired . I even learned how to profess the making of checks and driver 's license and cash them in over seventeen states , until a jealous queen called the Secret Service on me and I went to Federal prison . But , I learned a lot from these queens in this movie and I highly recommend you watch it yourself . You can even read about how I grew up in the houses here in Detroit and the criminal activity we indulged in . My book , Identity Schemes is available on sale at Amazon dot com or at Identity Schemes dot com . But trust me , It is a lot better than Paris is Burning , because its a 2005 make .
1 This movie documents the Harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties . Much more fun than than Palazzo Volpi , though just as diseased , this movie is a true gem of squalor . One can not help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness . The sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz . Here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and duly glamorized . The characters ' penchant for idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on part of the viewer , creating a " phenomenon of a phenomenon " effect which makes this movie a piece of art .
1 I like David Hamilton 's artistic photographs of nude women at the border of womanhood , sometimes erotic , though never pornographic . Someone else liked them , too , because my David Hamilton books were stolen . In one book were seen a few pictures of a young boy , obviously nude , intimate with a young woman older than he , also nude . Though discrete , there was strong sexual connotation . New territory for David Hamilton which proved to be either stills from the movie Tendres Cousines or perhaps photos taken on set.<br /><br />The art of still photography unfortunately does not automatically translate to cinematography . Soft focus becomes out - of - focus and discrete angles become confusing , perhaps because , in motion , they can not be considered . You either see it or miss it and there 's no time to observe , to comprehend . The movie is supposed to be a farce , and funny things do happen , but it does n't " hang together , " perhaps because the story develops so slowly and one may wonder just what 's going on . Eventually , the 14-year - old Julien has intercourse with his cousin , but it 's soft core , with no genital contact shown on camera . Since it 's a farce , we have a disappointing virgin and an embarrassing caught in the act gag and , having caught them , Julien 's father even gives him a cigarette to complete the experience . In fairness , the film is in French and conforms to French cinematic forms , which may just be too subtle for most Americans even with English subtitles to help us Phillistines along.<br /><br />It 's been suggested that this film is child pornography and that certainly results from today 's climate where sexual exploitation of children is clearly a serious problem . Nobody in their right mind wants to endorse or appear to endorse the sexual abuse of children , so there 's practically no room left for children to be seen in even the mildest erotic context without immediately activating alarms over sexual violence and exploitation . Guys will think " Lucky Julien ! " even as they agree that sex and children in the movies is a " bad thing , " all the while still wishing they could have been a Julien at that age . Women , too , may have similar thoughts , but all such considerations must be pushed out of one 's conscious mind . Hysterically , the worst assumptions have become automatic and matters of children and sex are rigorously avoided . Too bad , since sexual awakening is a real human experience . Afer all , children do grow up and become sexual beings as Julien does . It 's a fit literary subject , cinema included , but taboo under the threat of sexual violence against children . David Hamilton , I think , was taking a risk to make a movie on this topic even in 1980 . He was somewhat successful at exploring this sensitive topic , and , unfortunately , we 're unlikely to see better in the near future for fear of the child pornography label .
1 Most reviews say that this is the weakest point in Hamilton 's short movie career . This movie is a bit different from the rest , and considering it the best or the worst depends on what you expect from a movie , and what you expect from Hamilton.<br /><br />Knowing Hamilton as a photographer , you can be slightly surprised . While Bilitis looks like his books in a movement with all those young girls discovering themselves and relations with each other on the edge of lesbian , with a plot connecting these scenes , Laura concentrates on few characters what enables developing relations among them ( male - female , artist - model ) but though we see beautiful photos , many of them better than his average , their number is reduced for the sake of the plot . Tendres cousines is different from both , it is only Hamilton 's movie that looks more like a film than like a collection of moving photos . Because of that it can be acceptable to wider audience than Hamilton 's fans , looking like an erotic comedy ( but not German soft - core type - " Schulmädchen report " fans would be very disappointed ) . You wo n't laugh a lot , but you can smile ( and that 's something you do n't often get from Hamilton ) . Unlike all other Hamilton 's movies the age of female varies . Unlike other movies main character is a boy . Unlike his usual works this one is n't put out of place and out of time . We have characters that live their life , have their destiny and do n't lead us only from one photo to another , from one nude girl to another.<br /><br />Unfortunately , Hamilton ( again ) gets lost with a script in his hands . Girls on beaches , under shower , in low - light rooms , in gardens , under tents , in front of mirrors , regardless of the amount of clothes - this is his territory , he can shoot minutes and hours , and whatever he does you 'll always feel the artist 's eye and hand behind it . But when he has to present us average everyday life he stops being Hamilton and becomes average director who just follows the script . Hamilton is best known for his nudes , but they are just a part of his work . And in Tendres cousines we have a reverse situation : his girls are not in the best shots . Nature , garden , house remind us on Hamilton 's work ( often neglected part of it ) , while girls , even when nude , do n't have anything special in the way he presents us . Maybe Hamilton was confused having a boy in front of camera , maybe he was thinking about a line that censorship would accept , maybe he was really trying to make something new ( and no one dared to tell him he should n't ) , but he neglected what he was mostly praised for .
1 As others have mentioned , all the women that go nude in this film are mostly absolutely gorgeous . The plot very ably shows the hypocrisy of the female libido . When men are around they want to be pursued , but when no " men " are around , they become the pursuers of a 14 year old boy . And the boy becomes a man really fast ( we should all be so lucky at this age ! ) . He then gets up the courage to pursue his true love .
1 Finally we have before us a Category III movie for the summer 2006 season . Made of equal parts cruelty , crime and passion , Dog Bite Dog benefits not merely from an apt title , but also flexible direction , superb cinematography and respectable performances from most involved . Of course there has to be a catch , manifested here in the form of several glaring inconsistencies , yet all told DBD represents the mature spirit we 'd love to see more of in the HK mainstream.<br /><br />It also marks the heralded return of Edison Chen , long absent since the Initial D debacle of a year ago . Chen 's reserved machismo does wonders for the movie , yet would have had it rough without opposite Sam Lee , whose knack for alternating between physical comedy ( Crazy ' N ' the City , No Problem 2 ) and lunatic menace has culminated in the strongest role we 've seen from him since Made in Hong Kong.<br /><br />Together , the duo makes Dog Bite Dog , and hopefully Edison 's going to get an easier break from now on as a consequence : his touch transformed projects from Princess D to the Infernal Affairs saga , and still he remains a rare occurrence.<br /><br />Mostly upon commencing , DBD showcases some mesmerizing imagery , playing gorgeous tricks with light , shadow and perspective . The soundtrack boosts this atmospheric effect , adding to the overall unreal mood the film purveys . Much of the resultant combination probably has to do with writer Matt Chow , previously engaged in likewise gruesome Three Extremes . Dog Bite Dog retains numerous traits recalled from that horror project , namely rundown urbanscapes and a pervasive air of something eerie lurking round the corner.<br /><br />Rest assured , though , this is n't a horror movie , instead following a path trodden before by classic One Nite in Mongkok , albeit from a miles more perverse angle . Replacing Daniel Wu 's reluctant mainland assassin character we have Edison , playing a nameless killing machine hailing from Cambodia 's underworld . Sent Hong Kong - way to execute a single target , the nearly silent assassin takes care of business immediately upon arrival , a process chillingly depicted courtesy of the film 's brilliant visuals.<br /><br />Although weaned from childhood to become a professional killer , Edison 's eponymous wild dog still has human weaknesses and leaves a trail , picked up on by a CID team sent to investigate . This assembly features a nice cameo by mob - movie stalwart Lam Suet , and good support from TV star Wayne Lai . However , Sam Lee 's renegade officer Wai leads the charge , revealing himself to be a highly disturbed individual but excellent cop nonetheless . We gradually learn Wai 's inner - conflict stems from his father 's police corruption background , evoking demons handy in the relentless pursuit that ensues.<br /><br />A minor body count transpires , as Edison seems to consider taking prisoners a no - no . There 's quite the violence quotient in store , even though gore per se feels toned down in places , and adult language only makes a token appearance . Once more , no nudity , leading one to conclude Cat III 's are being handed these days a bit hastily . Still , DBD 's a relatively mature theatrical release , and we applaud its arrival.<br /><br />In between the fighting , stabbing , hacking and shooting , even a career murderer needs some romance , and just like Daniel Wu had Cecilia Cheung in One Nite , so does intrepid Mr. Chen get a sweetheart , done beautifully by new comer Pei Pei . Her unnamed character ( lots of anonymity in this one ) meets Edison 's at a strangely deserted landfill , abused by her father to the point of repulsive madness and yearning for escape . When the killer ditches HK , he agrees to take her with him , and they go on the run together , love blooming en route . While the movie does n't linger on lovey - dovey stuff , our hearts go out to Pei Pei 's tragic character and her endless suffering . She renders the timid but valiant protagonist amazingly well , establishing that there are n't any good or bad guys here , evinced by the highly sobering finale.<br /><br />Director Cheang Soi 's portfolio includes recent suspense thriller Home Sweet Home and Love Battlefield with Eason Chan , two numbers likely surpassed in most accounts by Dog Bite Dog 's sinister demeanor . Cheang manages to keep DBD flowing throughout , and considering the many parts in play here , stands up to critical standards erected by people like Johnny To in his watershed nocturnal epic The Mission . A couple of glitches do come about , to wit Edison miraculously shrugging off a shot to the chest , but these are highly forgivable.<br /><br />Marking triumphant returns for two young , talented performers of the kind Hong Kong needs if we want the city 's movie heyday to come back , Dog Bite Dog does n't stand out for story . Its forte lies in strong portrayals and style , buoyed along on the strength of thespian muscle and a keen eye for visual and auditory finesse.<br /><br />HK has a long , time - honored tradition of stories to do with the city 's nighttime alter - ego , something Dog Bite Dog upholds lovingly , amounting to a solid run if not an outright masterpiece.<br /><br />Rating : * * * *
1 One of the most nihilistic and brutal films I 've ever seen , but also one of the most tragic and moving ones . This is an action - melodrama like the world has never seen it before . Sometimes the plot got me close to tears , while in the next moment delivering shocking revelations like a bone - crunching blow to the guts . Chilling performance by Edison Chen . The story of a HK - Cop and a Cambodian killer hunting each other down , while bit by bit losing their humanity , is a strong one . Featuring very little dialog in favor of haunting imagery and gritty camera - work , " Dog bite Dog " is pure HK - Bloodshed without the Heroism .
1 It 's remarkable and quite praiseworthy how writers and directors continue to make great movies out of one of the oldest and most ( over)used story lines in cinema ! " Dog Bite Dog " is basically not much more than just the simple story of an lone copper obsessively chasing a brilliant criminal , only Pou - Soi Cheang distinguishes his film from the rest by being extremely violent & relentless . This is unquestionably one of the grittiest and most uncompromising movies I 've ever seen , with an atmosphere of constant nihilism and characters that seem to come walking straight out of hell ! Not even the installments in Chan - Wook Park 's trilogy of vengeance ( with the exception of " Oldboy " , perhaps ) or any other infamous Cat - III film ever released were as sadistic and brutal as some of the events depicted in " Dog Bite Dog " . Pang is a young and ruthless Cambodian assassin who lands in the crowded streets of Hong Kong to eliminate the wife of an eminent judge in a restaurant . When the police arrives at the place , young officer Wai sees how Pang hastily flees from the scene of the crime and follow him . The first actual confrontation between the two rabid dogs results in a gigantic blood bath , as Pang mercilessly kills several hostages and even Wai 's long time friend and colleague . From then on begins a thrilling and action - packed cat and mouse game between the frustrated cop and the professional killer . The latter also saves a young girl from the constant sexual abuse of her father and stays with her at her shed in the local garbage dump . What makes this routine action / thriller so fascinating ( apart from the explicit violence ) are the main characters ' backgrounds ! Pang , the hit - man , is a Cambodian orphan and has been trained to fight & kill for money ever since he was a child . He knows no restrictions , has no mercy and barely speaks a word . Wai , the cop , became particularly ruthless and unorthodox ever since his role - model father ( also a cop ) lies in a coma after a drug - related incident . Lai does n't question suspects and witnesses ; he yells at them and he 's prepared to sacrifice everything in order to stop his brand new nemesis . People with a weak stomach or tangled nerves are advised to stay away from this film , because the cruelty and shocks featuring in " Dog Bite Dog " can easily cause nausea . It 's not the type of violence where bloodied heads and chopped off limbs fly through the air , but more like the intense and utterly disturbing type where people attempt to crush their opponents mentally as well as physically . The filming locations are effectively dark and eerie and the extremely sober music makes the already harrowing tone of the movie even more petrifying . The performances are terrific ! I would n't be surprised if Edison Chen and Sam Lee treated each other like enemies on the film set as well , because their on screen hatred and disgust feels a little too legitimate . " Dog Bite Dog " is a powerful and unforgettable film , highly recommended if you can stomach it . If you fear you ca n't , just wait a few years for the inevitable American remake which will unquestionably soften the premise a little .
1 This has to be one of the best movies to come out of HK in a long time , i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title . Loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with Sam Lee 's impossibly believable insane behavior and Edison 's portrayal of a killer machine , which totally reversed his normal idol image . i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie . However , i must warn you , this is also an equally depressing movie , as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own , and struggling to breathe . Makes you think about what is life about really .
1 WOW . If you think that a film ca n't fatigue in some way , then you have n't seen Dog Bite Dog . This film pulls no punches , and it does n't shy away from showing very disturbing images at all . Much like Salo , this one shows us the dehumanization of the human spirit . It is gritty , dark , depressing and hopeless , but it is also one of the best films to ever come out of Hong Kong.<br /><br />The script is much more of the same , but do n't go on thinking it is incredibly clichéd . It basically is about a troubling and obsessive detective in a cat and mouse game , against a professional and emotionless hit - man . While the script offers nothing new on the surface , it does provide a lot of questions about the dark side of humanity . Is violence really that necessary ? Do we become more or less human when we abuse a 5 year old child , without pity , without remorse ? In turn , we humans act no less than rabid dogs when we are blinded by anger , this is a sad truth . It is a topic that the director brilliantly explores , without limiting himself at all . Besides the cat and mouse chase , the script also develops two separate story lines for the main characters . One is about love , and the other is about redemption . Even if the script is n't that new , it is still wonderfully written and it keeps you glued to the seat at all times . < br /><br />The acting is really , really good . Edison Chen as the Hit - man is incredible ; he proves that he is n't just any pretty face . He is ruthless , vile and beyond likable . Sam Lee as the obsessed cop is also outstanding . The supporting cast , in short , is excellent . The music is also worth mentioning . Very somber score by Ben Cheung , with some effective light hearted songs played at key dark moments in the film . The cinematography by Yuen Man is also really good.<br /><br />Overall , this CATIII film is highly recommended . Very well paced , incredibly acted , marvelously scored and just really good at the end of it all . However , as many have pointed out , this is not a movie for everyone . If you dislike strong violence then you should stay away from this one . If you do n't like seeing heavy negativity in film then this is n't for you too . In the end , a powerhouse film , 8/10 .
1 Those individuals familiar with Asian cinema , as a whole , are aware that Japan is renowned , or notorious , for it 's hyper - violent films and Korea is now garnering a reputation for viciously brutal films . Dog Bites Dog , while not necessarily getting as hyper - violent as the craziest Miike film , nor is it as unapologetically brutal as some Koreas more ambitious efforts , it is a perfect in between with its own brand of brutality all it 's own . The greatest strength this film has though , like the greatest of the Japanese or Korean efforts , is that the brutality , rather than detracting from the film , actually develops the characters , if not , pushing the story forward . The two main characters are both incredibly vicious individuals with their own motivations and emotional underpinning for being as such . Sam Lee 's character , for instance , is on the edge from the very start and slowly and surely , amidst various encounters with Chang 's character , it is revealed why he is . Without spoiling this part of the story too much , it involves the morally ambiguous nature of his father . Chang 's character , on the other hand , has his most primal instincts honed to , if not perfection , brutal efficiency . Surprisingly , Chang 's story arch , while not necessarily revealing a more human side , actually reveals a side to our animal nature which many forget about which is the natural ability to recognize a fellow broken animal ( and no I am not talking about Sam Lee , rather Pei Pei 's garbage dump girl character ) . Ultimately however , for the first 80 minutes or so , it is a , more or less , straight forward cat and mouse , or Dog chase Dog , film in which every encounter ends in at least one death ( seriously , once Sam Lee and Chang Square off , some one will die ) and the fun part of movie is you never know who hands will commit the act . Which brings us to the film 's one weakness . Unforunatley to delve into it would be yet another spoiler but , to put it simply , it is guilty of pushing one of the main points of the film since , rather then letting the point be made as is 80 minutes into the film , the film goes on for another 20 minutes or so to further emphasize it . Do n't get me wrong , if transitioned better from the 80 minute mark to the climax and if the final act was n't filled with sweet music ( in fact if it , like the majority of the film , kept the music to the barest minimum and let the disturbing sound effects do their job ) , it still could have worked and not detract from the film . As it is though , despite the third act having the most vicious and bloody of the encounters , the way it was handled made it feel tacked on , and almost , insults the viewers intelligence since it felt it had to go this far to get it across . Nevertheless , it is still a breath of fresh air from Hong Kong cinema since even the most bloody of the martial arts films never reaches the level of viciousness and brutality while keeping the the character archs in tact .
1 I got ta be straight - up - I have n't seen a film as solid as DOG BITE DOG in quite a while . I 'm a big fan of the " old - school " late 80s to mid 90s era CATIII films , and I had been hearing that that " style " of films is making a bit of a come - back with films such as this , and Herman Yau 's GONG TAU ( which as of this writing I have not yet seen ... ) , so I was very interested to give some of these newer - wave CATIII films a shot . Did this film live up to my expectations ? Absolutely - but not quite in the fashion that I imagined.<br /><br />The story follows a young , animalistic , resourceful and virtually unstoppable Thai hit - man with a somewhat vague history who comes to Hong Kong to complete a " mission " . Due to some bad - luck , he is quickly identified by a roguish copy ( who exudes many of the same qualities as our hit - man ) , and is quickly apprehended and captured . This state of affairs does n't last long though , as the un - named assassin escapes from his captors and quickly shows the local police that he is not to be taken lightly . The hunt is on , and a cat - and - mouse game between the police and the " mad dog " ( as the police refer to him ) ensues . Along the way , Mad Dog is inadvertently befriended by a slow - witted young woman , and a bond forms between the two when she helps him out of a sticky situation . The ante keeps getting upped as Mad Dog 's only objective is to get out of Hong Kong and back to Thailand by any means necessary , and the cops keep trying to reel him in alive ... <br /><br />I could probably write ten paragraphs about this complex and thoroughly layered film , but I do n't want to give too much away . I watched DOG BITE DOG knowing nothing about the premise , and I think it 's the type of film that is definitely better appreciated that way . As to comparisons to the older - style CATIII films ... there are some similarities . DOG BITE DOG has some hyper - violent moments reminiscent of the " good ol' days " , but is never quite as sleazy or grimy as old - school classicks like THE UNTOLD STORY or RED TO KILL . Where many of the older CATIII films ' main intention was to " shock " - DOG BITE DOG is a far more thought - out and well - rounded production ( though that 's not to take ANYTHING away from those CATIII films that I hold so dear ... ) . This film is far more " emotional " than it is exploitative , and as we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds , the audience begins to bond and identify with both sides . There really are no clear - cut " good " and " bad " guys , as Mad Dog shows moments of extreme compassion , and the cops stoop to extremely unorthodox methods to try to flesh out the killer . There 's also no nudity / sex in this film , which is a typical characteristic of the older CATIII films . Personally , I would compare DOG BITE DOG more to Park 's SYMPATHY FOR MR . VENGEANCE or perhaps the Pang brother 's BANGKOK DANGEROUS , as both of those films mixed extremely emotional overtones with strong and unflinching action and violence . Again - there 's pretty much nothing that I did n't like about this film . The acting is dead - on , the cinematography is sharp and well done , and the whole film skillfully blends several different elements successfully in a way that is n't seen very often . Is this film ( and others like it ... ) the " rebirth " of the CATIII film - not exactly - but it IS a very solid film that 's absolutely worth checking out ... 9/10
1 Despite being quite far removed from my expectations , I was thoroughly impressed by Dog Bite Dog . I rented it not knowing much about it , but I essentially expected it to be a martial arts / action film in the standard Hong Kong action tradition , of which I am a devoted fan . I ended up getting something entirely different , which is not at all a bad thing . While the film could be classified as such , and there is definitely some good action and hand to hand combat scenes in the film , it is definitely not the primary focus . Its characters are infinitely more important to the film than its fights , a rather uncommon thing in many Hong Kong action movies.<br /><br />I was really quite surprised by the intricacy of the characters and character relationships in the film . The lead character , played by Edison Chen ( who is really very good ) , becomes infinitely more complex by the end of the film than I ever thought he would be after watching the first thirty minutes . The police characters also defied my expectations thoroughly . In fact , the stark and honest portrayal of the seldom seen dark side of the police force was quite possible my favorite aspect of the film . I do n't know that I would say Dog Bite Dog entirely subverts typical notions of bad criminal , good cop , but it certainly distorts them in ways not often seen in film ( unfortunately ) . So many films , especially Hong Kong action films I find , portray police in what is frankly a VERY ignorantly idealized light . This is one of my least favorite things about the genre . I was pleasantly surprised to see that Dog Bite Dog actually had some very unique , and really quite courageous , ideas to present about the police force . There are negotiation scenes in this film that I have never seen the likes of before , and doubt I will ever see again , and am sure I will remember for quite a while . Also , the criminal characters are shown from an interesting perspective as well , there is some documentary footage in the film of Cambodian boys no older than ten being made to fight each other to the death with their bare hands , which I thought was one of the film 's most powerful and moving moments . It says a lot about the reason these guys are the way they are , rather than simply condemning them . Also , the relationship between Chen 's character and the girl he meets in the junk yard reveals a lot about his character . It was n't until this element entered the film that I really started to see the film as an emotional experience rather than only a visceral one . There is something about most on screen relationships that does n't quite get through to me , but for some reason this one really did . The actress does an incredible job with this role which I imagine was not easy to play.<br /><br />Dog Bite Dog also features some really breathtaking cinematography , all though it is unfortunately rather uneven . There were some moments that I found really striking , particularly in the last segment of the film , but there was also a good deal of camera work that was just OK . Another slight problem I had was with the pacing , which I also felt was uneven . I found a lot of the " looking for a boat " scenes to be a little alienating , all though it quickly picks up after that . The action scenes are short and not too plentiful , but are truly powerful and effecting , particularly towards the end . The fight choreography is honestly not all that impressive for the most part , all though to its credit it is solid and fairly realistic , but the true strength is the emotional content behind the fights . The final scene , while not a marvel of martial artistry or fight choreography , is one of the most powerful final fights I have ever seen , and I 've seen quite a few martial arts films.<br /><br />I suppose the biggest determining factor of whether or not one will get much out of Dog Bite Dog is whether or not you can connect with the characters . All of them are certainly some of the more flawed characters one is likely to see in a film of any kind , but there was something very human about all of them that I could n't help but be drawn to and really feel for them , particularly Chen 's girlfriend . I should say that I doubt most people will like the film as much as I did simply because I imagine that most people will not like or care about the characters in the same way , but I still recommend it highly all the same . It is truly a deeply moving and effecting film if you give it a chance .
1 As I understand it , after the Chinese took over Hong Kong , the infamous Cat . 3 Hong Kong movies kind of disappeared . At least until now , and what an amazing movie this one is . I knew it was a rough crime drama going in , but being the first Cat . 3 I 've purchased that 's been made recently , I was n't sure what to expect.<br /><br />A Cambodian hit - man goes to Hong Kong to knock off the wife of a judge , who is also a lawyer . Turns out , the Judge made the arrangements for the hit - man , because she was divorcing the judge , and threatening to take all his money . This is all known within the first ten minutes , so nothing is being given away . After the hit , the cops locate the hit - man pretty fast , but in trying to arrest him , several police officers and civilians are killed . He eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy , before he escapes back to Cambodia . This is a movie that never stops , and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath . Yes , it is very violent and intense , many cops are killed , as the hit - man proves very very hard to track , and take down when they do locate him . Along the way , the hit - man in trying to hide in a dump , finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man . He helps her , and saves her from the guy , and she persuades the hit - man to take her along with him in his escape . I loved this movie , it 's like a roller - coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed , as one incident leads to another , and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit - man . The acting is exceptionally good , and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking . There 's no let up in this movie , not even with the very very incredible ending . The ending is pretty much unbelievable , and also a fitting end to all the action and violence . Yes , the violence is brutal at times , but this is a very no nonsense crime drama , that will knock your socks off . " Dog Eat Dog " definitely needs a more widespread release , including an R1 release for sure . Great movie , highly recommended .
1 Some comments here on IMDb have likened Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III films of the 90s , but although it is undoubtedly brutal , violent and very downbeat , this film from Pou - Soi Cheang is n't really sleazy , lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison . However , it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch , particularly if gritty , hard - edged action is your thing.<br /><br />Edison Chen plays Pang , a Cambodian hit - man who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate the wife of a judge ; Sam Lee is Wai , the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down , whatever the cost . With Wai closing in on his target , Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escapeuntil he meets Yue , a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse.<br /><br />A relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography , amazing sound design , a haunting score , and solid performances from Chen and Lee ( as well as newcomer Pei Pei as Pang 's love interest ) , Dog Bite Dog is one for fans of hard - hitting Asian hyper - violence ( think along the lines of Chan - wook Park 's Vengeance trilogy ) . Stabbings , shootings , merciless beatings : all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director Cheang.<br /><br />Of course , this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved , and sure enough , pretty much everyone in this film dies ( rather nasty deaths ) . Unfortunately , there is a fine line between tragedy and ( unintentional ) comedy , and in its final moments , Dog Bite Dog crosses it : in a laughably over - dramatic final scene , Pang and Wai are locked in battle as a pregnant Yue looks on . Eventually , after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas , a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean on ( a now dead ) Yue , delivering their baby moments before he himself dies.<br /><br />Whilst this film might not be a ' classic ' slice of Hong Kong excess , with its deliriously OTT action and stylish visuals , it 's still worth seeking out .
1 I watched the DVD of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track ( in English ) . It seems in Cambodia ( the subtitles in English say the character is speaking Thai but the movie says Cambodia)a very violent evil man is raising boys to be killers using starvation and training them to fight and kill . He sends Pang to kill some people in China and during the killings a cop 's partner is killed . The cop Wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a cop who was shot and is in a coma . Wai 's chief is his dad 's friend and is worried about Wai 's erratic behavior . He does n't know Wai was the one who caught his dad in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him into the coma . Pang escapes and hides in a squalid landfill shack where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father wo n't let her leave ( Pang does n't speak Chinese and does n't understand this but saves her from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for Cat III ) . Wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting Pang but Pang is almost unstoppable . Even after Pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where they are married and she becomes pregnant Wai follows and joins the evil man ( who 's training the boys)making a deal to fight and train so he can get Pang . There is a big showdown between Wai and Pang with the terribly abused woman the major victim and leaving Wai dead and Pang cutting out his child from the dead mother only to die and leave him as the possible next boy to be raised as a killer . This film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack . There are many very brutal violent scenes . The woman having a long nail pulled out of her foot . Knives to the neck and torso . Guns fired directly to the head . And several very intense beatings . It maybe grim intense and downbeat but it is definitely worth seeing .
1 Ultra - grim crime drama from Pou - Soi Cheang , the director of " Home Sweet Home " . Tonally , it reminded me of Billy Tang 's " Run and Kill " , although it 's not as polished as that . Nevertheless , it 's an engaging , flawed bit of mayhem about a Cambodian loner , Pang ( Edison Chen ) , who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer . While fleeing the scene , he kills the partner of cop Sam Wai , who , to add insult to injury , is in the midst of dealing with his dying father , so Sam begins an insane , obsessive manhunt for Pang that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence . There must be something in the air lately because I 've never seen so many humans beating the pulp out of each other as I have lately . This is grim , nasty stuff , which is why I 'm so partial to it , and I applaud its downbeat vibe . It 's visually arresting and the sound design is very unique . Dramatically , everything spirals downwards until every character finds him- or herself in a world of screaming pain . A subplot involving Pang 's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and spawns a surprise fourth act which boasts a fine act of grotesque surgery .
1 Dog Bite Dog is n't going to be for everyone , but I really enjoyed it . Full of slapping , stabbing and shooting ( but do n't worry  the lead 's a terrible shot ) , it can best be described as a violent romp through Hong Kong and Cambodia . Edison Cheng plays Pang , a Cambodian assassin in town to kill a barrister . Despite being filthy from his journey , he 's almost immediately seated at a huge table in the middle of an obviously expensive restaurant . If this sounds wildly implausible to you , you should probably avoid this film . It acted as my cue to suspend disbelief , and I had a lot more fun for it.<br /><br />Chasing Pang down is Wai ( Sam Lee ) , a young , edgy cop who likes to smack people around almost as much as he likes to smoke . Wai walks a fine line that has Internal Affairs investigating him , and his father , a legendary Good Cop , is in a coma following a drug deal that went south ( the implication is that Wai is letting his father take the rap for his own corrupt dealings).<br /><br />There are a car crashes , lots of killings , and a strange and awkward love story on offer here , all played out in almost comic - book style . I suspect the humour was deliberate ( nobody uses gargantuan concrete bludgeons without an eye for the extravagantly absurd ) , though the over - the - top nature lost a number of my fellow audience members . There are at least three points where the film might have ended , and at 109 mins it may have benefited from more ruthless editing , or the deletion of one of the narrative threads ( the light - hearted stuff worked well , so I would have left out the interactions with the three fathers).<br /><br />I'm inclined to give it a ( high ) pass , however , if only because of the ending  I 've rarely heard so many people laugh so loudly at what should have been a poignant moment . This is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous
1 This has got to be the best movie I 've ever seen.<br /><br />Combine breathtaking cinematography with stunning acting and a gripping plot , and you have a masterpiece.<br /><br />Dog Bite Dog had me gripping the edge of my seat during some scenes , recoiling in horror during others , and left me drowning in my own tears after the tragic ending.<br /><br />The film left a deep impression on me . It 's shockingly violent scenes contrasted sharply with the poignant and tender ' love ' scenes . The film is undeserving of it 's Cat III ( nudity ) rating ; there are no nude scenes whatsoever , and the ' love ' scenes do not even involve kissing or ' making out'.<br /><br />The message which this film presented to me ? All human beings , no matter how violent or cruel they may seem , have a tender side . Edison Chen does a superb job playing the part of the murderous Pang.<br /><br />I rate this film 10/10 . It 's a must - watch .
1 First of all that I would like to say is that Edison Chen is extremely hot and that Sam Lee is looking much better than before XD ! This is probably one of the most original movies I have seen so far ; shows a poverty lifestyle background of a Cambodian . The Cambodian(Edison aka Pang ) goes around killing people to survive himself ; has done it throughout his entire life . Sam Lee's(Wai ) duty is to capture the Cambodian for good . There are tons of violent actions but has a good story to it . The movie shows the struggles between those two characters ; they both beat each other like angry dogs . GO AND WATCH PPL ... STRONGLY SUGGESSTED ! ! ! ( GO HK FILMS )
1 First things first , Edison Chen did a fantastic , believable job as a Cambodian hit - man , born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial ring , where he honed his craft of savage battery in order to survive , living on the mantra of kill or be killed . In a role that had little dialogue , or at least a few lines in Cambodian / Thai , his performance is compelling , probably what should have been in the Jet Li vehicle Danny the Dog , where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting , and on someone else 's leash.<br /><br />Like Danny the Dog , the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically , but rather designed as normal , brutal fisticuffs , where everything goes . This probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each other 's throats , in defending their own lives while taking it away from others . It 's a grim , gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively , and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller production.<br /><br />Edison plays a hired gun from Cambodia , who becomes a fugitive in Hong Kong , on the run from the cops as his pickup had gone awry . Leading the chase is the team led by Cheung Siu - Fai , who has to contend with maverick member Inspector Ti ( Sam Lee ) , who 's inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of his father . So begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of Hong Kong.<br /><br />The story itself works on multiple levels , especially in the character studies of the hit - man , and the cop . On opposite sides of the law , we see within each character not the black and white , but the shades of grey . With the hit - man , we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl ( Pei Pei ) , bringing about a sense of maturity , tenderness , and revealing a heart of gold . The cop , with questionable tactics and attitudes , makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done . There are many interesting moments of moral questioning , on how anti - hero , despicable strategies are adopted . You 'll ask , what makes a man , and what makes a beast , and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances - do we have that dark inner streak in all of us , transforming from man to dog , and dog to man ? Dog Bite Dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end , though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag , especially on its tender moments , and it suffered too from not knowing when to end . If I should pick a favourite scene , then it must be the one in the market food centre - extremely well controlled and delivered , a suspenseful edge of your seat moment . Listen out for the musical score too , and you 're not dreaming if you hear growls of dogs.<br /><br />Highly recommended , especially if you think that you 've seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre .
1 ' ' Ranma ½ " is my favorite anime by Rumiko Takahashi . The woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story , that is not only a comedy , but also an action anime . The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome , a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts . Ranma is engaged to Akane because of an arrangement of both fathers , who are great friends and trained together during many years . < br /><br />Akane is the younger and most violent sister of the Tendo 's : Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what.<br /><br />Ranma and Akane fight all the time , specially because both have a very bad temper , and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda , many new characters and situations starts to happen . They also discover the reason of the transformation : while fighting , Ranma and his father fell in a cursed river . But not only them had this kind of fate ... <br /><br />If you watched ' ' Ranma 1/2 '' and liked , I would recommend you ' ' Inuyasha '' and ' ' Maison Ikkoku " , two other good creations from Rumiko 's hands .
1 admittedly , I first picked up Ranma 1/2 when I was around twelve . I was in the library and searched desperately for something good to read . Then , I went to the Comic / Manga section and spotted this book . At my first few reads through the chapters I did n't really know what was going on , but I knew that I LOVED it . I even took it home for a few more reads over . Frankly , I was n't getting anywhere . And then , about five months ( I 'm 16 now ) ago my friend was watching some anime series and I remembered about this Manga . I could n't remember what it was called , but recalled that the author was Rumiko Takahashi , creator of Inu Yasha . I Googled it , and then made a rash decision to watch all 161 episodes . At first I was a little thrown off by the 1990 graphics , but it did n't really matter in the end . No anime has ever made me laugh so hard and rewind , watch again . I once watched 45 consecutive episodes within a day . I do n't know how I did it ... but I could n't stop . Eventually , after about two days , I grew obsessed . I even dreamt -- as crazy as this sounds -- about watching Ranma . Never have I found a series so enjoyable , so funny , and so heartwarming to watch . To this day 161 episodes are not enough to keep me satisfied . Of course the cliffhanger ending was enough to make me go bonkers , but the series alone was enough to make me continue reading . < br /><br />Ranma 1/2 is about a boy named Ranma Saotome and his dad Genma Saotome . INTENSE martial artists . They are so intense , that they went to the ancient training grounds in China and became ' cursed ' . The grounds were full of different pools of springs , and if you land in one , you take the shape of whatever drowned there when doused in cold water . For Genma , that was a PANDA , and for Ranma that was a ... girl ! It 's a very crafty fun loving story . On top of that , Genma promises his friend that Ranma will marry one of his daughters to keep the Tendo dojo alive . ' Course the one he gets matched up with hates his guts and the feelings mutual . Obviously they start to like one another , but both way to stubborn to admit it . But .. Genma has a history of doing this . He promised Ranma to many girls . < br /><br />Trust me . It 's worth watching . It 's humorous , heartwarming and all around amazing .
1 Wow ... I mean WOW this has got to be one of the best story 's I 've ever had the chance to read / watch . We all know this famous story . Two martial artist , a man and his son , go to train in the forbidden Cursed Springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each . The dad , Genma , the spring of drowned Panda . And 16 year old Ranma , the spring of drowned girl . Now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in . Crazy enough yet ? No , that s just the beginning . As if being one of the strongest teenagers to ever exist who turns into a female was n't enough , Ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane art styles , an insane high school principle , opponents right and left who have a score to settle with Ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow or for " stealling " their loved ones . And speaking of loved ones , I 've lost track of how many times a boy or a girl has fallen in love with Ranma . And not once has it been his fiancée , Akane . And that s just from the first few chapters / episodes of the series.<br /><br />The story itself is amazing . I have never come across something so crazy , so bizarre , so ... so ... out of this world and yet its so down to Earth and believable ... I ca n't even describe it to its fullest . Its just a charming story that s so easy to get into . What I like about it is the humor . Not once have I laughed out loud this much from a manga , and it does n't have to try any of the stunts you would catch in Simpson 's or something of the sort . I could read any part of the comic and I would be laughing from beginning to end . Another thing is the characters . Ranma , you would think making him too strong would be a set back but nooo ... with every little problem the story throws at him he 's doing his best just to survive half the time and his personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst he can be a calculating genius . And to think , of the hundreds of perverts in the show , Ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in his town , more so by Akane , the worst pervert to ever live . His father Genma , you would think the father character would blend in to the background right ? Correct ! But whenever he does have some spotlight ... he just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him ! You think you know the worst dad ever from an anime ? You have n't met Genma . Ryoga , probably one of Ranma 's greatest rivals and my favorite character ( next to Ranma ) ... and probably one of the only people he can actually stand . Most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults , one is his curse that turns him into a baby pig but his worst fault ... is his lack of sense in direction ! Then we have ... you know , I could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters , the story 's , everything positive about it but that would be just pointless.<br /><br />Check out the series if you have n't , NOW ! You WILL NOT regret it ! Though I would advise checking the comic out first . I like the anime , but I 've had some trouble getting the series at a good price . And a small nitpick , the humor does n't seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga . I think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me . But either way , its a win win ! 10 out of 10 !
1 So i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene , with very few shows i simply WILL NOT WATCH.<br /><br />this show , however , i would recommend to anyone.<br /><br />Quite possibly the most Original series to date , it;s got just about everything i could ask for . A side story , so to speak , about an unconditional love that will NOT be admitted to , a very blatant comedy , and a very well put together voice acting cast ( both Japanese and American translation).<br /><br />If not for the terribly funny aspect to it , it would be , just another anime.<br /><br />More or less , as i have noticed , a ' love it or hate it ' , very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with a distaste for it.<br /><br />Original to the core , with everything you could ask for in an afternoon , bet the house on this series . I 'm ready to ASSURE you that you will enjoy it .
1 I love this anime ! I was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence ( mostly from Akane Ranma 's reluctant but short tempered " fiancee")is so slapstick however Ranma does deserve it but he does try his best to make amends ... clumsily . The main character Ranma goes to China to train only to fall into the cursed Jusenkkyo Spring and turns into a girl when splashed by cold water . From then on it 's pure chaos one after another . Among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of Kuno and Kodachi , the sexy Shampoo , the pervert Happosai all causing trouble for our hero / heroine . However it is Ranma 's selfish father Genma who winds up being the culprit for the mess most of the time . If anyone want an anime that 's funny , this is the one . It 's cuter and better with the Japanese dub .
1 When our local TV station first launched , it filled a lot of its schedule with old British programming . " Lock Up Your Daughters ! " was duly aired , and I -- swayed by the opening few seconds of the film -- popped in a blank tape . Best thing I ever did.<br /><br />The actors are beautifully suited to their characters and bring them to delightful life , complete with appropriate accents ( Christopher Plummer 's Foppington will leave you in stitches , as will Hoyden and her family ) . Double entendres abound , plot - line wheels within wheels mix and match the characters , hilarious sight gags lurk in every scene , and risqué comments are made on a regular basis.<br /><br />I showed the film to friends a few years ago and they called the piece " a lost treasure , " as much for the cast as for the story . To this day I can crack up just thinking about the dialog . Should this gem ever find its way to a DVD release , I 'll be at the front of the line .
1 I saw this film 12 years ago on TNT . It was Susanah York 's Birthday and they were showing this film as a double feature with Tom Jones ( 1963 ) . I have not seen this film on TV since . I took interest in seeing this film because one of the stars is the very funny and talented Jim Dale , as Lusty the sailor . I believe that Dale now does the narration of the Harry Potter books on Casette , but anyway he is quite funny . This is a fast paced comedy . It is not on VHS or DVD . Columbia Pictures should go through their film collection , and consider restoring and releasing this film to DVD . Christopher Plummer is hilarious as Lord Fopington , Ian Bannen is also quite humorous as Ramble the sailor . This is a bawdy comedy , the kind of film one no longer sees , with great production values . * * * 1/2 stars out of * * * *
1 Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best high - spirited comedies I have ever seen.<br /><br />It is misunderstood since it lacks the " social commentary " values that many films of the day ( 1969 ) required to be successful.<br /><br />The characters are over - the - top satires of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actors.<br /><br />Christopher Plummer shines especially bright as Lord Foppington , a noble with hair too big to fit in the door.<br /><br />The plot involves the usual 18th century stuff ; mistaken identities , thwarted romances , corrupt government officials , and jokes at every turn.<br /><br />It answers the questions : What happens when 4 rambunctious , eager to party sailors are on leave in a small British coastal town ? And , who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out?<br /><br />Despite doing poorly at the box office , it has great costumes , excellent music(based on the Mermaid Theatre musical of the same name ) , great , lively acting and sets that are obviously authentic.<br /><br />That it has never been released on either VHS or DVD is truly a shame , since so many bad movies are released every day .
1 I agree with the other comments . I saw this movie years ago . Christopher Plummer is hilarious as a dandy . The ribaldry is unsurpassed . If this comes out on video , I will definitely buy it .
1 A real classic . A shipload of sailors trying to get to the towns daughters while their fathers go to extremes to deter the sailors attempts . A maidens cry for aid results in the dispatch of the " Rape Squad " . A cult film waiting to happen !
1 I must say , I was surprised with the quality of the movie . It was far better than I expected . Scenario and acting is quite good . The director made a good job as well . Although some scenes look a bit clumsy , it is a decent movie overall . The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end . The mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good . The plot was clear , consistent and well thought . Some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development . Moral of the story , it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good .
1 Despite of the success in comedy or drama , the Turkish directors are failure in horror - thriller . " Okul - D@bbe " are good examples for the awful horror Turkish films.<br /><br />But if you watch " Gen " you will understand that it is a strike . The atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark . Also the special features are colorful and not cheap . The soundtracks fit the movie , but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary.<br /><br />As a result " Gen " does not add any difference to horror movies , but it does not disappoint thriller fans . In this respect it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey . ( 7/10 )
1 A young ( only 21 ) director with great talent , a powerful scenario , young and ambitious cast with all theatrical background ... <br /><br />One of the first tries of a thriller in Turkish cinema , which seems in the future we 'll have some more based on the success ... <br /><br />Shot on high definition video , the movie is perhaps effected on world thrillers , especially the American thrillers . The technical and cinematographic character is quite well done , the scenes are all well worked on . Not too much blood but sufficient enough to make you think you 're in a blood bath too ... <br /><br />The scenario is quite wise but with certain clues , a clever audience can easily predict what 's going on and at the end when everything settles down you 're getting somehow weird to conclude the result.<br /><br />Well done Tiglon , one of the biggest DVD distributors in Turkey , it is not easy to decide for such a movie in their first try as a production company ...
1 It is an excellent thriller from Turkey which can make sense . Great job from Gokbakar brothers.<br /><br />First of all , i want to point on screen play . Generally screen play in most films from Turkey is not enough , but GEN has the best shots to be said " perfect".And also transition parts are really excellent.<br /><br />On the other hand,"Gen " has a great topic that influence everyone . Especially , a woman , who wants to be a psyciatrist in a sanitarium , has a mother that is a habitual insanity . Principal causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen . The only thing you have to do is to combine all the hints.<br /><br />There is an impressive aggression part Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar played . This performance may be more realistic than " Irréversible(Monica Bellucci ) " .<br /><br />The last thing i want to say is " Watch this movie , you'll get confused "
1 This movie is the first time movie experience for several people in the cast . All of them are experienced actors and have played in several TV series and plays . Sahan Gokbakar is a well known comedian in Turkey . It 's kind of strange to see him in a thriller , while he is at the peak of his comedy career in Turkey . This movie is Togan Gokbakar 's first long shot and pretty much the first experience as a director . But they all did a good job . We are happy to see such enthusiastic young cast . They seem very promising for the future of the Turkish film Industry . Doga Rutkay being long time sweetheart of Sahan Gokbakar , is also a talented actress , who is known for her recent play in " number 27 " theatrical play and several TV series .
1 Directed by the duo Yudai Yamaguchi ( Battlefield Baseball ) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto " Meatball Machine " is apparently a remake of Yamamoto 's 1999 movie with the same name . I doubt I 'll ever get a chance to see the original so I 'll just stick commenting on this one . First of what is " Meatball Machine " ? A simple in noway pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick packed with great make up effects and gore . It 's not something you 'll end up writing books about but it 's nevertheless entertaining if you dig this type of cinema.<br /><br />"Meatball Machine " follows the well known plot . Boy loves girl but is too afraid to ask her on a date . Boy finally meets girl . Girl gets infected by a parasitic alien creature that turns her into a homicidal cyborg . Boy , in turn does also transform into said thing , and goes on a quest to save his love . Will he succeed ? Who gives a damn , as long as there is carnage and death I 'm satisfied.<br /><br />The plot is simple , relatively clichéd but it does it 's job well enough setting the movie 's course straight forward into a bloody confrontation between the two leading characters . There is a subplot focusing on how the parasite that infected the girl came into to their lives . And yes it too luckily shows more violence . I 'm happy . Acting is what you would expect from a no budget splatter film . It 's not exactly painful for the ears but it 's not exactly good either.<br /><br />The movie 's main attraction besides the violence and gore ( like I have n't mentioned that enough already ) are the cyborg designs . Done by Keita Amemiya who 's work in creating outlandish creatures and costumes for both movies and video - games is well known . The necroborgs as they are called in " Meatball Machine " look stunningly detailed . Without the usage of CGI Amemiya 's designs are a breathtaking fusion of flesh and metal , painfully awesome in their appearance . Able to transforms various parts of the body into cool weaponry such as saws , rocket launchers , blood - firing shotguns and so on and so on . Though you can easily recognize the cheapness of the film , necroborgs are A - movie class.<br /><br />"Meatball Machine " is " Tetsuo The Iron Man " mixed up with " Alien " all done in low budget and extra ketchup mode . It 's an immensely entertaining film that disregards modern special effects and proves that the splatter genre is still alive and kicking .
1 I do n't know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of " Tetsuo " or not . Why " Tetsuo " ? Because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious " Tetsuo " rip - off . The concept is similar , editing is equally frantic and fast - which is good because , aside from making the movie more dynamic , it obscures some flaws caused by low budget and other factors .<br /><br />There is lot more gore , less eroticism and , in the case of " Meatball machine " , the transformation of human being into a creature that 's partially a machine ( sounds familiar ? ) called " Necroborg " ( very original ) is caused by slimy little aliens .<br /><br />These slimy little scums from outer space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other . They infest the body , somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other Necroborgs . Their aim is to defeat another alien who is in another Necroborg , rip it out of the corpse and eat it .<br /><br />All in all , the plot sounds somewhat silly and I did n't expect much , but at the end I actually enjoyed this film .<br /><br />As I said before , this is a low budget flick , but it 's still relatively decent . Do n't expect much from actors , they 're mostly not very good , but it can be tolerated . I liked the atmosphere and gore , certain bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited . Although the story is not too original , it possesses certain charm - to me at least .<br /><br />7 out of 10 .
1 Meatball Machine is an amazing splatter film , it has an original plot with young love , buckets of blood , and weird alien creatures that mutate people into freakish robotic war machines.<br /><br />Now the film is n't for everyone , people who love splatter films or the movie Tetsuo : the Iron Man will applaud it.<br /><br />The special effects can be cheesy at some points of the film , but your not exactly suppose to take the film very seriously.<br /><br />Yet , all in all it 's a lot of fun , well if you find budding romantics infested with slimy tumor like gobbles who seek to destroy each other in bloody alien oozing battles .
1 The Japanese cyber - punk films have never really done a whole lot for me , but of the handful that I 've seen , most have been at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining . MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception.<br /><br />The storyline is about a species of parasites that take over human hosts , takes control of their bodies , turns them into " necroborgs " , and causes them to fight each other with the sole purpose of eating each other - apparently as a " game " for the enjoyment of said parasites . The film mainly revolves around a shy guy and gal who fall for each other , but whose love - affair is cut short by both being infected with the parasites , and are forced to fight each other . It becomes a test of human - will vs. the parasite 's control over their physical bodies ... <br /><br />MEATBALL MACHINE will invariably be compared to TETSUO ( as most cyber - punk films are ) , and for good reason . There are definitely some thematic parallels , though the films are definitely different . There 's plenty of fun , splattery moments in MEATBALL MACHINE , and the creature / borg FX are definitely the high - point - a mixture of TETSUO - meets - GWAR that are both elaborate and inventive . Depending on your taste for these types of films , MEATBALL MACHINE may or may not be your thing . If you enjoy hyper - kinetic cyber - punk films with a healthy dose of splatter - this one 's for you ... 7/10
1 Do n't be fooled by the silly title folks , this is one sweet ride ! A true successor to Tetsuo the Iron Man and Ichi the Killer , this gem starts with a bang and lays the gore on thick until the credits roll . It seems that aliens are taking over people 's bodies and modifying them into war - machines , which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game for the amusement of their species . The winner of the battle eats the loser alive . That 's mostly it for plot , but who cares when the gore is this good ? I have no idea how many buckets of slime were used , but it 's disgusting to behold . There is interesting and effective use of stop - motion when the takeovers are in progress , and loving care is lavished on all of the creature and make - up effects . The CGI is a bit limited , but that actually does n't detract from the overall quality one bit , at least for me . This was truly a fun and stomach - turning film that deserves much praise , and has truly earned its place in the stack of Cult Classics . Find it and watch , you wo n't be disappointed !
1 Wow baby , this is indeed some fine Asian horror / gore , and a crazy outlandish movie . This is a Japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little of Tetsuo , except in this case with all the blood and guts , there is a bizarre love story . It 's hard to imagine how they even dreamed up this visually stunning movie , with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites , turning them into part machine or I guess cyborgs . The only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a human , is they need to kill each other and eat the other . hmmm , yum yum . This would probably be called industrial splatter or something like that , with a superb soundtrack to add to all the fun . The movie also borrows a little from Carpenter 's " The Thing " in creature design and effects . I would put this in the must - have category for gorehounds , as there is non - stop carnage and some very fine gore . And a must - have for stoners , because you do n't even need to read the sub - titles , the visual images alone are enough of a mind trip . The design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a fetus reminded me a little of Frank Henenlotter 's movies , which is another homage to some excellent gore films with a sense of humour . " Meatball Machine " is great fun for gorehounds , there is no doubt about it , and I simply loved it .
1 Most of the feedback I 've heard concerning Meatball Machine has been pretty mixed . A couple even saying that they think " it sucked " . Well , to those people I say , get some f@ckin imagination and go f@ck yourself . This was a very entertaining flick.<br /><br />The story starts with this mechanical bug which attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these Gwar - costume looking , deathbots called Necroborgs . Eventually you learn that these mechanical bugs also attach a little parasite onto you , which then is able to control your actions due to hot - wiring your nervous system . Unfortunately for two love - seeking lonely young adults , they happen to cross paths with the mechanical bug , and before you know it transformations are taking place and blood is being splattered . Is there a way to stop the transformation ? Maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat ? Why do the Necroborgs fight one another ? Do the two desperate singles get to express their feelings for one another and do the nasty ? Only one way to find out.<br /><br />Going into Meatball Machine I was kinda wary due to the mixed reactions , but it turned out being a great surprise . A few unanswered questions , some average acting at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points I can think of . From the anime feel to it , to the parasites becoming little characters themselves and even to the low budget feel , this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses . With a ever - developing story that 's interesting enough to keep oneself asking questions throughout mixed with the cool make - up effects and blood splatter , this is one flick fans of bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / splatter fans should check out . 8 outta 10
1 For fans of Troma or the Cyberpunk genre mixed with a little blood shed then this film for you ! There is a good amount of blood shed within the confines of this film , also the effects can be impressionable and awesome . The plot is ridiculous and refreshing , not being chained down to what we as audiences are expectant of from films these days.<br /><br />Also notable are the little aliens , who I found cute . All in all , it 's a good film for fans of the genre . Also recommended are films such as Tetsuo : The Iron Man and Versus for that weird Japanese film approach , filled with wonderful obscurity and bloodshed . Of course , seeing this film you should already have knowledge of the two .
1 Why are n't more films ( especially American ) more like Meatball Machine ? < br /><br />This is my first official on - line review and I am charged with " electrical ecstasy " after having chosen " Meatball Machine " as my first endeavor . This is a review , so I 'll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion.<br /><br />I mean , this is one creative piece of work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic TETSUO ! So what if it 's not all original ? I own both of these films and though Tetsuo is one strange son of a bitch , Meatball Machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify film significance . Meatball Machine is as elaborate in it 's story as it is in its high influx of blood and gore . Thank you Jesus for Japanese Cinema!<br /><br />Simply put , the last time my dreams were overrun by visions of horror happened after watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 7 or so . I could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a telephone for weeks on end . This time ( at 31 ) my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring.<br /><br />In this film human bodies are host to Aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending quench for human flesh and blood . Humans become flesh eating cyborgs ! ! ! There 's more ! ! ! Fight scenes ! ! Great Music ! ! Great point - of - view shots ! Decent acting by the woman Cyborg ( at least better than her male counterpart ) . The fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times.<br /><br />Oh , and did I forget to mention it 's a Love story ! Wow , I hate love stories but this takes the cake!<br /><br />I ca n't wait to have friends over to watch this film once more just to see the reaction on their faces . Sadly , I took time to write this review because I 'm afraid most friends and family wo nt understand Meatball Machine . The truth is America as a whole is not prepared for Meatball Machine.<br /><br />Lastly , My wife walked in while I was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless . Normally she says something like " why are you watching that junk ? " This time she had nothing to say . I was glad ! < br /><br />This is not junk . This is n't just SPLATTER ( splatter for the sake of splatter is also great ) . This is Art my friends . Art.<br /><br />CHACHO
1 Some may feel that the rating i have just given is a bit generous , but for what this film is i think the directors have done a good job with that they had available to them , this is also a film a film of an acquired taste ! < br /><br />my immediate thought was the direct connection to the classic cult film ' The Thing ' i.e the parasitical aliens from outta space , infesting human host to then reek havoc wherever possible!<br /><br />You can see how this film pays homage to such a film and others of the horror / gore genre , however cleverly maintains its own originality , well these things fight each other for one and then continue to eat then fallen rival ! Only killing and picking a human when it needs a new host ! To then pick another fight with another infected host ! And this film even throws in a love story but i wo nt say no more otherwise it gives too much away.<br /><br />GREAT ! But like i said of an acquired taste , so do n't be surprised if you do n't like the film . It is low budget and yes it is blood thirsty , with the creatures / aliens / things morphing their limbs into crude looking weapons , i.e saws , drills , blades and even the odd gun to all but decimate there opponent . I found myself cringing at what i was being shown but at the same time glued to the screen wondering what was going to happen next!<br /><br />So if you like gore , you like aliens , you like fighting and even maybe a little bit of love thrown in somewhere , then i must recommend this film as a must see . I just wish i came across this earlier then i did !
1 Deranged and graphically gory Japanese film about little beings taking people over and turning them into necroborg - zombie like machines- which beat and hack each other apart so that the winner can eat the loser . In the middle of this a pair of lovers become infected.<br /><br />Technically superb horror comedy ( ? ) is only for those with strong stomachs as blood and body parts go flying . Good taste prevents me from describing what happens here , but lets just say its pretty gruesome . If you like this sort of thing with form several steps above slender content by all means see this film . Personally I 'm not normally one to enjoy films like this on anything but the how sick and twisted do they go level . Here I was intrigued enough that I can suggest it to people I know who like really gory movies .. Its also a film with enough going on in the details that I want to see it again since now that I know what was going on - as revealed in the end - I want to go back and see what it was I did n't catch on to . There is an internal logic rare in these films.<br /><br />7ish out of 10 for those who like blood and severed limbs , its a zero or more precisely a run and hide alert for everyone else .
1 Road to Perdition , a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes ( and in my opinion his best work ) , a director who three years before won Oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial American Beauty . This is a terrific movie , and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad.<br /><br />It 's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the , Michael Sullivan , a father of two children , played by great Tom Hanks ( I 'm not his admirer but ought to say that ) is a hit - man for local mafia boss , played by Paul Newman . His eldest son , a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr. , perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin , after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live . Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder , committed by John Rooney , son of his father boss . Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever . The atmosphere of the period , all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created , editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written . But the main line of the movie , the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father - son relations in bad times . They are shown so deeply , strong and believable . Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb . Finally worth to mention a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful ( but one more time sad ) masterpiece . I believe Road to Perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film - making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />My grade 10 out of 10
1 Acting This film is a very well acted film . I will say that the performances are slightly weak at times ; but for the most part , the acting is very good . The only actor that blew me away with his performance was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire . He was incredible ! Tom Hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible . Paul Newman , good as always . Cinematography This is what made the movie a masterpiece ( and I rarely use that word ) . Conrad Hall is a true genius . If at any point in the movie you were to pause it , you will see the delicately crafted work of this man . He sets up every shot so that nothing is left out . When the camera is still , there is a postcard like quality to the screen . When the camera is moving , every shot is planned to understated perfection . But it does n't stop there . Conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art . The way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work I 've seen . His work on this movie made it what it is . This movie is at the top of the list for best Cinematography with LOTR , Black Hawk Down , Hero , CTHD , Moulin Rouge , and Vertigo . Story People will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but , I believe they missed the point of the movie . It is a love story about a hit - man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose . It is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other . The screen Writing is worthy of an Oscar . Music Thomas Newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story . The music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores I 've herd . Direction Sam Mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director . The symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film - making world . I will be on the lookout for the next Sam Mendes Film . 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I 've ever seen .
1 This could n't have been better . The strong restraints on Mike Sullivan 's expressions could n't have been portrayed in any other way . Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career . Young Tyler Hoechlin drives an emotional wheel ; playing the basis character for the story . And veteran Paul Newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time.<br /><br />This film is based on a bold graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner . This is a father / son story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles . Mike Sullivan had no father as a child , so John Rooney took him in . Although a generous man , Mr. Rooney involved himself in organized crime . Therefore , the debt of Sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business . Now , Sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe , but at the same time pay back his boss . The events to follow , will test Sullivan 's loyalty and embrace his family 's fate.<br /><br />With a great adaptation by David Self , the dialogue comes out seldomly , but yet very virtuous . The story unfolds in a beautiful 1930 's setting ( Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson & Nancy Haigh ) covered with a dark rainy ( snow on the ground ) exterior . Driving the story , is Thomas Newman 's wonderful Irish score , settling in only when necessary.<br /><br />But the most important technical element in the film is Conrad L. Hall 's beautiful photography . This is some of the best cinematography I 've seen ; and I watch a lot of films . The scene when Mike and Michael are in the car , entering Chicago is quite impressive . The shot starts at the front of the car , revealing Mike(Hanks ) through the windshield . It subsequently dollys around to the side of the car , to see Michael(Hoechlin ) awakening and peering out his side window . As it continues , it trucks sideways and dollys back , completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930 's Chicago.<br /><br />With a great cast and crew , the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film . I 'm talking about Sam Mendes , who made his feature film debut in 1999 with American Beauty . ( won him various awards ) Before American Beauty , Mendes worked as a play director for the British Theater , but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater . With only two films , Sam Mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors ( In a list of about twenty - five).<br /><br />The film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly . The photography , acting and story is phenominal . I 'm still waiting for Scorcesee 's Gangs of New York , but for now , I 'm fully confident in saying that this is the " Best Film of the Year " . Considering it 's competition ( Signs , Insomnia , Minority Report ) that s a strong statement .
1 I loved so much about this movie ... the time taken to develop the characters , the attention to detail , the superb performances , the stunning lighting and cinematography , the wonderful soundtrack ... <br /><br />It has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that wo n't work for anyone who wants the typical fast - paced action flick . If we lived in Elizabethan days , I 'd say this movie 's a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy . But since we do n't , let 's say it 's more like a Drama - Suspense movie.<br /><br />The plot is simple , but the story is complex . The movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored . Much of the story is shown rather than told , which I find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book ( or graphic novel ) . At times I felt I was actually there in the 1930s , part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream - like quality in the style of its telling.<br /><br />I do n't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon , but in this case I do . ( Though I did enjoy the book too . ) I 've bought the DVD , which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary.<br /><br />(I also took my little cousin , who 's a little younger than the boy in the movie , to see it after I saw it for the first time , because he has issues at home and I wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father - son issues with him . He loved it - and the discussion . )
1 I f you thought Sam Mendes ' first film , the much heralded American BEAUTY was a movie with style to spare , wait until you see his highly anticipated second effort , the unrelentingly grim 30 's gangster melodrama ROAD TO PERDITION . Some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to THE GODFATHER , a rash judgment made by several reviewers taken with Mr. Mendes ' extraordinary technical prowess . If the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great , then yes , ROAD TO PERDITION is a distant cousin to THE GODFATHER in terms of what it achieves in cinematography , editing , music scoring and sound . What it does n't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over . As with American BEAUTY , there is a cold , distancing feel to this movie , despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love , loyalty and betrayal.<br /><br />This story of a hit man ( Tom Hanks ) and his relationship to a surrogate father - figure who is also his boss , an elderly Irish mob leader ( Paul Newman ) , seems to have been culled from innumerable gangster movies of years past . The father /son motif that hangs over this picture is so heavy handed in its treatment that there is not much room for spontaneity ; the entire enterprise has been very carefully wrought , and nearly all the dialog is delivered with an air of great portent : this is obviously a gangster film , hence the requisite amount of violence and bloodshed , but the film is nearly devoid of any humor to speak of ; only in scenes involving a young boy driving a getaway car in a cunningly edited montage is there any sense of lightheartedness to leaven the pervasive sense of doom.<br /><br />That being said , I have nothing but the highest praise for the stunning look of this film ; indeed , it is not an overstatement to say that this is one of the most beautifully photographed and designed movies I have ever seen . Veteran cameraman Conrad Hall will very likely win another Oscar for his work here . The production 's sets and costumes are just as exemplary ; in fact , the entire film is a technical marvel . Mr. Mendes continues to astonish with his vivid use of color , and he and Mr. Hall again make very dramatic use of red blood splattered against pale colored walls , all the more effective and disconcerting due to the preponderance of blacks , blues and grays that dominate the movie 's color scheme.<br /><br />If I have failed to duly note the acting , it is not because the actors do not purport themselves ably ; everyone in the film is top notch , with special mention going to the two malevolent bad guys : Daniel Craig is the classic " man you love to hate " , the spoiled , impulsive son of Newman 's gangster father ; and an almost unrecognizable Jude Law as an especially slimy miscreant who goes on pursuit of Hanks and his son and figures very importantly in the film 's riveting second half . But acting in a movie this dazzling is bound to take a back seat to the photographic fireworks on display here . If a Rolls - Royce was a movie , I 've no doubt it would look like ROAD TO PERDITION .
1 Conrad Hall went out with a bang . The great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on . He did himself proud as this is one of the best - looking crime films you 'll ever see.<br /><br />Of course , the acting ai n't bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman playing the leads ! The amount of action in here is just right , too : not too much ; not too little.<br /><br />None of the characters in here , frankly , are " good guys " as Hanks is a professional hit - man for town boss Newman . Hanks ' only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him , although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies ! Huh?<br /><br />As good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is , the real star of this film is cinematographer Hall , who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens . His work is just awesome .
1 This is one of the best made movies from 2002 . Maybe it is not the best movie , but it looks the best , has great acting and is directed perfectly by Sam Mendes , who debuted with ' American Beauty'.<br /><br />It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan ( Tom Hanks ) who is seen by his son ( Tyler Hoechlin ) on one of his jobs . Michael 's boss , John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) , thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney ( Daniel Craig ) sets both his father and Michael up , leading to the death of Michael 's wife ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ) and second son . Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit - man Harlen Maguire ( Jude Law ) to finish the job . Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti ( Stanley Tucci).<br /><br />In a way ' Road to Perdition ' is a standard gangster movie but it is so well made you almost can not see that . This movie is good in its production design , art direction , sound , music and most of all in its cinematography . All these elements are able to surprise and create suspense although the outcome is pretty certain . That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks , Law and Newman know how to act helps , of course.<br /><br />Based on a comic this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has it flaws it belongs to the better movies in the genre . Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before , but for some reason it also feels fresh at the same time . The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area . See this movie that will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas .
1 Frankly , this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors.<br /><br />The opposite of perdition ( being lost ) is salvation ( being saved ) and this movie is one of a very few to deal with those two concepts . The movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the father - son relationship . It should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themes.<br /><br />The premise is that the fathers in the move , hit - man Michael Sullivan ( Tom Hanks ) and his crime boss John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) , love their sons and will do anything to protect them . But Rooney 's son Connor is even more evil than the rest . He kills one of Rooney 's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father . When Connor learns that Sullivan 's son Michael witnessed it , he mistakenly kills Sullivan 's other son ( and Sullivan 's wife ) in an attempt to silence witnesses.<br /><br />Sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price , even at the terribly high price of perdition . Rooney , who in one scene curses the day Connor was born , refuses to give up his son Connor to Sullivan , and hires a contract killer named Maguire ( Jude Law ) to kill Sullivan and his son . So Rooney joins his son Connor on the Road to Perdition.<br /><br />For the rest of the movie , accompanied by his surviving son young Michael , Sullivan pursues Connor Rooney down the Road to Perdition , and Maguire pursues Sullivan . When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a Church basement , and demands that he give up Connor because Connor murdered his family , Rooney says - " Michael , there are only murderers in this room , .. , and there 's only one guarantee , none of us will see Heaven . " As the movie ends , somewhat predictably , one character is saved and one character repents.<br /><br />I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan , but he does step out of character to play hit - man Sullivan convincingly , giving a subtle and laconic performance . Newman does well as the old Irish gangster Rooney , showing a hard edge in his face and manner , his eyes haunted by Connor 's misdeeds . Jude Law plays Maguire in a suitably creepy way . Tyler Hoechlin plays Young Michael naturally and without affectation.<br /><br />The cinematography constantly played light off from darkness , echoing the themes of salvation and perdition . The camera drew from a palette of greens and greys . The greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of Depression era Illinois . The greens belonged to the younger sons and that State 's rural flatlands . Thomas Newman 's lush , sonorous and haunting music had faint Irish overtones and was played out in Copland - like arrangements . The sets were authentic mid - Western urban - factories , churches . The homes shone with gleaming woodwork.<br /><br />The excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes , distinctive acting , and enveloping music and cinematography . The only negative was a slight anti - gun message slipped into the screenplay y , the movie 's only nod to political correctness.<br /><br />I give this movie a10 out of 10 ; in time it will be acknowledged as a great film .
1 This is the best mob film ever made . It deserved more then what it got at the Oscars . Nominated for things like its score , art direction , supporting role ( Newman ) , this film could have easily been nominated for Best Picture , Director ( Mendes ) , Actor ( Hanks ) , Supporting Actor ( Newman and Law ) and won ! ! Hanks gives one of his best performances , and the kid who played Michel Jr. was so good that I 'm surprised i do n't see him in more movies today . Critics themselves did n't give this film enough credit . But besides the incredible performances , another real star of this film is the incredible music . This was by far the best score of the year . It was nominated but did n't win . This is a great film that should be seen by everyone . My Grade - A+
1 Having been driven out of the house and into the theater by the sweltering heat , I could not have been more pleased . The Road to Perdition , directed by Sam Mendes ( American Beauty ) , is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time . Perhaps I 'm just getting old ; perhaps I 've just seen the same themes recycled time and again . But this movie is indeed different.<br /><br />The story opens with young Michael Sullivan Jr. facing out to the sea , contemplating the duality of his father 's legacy -- one of the best men to ever live , one of the most evil . This duality snakes its way throughout the movie . The story revolves around crime boss John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) and Michael Sullivan ( Tom Hanks ) , the young man Rooney once took in and who now serves as his personal " Angel of Death . " Rooney is tied by blood to his own son , but tied by love and loyalty to Michael . Young Michael Jr. , intrigued by the stories he reads , steals away in his father 's car one night while Dad goes off to " work " with Connor Rooney , heir to the family " business . " Connor lets the situation get out of hand , and what was meant only to be a warning turns into murder -- witnessed by Michael Jr. Upon the discovery that young Michael has seen what he should not have seen , the plot is set in motion as conflicting loyalties collide . Soon , Michael Sr . is on the run with his young son , pursued by contract killer Harlen " The Reporter " Maguire ( Jude Law).<br /><br />I will disclose no further details in order to avoid any potential spoilers . However , I strongly encourage viewers to examine the many dualities that present themselves in the movie : Problems between sons and fathers ( Michael Sr & Jr. , John Rooney & son Connor ) , between the world at home and the world at " work " , between good and evil , between those who pretend to be men of god and those who really are , between " clean " money and " dirty " , between the town of Perdition and Perdition as hell . And along the way , savor the visual brilliance of cinematographer Conrad L. Hall ( 9 nominations , 2 oscars for best cinematography ) : rain pouring off fedoras , shots through mirrors ( especially on swinging doors ) , tommy - gun flashes from out of the shadows , absent any sound . Not only has 75-year - old Hall given us perhaps the best cinematic product of his career , but 77-year - old Paul Newman offers one of his best performances ever.<br /><br />Yes ... I may be getting old . But I 've seen a lot ... and this is fresh and invigorating . The Road to Perdition presents a lasting and loving tribute to the gangster genre , to films of the 40s , to dark comic - book figures lurking in the darkness , to villains and heroes , to American film in general . Go see it !
1 ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newman 's score . It 's haunting and beautiful but you 're aware that this music is similar to Newman 's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you 're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN , MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION you 're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen . As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY , Irish gangsters is MILLER 'S CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone 's gangster epics . Despite having a seen it all before feel this should n't be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed . But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you ca n't help thinking what a superb director Mendes is < br /><br />ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances . I 've never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but he 's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role , probably better . Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent - Newman 's performance works due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milks it or goes over the top . While never upstaging Newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how Daniel Craig might have progressed as a character actor if he had n't decided to become James Bond , a role which heralds the end of an actors career
1 After gorging myself on a variety of seemingly immature movies purchased on ex - rental DVDs , I figured that the time was right for a little serious drama and who better to provide it than Sam Mendes ? For a number of reasons , " American Beauty " does n't appeal to me as much as this film which is easily the darkest thing that Tom Hanks has ever done and probably one of the most underrated films of the last decade . For this is not a simple gangster tale lifted from its graphic novel origins , and is simply wonderful to watch because of it . And despite my usual allergy to any film with Tom Hanks ' name on it ( still ca n't watch " Big " without wanting a cat to kick ) , I 'm glad I gave this a try because this is one of those movies that you 'll kick yourself for if you miss it.<br /><br />Normally squeaky - clean Hanks plays Michael Sullivan , a devoted family man and father of two sons growing up during Prohibition in the early 1930 's . He is also a professional hit - man to mob boss John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) but has managed to keep his job a secret from his sons . But after his eldest ( Tyler Hoechlin ) witnesses his dad involved in a mob killing , the pair are forced to go on the run as John seeks to tidy the matter up . Soon , father and son are pursued to Chicago where a fellow hit - man ( a menacing Jude Law ) is waiting for them.<br /><br />On the face of it , it reads like a pretty standard gangster film but as I 've said , this is n't really about gangsters at all . It 's about the relationship between a father and son thrown together in the most tragic of circumstances . Hanks is ( * grits teeth * ) superb as the tortured man who finds out that everything has its price and little Hoechlin is also good as Sullivan 's son . In all honesty , there is not a single performance that I could single out as weaker than the others - the cast is pretty much faultless . As is the cinematography and costumes ( and it 's not often I praise costumes ! ) which recreates the 30 's with stunning effect . There has been so much effort to get everything right and it pays off in spades . This could easily have looked rubbish - they admit that the early 30 's look was difficult to put down - but it does n't and that deserves every bit of credit . Chicago especially looks fantastic , lined with hundreds of rickety cars from the era and filled with people in monochrome suits and hats . True time - travel , even if a little CGI is needed.<br /><br />The story is also a winner , offering a human face to what is often seen as a stereotypical genre of movie villain . Law is surprisingly menacing as the almost mechanical killer Maguire and proves that you do n't have to be Cagney or De Niro or Brando to play a gangster . The film is decidedly noir - ish , driving rain and ill - lit warehouses predominate but at least violence and killing are ( finally ) seen to have an emotional and psychological impact on those who perpetrate and those who merely witness such acts . The whole thing is evocative of a previous age and previous movies but it sweeps away the old and refreshes with a modern tale of redemption amid the Tommy - Gun shootouts and extortion rackets . It can feel a little slow in places , especially if you 're used to masses of gun - play in movies like most modern audiences ( like yours truly ) but sometimes , words can speak louder than actions . Mendes has delivered a fine follow - up to his Oscar - winning debut , a film which is as intelligent as it is beautiful to watch . " Road To Perdition " may not be to everyone 's tastes but this is one DVD I shall not be exchanging anytime soon .
1 I loved this film ! I 'm a true Tom Hanks fan , and I have always been impressed with all of his work . From his most dramatic roles like Cast Away , The Green Mile , Saving Private Ryan , Forrest Gump , Apollo 13 & Philadelphia . To his hilarious roles like A League of Their Own , Turner and Hooch , Catch Me If You Can , The Lady Killers , Big & of course Toy Story . But in this film Hanks is n't the only great actor who lights up the screen . Tyler Hoechlin , an up and coming star who shows great promise in Hollywood co stars as Hanks son and delivers nothing short of a great performance . He is certainly someone to watch out for over his career , I believe he will do great things . Paul Newman as always delivers a brilliant performance on screen . He is truly a legend . We ca n't forget the people who did n't have such big roles in the film , but still helped make it great . The beautiful & very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh , who 's performance in Bastard Out of Carolina & Single White Female I will never forget , brings her grace to the screen as Hank 's wife in the film and does a superb job . Liam Aiken is another found treasure in film . He does such a great job with such a small role , and like his roles in Lemony Snickets , and Sweet November , and I Dreamed Of Africa he gives a great performance .
1 This is the first Tom Hanks movie I have gotten the privilege of seeing in the theater , although he is my favorite . When I heard he was going to play a hit - man , I was a little stunned thinking " can Mr. Hanks pull this one off " ? And he did in high fashion . This 1930 's depression era film is a about loyalty , redemption , and one path that you do n't want your children stumbling down . Tom Hanks leads a stellar cast as Michael Sullivan . Being the family man , and the secret life of the contract killer for the Oscar nominated Paul Newman . This movie Tom Hanks relies more on reaction and gaze rather than dialogue , which he delivers a knockout performance.<br /><br />On one night of one of his jobs , Michael 's son Michael Jr. , played by newcomer Tyler Hoechlin , witnesses the hit . And Michael Sr . 's partner in crime , fellow stage actor Daniel Craig ca n't have that information out . So he wacks out the son and wife of Michael Sr . , except Michael Jr. So the two head for Chicago to get Conner Rooney(son of Paul Newman 's Mr. Rooney).<br /><br />The drama and intense plot really thickens from their as father trys to set things right , even though son is along for the ride . While on this deadly journey , someone has hired a hit for Michael Sr . The assassin would be the photographer of the deceased Harlen Maguire , played by a stain - teethed Jude Law.<br /><br />The movie will have you feeling the old days . And with Thomas Newman 's beautiful and haunting Oscar nominated score to go along with it , you ca n't help but appreciate this film from Oscar winning director Sam Mendes . So sit back , and enjoy the wild ride .
1 i think that this film is brilliant.there are many reasons why but these are some of them 1)the good acting by Tom and Tyler 2 ) brilliant machine gun scene that was a piece of brilliance 3 ) i thought that the ending was a good twist because i never expected that at the end all credit to Sam Mendes.as well as a these 3 points the film form of the film is good as well . i am a film student at college and we studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films i have seen in many years . i 'd just like to say a big thank you to all of the people involved in making this film . lastly i would like to say the best scene in the film is the machine gun scene where John Rooney gets kill it is just pure brilliance in shooting the scene in silence until John Rooney says " i 'm glad it 's you " it is a lot better like that i think because the viewer creates there own sound and that sound is totally different for every viewer just brilliant.<br /><br />thank you for reading this comment written by Ross Kirk aged 16
1 This is a beautiful film . The true tale of bond between father and son . This is by far , Tom Hanks at his finest . Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie . He usually has the nice guy roles . Yet in this film , he comes off in this film as a bit gritty , but still emerges smelling like a rose , even until the very last scene , the assassination of his character . The cast of this movie was well put together . I also love the part when there is total silence when Tom Hanks ' character shoots and kills all of the men in Mr. Rooney 's group . There is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene , just simply emotion . I love the look on John Rooney , Paul Newman 's character 's face when he realizes even before seeing him , that it is Tom Hanks 's character getting revenge , and he knows his fate has come . The first time I saw this movie I was blown away and knew I had to go out and get the video and I since have , adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is my favorite actor , so this film has a special place in me .
1 Tom Hanks has been in such hit movies as Forrest Gump , Saving Private Ryan , and The Green Mile . For the most part , his roles have been good guys that we cheer for . In Road to Perdition , his character Michael Sullivanis a little bit different.<br /><br />In Sam Mendes ' film Road to Perdition based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins , he shows the story of a man and his son on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago . What is different about this little road trip is that Sullivan is a hit - man who is now being hunted by his former partner . His boss or ex - boss John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) loves him almost more than his own son , Sullivan 's partner Connor ( Daniel Craig).<br /><br />After a job done the wrong way because of Connor , the only witness to his mistake are Sullivan and his son who was n't supposed to be there . So Connor tries to take out Sullivan and his family , but only gets the wife and other son Peter . Sullivan outsmarts the hit and rushes home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table ... just sitting . With his wife and child dead , Sullivan takes to the road to find answers.<br /><br />The story follows the two as Sullivan tries to make things right in memory of his wife and kid , and for Michael who feels like he is to blame for all this . He feels his curiosity killed his mother and brother . Tyler Hoechlin does a terrific job as Michael Jr. He brings maturity and also a sense of still being juvenile . His loss of innocence is well acted out as he travels from town to town , leaving nothing behind him.<br /><br />Mendes ' previous hit film was American Beauty which received five Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director . This film did n't do nearly as well at the Oscars only winning one award for best cinematography but receiving five other nominations for music , sound , and a Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Paul Newman . This picture is a great story that takes you on a ride through the Midwest and into the legend of Mike Sullivan : husband , hit - man , and devoted father . This movie is a sleeper film that should be watched for years to come .
1 An excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspects of that era . I loved the visuals -- very fitting for a story connected to a graphic novel.<br /><br />I thought Tom Hanks was really great in this , he came across very well as someone who has been hardened by his work ( which he did n't fully choose for himself ) but still wants to have a normal life for his family . He does the best he can to see that happen . DOn't want to spoil the plot -- but YOU HAVE TO SEE this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot 'em up action / gangster format . ( It is violent though . )
1 This is an excellent film!Tom Hanks and Paul Newman performed great!I was really surprised when Newman was beating on his son!That was a great scene and the shooting scenes were staged good . I was very surprised about the end . Rent this film today as it is one of Tom Hanks ' best !
1 Tom Hanks like you 've never seen him before . Hanks plays Michael Sullivan , " The Angel of Death " . He is a hitman for his surrogate father John Rooney(Paul Newman)an elderly Irish mob boss . Sullivan 's young son(Tyler Hoechlin)witnesses what his father does for a living and both are soon on the road for seven weeks robbing banks to avenge the murder of Sullivan 's wife and other son . Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer willing to kill Sullivan himself for the chance to add to his collection of photos of dead mobsters . Filmed beautifully catching the drama of life in the 30 's . Sometimes the pace bogs down , but then a burst of graphic violence sustains the story . Director Sam Mendes directs this powerful drama about loyalty , responsibility , betrayal and the bonding of a secretive man and his young son . Other notable cast members are : Dylan Baker , Stanley Tucci , Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh . Hanks again proves to be excellent in a very memorable movie . Make room for some Oscars !
1 One of my favorite movies , with a very nostalgic ending . The movie is about the Sullivan family , obviously Michael Sullivan ( the father ) is one of the main members of the mafia , the killer to say it this way , and an expert one . One of the kids wants to know the work of his father ( a terrible mistake ) , so he hides on his father 's car and well , he sees Tom Hanks in action to say it this way.<br /><br />Mafia does n't rules , in Mafia nobody wins , when they want you out , they take you out . Of course you can see anyone who works at the mafia with a giant house , the best car in the world , whatever you like , but make a wrong work , or make something your " boss " does n't want , and you 're fired , and killed.<br /><br />You can see what I mean in the movie , Sullivan Jr. sees something he did n't had to see , and well , almost all his family gets killed for that " wrong thing " his son did . The movie is really entertaining , you see how the Sullivan 's live after being chased by the mafia , or kinda of that.<br /><br />This movie is kinda of sad , shows us about revenge , those dirty works people do , almost everything you like . Hopefully the guy is reading this comment does n't works for the mafia , and if you work at the mafia make yourself a favor and get the hell out of the country before you get killed by your boss and their workers.<br /><br />This movie receives : 10/10
1 This is one of the best movies I 've ever seen . It has very good acting by Hanks , Newman , and everyone else . Definitely Jude Law 's best performance . The cinematography is excellent , the editing is about as good , and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie . The production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special . To me , it takes a lot to beat Godfather , but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest . Definitely a Best Picture nominee in my book .
1 A great gangster film . Sam Mendes has directed this beautiful movie showing another father - son camaraderie . Brilliant star - cast leading with Tom Hanks(Michael Sullivan ) has done a terrific job . Great acting by him again . He is an acting legend . Great acting too from Paul Newman , Jude Law and Daniel Craig . Casting is just too good . The plot is quite good . You will enjoy the movie . A great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930's . Set in the 1930's , this will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that era . Soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie . A great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son . Way underrated for my liking . Deserved a fully deserved 10 .
1 This is a film that can make you want to see it again . I especially , liked the way it ended . I did not see the end coming , but when Laws was not blown away the first time , one suspects he will be back again.<br /><br />The story is gripping and could have been more psychological , but I understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was necessary for that.<br /><br />Hard to believe Michael Jr. could be so apparently unmoved as his younger brother and mother as blown away . But , I can appreciate the scene play could n't really take our attention there because it had a greater story to tell.<br /><br />Some have complained about Hanks as a gangster . I believe that is n't justified . If his character had been any harder , he would not have cared if his son pulled a trigger or not.<br /><br />Eight Stars for this one . Although it was released in 2002 , I just saw it for the first time yesterday on DVD .
1 A bloody gangster story which takes place in the years of Great Depression . It tells us about another notorious hit - man , Michael ( Mike ) Salliwan . Somehow , this time the story turns the other way round : Mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son , because the rest of his family was killed due to dirty game of his own boss . He succeeds in his revenge and secures honorable future to his son , but gets killed in the end . Such stories never have happy end after all.<br /><br />The role of Mike Salliwan senior was wonderfully played by Tom Hanks , and the part of Mr. Rooney ( the Mafia boss ) was performed by Paul Newman . The film makes a great impression , and we hear the well - known phrase " we rob banks " . This film is still worth watching although you could have expected something bigger from Sam Mendes after his American Beauty .
1 In the winter of 1931 , supposedly 12-year - old Tyler Hoechlin ( as Michael Sullivan Jr. ) wonders what his mobster father Tom Hanks ( Michael " Mike " Sullivan ) does for a living . Young Hoechlin follows Mr. Hanks to " work " one evening , and witnesses him blasting away some rival gangsters . This leads - in a VERY roundabout way - to " Godfather "- type Paul Newman ( as John Rooney ) hiring independent hit - man Jude Law ( as Harlen Maguire ) to track down Hoechlin and Hanks , who are off to cool their heels in Chicago . Hanks thinks they will be safe with a relative , which is puzzling when you consider the characters ' line of work.<br /><br />Looking uncannily like Paul Peterson ( " The Donna Reed Show " ) , Hoechlin does a terrific job for director Sam Mendes ; and , getting to work with this cast makes him the luckiest young actor of 2002 . But , the most striking thing about " Road to Perdition " is the stunning cinematography of Conrad L. Hall , which deservedly won a career capping " Academy Award " for the late photographer . Mr. Hall 's work is truly superlative . This helps make up for the overall impression of a measured , contrived staginess to both the narrative and visuals . The deviating end is abruptly uplifting ( the unrelated dog is an example of the aforementioned staginess).<br /><br / > * * * * * * * * Road to Perdition ( 7/12/02 ) Sam Mendes ~ Tom Hanks , Tyler Hoechlin , Paul Newman , Jude Law
1 Wow , this movie was absolutely brilliant . I really do n't know why everyone says it has a slow pace . I thought the pace was perfect . The movie is about Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks with perfection who is a sort of hit - man/ killer working for John Rooney ( Paul Newman ) . He disslikes this job but does it because Rooney payed for his house and helps him financially . He had nothing and Mr. Rooney gave him everything . But , his children are unaware that this is his job , and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him , he is placed in an awkward position . And when an atrocity occurs , he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge . They rob abanks and much more and build a bond . They 're the perfect team . Hanks does a great job as always as well as Jude Law who plays his creepy role to perfection . This drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the 1930s were .
1 In a poor village in Mexico , the Colonel ( Fernando Luján ) lives with his asthmatic wife Lola ( Marisa Paredes ) in an old house . Lola still grieves the death of their son Augustin some time ago . The colonel has been expecting for his pension of fighter in a war against Catholic church for almost twenty - seven years . However , for political reasons , the present government wants to forget this old fight . Without having any possession or money , but a valuable gamecock , they struggle to survival with the expectation of the acknowledgement letter from the government , recognizing the law and paying for the delayed pension . This slow and touching movie reflects the social and financial situation of most of the elder retired persons in third world countries . In Brazil , most of the retired persons has to survive with about US$ 80,00 per month . The debts of the colonel in the story were made to pay for a graveyard for his son , otherwise he would be buried as an indigent . Outstanding performance of the cast , in a very sad story that is reality in the poor countries . My vote is eight . < br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : ( ` Não se Escreve ao Coronel ' ) ( Do not Write to the Colonel)<br /><br / >
1 the government that he fought to establish to recognize his loyalty with a promised and much needed pension . Ripstein 's lyrical work is a sweet ode to all those who , like the Colonel , suffer under the abuses of a cynical and hardened society that strengthens itself by denying its citizens the means to live with dignity and purpose . Unlike the absurdity of WAITING FOR GODOT , the Colonel 's wait for the arrival of his pension gives hope and significance to his otherwise miserable life . Two things in the film drive the Colonel who is masterfully played by Fernando Lujan ; the hope that his military pension will one day arrive and the knowledge that his son , Agustin , died for a noble cause , a reason other than a drunken fracas at a rigged cockfight . Unable to realize the former , and forced to prove to the world the latter , the Colonel does the only thing he can do , set about training his son 's fighting cock . The cock is now the warrior who can bring fortune and justice to the Colonel and his asthmatic wife , but his fighting ring is that of the killer of his former owner , Agustin . In a tense scene of confrontation between the Colonel and Nogales , his son 's killer , the Colonel is offered by Nogales , a paid government agent , money enough to equal the Colonel 's full pension . But , this is blood money ; hush money designed to hide the fact that those in power have turned their backs on one who fought for their political ideals , and to conceal to the world that the warrior colonel 's son was assassinated because he wrote for an underground paper that favored the rights of labor unions and the common man . With maximum dignity , the Colonel rejects Nogales ' offer , picks up his fighting rooster and walks away as nobly as his old legs can carry him . Once he is at home , Dona Lola , his scolding wife , wants to know why the Colonel refused the money when both of them are starving . In response to her continued question , " What are we going to eat until November ( when the cockfighting season begins ) " , the Colonel responds , " Shit . " Excrement is what the poor and disenfranchised have been eating all of their lives , and excrement is a meal that the Colonel willingly chooses to eat with dignity , knowing that he could never sell his soul to those who oppress him . The Colonel waits as the only man of honor and valor in a world without principles .
1 A sober , reflexive piece , a little miniature which blossoms into a magnificent humane pictorial sequence which goes beyond a mere dramatization for the screen . This quiet little story will hold you enthralled - if you do not have too many problems with the various Spanish accents ranging from Mexican to Peruvian , and Marisa Paredes ' more authentic Iberian Peninsular usage ! Garcíadiego has accomplished a perfect adaptation from the novel : even the grand maestro García Márquez should be proud of her superb work . And hats off to Arturo Ripstein who has so ably concerted the whole effort into a gem , a ruby , and so refined , so elegant , so sensitive , so touchingly ..... <br /><br />El Coronel - Fernando Luján - is waiting to get his pension , while he continues to live in his ramshackle timber dwelling deep in the Colombian jungle ( however , filmed elsewhere , NOT in Colombia ) with his fighting cock and his wife ( in that order ? ) . And that is all there is to it.<br /><br />But , oh , so much more .... This film is a rhapsody.<br /><br />I must see this poetic little piece again as soon as possible . Worth the high side of 8 out of 10 , which is very high on my scale.<br /><br />This is not light commercial Hollywood stuff .
1 This is a truly magnificent and heartwrenching film ! ! ! ! Ripstein 's locations are spectacular , extremely detailed and well lit , the dialogue is extraordinarily García Márquez , no doubt about it . Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give us outstanding performances as the colonel and his wife.<br /><br />You must see it ! ! !
1 As many people know , Mexican cinema was very poor after the so - called Golden Age of the Mexican Cinema , fortunately , during the late 90 's , and early 21st century , great movies like La Ley de Herodes , Bajo California , Amores Perros , Y Tu Mamá También and , of course , El Coronel No Tiene Quien le Escriba , appeared . El Coronel ... , is a wonderful movie , that retells the classic story by Gabriel García Márquez , by eliminating the magic realism elements , and replacing them with the crude reality lived in Mexico , not only by people like the Colonel , who wait for their pensions , but by more than the half of the Mexican population , who live in complete poverty . The film 's characters , satirically represent classic characters found in Mexican society , such as the nationalist Colonel , the cold and even ambitious priest , the hypocrite , but at the same time loyal compadre , the tolerant and patient wife , the hidden homosexual , etc . This movie , is a must - see if you want to know more about Mexican society , and specially , if you want to watch a gorgeous movie , by one of Mexico 's finest directors
1 a bit slow and boring , the tale of an old man and his wife living a delapidated building and interacting with a fixed cast of characters like the mailman , the brothers sitting on the porch , the wealthy cigar smoking man . The photography of the river is marvelous , as is the interior period decoration . If you like decoration of Banana Republic stores , this is a must .
1 I liked this movie very much . Although this movie does n't boast of big ( or even known ) names , its very charming . Its one of those feel good types where you know that everythings gon na be just fine in the end . My favorite scene is with the baby elephant part . I rate this movie at 7.5
1 I had seen this movie when it got released , and when I was 12 years old :) And I still vividly recollect the wonderful scenes of how the hero / heroine escape every time when faced with danger :) And the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain ! I think many so - called action movies copied a lot many " escape scenes " from this movie ! ! And not only does it never impress me when I see such copying , it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece ! :) The lead actors have acted wonderfully . The slow and realistic development of the chemistry b / w the hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed . As children , we felt that the love that developed b / w them was very natural :) The way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can make even kids realize the value of true love , sacrifice and caring . I recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance ! ! --Vijay .
1 I saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer Mccomb . It was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of Africa and of course Mccomb . At that time I was thrilled watching this movie and from then onwards I am trying for VCD of this film but I am unable to find it . Huge African lions makes appearance int his film and we will be spell bounded simply by the size of those animals and grace of them . All section of audience can watch this movie particularly children will enjoy this film . But some scenes involving Mccomb forces parental guidance for this film . It is a enjoyable holiday movie for one and all .
1 A boy and a girl is chased by a local warrior because the boy killed ( by accident ) the warriors father ( or whoever he was ) . And they travel through the nature of Africa 's most ruff areas.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is n't that good ( except for that elephant kid ) . But it 's a very good adventure and it 's not very censored , there is some blood , flesh and nudity ( which lighten up the movie a bit).<br /><br />I give this movie a 7 because of it 's picture of the African nature and it 's action .
1 " Painting is seeing , then remembering better than you saw . " So says Dick Heldar ( Ronald Colman ) , the painter in The Light That Failed . The movie is in the grand old Hollywood style , starring Ronald Colman and a bravura supporting cast that includes Ida Lupino in her first important role , dependable character actor Dudley Digges ( who also co - starred with Colman in Condemned.),and a solid performance by the wonderful actor Walter Huston.<br /><br />The title and opening sequences of the film pretty much give away the fact that Dick will lose his sight . He 's blinded by gun powder discharge as he and childhood sweetheart Maisie ( Muriel Angelus ) are playing with a pistol . Later a wound while fighting in the Sudan is the catalyst for his blindness . He becomes a famous painter , but he 's already blinded by ambition , and does n't really reach his full potential until the point that his sight is leaving him . Enter bad girl Bessie ( Ida Lupino ) , and his self destruction is set in motion . Lupino is very powerful in this role and plays off Colman very well . Her evil tart reminds me of Bette Davis in Of Human Bondage . < br /><br />Well acted and well directed , this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas .
1 Absolutely fantastic trash .... this one has it all : nudity , good fight scenes , gore , action , explosions etc . It also stars the wonderful Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga as the other reviewer pointed out - although Olga turns into Ingrid later on in the film ( you 'll have to watch it to see what I mean).<br /><br />I wo n't bother to go into the story as it 's far too long winded and not very interesting . The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo ( Robert Ginty ) is interesting - watch the towel stealing scene to see what I mean.<br /><br />The fight scenes were at once quite good and then spoilt by some really shoddy gore effects that looked like they were done by the team who did City of the Walking Dead ( i.e. strange coloured blood gushing out of neck wounds).<br /><br />I'd advise fans of low budget trash to check it out if they can track down a copy - its pretty rare though and I could n't ever see anyone bothering to re - release it so it 'll become all the rarer in a few years.<br /><br />Anyway I 'd recommend it solely for Belinda Mayne 's great nude scenes ! That lady 's a fox !
1 What can you say about the film White Fire . Amazing ? Fantastic ? Disturbing ? Hilarious ? These words are not big enough to describe the event which is White Fire . From wobbly , garbled beginning to profound end , this movie will entertain throughout.<br /><br />Our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world . A family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms . When the father separates from the mother and their childen , you get a real sense of what kind of movie you 're about to watch . Father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit , and is polite as he gets people 's attention before he shoots them , but alas , dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised , unsafe stunt . Meanwhile , mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about 5 feet behind them . He too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre " HALT ! " , and then promptly wastes the mother . This action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes Bo and Ingred.<br /><br />So now we fast forward about 20 years ( 30 if you 're honest about the hero 's age ) to beautiful Turkey , where Bo and Ingred have settled as professional thieves , or diamond prospectors , or something . Ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods , while Bo ( masterfully played by the dynamic Robert Ginty ) drives around the desert in his denim outfits . Bo and Ingrid have an interesting relationship . They do n't seem to have any friends other than each other , and they spend all of their time together . That coupled with the fact that Bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as " you know its a shame you 're my sister " he says to her while she 's stark naked , make for a very dynamic duo . Bo is then crushed when Ingrid is killed , as he wanders the beaches of Turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf . A renewal of hope occurs when Bo finds a girl who looks like Ingrid , and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like Ingrid . This opens the door for Bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong . Bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas , and he is overjoyed with his new love.<br /><br />So anyway , there 's a lot of fun action scenes , ridiculous violence , great acting , impossible to follow plot - lines , Fred " the hammer " Williamson ( for some reason ) , and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond ( which later explodes ) . All of these things are great , but the Bo and Ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special .... really special . So I heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is White Fire . You may be glad you did .. or not .
1 Superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious 80 's exploitation , hooray ! The pre - credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we 're dealing with a serious and harrowing drama , but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we 're up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles , rough fist - fights , lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity ! Bo and Ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship . Can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister 's naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes ? Well , Bo does that to his sister and , judging by her dubbed laughter , she does n't mind at all . Sick , dude ! Anyway , as kids they fled from Russia with their parents , but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy . A friendly smuggler took custody over them , however , and even raised and trained Bo and Ingrid into expert smugglers . When the actual plot lifts off , 20 years later , they 're facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable White Fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine . Very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of " White Fire " , but it sure is a lot of fun to watch . Most of the time you have no clue who 's beating up who or for what cause ( and I bet the actors understood even less ) but whatever ! The violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded . The script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly  and I wo n't reveal for what reason  Bo needs a replacement for Ingrid and Fred Williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes . Bo 's principal opponent is an Italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent , the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film , there 's the obligatory " we're - falling - in - love " montage and loads of other attractions ! My God , what a brilliant experience . The original French title translates itself as " Life to Survive " , which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie : None !
1 WHITE FIRE was recommended to me by a guy who owns it on two separate DVD releases and on VHS . He claimed it 's one of the funniest and coolest low budget actioners ever made . I generally do n't watch movies knowing that they 're going to be bad , but I made an exception for this one ... and I was very glad that I did.<br /><br />It 's filled to the brim with action ( much of it surprisingly , graphically gory ) , sleaze ( isolated to nudity with a key female character , but there 's so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious ) and outrageously awkward dialogue , all of which adds to the laughter - inducing tone of the film.<br /><br />Ginty , the unusual looking star of THE EXTERMINATOR ( and countless other low budget action turds ) is amusing in the lead , giving the best performance he could muster . Williamson is better than usual , clearly hamming it up with unparalleled glee ( and he does n't come in until midway through ) . The rest of the cast is also fun to watch , particularly the villains , one of whom is a sadistic sexpot who speaks with an accent that appears to be a mish - mash of Spanish and Italian . She 's priceless.<br /><br />Again , I ca n't stress enough how gory it was . It 's not so bloody that it 's nauseating , but it 's uncommonly violent in parts with some meaty squibs going off in the shootouts and it has a grueling torture sequence that no man will soon forget . Also , when Ginty is being swarmed by a pack of bad guys , he conveniently gets a hold of a chainsaw and the splatter moments that follow will have any and all action fans cheering and spilling their beers.<br /><br />Don't miss WHITE FIRE . It 's a rollicking - if mind - numbingly stupid - action classic .
1 White Fire has so much going for it . With Larry Bird look - alike Robert Ginty leading the charge blazing away with his fabulous hair and super macho mustache , the movie soars above other low - budget actioners . The charisma he has in this makes Tom Selleck look like a putz . With Ginty beating up everyone , the movie only rises in awesomeness when a story of diamond intrigue enters into play . Then add in Fred Williamson , some frontal bush , chainsaw attacks and some awesome incest themes .... this flick ends up delivering on all cylinders . If you 're looking for some awesome B - Action , this is where it 's at . Now , if I can just get my hands on that soundtrack .
1 This film was enjoyable but for the wrong reasons . The co - ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments . Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together near the end , where Williamson says to Ginty , " you sure do get around buddy boy ! " . I did enjoy this film only for Ginty and Williamson , but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest ad - libbed most likely . A film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so . It seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film , maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look . The one thing this film does have going for it is that it is quite violent , so that tripled with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty make for a film worth seeing .
1 Henri Verneuil 's film may be not so famous as Parallax View , 3 Days of the Condor or JFK but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre . Action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed . After several years of investigation , special government commission decides that president was killed by a lone gunman . But one man - prosecutor Volney , played by Yves Montand - thinks there 's something more to be investigated and so the film starts . This movie does n't deal with some exact theories , but it embraces the whole structure of relationship between government and society in today 's world . Such film could be made only in the 1970-ies but it will never lose it 's actuality . Furthermore , it 's even a bit frightful how precise are it 's oracles . 10 out of 10 .
1 First time I saw this movie was in the eighties , but reviewed now this thriller is still actual . Some newer movies focus on similar topics , but they do not match this french milestone.<br /><br />A president - obviously JF Kennedy - gets shot in an open car during a public appearance . The resulting huge investigation finds the " Lee Harvey Oswald " figure of this movie guilty , but one member of the jury insists in further inquiry . He reveals some surprising evidence ... < br /><br />Unlike Oliver Stone 's JFK - a movie with the same plot - this one does not play with emotions , but concentrates in a exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits together , drawing a new picture of the assassination . Even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene . Compared to JFK this movie is more reasonable , intelligent and thrilling . Parts of the plot can be found in a lot of newer movies , I had a kind of deja vu sometimes sitting in the cinema.<br /><br />"I ... comme Icare " is a " must see " . Its unique and brilliant , and the music by Ennio Morricone is wonderful . This movie deserves a very good ranking , if it was a Hollywood production it would be famous for sure.<br /><br / >
1 I 'm not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made . The story takes place in a fictional state , but obviously it deals with the murder of Kennedy . A truthful and honest district attorney ( played by Yves Montand ) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man Daslow ( = Oswald ) and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his team.<br /><br />The screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end . Just the part dealing with the Milgram experiment about authorities is ( though not uninteresting ) a bit out of place . The ending sequence - explaining who Icarus really is - partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a Morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence I have ever seen in a movie .
1 Highly memorable , intelligent and suspenseful movie from one of French movies ' true geniuses , the formidably able Henri Verneuil . The plot is an exact parallel of the JFK assassination , and takes place in a non - descript , fictional country . The film , visually as well as plot - wise , is razor - sharp . Shot with meticulous precision , it follows Henry Volnay , the Procuror who takes on himself to unravel the coup . In many ways , it 's a very disturbing movie , not the least for the cold and analytical precision of its comment on a so - called modern state 's inner workings . The atmosphere and characters are all utterly believable , and Verneuil left nothing to chance in its tight plotting . On another level , this relatively little - known movie just had a 15 years head - start on Oliver Stone , who was acclaimed for the " JFK " movie , a inferior film in many areas , the least of which not being credibility ... <br /><br />It 's a masterpiece , any cinema lover should see it , preferably in its original French version with subs .
1 The first time I saw this film , I was in shock for days afterwards . Its painstaking and absorbing treatment of the subject holds the attention , helped by good acting and some really intriguing music . The ending , quite simply , had me gasping . First rate !
1 Finally a thriller which omits the car chases , explosions and other eye catching effects . The movie combines a simple plot ( assasination of a french president ) with an excellent background . It takes a look behind mans behavior with authorities , and explains why we would obey almost every order ( even murder ) which would be given to us.<br /><br />Furthermore it shows us how secret services can manipulate the run of history and how hardly they can be controlled . The best thing on this movie is , that there is no classic " Hollywood end " which can easily be predicted .
1 I saw this film for the very first time several years ago - and was hooked up in an instant . It is great and much better than J. F. K. cause you always have to think ' Can it happen to me ? Can I become a murderer ? ' You can not turn of the TV or your VCR without thinking about the plot and the end , which you should'nt miss under any circumstances .
1 this movie I saw some 10 years ago ( maybe more ) , I took it in a rental and never found it to buy even in French sites . The end is very surprising and intelligent . I would like very much to watch it again because I think it 's as surpring as the Sixth Sense althogh a completely different kind of movie .
1 This is a must see for anybody who loves thriller 's specially political thriller . One scene that stands out is Milgram experiment it is shot to perfection very rarely do we get to see a movie shot and scripted the way this movie is presented.<br /><br />The movie starts with a Kennedy like assassination and a three member team is constituted to investigate the assassination . However one of the member does not agree with the final findings of the committee . As per the terms set that member would initiate a one man investigation into the assassination . This investigation gets him involved in into to deep and dark secrets of high office politics and the way they are controlled .
1 Henri Verneuil represented the commercial cinema in France from 1960 - 1980 . Always strong at the box - office , and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies , mafia score - settling and World War II battles , Verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on Saturday night . He worked with the cream of the male actors of his day : Gabin , Belmondo , Fernandel , Delon , Sharif , Anthony Quinn . I ... comme Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand . It 's an oddly static film , taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms , containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence.<br /><br />Montand gives a good performance , if somewhat dry , and he is well supported by the other actors . I could n't help wondering what Costa - Gavras could have done with this story , on the basis of Z ( the Lambrakis assassination ) and L'aveu ( the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists ) .
1 Xiao Chen Zhi Chun is a great movie , not only in the year it was shot but also now . It 's an art movie which is not outdated even in 21st century . The director maintained a good narrative skill and thus made the story so smooth!<br /><br />The movie reminds me of the later French new wave movie : Francois Truffaut 's " Femme d'a cote " which is of the similar topic .
1 mature intelligent and highly charged melodrama unbelivebly filmed in China in 1948 . wei wei 's stunning performance as the catylast in a love triangle is simply stunning if you have the oppurunity to see this magnificent film take it
1 Tian 's remake is no good at all . I only click on his remake documentary to see Wei Wei , the original actress back in the classic 1948 film say a few words to the crew . We are going to meet Wei Wei this Sunday ( 28/3/2010 ) after the showing of Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun in the Hong Kong Film Archiev . Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair , her cameo appearance in Hong Kong films is always a surprise to her fans . In this year 's Hong Kong Film Festival , a special program is dedicated to Fei Mu , director of this epic movie and Wei Wei 's still shot from the movie is being seen all around in Hong Kong . My son , who turns 21 this year , is surprised Wei Wei was so beautiful then .
1 This is a nice little movie with a nice story , that plays the most important role in the entire movie.<br /><br />It 's a quite intriguing dramatic story , with also romance present in it . The story is being told slowly but this works out all too well for its build up . The characters are nice and portrayed nicely by its actors . Normally I 'm not a too big fan of the Asian acting style but the acting in this movie was simply good.<br /><br />Of course the movie is quite different in its approach and style from other genre movies , produced in the west . In a way this movie is more advanced already with its approach than the western movies made during the same era.<br /><br />I only wished the movie its visual style would had been a bit better . For a movie that is considered a kind of an art - house movie this movie is certainly lacking in some well looking sequences . This was obviously a quite cheap movie to make and it got made quite generically . Not that this is a bad thing , it just prevent this movie from truly distinct itself and raising itself above the genre.<br /><br />But oh well , this movie is all about its well constructed story and characters that are in it . In that regard this movie most certainly does not disappoint.<br /><br />8/10
1 This is a film about deep and unspoken human relationships.<br /><br />Eventually they do become spoken , but is there a chance to change anything about the situation.<br /><br />Originally made in Shanghai 1948 and quite free of propaganda the film introduces us to the Dai Family . There is still some weight about the history that surrounds the family . History usually has weight in Chinese literature and serious film.<br /><br />A young married couple - Liyan , an invalid , and his wife Yuwen live in a once great family compound that is partially ruined.<br /><br />A bright contrast is Liyan 's young sister who can not really remember the past of the family but accepts everything in quite a natural way . Her spirit is as bright as the other two are reserved.<br /><br />Into this apparently stable world comes an unexpected visitor ... <br /><br />I ended up feeling quite sad - but definitely a superior film .
1 For Romance 's sake , as a married man . The following two films are recommended.<br /><br />1 . Brief Encounter by David Lean ( 1945 ) , UK < br /><br />Well , when a woman goes to a railway station , something may happen . And it happened ! How she longed to be there , in a little tavern waiting for the man of her dreams . But she was married ... the man was a stranger to the fantasizing woman < br /><br />2 . Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu ( 1948 ) , China < br /><br />Well , when a woman goes to the market to buy fish , grocery and medicine , passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town , there is much to think about , about the melancholy of her life , her sick husband in self - pity and lack of future ... Just when a jubilant young doctor arrived , something happened ... the doctor was a high school honey of the fantasizing woman < br /><br />In both movies , from great directors of UK and China , the passion vs restraint was so intense , yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any physical contacts . That leaves you with a great after - taste , sniffing it intensely without biting it .
1 The most satisfying element about " Dan in Real Life " is that the relationship between Dan ( Steve Carell ) and Marie ( Juliette Binoche ) makes sense and is beautifully realistic . The casting of Oscar - winner Juliette Binoche as Dan 's love interest was a superb decision ; she is exceptionally talented , intelligent , naturally attractive and , thank goodness , appropriately aged for the part ! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson , it would have been a disaster.<br /><br />Another wonderful aspect about " Dan in Real Life " is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the " frat pack " formula : dumb chicks , chauvinistic guys , and sleazy jokes . " Dan in Real Life " is witty and has fun , intelligent laughs throughout . Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing , the jokes from " Dan in Real Life " are more natural and clever , and involve some thinking on the part of the audience.<br /><br />My only problem with " Dan in Real Life " is that the rebellious , middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson . It 's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director . Either way , her character is unrealistic and annoying . But , this is only a minor flaw in the film , and does not take away from the story as a whole.<br /><br />All in all , " Dan in Real Life " is a great film , a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed - down comedies . The quality of the writing , directing , acting , and ( especially ) cinematography is excellent . It is simply a beautiful , light - hearted comedy .
1 I got to see this film at a preview and was dazzled by it . It 's not the typical romantic comedy . I ca n't remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it . The laughs are n't gags here -- they're observations , laughs of recognition , little shocks of " Oh , my God , I thought I was the only one who felt that way ! " I wo n't give away the plot , which is more than just " Guy falls in love with his brother 's girlfriend . " The whole family plays a part in the relationship here . Probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since " While You Were Sleeping . " < br /><br />Steve Carell goes much deeper than he 's gone before , and for the first time I really liked him . The cast is amazing , a list of veteran theater actors whom I 've loved in other roles , but they blend to make a convincing family . Dianne Wiest is lovely as the mother , Juliette Binoche is luminous and hilarious ( who knew she was funny ? ) , and even the reviled Dane Cook gives a warm , quiet , touching performance . The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition , and I 'll buy the CD the second it 's available.<br /><br />Don't miss this one .
1 I was lucky enough to see this at a pre - screening last night ( Oct. 20 ) and I was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and genuinely heart felt acting.<br /><br />While the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally new , the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh , unique , and distinctly " indy " in style . It is n't something that can easily be compared to films of the past , it 's a unique take on a sort of classic middle - aged depressed love story.<br /><br />I was particularly struck by the casting of the film . Down to every last extra in the family , it was a beautiful and talented cast . The three daughters did a wonderful job , the talent was evenly dispersed between them and none of them " out - shone " the other two.<br /><br />It was truly a delightful film , appropriate for all ages and laugh out loud funny while also being truly touching and heart warming . It was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and nudity of recent films .
1 Marie : You are smooth . Dan : No , I 'm not smooth . I 'm Dan.<br /><br />If you 're anything like me , smooth and single do not go together . You see someone you like , rare enough as that can be , and you want to say something but you do n't . Or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you 've ever said in your life . More often then not though , you stare from afar and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life  a risk . You ca n't blame a guy for being a little frightened though . Maybe he 's been burned hard before or maybe he 's trying to focus all his energy on his career . There are reasons , some valid , some not , and all of them can be interpreted as excuses rather than reason . You tell yourself you do n't need it or it is n't the right time for you but you still wish it were happening . Any way you break it down , it 's not easy . Sound familiar ? If you thought yes even just a little , then DAN IN REAL LIFE , the new comedy from director Peter Hedges , is a must - see . It will reach inside of you and somehow manage to both break and warm your heart all at once.<br /><br />The Dan from the title is Dan Burns ( Steve Carell ) , an advice columnist who is admired for his insight into living a balanced , fulfilling and morally uplifting life . Four years or so before the film opens on Dan waking up to his day , he lost his wife and love of his life . After that tragedy , Dan was left to raise their three daughters alone . Between that and focusing on his career , finding love again was not one of Dan 's priorities . And so he became more functional than feeling . Removed from the power of intimacy , Dan no longer knows what it means to be that close to someone and has resigned himself to never knowing that again . That is , until he meets Marie ( Juliette Binoche ) in a book and tackle shop in Connecticut on a quiet morning . They 're interaction is casual , comfortable and it catches both of them off guard . There is only one problem really . She is already seeing someone . Unfortunately for all involved , that someone is Dan 's brother , Mitch ( Dane Cook ) . His entire family has come up to their parents ' country home for their yearly visit and Dan must now spend the weekend pining and yearning for the fleeting feeling he had with Marie that morning . It only lasted an hour or so but it only took that long to awaken Dan 's heart from its coma.<br /><br />With so many family members to deal with ( Jack Mahoney and Dianne Wiest are at the helm ) , DAN IN REAL LIFE does drift away from its grander purpose from time to time . While the cyclone of kids and parents and aunts and uncles makes for trying times for Dan , Hedges also uses it unnecessarily as a means to distract , with the presumption that it would ultimately make for a more complete film . Luckily , Hedges has got Carell to carry the heavy burden . It is a pleasure to watch Steve Carell come into his own more and more with every picture he makes ( despite the occasional EVAN ALMIGHTY - sized misstep ) . He is charismatic , charming and obviously a sharp humorist . As Dan , he is also self - deprecating , awkward and scared . Carell is the rare comedian who pushes himself to find character in his roles rather than rely solely on his comedic instincts and established persona . Perhaps more importantly , he is entirely relatable as Dan . Whether he 's flopping down on the cot in the laundry room where he is subjected to sleep as the only single adult at this reunion or fidgeting around the kitchen , unable to stan d still in his anxiety , Dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd . Carell gives Dan so much heart that he becomes the heart of the film itself at the same time.<br /><br />I wondered after seeing the film if I enjoyed the it as much as I did , despite its slight shortcomings ( Juliette Binoche  I know you might like to lighten up every now and then but I do n't recommend it unless there is chocolate involved ) , because of where I am in my life . Would someone who has found that someone else derive as much meaning and comfort from this film ? I ca n't say . What I can say , as someone who knows what it means to be lonely , DAN IN REAL LIFE knows what it means to be surprised by life and love and how these moments and people need to be appreciated and cherished . It also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen .
1 Simon Pegg plays a rude crude and often out of control celebrity journalist who is brought from England to work for a big American magazine . Of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications . Amusing fact based comedy that co stars Kristen Dunst ( looking rather grown up ) , Danny Huston , and Jeff Bridges . It works primarily because we like Simon Pegg despite his bad behavior . We completely understand why Kristen Dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent screw ups . I liked the film . Its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies.<br /><br />7 out of 10
1 Well it was a nice surprise after all . its trailer did not predict a good film at all , it was even a bit misleading . Especially the part of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise , well written , sardonic and funny . Less real though , I do not think a guy who got where he got would show signs of such irreverence towards everything that his current company stands for . One does not become a top suit just to doubt it all suddenly again . The ending of the film , during the showing of Dolce Vita , was too corny , cliché and quite disappointing . And of course a guy like Pegg 's character would not last past his first week in a blitz New York magazine like this . I hope one day I will see a decent role written for Megan Fox , here she looked a poor actress playing a bimbo . And by the way , I do not see why she is the " sex symbol " of the year , I see hotter girls on nearly every cover of every magazine .
1 " How To Lose Friends & Alienate People " is not based on Tiger Woods ' infidelities . It is a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young 's book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities . The film stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young , a zany British journalist who takes a job in an illustrious celebrity magazine in New York . Young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigans to alienate all around him , hence movie title . He is uproarious , daring , and moronic . But nevertheless for some very bizarre reason , he is a somewhat likable character . Sidney befriends a fellow journalist , the composed Alison Olsen , played quite admirably by Kirsten Dunst . However , Sidney is primarily longing for the sexpot actress Sophie Maes played by the Fantastic Ms. Megan Fox . This foxtrot is short on acting proficiency but high on " eye candy " material . Sidney gets in all kinds of tomfoolery in order to move up the journalist ladder in the magazine co. Those are the peak comedic moments of the film . However , I think that Director Robert Weide and Screenwriter Peter Straughan might lose some viewers and alienated authentic rom - com material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between Sidney & Alison ; even though Team Weidstraughan did formulate an entertaining narrative otherwise . Pegg did peg his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as Sidney Young . Jeff Bridges was again building " The Dude " bridges with his enigmatic supporting work as Clayton Harding , the magazine 's suave prez . But the rest of the film 's acting was not worthy enough to feature here . " How To Lose Friends & Alienate People " should not be alienated entirely , but you might lose some movie friends if you publicize it as a superlative romantic comedy . * * * Average
1 I love Kristen Dunst , especially in Elizabethtown . I guess she 's the kind of actress who had better not act before camera , but just be herself . She did that , and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown . In this movie , however , she did try to add in more artificial performance , especially in the first half of the film , so that she looked more like a sober editor . While in the other half , she totally set herself back in her daily track , and I just could n't tell her to be an editor any way . Therefore , her performance is not enduring in this film . < br /><br />The film , on the whole , is attracting and inspiring . the character of Young is full and reasonable . Anyway , the film tells a big and sophisticated story . < br /><br />The only big defect is that it did n't show a turning point of the hero and heroine 's love story . I am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story , because that is rather unclear for the two persons .
1 I really , really enjoyed watching this movie ! At first , seeing its poster I thought it was just another easy romantic comedy ... but it is simply more than this ! I personally believe that this idea ( that I 'm sure a good part of the viewers had just before they saw the movie ) it 's yet another important part of the big concept of this movie itself ( or even of its marketing strategy ) ! What I mean is : Nowadays we are slaves to images ! To impressions ! I went to the cinema to view this film having the wrong impression , the wrong expectations , and at the end I felt how superficial I could be ! To exemplify it comes to my mind the sequence near the end in which Sidney buys the plane ticket to go back to New York and as he is asked to ' give an autograph ' , meaning to sign for the ticket , he believes that just because he got on TV thanks to the scandal at the awards he is now some kind of celebrity . And this is just , I believe , the climax of this main theme around which the movies revolves . Above this , I believe the movie also offers us a solution to get along with this , illustrated throughout the movie by Sidney 's attitude : do n't become too serious about yourself or about anybody else ... " even saints were people in the beginning " ... as Sophie once says in the movie . The saints of the moment are the stars . We attribute them an ' aura ' of perfection , of eternal happiness , but the reality is much less than that . Even the saints of any religion are images , ideal models of how to behave and how to live your life . Even they were not for real ... they became ' for real ' after they died and we looked back at them . And that 's the catch : we need our saints ! we need our stars ! We strive for them as if it was n't for them we would n't have anything to strive for . And television and all other media are means to create and capture our strivings . We desperately need benchmarks in regard to which to measure ourselves . And that 's how we got in the cinema to watch this movie in the first place : to see if we can fit the benchmark , or if the benchmark is to small for us . This time it was larger than we expected .
1 Simon Pegg plays the part of Sidney Young , a young entertainment writer who has begun the beginnings of a career writing for a grassroots magazine that specializes in badmouthing the shallowness and superficiality of the rich and famous . He is making a career out of lampooning celebrities , although he has a desperate wish to be a celebrity himself . The movie is based on the very bizarre career of Toby Young , who also ran a small magazine in Britain called the Modern Review , which offered scathing criticism of pretty much everything imaginable , until he closed the magazine in a hail of verbal bullets with his co - editor , and then went on to a spectacularly failed career as a writer for Vanity Fair , which is pretty much the part of his life told in this movie . < br /><br />He is at first thrilled to go work for a major publication ( called Sharp 's Magazine in the movie ) , and despite active nerves he is positively beaming on his first day . He meets the chief editor , Clayton Harding ( played by Jeff Bridges ) , who is hard as nails but who is also exactly the kind of editor he needs to be for a goof - off like Young to keep his job at the magazine . He offers little in the form of immediate acceptance of Young , but he also has what can only be described as a liberal tolerance of Young 's off - the - wall antics and inappropriate behavior . < br /><br />Much of the comedy in the movie is derived from Young 's misunderstanding of or indifference to the generally accepted code of public behavior and the peculiar etiquette involved in dealing with the rich and famous . But Sidney 's reasons for acting in such a weird way and for giving outwardly offensive interviews is because he believes that he loathes the entire celebrity culture and , it would seem , he believes in that age - old saying  ' If you ca n't beat 'em , join 'em  and THEN beat ' em." < br /><br />Complicating matters are two very different women . There is a charming , regular girl at the magazine named Alison Olsen ( Kirsten Dunst ) who at first is appalled by Sidney 's obvious arrogance and womanizing ways , and a stunning model named Sophie ( Megan Fox ) , who represents the celebrity culture . Needless to say , Sidney 's endless attack of superficiality and stardom is a superficial lust for Sophie , the one with the look of a star.<br /><br />Sophie is stunningly beautiful , it 's true , but also comes across as having not a single thought rattling around in her head . Alison is a regular girl , not very interesting or attractive , but Dunst 's performance makes her a real person . A relationship with her would have all the reality of a Britney Spears marriage , and yet the movie retains some level of believability because , despite how obvious this is , we also feel Sidney 's pain in not pursuing her ( I felt it , anyway).<br /><br />How To Lose Friends and Alienate People has a pretty interesting premise and is full of honest , satisfactory performances , and although it turns into a bit of your standard romantic comedy by the third act , it has a variety of well - developed and interesting characters . Danny Huston , for example , gives us a great performance as Alison 's other love interest , who pays homage to The Big Lebowski ( also starring Bridges ) with his ever - present White Russian , one of my personal favorite drinks . Buying Absolute and Kahlua here in China costs the equivalent of about $ 350 , but my kitchen is never without them . < br /><br />I am looking forward to the day when Simon Pegg will branch out a little bit , because I love his films but I am completely unsure about his range . He played a serious character in Hot Fuzz , but only serious in relation to the lunacy surrounding him , and ultimately went back to being himself again , which he has pretty much been in Shaun of the Dead , Run , Fat Boy , Run , and now How To Lose Friends . He 's a rising star , it will be interesting to see what else he can do .
1 How to lose friends and alienate people is decent comedy with a bit of romantic approach.<br /><br />It 's actually a story of Sidney Young(Simon Pegg ) breaking through in journalist and magazine writing business which is interpreted in a funny way . Simon Pegg made an OK appearance , slightly worse than his usual . Movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or anything like that but it has its moments , and those moments are really hilarious.<br /><br />I recommend this fun and worth watching American with English cream comedy to all people who just wanna sit , relax and enjoy movie for what it is . If you 're about to watch this movie with critical approach then you should pass unless you want to be disappointed and start trashing it .
1 ' How To Lose Friends & Alienate People ' is a superb film . A hilarious film from start to end . A lovely entertainer . Enjoyed it . Thumps Up ! < br /><br />Performances : Jason is fantastic . He 's a treat to watch him from start to end . Jeff Bridges is excellent as the boss . He 's a Legend . Megan Fox looks amazingly hot , and deliver a good performance . but dude , She 's so hot man ! Anderson is delightful . She does n't look old at all , still hot indeed . Kristan Dunst looks lovely and does a pretty good job . Others are also pretty good.<br /><br />'How To Lose Friends & Alienate People ' is a excellent entertainer . Do n't miss this flick !
1 Going into this movie , I had heard good things about it . Coming out of it , I was n't really amazed nor disappointed . Simon Pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies . There were a couple of laughs here and there-- nothing too funny . Probably my favorite parts of the movie is when he dances in the club scene . I totally got ta try that out next time I find myself in a club . A couple of stars here and there including : Megan Fox , Kirsten Dunst , that chick from X - Files , and Jeff Bridges . I found it quite amusing to see a cameo appearance of Thandie Newton in a scene . She of course being in a previous movie with Simon Pegg , Run Fatboy Run . I see it as a toss up , you 'll either enjoy it to an extent or find it a little dull . I might add , Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie . :3
1 POSSIBLE SPOILER - In some way " How to Alienate Friends .... " is the " loser learns to adjust , becomes successful and finds out that something else matter more " type of story , situated in the celebrity business . - END OF SPOILER < br /><br />I do n't know the original book but this comedy delivers several good moments . Though I do think the ending is flawed . It felt too fast and too abrupt , as if something was missing . Besides I 'd say the movie is n't able to keep a high level . Apart from this you 'll find a sweet selection of actors and actresses with sometimes controversial acting qualities . Until now I 've never seen Pegg any different . Still he is a very unique type though on the screen he sometimes might seem a little more tedious than necessary . Fox proved she is capable to play a hot starlet with her head in the clouds . Do n't know whether it was a hard thing to do , but her performance was hot and way better than during " Transformers " ( okay ... probably that 's no tough match ) . Kirsten Dunst is very much Kirsten Dunst ( again ) and you may like it ( as I do ) or find it annoying . On the other hand you 'll see Anderson who proved her acting skills and Jeff Bridges ( who is fine but perhaps he could have acted a little more powerful ) . They all fit their character well enough.<br /><br />Conclusion : I think it 's a nice celeb comedy with some more and some less funny passages , a sweet cast but an all too sudden ending .
1 How to Lose Friends & Alienate People is in all honesty one of the best comedies I 've seen this year along with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers . Its not one of those " gross out " comedies that heavily relies on fart jokes and toilet humor but instead moves at an affable pace and you will be easily attached to the unfolding narrative . Simon Pegg nails it in the coffin with his hilarious portrayal of a fish - out - of - water character and is quickly detaching himself from the tripod he once belonged to back in England ( the other two would be Nick Frost and Edgar Wright ) . Getting yourself in the top of the Hollywood food chain is a hard thing to do as we can clearly see with Pegg , his first jab at the lead role was David Schwimmer 's comedy Run Fatboy Run but it received lukewarm reviews from critics and audiences alike . His second try is this movie , got fairly positive reviews from the majority but was a flop in the box office . I , for one still have n't lost faith in him and I 'll still be there whenever he wants to take that third shot for glory.<br /><br />Other characters were well cast from Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson . Surprisingly , Kirsten Dunst in my opinion fared well in this movie as the love angle to Pegg 's character however , the spark that I saw in Interview with the Vampire is still lost . She needs to find it , fast or she might suffer the consequences of being lost in the land of " rom - coms " forever .
1 To like this movie at most you must be a)strongly in love ( without a marriage ) b ) acknowledge English humor which is about admiring gallant and witty life situations and not just running gags c ) be fairly very intelligent , because authors gave an opportunity to laugh and cry over every single minute of this movie , and only if you meet " b " and " c " requirements , you can recognize and enjoy author 's input . d ) to fully enjoy the movie you must love women like Kirsted Dunst , who is so natural , sweet and irresistible . e)you must admire creative , a little melancholic people with great and remarkable personalities < br /><br />if you meet all these requirements you 'll be likely to rate this movie near 10 points.<br /><br />I never laughed half ( ! ) as much as from watching this masterpiece . And i even managed to cry while laughing in some moments ( i always get sensitive , whenever good things happen to Kirsten Dunst )
1 Here 's the skinny , it seems that this is much older then I thought it was . But it 's still cool . The bike mechs are cool and the story works for the most part . There are some character issues that I hope work themselves out by part 2 and my biggest complaint of all that it seems to be a MACROSS knock off . Not just the animation style but several character designs . For example all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY of MACROSS . The mechs look similar to MACROSS as well as the other characters . This is really not made for little kids , it has graphic violence , nudity and graphic sexual content . So to make a long story short I give this cool MACROSS knock - off 7 STARS .
1 What do you get if you cross The Matrix with The Truman Show?<br /><br />I'm sure you 've all seen The Matrix by now . The creators of The Matrix say that it is ' anime inspired ' . Just from watching the trailer to this classic , you can see where they took the plot from.<br /><br />The film is sort of set in 1980s Japan , and it really shows . The costumes , music and words(in the recent English Language version by AD Vision ) are all like they 've been directly lifted from the era . I believe it was made in that time also , but due to certain plot points , this does n't date the film!<br /><br />As you probably guessed by my referencing to The Matrix , the world is n't real . It 's not really the 1980 's . In fact , it 's something more like the 2480 's . After a nuclear war , the Earth(or " Biosphere Prime " ) 's ecosystem was destroyed . The survivors we 're forced to escape into space , where the conflict continued . Once the planets(or " Biospheres " ) were all abandoned , people began to live in MegaZones - cities inside of spaceships , where , via hypnotism techniques and Truman Show - esque illusion , they were made to believe they we 're back on earth , in the most peaceful time in recent memory ... The 1980s . When young Shogo obtains a mysterious advanced looking motorcycle , it leads him to find out more than he 's supposed to know ... The Garland(a bike which becomes a mech ) , a weapon from the 2400 's , aids Shogo in his escape from the pursuing military . As more and more is discovered about the MegaZone , the war comes closer to home , and due to conflicts between the military and the computer , the war comes to the MegaZone too ... I apologise if those points are seen as spoilers , but the plot is outlined basically that way on the synopsis.<br /><br />Emotions run high in this movie , moreso than The Matrix . You really do believe the war is going on , and Shogo really does become quite scarred by what he 's discovering . What starts off as an uber - happy cool 80 's flick becomes a tragic tale of war and unreality . These characters are real people , not the cardboard cutouts we saw flipping around in bullet - time in The Matrix . There really is the sense of the suffering people can go through after being caught up in such a conspiracy , and a war . It may just choke you up towards the end ... I know it did me.<br /><br />Animation is pretty impressive for it 's day , and the picture quality on the ADVision DVD is unbelievable for it 's age . The artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime , very cultural . Be prepared for quite a lot of violence and blood , there 's also an erotic sex scene.<br /><br />The ending can be seen as a ' there can be no ending ' , similar to the Matrix , or , supposedly can be followed by the sequel , which I have n't yet had the pleasure of watching.<br /><br />I have to say that this is one of the best animes I 've seen , in fact , one of the best movies I 've seen , and considered by many to be one of the greatest animes of all time.<br /><br />I must recommend the ADVision DVD , as their take on the English Language is incredible , and does the movie justice , and can be purchased with an artbox for holding the two sequels when they are released , which will have the same vocal cast.<br /><br />All in all , MegaZone 23 is an incredible movie , and deserves to be held highly , and should be an essential in any anime fan 's collection . Heck , even my mother enjoyed it .
1 This series premiered on the cable TV station " Comedy Central " in the United States . It was chopped to death , and shown out of sequence . This was sad for the audience it should have attracted , it did n't and fell by the wayside . Luckily , at the same time my cable company went digital and I got the BBC . Thank goodness because I got to see " The League of Gentlemen " in order , complete and uncut . < br /><br />"The League of Gentlemen " troupe is right up there with England 's " Monty Python 's Flying Circus " and Canada 's " The Kids in the Hall " . But .. a warning.<br /><br />"The League of Gentlemen " though are one step beyond . It 's not only about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ills , it goes deeper and much , much , darker . I can tell many of you now -- it will offend certain groups of people , it will enrage others . But remember , its only comedy .. dark , dark comedy . If that is not your thing , do n't watch . If you think you KNOW dark comedy , watch this -- if you get angry and upset , then you do n't quite know DARK COMEDY . < br /><br />These guys got it right , and right on the button . They are brilliant , they are excellent and I enjoyed each and every character creation . There 's a COMPLETE story that is told here from episode one to the end . You can not watch this one episode at a time , willy nilly , that is one of the charms of this series . Watch it in order . See how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are . No one and nothing is out of bounds . That , my dears , is " dark humor " . Bravo !
1 Another review likened this troupe to a cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks , also aptly . Yet another review expounded on the differences between the comedy we enjoy non - critically and black comedy , also well worth consideration.<br /><br />Watch the whole thing , all three series . At the end , all the characters are tied up and the puzzle pieces fall into place just as well as a Douglas Adams novel . The detail and intricacies are staggering . Thoroughly post - modern . Wickedly funny , and startlingly tragic . Not for kids . Not for those with thin skins or who lack objectivity . Thought - provoking . At once literal , figurative , and surreal in disturbing ways . The blackest comedy I can recall.<br /><br />And very possibly the most wonderful thing I will ever see .
1 Well , I just discovered that there is a show more disgusting and shocking than " Little Britain " and I like it ! " The League of Gentlemen " is a sick British comedy that is about the most awful , insane and disgusting small town in all the UK . This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island ( from " The Vicar of Dibley " and " Father Ted " ) seem pretty normal ! ! The format of the show is a lot like LITTLE Britain except that all of it centers around the townspeople of this one hellish town . Both shows feature the same skits again and again every episode and some obviously inspired " Little Britain " ( particularly the job seeking class skit ) . But the show differs because although it is crude like " Little Britain " ( hence not a show for kids ) , the show has a sick and sadistic quality that sets it apart from all these shows . In particular , animal cruelty and serial killing are recurring themes throughout the show.<br /><br />Now if you have n't guessed , this is NOT a show for kids , the easily offended or normal people and that 's probably why I liked it . However , you really do need very thick skin and a love of the awful to enjoy this to the max . Funny and incredibly irreverent beyond belief -- you have to see it to believe it .
1 This is what makes me proud to be British . This is by far the funniest thing on TV . The league consists of Jeremy dyson , Steve pemberton , mark gatiss and the lovely Reece shearsmith . Totally underrated , this horror - comedy is perfection . The characters are iconic and the catchphrases bizarre , " Hello Dave " . It is a comedy that everyone simply must watch.<br /><br />The best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it is always fresh , and always pushing the boundaries . It does not need to rely on catchphrases(unlike little Britain ) for it to be funny . the fact that the league are willing to kill off arguably their most famous and iconic characters , shows us that they 've got balls of steel .
1 I first flicked onto the LoG accidentally one night while waching television : since then , I have never missed an episode.<br /><br />It 's humour is very weird , like a cross between Brass Eye 's social commentary , the Fast Show 's excellent one - liners , and an amazing plot that seems to develop each week without ever going anywhere . The best example of this was Hillary Briss 's special stuff - what was that all about?<br /><br />The humour will not appeal to all . Some will say it 's just too sick , and it 's easy to see where they 're coming from . Nonetheless , give it a try . If you do n't like it , do n't watch it , but if you do like it you 'll be very glad you took my advice .
1 I never really watched this program before although it came highly recommended by members of my family . Funnily enough , my girlfriend lives in Hadfield ( the filming location ) and she pointed out a few landmarks when I first visited.<br /><br />This got my interest going so I bought the 1st series on video and sat down to watch . Besides recognising some of the locations , I found myself not in the least bit surprised . Once again the BBC were responsible for producing another example of the finest comedy in the world . TLOG easily ranks up there with Red Dwarf , Fawlty Towers and Monty Python as probably the best.<br /><br />Suffice to say I am hooked on the program now . The characters are superb and show unusual depth while retaining a scarily realistic edge . The look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes bleak feeling of the North ( no disrespect to Hadfield which I have found a very welcoming and warm place).<br /><br />I only hope that it continues its originality throughout its run ( which based upon the 2nd series which concluded its rerun in the UK last night , it certainly is).<br /><br />Well done the BBC ! !
1 About a year ago I finally gave up on American television . I thought of giving up television completely until a friend who had lived in England showed me some programs that included The Office , Extras , Blackadder , and The League of Gentlemen . It was then that I decided to switch to British television . Among all the shows listed above , The League of Gentlemen is easily the most dark and twisted of them all , providing guilty laughs and material not found in any other comedy I 've seen yet . Characters included are the most unhappily married couple , a butcher that puts ingredients in the meat that go unsaid ( probably for the best ) , a deranged couple that look over a local shop that only caters to local people , and the worst veterinarian ever . This program is one of the best I 've seen .
1 The League of Gentlemen is one of the funniest , strangest , darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time . So much so , it paved the way for more comedies of its ilk , many of which have copied the style , but have never succeeded.<br /><br />Unlike every other sketch show around , the characters of The League of Gentlemen are all loosely connected . Firstly they all live in the fictional town of Royston Vasey , in the back of beyond of Northern England . < br /><br />The first characters to greet newcomers are Tubbs and Edwrad , the pig - faced owners of a supposedly local shop situated so far away most of the residents probably do n't know of its existence . Other oddities include : the Denton family , with an obsession with hygiene , chastity and toads ; Hillary Briss who sells a special yet thankfully unknown brand of meat ; Pauline , a restart officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens ; Mr. Chinnery , kind - hearted vet and menace to all things four - legged ; Geoff Tipps , a plastics salesman with a vicious sense of humour , often involving guns , electric tubes and . . . . . . . PLUMS ! ! ! ! ! < br /><br />Despite being a comedy at heart , The League of Gentlemen often transcends genres whilst never appearing to be spoofing or ripping off other people 's material . There are several horror references such as the disappearance of a hiker , a pair of silent twins , an obsessive circus owner , and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds . Even more striking are moments when the series takes on a more sobre tone and aforementioned characters such as Pauline and Geoff are shown in a more sympathetic , vulnerable light . The film adaptation is the best demonstration of this , but some fans may decide they belong local.<br /><br />The equally underrated third series also takes a different route , instead of sketches each episode focuses on an individual character with each storyline leading to one conclusion involving a plastic bag and a runaway theatre company van . Although many fans may not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two , they 're certainly signs to how inventive The League of Gentlemen can be , and how unafraid to explore new areas.<br /><br />In short , The League of Gentlemen is definitely worth a look , as like the welcome signs says : YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE !
1 This is probably the best television show I 've ever seen . I first saw it on Comedy Central several years ago . At the time I was unaware that it had been dramatically edited and was shown out of order , and having just watched all three series in order and unedited ( thank you internet and your wondrous " series of tubes " ) I am SO GLAD I rediscovered it ! I think Comedy Central sort of picked and chose their way through series one and two to make a " season" ...... and I tried to get friends and family to watch it , but nobody really seemed to like it ( I need new friends ) . So , on my own , I made the best out of it that I could . Even when I felt like it was waning a bit , I still felt compelled to continue watching . Years after when I discovered Little Britain , I immediately recognized Pauline from LoG as having influenced Marjorie in Fat Fighters . Also , I love the idea of writers who act the entire show .... (not new , but done impeccably here ) . LB has nothing on LoG ! ( No offense , Matt & David .... Love you ) ! This is indeed a darkly comedic piece of genius . Serial murder , implied cannibalism ..... you name it and it 's probably found in this wonderful , unique piece of TV art . The location shots from the very first scene themselves are chilling and seem to beckon you to the town of Royston Vasey ..... You'll Never Leave ! I think my favorite character would have to be Tubbs , but each character as portrayed has it 's own " charm " . My least favorite was Papa Lazarous , that was until he re - surfaced in series three ( clever and wholly unexpected ) ! It 's best to watch several episodes in a row as it drives the continuity and as I said before , becomes so compelling ( while repulsing ) that you really CAN'T stop watching . This is not for those with weak stomachs , kids , conservatives or Grandma ( unless you 've got one saucy granny ) ! I have always loved British TV , particularly comedies , from Monty Python to Benny Hill , Red Dwarf to Keeping Up Appearances , Absolutely Fabulous and the British originals Coupling and The Office ( but not their US counterparts .... sorry ) . This is unlike any of those in that it completely redraws the line between what 's funny and what 's just sick and twisted . Nothing , NOTHING on US TV has ever come close to this level of entertainment . US broadcast TV is so sad and lame , I can barely stand to watch ANY of it . It 's kind of sad that even our cable channels do n't have the guts to show unedited versions of this gem ( your loss , Comedy Central ) . Thankfully there are shows like this one that come from the " across the pond " that redeem the entire medium every decade or so . Basic cable here in the US has been making tiny steps the last few years in confidently " crossing lines " with more graphic sexual content , drug use and adult language , but they are still years away from just deciding to be Adults about showing real life , adult behavior ( instead of just murder obsession and blowing things up , sheesh , it 's like the same basic show format for the past 35 years ) ! Do n't even get me started on US sitcoms ! Waste of time and lots of wasted money ...... did you know that " According to Jim " has been on the air for 10 years ? ? ? 10 YEARS ? ? Anyway ... Watch this show , get it on DVD , do what you must and then make your friends watch it as well ! You 've never seen anything like it . There are three specials that I have not watched yet .... I'm saving them to spring on my best friend next time he visits . He 'll watch them , even if I have to chain him up and paint him with Excrement ! Lines and lines and lines and lines ! Note that series three departs from one and two .... the greater town seems to fall away to concentrate on newer characters , the laugh track is gone ( thank bloody hell ) , the theme is more band and less orchestra and a bit of the story takes place outside of Royston Vasey . Do n't be thrown by any of that as by the end , the series has preserved the quiet perversity first demonstrated in series one and two . I think these four guys have created something sort of undefinable . Brilliant , confident and absolutely demented . You will want to re - watch it again and again . It 's amazing that in 5 seconds of screen time they can go from cheap sight - gag to horrifying blasphemy then end with a single actors close - up facial expression . If ever I were to meet any of the writer / performers , I 'd implore them not to recreate it or try to top it ..... I'd just say " Can I help you at all ? " ( Then they 'd probably slap me , so I 'd ask them to sign the slap - mark ) ! 10 out of 10
1 I ca n't believe it 's been ten years since this show first aired on TV and delighted viewers with its unique mixture of comedy and horror . This is the show that gave birth to a good part of modern British humor : Dr. Terrible 's House of Horrible ; Garth Marenghi 's Darkplace ; The Mighty Boosh ; Snuff Box . Many have imitated this show 's style , and I do n't deny some have surpassed its quality . But Jermy Dyson deserves being remembered for having started the trend , with actors Mark Gatiss , Steve Pemberton , and Reece Shearsmith.<br /><br />Together they created Royston Vasey , a sinister small town in England 's idyllic countryside , where unsuspecting tourists and passers - by come across an obsessive couple that wants to keep the town local and free of strangers ; where the unemployed are abused and insulted at the job center ; where a farmer uses real people as scarecrows ; where a vet kills all the animals he tries to cure ; where a gypsy circus kidnaps people ; and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistible to the food to hook people on.<br /><br />This is just a whiff of what the viewer can find in The League of Gentlemen . By themselves , the three actors give birth to dozens and dozens of unique characters . The make up and prosthetics are so good I actually thought I watching a lot more actors on the show than there were . But it 's also great acting : the way they change their voices and their body movement , the really become other people.<br /><br />Most of the jokes start with something ordinary , from real life , and then blows up into something unsettling , sometimes gut - wrenching . Sometimes it 's pure horror without a set up , like in Papa Lazarou 's character . Just imagine a creepy circus owner on make - up barging into someone 's house and kidnapping women to be his wives . No explanation given . It 's that creepy . Then there are the numerous references to horror movies : Se7en , The Silence of the Lambs , Nosferatu , The Exorcist , etc.<br /><br />Fans of horror will love it , fans of comedy will love it . As any traveler entering knows , there 's a sign there that says ' Welcome to Royston Vasey : You 'll Never Leave . ' Any viewer who gives this show a chance will agree . Once you discover The League of Gentlemen , you 'll never want anything else , you 'll never forget it .
1 One of the best comedy series to ever come out of Britain . Mark Gatiss , Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are terrific actors and performers who seem at home with drama as they are with comedy . Ably supported by their writing partner Jeremy Dyson , they have peopled the series with the most memorable characters of recent years . Little Britain pales into insignificance as a poor imitation of their ideas . Consistently original and groundbreaking I am sure that as many people hate these series as love them but I am equally as sure that no one could have no opinion on LOG . I have yet to see the feature length movie but I have heard good things and bad things so I will reserve judgement . The original radio series from which LOG came was as innovative as the TV series became . I do n't know whether the TV series made it to the US but I would be fascinated to see how American audiences found the weird Englishness of the humour
1 the town of Royston Vasey is a weird , but wonderful place . The characters would be just wrong and too disturbing but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works , and it works very well . Most people will know others with a touch of some characters , but hopefully no one knows people with extremes of personalities such as Tubbs and Edward , the stranger - hating owners of the local shop , or the pen - obsessed Pauline who treats " dole scum " with much contempt . That was only a few of the strange inhabitants . The TV works consists of 3 series and a Christmas special . There are references to many horror films , such as the wicker man . A more recent addition to the range of works is a film , the league of gentlemens apocalypse , of which I will not say much but highly recommend . All in all the league of gentlemen is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and brilliantly bonkers characters . I would definitely say that it is worth watching as you wo nt regret it !
1 A fantastic show and an unrealized classic ; The League of Gentlemen remains as one of the greatest modern comedies of recent times.<br /><br />With a dark and bizarre style of humor that towers over the tired , formulaic approach of it 's inferior , yet unfortunately far more acknowledged successor , Little Britain , The League of Gentlemen was truly something special during a rather quiet era in British comedy.<br /><br />Up until it 's arrival on the scene , there had never really been anything like The League of Gentlemen before . On the surface , a seemingly simplistic sketch show , the show soon unfolds as a vivid , sinister but incredibly hilarious universe populated with all manner of brilliant comedic creations . What really sets the show apart from it 's rivals , is it 's approach to telling us it 's story . Rather than serve us re - hashed sketches , barely distinguishable from the next , here we see each individual or group of characters go through their various journeys and story lines . No visit to them is the same , and each time they offer us up with a surprise.<br /><br />Gradually , over three series ' and a Christmas special , the fictional town of Royston Vasey is heaving with a grotesque yet hilarious populace . And that 's probably the main reason why the show is such a joy to watch ( and also the reason why the show would easily merit more series ' ) Unlike other current shows like The Catherine Tate Show or more importantly Little Britain , the League both know when a character has run it 's course , and have the opportunity to deal with that . Several fan favorite 's , who could have easily been kept on to entertain further , bowed out before the series came to a close , giving room for fellow characters to grow more , or allow for the introduction of newer residents of Royston Vasey to make their mark.<br /><br />Another thing that sets this show above others is that the writing team approach the script process with care and intelligence . As mentioned before , all four members of the League have a sound mind when it comes to judging the longevity of their creations , and when it 's time to call it quits in respect to certain characters . This awareness has also meant The League of Gentlemen undergoes a bold evolution , not usually seen in a show of this nature . The narrative driven , and far darker third series is a brave step away from the more sketch based first two series ' and this bold move by the League really pays off . With the third series , there 's less of an urgency for them to please an audience , and like the Christmas special , they pursue individual stories with a clear narrative , unlike the more sketch - based previous series ' that ( succesfully ) binded together various sets of sketches into a series ' long story arc.<br /><br />The third series is both a refreshing change of pace of style , as well as a real treat for fans who 've already seen the first two . Despite some polarized opinion on the third series , any real fan of the League will appreciate what the third series has to offer , as well as really enjoy the more character based episodes , that only delve deeper into fan favorite 's , but pair up and inter - wine characters that might not have crossed paths previously.<br /><br />It might take a little trying to get into the change in style , but it 's definitely worth it , and in my opinion , the third series is the best and also provides a firm conclusion to the series.<br /><br />The show 's not without it 's drawbacks , and very occasionally certain characters and set pieces appear somewhat out of place , but for the most part , the genius writing , dark nature of the show and the host of brilliant characters ( that are often all too close to real life ) make for a real treat and prove what comedy should be about and puts much of the more recent , catch phrase driven and often desperate attempts at comedy to shame
1 Somehow , this movie manages to be invigorating , bittersweet , and heartwarming at the same time . Stars like Tony Shalhoub ( from Providence ) bring the tale to life . The story itself is inspiring . We see a desperate , up - and - down life through the most innocent eyes imaginable : a bird's.<br /><br />Paulie begins his life as a baby parrot given to a little girl ( played by Hallie Eisenberg , also known as the Pepsi girl ) with a speech impediment . While she learns to speak correctly , so does Paulie . However , unlike most birds , he can speak and understand everything being said . The military father does n't like the bird , so he is sent to a pawn shop and bought by an aging artist , Ivy . She teaches him manners , etc . , while traveling across the country to find Paulie 's owner . The movie continues with several twists of fate , until Paulie ends up at a laboratory where he is eventually hidden away in a basement , and found by a Russian custodian , who is touched by the bird 's story . the plot is in keeping with the simple , metaphorical theme that language is a gift , and a curse . I would like to say that the soundtrack is astounding . A beautiful mixture of flute , digital base , and horns enhance the movie to the point of pure ecstasy . The sweeping camera angles and breathtaking scenery beautify the story even more . And , as a final remark , the puppetry is entirely believable . ( Unlike in star wars , where Yoda resembles a Muppet ) This film is one of my favorite movies , with the added remark that my wonderful parakeet of four years died recently . Overall , I give this movie * * * * out of four stars , two thumbs up , and a big hug .
1 Something about " Paulie " touched my heart as few movies do . It is a witty , funny yet emotional movie . I 'm a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie . I did n't see " Paulie " until May , 2004 and have since ordered the Widescreen DVD from a seller at eBay.<br /><br />The special effects of showing Paulie talking are superb . My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases . Probably my favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands ( Ivy 's ) company followed by Cheech Marin ( Ignacio ) . Tony Shalhoub ( Misha ) plays an excellent part as the good hearted human . You root for him all the way through the movie.<br /><br />You ca n't go wrong renting or buying this movie ! !
1 I have seen this film numerous times and for the life of me , I can not understand why some people compare this to BABE . This film is not about the secret life of ALL animals who secretly can talk . Instead , it is about a Parrot who learns to talk to help his owner , a little girl with a serious stammer , overcome her speech impediment only to be separated from her in a heart - wrenching scene early on . Then the great journey begins . Paulie the Parrot sets out to try and find his one great friend , Marie.<br /><br />Along the way , he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people . He falls in love with a girl parrot and loses her . He gets conned into a life of crime and then captured by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him.<br /><br />He recounts his tale to a sympathetic Janitor in the Lab who agrees to help him escape and find his beloved Marie.<br /><br />Tony Shaloub shines as the kindly Janitor who has an open mind and big heart and who determines to help little Paulie despite the risks . Jay Mohr plays the voice of the Parrot AND one of the seedy characters he comes across.<br /><br />There is a little suggestive language but this film is appropriate for most kids and even more so if the parents join in on the fun and watch too . It is a witty , clever , epic animal - adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a Bird and his little girl . He search for Marie ends with a quite an unexpected surprise for most people who don;t know much about Parrots.<br /><br />Kids who have seen the wild Green Parrot Tribes in Los Angeles and Pasadena will especially benefit from seeing this film and understanding that Birds , especially Parrots are not disposable pets . All children everywhere , will see that Pets form deep attachments themselves and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be treasured.<br /><br />so no BABE here , more of an incredible journey with a twist.<br /><br />Enjoy and try no to tear up during the sad parts .
1 This is a really heart - warming family movie . It has absolutely brilliant animal training and " acting " ( if you can call it like that ) as well ( just think about the dog in " How the Grinch stole Christmas " ... it was plain bad training ) . The Paulie story is extremely well done , well reproduced and in general the characters are really elaborated too . Not more to say except that this is a GREAT MOVIE!<br /><br />My ratings : story 8.5/10 , acting 7.5/10 , animals+fx 8.5/10 , cinematography 8/10.<br /><br />My overall rating : 8/10 - BIG FAMILY MOVIE AND VERY WORTH WATCHING !
1 I 'm no fan of newer movies , but this one was a real pleasure to watch . Adults and children could watch it together - how unusual ! My aunt liked it , too . It had laughter , tears , love , adventure , special effects , good actors - and a talking parrot . It reminded me of a favourite , The Wizard of Oz . The hero , Paulie , an intelligent parrot , is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures , temptations and disappointments , always keeping in mind his resolution to find his friend , Marie . Highly recommended .
1 Some people might call " Paulie " a kids ' movie , but I wish to assert that it 's more than that . Probably more than anything else , this movie successfully goes to great lengths to show the plight of immigrants in the United States - topical given the recent debates . Portraying a parrot telling a Russian immigrant janitor ( Tony Shalhoub ) of how he searched America for his original owners , the movie tells several stories . There 's the elderly woman ( Gena Rowlands ) whom he befriends , then a Mexican immigrant ( Cheech Marin ) , and others.<br /><br />All in all , it 's a very well done movie . I usually do n't expect much from these sorts of movies , but this one is a treat . I certainly recommend it . Also starring Jay Mohr , Buddy Hackett , Bruce Davison , Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado .
1 I was entranced by this touching and hilarious film , not to mention surprised . I was also surprised to find that the voice of Paulie was performed by Jay Mohr . The performance was so finely nuanced , neither wavering into schmaltz nor becoming too hard under the New Jersey swagger , that I thought that this must be some unsung old pro , not the baby - faced Mr. Mohr . A very impressive performance , indeed , and it 's gratifying to see his talents being taken seriously in a string of quirky , indie films .
1 I was very surprised with this film . I was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his " marie " the little girl he was separated from . The humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do . Actually i was expecting " paulie wants a cracker " jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room conference . So if you wish to see a good " animal that talks " film check this one out , much better than Dr. DOLITTLE in my opinion . PAULIE also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well .
1 I do n't know who could find fault with a simply human and funny film like this with lots of delights for your heart . I enjoyed each minute of it and guessed the ending half way through the movie -- but that did not disappoint me at all . It will not only touch your heart but it 's such a good family friendly film -- we need many more like these !
1 This is absolutely the best none - animated family film I 've seen in quite a while , back to the first Homeward Bound . Paulie is a humerous movie about life through a parrot 's POV . It 's a really touching movie and ranks high among family films , up to Disney status , IMHO .
1 Paulie was cute , cool , enjoyable and quite fulfilling . I went to this movie expecting to view a typical " family " movie , one that within moments would find me unconscious and drooling on the floor . My mindframe immediately changed when I was quickly captivated by the movie 's wholesomeness . It is rare that you find a family movie that is thorough and can be coined " wholesome " . Most are cheaply made , written and produced purely to attract young family members , who 'll then drag the unfortunate elders to a mind numbing 65 minutes of overused sight gags and plots.<br /><br />Oh yes , Paulie had a plot . It told the story of a young girl(Marie ) and her best friend Paulie the parrot , who unbelievably could talk and quite frequently held conversations with her . Marie 's dorky jerk father found this unbelievable , and thought Paulie to be damaging to his 4-year old daughter 's mental health , and quickly tore them apart . We follow Paulie 's adventures ( and misadventures ) as he attempts to reunite with his beloved owner , meeting many memorable characters along the way . Oh yeah , Paulie really could ( smart)talk and had a swift New Jersey accent . Cool . The plot held thick and entertaining throughout , keeping me attracted . Paulie is the best family movie I have found and wholeheartedly enjoyed . Ever . Seriously . Pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a true family movie , with the whole family . No sleeping . I promise .
1 So you think a talking parrot is not your cup of tea huh ? Well , think again . Paulie is a wonderful film filled with touching moments . The characters are all lovable especially Paulie as he enters the lives of many people on his journey . It is journey worth experiencing . Do n't miss it ! It is available on home video .
1 I approach films about talking animals with care . For every wonderful one like Babe , you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of Homeward Bound : The Incredible Journey . Or in the case of Cats & Dogs , you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential . When I heard about Paulie , the premise of a wisecracking parrot did n't exactly fill me with confidence . But I found the film a pleasant surprise . And it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising.<br /><br />A Russian janitor , Misha Vilyenkov ( Tony Shaloub ) gets a job in a research laboratory . One day , he hears singing coming from the basement . And when he investigates , he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out . Misha becomes fascinated with the bird , especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing , it can talk . And not a few phrases either . Its a parrot you can actually make conversation with.<br /><br />The parrot is called Paulie ( voiced by Jay Mohr ) , and recognises a fellow castaway in Misha . Wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement , Misha convinces Paulie to tell him his life story . Which all began when he was a baby , and in the care of Marie , a five year old girl with a stutter . The two of them became birds of a feather ( OK , bad pun!).<br /><br />When Marie 's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird , they considered sending him away . And they finally did after Marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching Paulie to fly . Desperate to be reunited with her , Paulie begins a long journey across America , which includes a diverse number of new owners , flying great distances , and even ending up behind bars . Of a cage that is!<br /><br />Paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by DreamWorks in the late 90s . And although it was n't afforded the same recognition or box - office success of Babe , Paulie succeeds on quite a few levels , and is an occasional work of striking intelligence.<br /><br />Jay Mohr 's stand - up style of acting is well suited to the part of Paulie . He never plays the part as too smug , even if he is a bit of a smart Aleck . Paulie 's worldly , but he is also naive in his way.<br /><br />Because he 's lived a rather sheltered life with Marie , when he 's taken away , he has to fend for himself for the first time . And when he falls into the hands of different owners , they make promises to Paulie to reunite him with Marie , which he believes . Only for those promises to be broken time and again.<br /><br />Paulie is admittedly a little episodic . It follows the eclectic people Paulie ends up with , and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to Marie . He first winds up in a pawn shop , where he is adopted by Ivy ( Gena Rowlands ) , a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners . She sympathises with Paulie 's situation , and drives an RV across America to find Marie.<br /><br />Paulie is an occasionally very touching film . His scenes with Ivy are some of the best . Wonderful moments of Paulie perched on her shoulder singing Tom Jones numbers . The way she instills in him the need for hope is great , and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought - provoking : < br /><br />"There are things in life you put off , because you think you 're gon na do them later . But the real thing Ivy taught me is you got ta live like there may not be a later." < br /><br />The scene where Ivy passes away en route leaving Paulie all alone is a very heart - rending moment . And the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the Grand Canyon , soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film 's over.<br /><br />Despite the occasional sad moment , there are plenty of laughs to be had . Paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a Spanish outdoor restaurant . The animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number . And Paulie even gets to have a romance . Which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief ( played by Mohr as well ) . That may be the only complaint I have . As soon as you get comfortable with one situation , the film then moves Paulie on to another.<br /><br />The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATM machines is funny , but a little disturbing too . I 'm amazed DreamWorks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film . And Paulie 's diamond robbery is very Mission Impossible . He 's caught in the act , and shipped off to the lab for animal testing , where he 's remained ever since.<br /><br />The story finally comes full circle at the lab , where Misha vows to help Paulie . Of course they do find Marie . But the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity , I was left numb for several minutes . Paulie may never get the longevity Babe has , but I believe its an equally brilliant film . The same laughs . The same flawless effects . And the same surprising intelligence.<br /><br />A minor gem .
1 A talking parrot is n't a hugely imaginative idea for a new film , but Paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant , heartwarming film that will delight the whole family . It manages to bridge the gap between sentimental trash and cruel harshness during Marie and Paulie 's separation , and all the events in the film lead to a hugely satisfying emotional conclusion . The animal training is well - done - everyone will be affected when Paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time . Paulie is a great character and should have received way more success , though this film was n't a highlight of 1998 , unlike Saving Private Ryan . This hour and a half will surely be an enjoyable one and one that you will remember . Paulie 's story is a moving , sad , happy and interesting one - from the moment he is first seen to the moment he is united with his original owner , you will enjoy following him and watching him learning about friendship and the grim realities of life along the way . Not one to be missed if you have any kind of heart or emotion . 9/10
1 A sentimental story with a sentimental sound track . It 's about a little girl ( with a voice impediment ) who treasures her green parrot Paulie . The parrot thinks and talks like a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion.<br /><br />The parrot is definitely the star of the film . At times mischievous and at times in fits of depression the bird captures the mood in a most remarkable and expressive way . The synchronised voice too is very well done and within a minute or two you can actually believe that this intelligent little bird exists.<br /><br />Early in the film her father gives the bird to a pawnbroker and the subsequent scenes tell the story of Paulie 's constant struggle over many years to be re - united with his mistress . One of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people using the automatic teller machines . Paulie it seems has a phenomenal memory.<br /><br />The ending is predictable , but who would want it otherwise . Children will love this film and anybody who keeps a bird as a pet will delight in Paulie 's antics .
1 A very refreshing story , the life of a parrot with an intellect higher than an average human 's . Shows humans from a bird 's point of view . Especially liked the portrayal of different types of characters that the bird spends time with . Not all birds are bird - brained ...
1 This movie brought tears to my eyes ; John Roberts really knew how to get to viewers ' hearts , directing this wonderful picture where life is viewed through the mind and heart of Paulie . We discover from time to time , with the help of sensitive and talented directors like John , that even small creatures like Paulie have a heart . I just could n't stop my tears , even though the film has a happy end . This is great , after thousands of films I saw through my life , " Paulie " really touched me deeply . This is , after the " Ugly Duckling " , the second picture that really turned me upside down .
1 Spoiler This is a great film about a conure . He goes through quite the ordeal trying to get back to his little girl owner . He learns a lot through his journey and meets up with a lot of other beautiful birds . If you love birds like my wife does , this film is for you . This film also has some sad parts that make the tears run . In the end it all works out for Paulie and his Russian friend . Rent this for the whole family , everyone will enjoy this .
1 I absolutely LOVED this movie ! It was SO good ! This movie is told by the parrot , Paulie 's point of view . Paulie is given to the little girl Marie , as a present . Paulie helps Marie learn to talk and they become best friends . But when Paulie tells Marie to fly , she falls and the bird is sent away . That 's when the adventure begins . Paulie goes through so much to find his way back to Marie . This movie is so sweet , funny , touching , sad , and more . When I first watched this movie , it made me cry . The birds courage and urge to go find his Marie for all that time , was so touching . I must say that the ending is so sweet and sad , but you 'll have to watch it to find out how it goes . At the end , the janitor tries to help him , after hearing his story . Will he find his long lost Marie or not ? Find out when you watch this sweet , heart warming movie . It 'll touch your heart . Rating:10
1 Add Paulie the parrot to beloved movie animal characters . This movie is a love story - bird and Gena Rowlands , Bird and beloved Marie , Michael and Marie . A Russian janitor helps a talking and thinking parrot find his rightful owner many years after Marie 's parents sell him to a pawn shop . Before the heart warming ending we learn all the misadventures of Paulie . Cheech Marin and his dancing parrots are marvelous . Beautiful photography throughout . Great little movie , word of mouth will make it a cult favorite .
1 This is such a great movie to watch with young children . I 'm always looking for an excuse to watch it over & over . Gena was good , Cheech was fun , the Russian was good , Maria was adorable & of course Paulie was the best !
1 I have to tell you , this is a great movie . It surprises me sometimes how good a movie with no pretenses can be . This one is just fabulous . It could be that it is n't TRYING too hard to send any kind of message ; it just tells a whimsical , fun story . I gave it a 10 out of 10 .
1 Made me wish my own happy birds could talk . Tisk tisk on the reviewer who dissed the movie . A sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy . Paulie is a lovable little treasure . He has quite a few clever lines that truly made me laugh . I especially loved the dance sequences during his showbiz stint . You can forgive the obvious clichés as you cheer him on in his quest to be reunited with Marie . A charming movie featuring two strong characters who genuinely befriend the little parrot separated from his young owner . Would have liked to have seen more of the woman who becomes blind and must abandon their mutual journey . I liked her artistic and poetic inspirations , a shame she could not share Paulie 's reunion . Bless Paulie in his new home , at last with Marie , perhaps joined by the nice young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey .
1 This movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids . The movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level . I watched this movie first as a young child and found it to be funny , entertaining , and heartwarming and did not see it again for several years . I watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining . This movie is highly underrated and contains many messages of real life . This movie is an inspirational quest story that is made for kids yet epic in its own right . I recommend this movie to anyone of any age .
1 The movie was very sweet and heartwarming ! I cry almost every time I watch the movie . I would recommend this movie for every one . The movie was so inspiring to me . The actors did a great job of acting , and the movie was very well played and done . The movie was about a little girl who owned a parrot of whom she named Paulie . Paulie had gotten separated from her by her parents because they thought it would be best for her.<br /><br />After Paulie had experienced so many people he ended up in a cage by himself in a basement . Finally this Russian man who had gotten a job at a place as a janitor . Had found Paulie in the basement and Paulie began to talk to him telling him the story of his life . In the end the man helped Paulie reunite with Marie ( the little girl who raised Paulie ) . Love overcame all the obstacles .
1 Most folks might say that if one were to spend a Saturday night watching a movie , you must be really bored . Actually , I had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the TV and there it was,"Paulie " . < br /><br />I had missed the opening credits , so I did n't know the name of it but I saw that it had Cheech Marin in it , so I naturally thought I had tuned into " Born In East L.A. " When I saw him talking to a talking parrot , I was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night.<br /><br />Happy to say , it was better than that . As you know , if you do n't already Paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner . Seems it 's taken years to find her . What should be Paulie 's advantage is actually a dis - advantage in ways . People come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves . < br /><br />While Cheech Marin 's character " is " making money from him , he 's not mean to him . The dance sequences with the parrots are something kids will find cute , I found them amusing.<br /><br />Paulie , who 's naive',learns quickly that not all humans are nice people . Especially the owner of an animal research lab . The man lies to him saying he 'll help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communications research . Paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of Paulie 's vocal ability.<br /><br />Throughout the film Paulie 's telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him , several other animals and finding the location of Paulie 's owner . It 's a touching reunion . < br /><br />8 out of 10,the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown . That part might bother younger children . Otherwise , it 's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart . ( END )
1 I did n't give this movie a perfect score in order to be honest in comparing to great classics like " Citizen Kane " and " Seven Samaurai . " However , this movie is so all - around wonderful , it 's a real shame it scores so poorly for the general IMDb voter . However , the IMDb voter leans to the geeky , and " Paulie " does n't qualify for that.<br /><br />The only acting criticism I might suggest is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg did n't portray the perfect stuttering child . I 'm sorry , but asking a 6 year - old child to out - do Dustin Hoffman as the Rainman is asking for the impossible in film - making.<br /><br />Moving past that minor complaint , the movie has the best of many films : buddy road - trip , con - games , hero as friendly party - animal ( party - bird ? ) , Disney - like humor for young and old , etc . What 's not to like ? Tony Shaloub wears his role like a pair of comfortable jeans . That 's normal for him , it seems . ( " I 'm Russian ... I LIKE long stories . ) I do n't like mangoes , but he almost makes me want to go out and buy one . Watch the movie and that will make sense.<br /><br />Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin make very appropriate appearances in the film . Roles that are quite fitting to what we all know about them . I have always found Jay Mohr to be a bit slimy , and his on - screen role fits that as well . The only surprise to me was finding that Jay was also Paulie 's voice . In the end , even that works well ; put Parrot and anti - Parrot together as a team and it creates a magic of its own.<br /><br />If you are trying to find a film for you and the kids that is neither insulting nor boring for either , " Paulie " is a perfect candidate . I will , however , admit that a happy moment colors my review of " Paulie . " I was on a road - trip during a major heat - wave . The car 's air - conditioning died , half the restaurants had dead cooling ( as did our hotel ) and I said , " let 's watch a movie where there is working air - conditioning . " So we did . So for 100 minutes we were cooled , amused , and given a heart - warming experience . When I saw it recently on VCR under less emotional circumstances , I realized just how well this movie was made.<br /><br />It 's a sleeper film you wo n't regret watching .
1 Paulie sounds like the most saccharine , lachrymose and sentimental garbage you could ever find , yet it 's actually much better than you might expect . The daftness of the plot could so easily have set the tone for the whole film , but actually in most other departments the film is charming.<br /><br />In case you 're wondering , Paulie is a parrot . Bought for a little girl with speech difficulties , Paulie becomes her best friend and goes everywhere with her . He even sits on her shoulder during speech therapy lessons , and eventually becomes a super - intelligent speaker himself . However , Paulie is sent away by the little girl 's mother and he spends the rest of the film trying to get from N.Y.C to L.A to be re - united with her.<br /><br />So , why does this awful - sounding film succeed relatively well ? Firstly , it boasts some interesting and impressive animatronic effects . Secondly ( and far more significantly ) it has the courage to embrace its ludicrous premise and tells a genuinely moving , often humourous story without worrying too much about the obvious flaws in the storyline . Thirdly , it has several surprisingly strong performances , including Jay Mohr as a wily crook , Gena Rowlands as a kind old lady , and Cheech Marin ( yes , the dope - smoking Cheech Marin ! ) as a musical immigrant . It might not be a classic , but Paulie is sound entertainment for kids of all ages .
1 I know , I know : it 's childish . But I just love this type of movie . A bird that suffered a lot of " mishaps " and still has n't lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor . What 's special about this film is the fact that the main character is Paulie -the parrot- and he 's not used as a boost to some hotshot human actor . Furthermore I like the storyline : Paulie tells his lifestory to a cleaner at the point he hit rock bottom . ( By the way : Jay Mohr 's voice almost sounds like Joe Pesci 's ! ) . And Cheech Marin of course , the man IS humor to me . Ever since I saw " Up in Smoke " I have appreciated his naive way of performing , making a simple situation a hilarious one .. ca n't help myself .
1 Paulie is a fantasy of a littler girl or perhaps her recollection of what her youth was like growing up.<br /><br />Tony Shaloub executes a flawless performance as an Russian Scientist ( PhD ) who can not find decent work in America . He befriends an isolated parrot while performing meanial duties of a janitor at a behavioral science lab.<br /><br />The chief Doctor is a bitter man , as Paulie , who can speak and fully comprehend language and learn , embarasses the Doctor , who later banishses him to the lower levels of the building , where Mikail ( Tony S. ) finds him.<br /><br />Paulie recants his life with Marie and how they lost each other . The quest begins to reunite Paulie with Marie , only more than 20 years has passed.<br /><br />The movie ends , some will say predictably , with Mikail reuniting Paulie with Marie . The story closes with the three entering Marie 's home , where you can make the final your own choice.<br /><br />Great family film !
1 One of the best movies I ever saw was an Irish movie titled Philadelphia , Here I Come . I read the play before I saw the movie and loved them both . It 's the story of a young man preparing to leave Ireland to go to America because he ca n't earn a living in Ireland . It is told both from the perspective of the young man(whom the other characters in the film can see ) and another young man representing his uncensored thoughts and feelings . , but who can not be seen by the other characters in the film . It is a very sad movie , but deeply touching , and I would recommend this film to anyone who wants something to think about . I love any Irish movie , or almost any movie about Ireland , and any film that has the late Irish actor Donal McCann in it gets my vote . I would watch that man chew gum for 2 hours on screen , and unfortunately , I have . Terrible shame to have lost him so young .
1 After reading the original play I thought it would have been much more difficult to adapt to screen than it turned out to be . Donal McCann puts in a once - off great performance as Public Gar , the repressed antagonist who is manifested openly on screen by his extroverted ( but unseen to others ) alterego- Private Gar . Eamonn Kelly also plays an excellent " screwballs " whose inability to communicate his feelings is matched only by Gar.<br /><br />Definitely worth renting out if you can find it . ( Probably unavailable outside Ireland & UK )
1 This is a small film , few characters , theatrical . And yet it says something about Ireland that you wo n't find elsewhere . This film IS IRELAND . In all it 's grubiness , it 's sadness , it 's self - delusion . The Boys , Master Doyle , SP O'Donell , The Cannon , Senator Doogan 's daughter , Gar and above all Madge . I know them . I'm in the pub with them or kneeling to pray with them . They are our sad history and they are our present .
1 Story of Ireland in the 70/s . This film is a beautiful reconstruction of small time Ireland in the 1970/s . All the gang are there see below . Master Boyle , The Boys , The Cannon , SP O'Donnell , Senator Doogan 's Daugter , Rose , Agnes , Maura and Una . See this film . Feel Ireland as it was.<br /><br / >
1 Bette Midler is again Divine ! Raunchily humorous . In love with Burlesque . Capable of bringing you down to tears either with old jokes with new dresses or merely with old songs with more power & punch than ever . All in All Singing new ballads , power - singing the good old / perennial ones such as " The Rose " ; " Stay With Me " and yes , even " Wind Beneath My Wings " . The best way to appreciate the Divine Miss M has always been libe - since this is the next best thing to it , I strongly recommended to all with a mixture of adult wide - eyed enchantment and appreciation and a child 's mischievous wish for pushing all boundaries !
1 Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert . She gives her all every time she is on stage . Whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or dabbing our eyes at the strains of one of her tremendous ballads , Bette Midler moves her audience . If you ca n't see it live ( which is the best way to see Bette ) then this is the next best thing . An interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and matured over the years but never lost its power . Her more " vocally correct " version of " Stay With Me " never loses anything in spirit from THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS , Here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever . I will treasure this concert for a very long time .
1 Bette Midler showcases her talents and beauty in " Diva Las Vegas " . I am thrilled that I taped it and I am able to view whenever I want to . She possesses what it takes to keep an audience in captivity . Her voice is as beautiful as ever and will truly impress you . The highlight of the show was her singing " Stay With Me " from her 1979 movie " The Rose " . You can feel the emotion in the song and will end up having goose bumps . The show will leave you with the urge to go out and either rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and purchase one of Bette Midler 's albums .
1 Love it , love it , love it ! This is another absolutely superb performance from the Divine Miss M. From the beginning to the end , this is one big treat ! Do n't rent it- buy it now !
1 A longtime fan of Bette Midler , I must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites . Bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads . A literal rainbow of emotion and talent , Bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire , as well as new songs from the " Bette of Roses " album . Spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone . The one and only Divine Diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around .
1 After losing the Emmy for her performance as Mama Rose in the television version of GYPSY , Bette won an Emmy the following year for BETTE MIDLER : DIVA LAS VEGAS , a live concert special filmed for HBO from Las Vegas . Midler , who has been performing live on stage since the 1970 's , proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business . From her opening number , her classic " Friends " , where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud , Bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap - styled number called " I Look Good " she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections . The section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old Sophie Tucker jokes here to good advantage ( even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it , but her ad - libbing until she remembers it is hysterical ) . Bette also treats us to " Rose 's Turn " from GYPSY and the title tune from her smash film THE ROSE as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie THE FIRST WIVES CLUB . She brings the house down near the end with " Stay with Me , Baby " from THE ROSE and her only # 1 hit record , " Wind Beneath My Wings " from BEACHES . It 's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for Midler fans , it 's a must .
1 Only after some contemplation did I decide I liked this movie . And after reading comments from all the other posters here , and thinking about it some more , I decided that I liked it tremendously . I love American films - probably because they are so narrative . They usually have a well - defined beginning , middle , and end . " Presque rien , " on the other hand , makes no such attempt . I disagree with other posters that say it 's ' too artsy . ' In every way , this film is meant to evoke your sense memories . So often throughout the film you feel like you 're there ... you feel the summer sun , the breezes , the heat , the winter chill , the companionship , the loneliness , etc . , etc.<br /><br />In every way , the director pulls you into the lives of the characters - which is why so many people feel so strongly that the movie disappointed them . After I finished watching it , I felt the same . But upon some reflection , I recognized that this is how the movie had to be : the ' story ' is n't the narrative , it 's the emotions you ( the viewer ) feel.<br /><br />The lighting , scenery , and camera angles immerse you in the scenes - they 're rich , exquisite , and alive with detail and nuance . Although I normally can not countenance films without a fully developed plot ( after all , is n't a movie ' supposed ' to tell a story ) , this film is definitely one of my new favorites .
1 ' Presque Rien ' is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young French homosexual . Eschewing both stereotypes and preaching , it 's a wonderfully naturalistic film , superbly acted , shot with a feel for the seaside town where the action takes place , never melodramatic but often painfully real . If anything it 's almost too realistic , as there 's little in the way of conventional plot , just scenes from a life . But the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it might in a world so subtly drawn . ' Presque Rien ' might not be the most exciting film ever made ; but its simple humanism serves it well compared with the pre - conceived celebratory or bigoted viewpoints that often mar treatments of this theme . Worth a watch .
1 " Come Undone " appears to elicit a lot of opinions among the contributors to this forum . Granted , it 's a film that promises a take on gay life , as most viewers expect and somehow , it gets away from that promise into an introspective view at a young man 's soul . The film has a way of staying with us even when it has ended . It is a character study about how a young man gets involved into a love affair with someone so much different than him that , in the end , will leave Mathieu confused , hurt and depressed when things do n't go according to what he hoped the relationship would be.<br /><br />If you have n't seen the film , perhaps you would like to stop reading.<br /><br />Sebastien Lifshitz , the director of the film , has told his story from Mathieu 's viewpoint . Most viewers appear to be disoriented by the different times within the film , but there are hints that are not obvious , as one can see , in retrospect . The story is told in flashbacks that might add to the way some people will view the film . This is a story about the doomed the love Mathieu felt for Cedric and the ultimate breakdown of their life together.<br /><br />First of all , Cedric , the handsome young local , pursues Mathieu until he succeeds in convincing him he likes him . Mathieu feels the attraction for Cedric too . We realize how different both young men are by the way Cedric tells Mathieu 's family how he feels school is not for him . On the other hand , Mathieu , who wants to be an architect , finds beauty in the abandoned place where Cedric has taken him . We watch as Mathieu , reading from the guide book , wants Cedric 's attention.<br /><br />When Mathieu comes out to his mother , she wisely tells him about the importance of continuing his career . She also points out about what future both of them would have together , which proves to be true . Mathieu appears to have learned his lesson , the hard way . He goes on to an uncertain life with Cedric and attempts to take his own life . We watch him in the hospital speaking to a psychiatrist that has treated his wounded soul.<br /><br />The ending might be confusing for most viewers , but there is a moment in the film when Mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him washing glasses and looking intently to Pierre , the young man who frequents the bar . That is why when Mathieu goes looking for Pierre at his house , appears to be hard to imagine . Yet , we have seen the way Mathieu is obviously interested in Pierre . The last scene at the beach , when Pierre and Mathieu are seen strolling in the sand , has a hopeful sign that things will be better between them as they watch a young boy , apparently lost , but then realizing the father is nearby.<br /><br />Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films . This is a young man who is hard to understand on a simple level . Mathieu has suffered a lot , first with the separation of his parents , then with his depressed mother and with losing Cedric . Stephan Rideau , who has been seen on other important French films , is equally good , as the shallow Cedric.<br /><br />While " Come Undone " will divide opinions , the film deserves a viewing because of the complexity and the care Sebastien Lifshitz gives to the story .
1 ' Presque Rien ' ( ' Come Undone ' ) is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer/ director Sébastien Lifshitz ( with the collaboration of writer Stéphane Bouquet - the team that gave us the later ' Wild Side ' ) . As we come to understand Lifshitz 's manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable . By allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths - time now , time passed , time reflective , time imagined , time alone - Lifshitz makes his tales more personal , involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters ' responses . It takes a bit of work to key into his method , but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film.<br /><br />Mathieu ( handsome and gifted Jérémie Elkaïm ) is visiting the seaside for a holiday , a time to allow his mother ( Dominique Reymond ) to struggle with her undefined illness , cared for by the worldly and wise Annick ( Marie Matheron ) and accompanied by his sister Sarah ( Laetitia Legrix ) : their distant father has remained at home for business reasons . Weaving in and out of the first moments of the film are images of Mathieu alone , looking depressed , riding trains , speaking to someone in a little recorder . We are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action.<br /><br />While sunning at the beach Mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him , and we can feel Mathieu 's emotions quivering with confusion . The youth Cédric ( Stéphane Rideau ) follows Mathieu and his sister home , continuing the mystery of attraction . Soon Cédric approaches Mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession . Mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking , rebuffs Cédric 's public approaches , but continues to seek him out for consignations . The two young men are fully in the throes of being in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship , so very necessary to understanding this story , is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes . Yet as the summer wears on Mathieu , a committed student , realizes that Cédric is a drifter working in a condiment stand at a carnival . It becomes apparent that Cédric is the Dionysian partner while Mathieu is the Apollonian one : in a telling time in architectural ruin Mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while Cédric is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemaking.<br /><br />Mathieu is a complex person , coping with his familial ties strained by critical illness and a non - present father , a fear of his burgeoning sexuality , and his nascent passion for Cédric . Their moments of joy are disrupted by Cédric 's admission of infidelity and Mathieu 's inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways . Time passes , family changes are made , and Mathieu drifts into depression including a suicide attempt . The manner in which Mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace , strangely enough , in one of Cédric 's past lovers Pierre ( Nils Ohlund ) brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax.<br /><br />After viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful . Lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion , conflicts with passion 's powers found in love , and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful . The entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative . Lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of film - making . In French with English subtitles . Highly Recommended .

1 An adult , realistic , cruel , dark story , like a second part of " les roseaux savages " ( the wild reeds ) , plenty of beauty and sadness , ellipsis and silences , shadows and little sparks of hope . a man searching for a warm companion , a better life , a sincere attitude .
1 Maybe " Presque Rien " is not the best movie ever made ... But it is better than many of you have said . I still have n't seen a homo - themed movie better than this one.<br /><br />You Americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies , with a clear beginning , development and outcome . But European movies are less narrative , but makes you think much and feel.<br /><br />Many of you did n't understand the sense of the movie .. The purpose of this one is not show us a simple " summer loving movie " , with commercial characters who " fall in love and live happy forever " . Summer Holidays and beach are only a background , and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys.<br /><br />Maybe some of you did n't understand well this movie , because of its 3 parts , showed as flashbacks . These 3 moments are : - Summertime in Pornichet , when they meet and love . - After a year and half living together in Nantes , Mathieu does n't go to a psychiatric himself . He tries to suicide taking something , and Cedric brings him to hospital . Later , he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that . - The last part , is when Mathieu come back to Pornichet , in winter , alone .. to think about how his life have changed , how his life become to be , and trying to find himself.<br /><br />It 's possible that some people could n't understand all this well , because all the scenes are mixed among them . But anyway , as I said before ... this is not a funny movie . If what someone want to see is meat , for that , we have Belami movies.<br /><br />Presque Rien , what want to show us , is how cruel can be the life , for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life . Mathieu only wants to go away from home , and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness .. But what seemed perfect at the beginning .. later is not as good as he thought , and he become troubled , and feel that he has lost the way of his life . He is lost and does n't know what he really wants to do , or what makes him happy . He finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide . < br /><br />So , funny ? Is not a funny movie . Very hot scenes ? only a few .. but this is not a movie for entertainment . Is all about feelings ... friendship , love , happiness , unhappiness , pain , depression , loneliness ... I , as many others , feel identified with life and problems of Mathieu , and that is what director wanted to do .. a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy 's life.<br /><br />For me , the best homo - themed movie ever .
1 Stephane Rideau was already a star for his tour de force in " Wild Reeds , " and he is one of France 's biggest indie stars . In this film , he plays Cedric , a local boy who meets vacationing Mathieu ( newcomer Jamie Elkaim , in a stunning , nuanced , ethereal performance ) at the beach . Mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother , demanding aunt and sister ( with whom he has a competitive relationship ) . Soon , the two are falling in love.<br /><br />The film 's fractured narrative -- which is comprised of lengthy flash - backs , bits and pieces of the present , and real - time forward - movement into the future -- is a little daunting . Director Sebastien Lifshitz does n't signal which time - period we are in , and the story line can be difficult to follow . But stick it out : The film 's final 45 minutes are so engrossing that you wo n't be able to take your eyes off the screen . By turns heart - breaking and uplifting , this film ranks with " Beautiful Thing " as must - see cinema .
1 First love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema : the all - encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or , worse , slightly ridiculous.<br /><br />Lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving , sexy , thoroughly engrossing tale of love , disaster and possible redemption , while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existence.<br /><br />The core story is of Mathieu , 18 , a solitary , introverted boy who meets Cédric , brasher , more outgoing but just as lonely , while on holiday with his family . As the summer warms on , they fall in love and , when the holidays end , decide to live together . A year later , the relationship ends in catastrophe : Cédric cheats on Mathieu who , distraught , tries to take his own life . He survives and , in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met , this time cloaked in the chill of winter.<br /><br />If the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does : much of it is implied , all of it happens non - sequentially.<br /><br />The intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced , through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective . Fortunately , the three time - lines used ( the summer of love , the post - suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction ) are colour coded : warm yellows and oranges for the summer , an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside.<br /><br />Both main actors put in excellent performances though , whilst it 's a delight to see Stéphane Rideau ( Cédric ) used to his full capacity ( I 'm more used to seeing him under - stretched in Gael Morel 's rather limp dramas ) , Jérémie Elkaim ( Mathieu ) has to be singled out for special mention : you can feel his loneliness , then his almost incredulous passion , then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia . Beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could.<br /><br />The themes touched upon are almost classic in French cinema : our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling ; our difficulty in communicating fully ; the shifting sands of meaning   The film 's title " Presque rien " ( Almost Nothing ) points to all of these and , indeed , to one of the key scenes in the film : In trying to understand why Mathieu attempted to kill himself , a psychiatrist asks Cédric if he had ever cheated on him   " Non   enfin , oui   une fois , mais ce n'était rien " ( No   well , yes   once , but it was nothing ) . Cédric still loves Mathieu  he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt ( none of which we see ) and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves  but can not understand that he has lost him forever , because something that seemed nothing to him ( a meaningless affair ) is everything to Mathieu.<br /><br />Whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate Pierre et Gilles poster would suggest , it is not without hope : we get to see Cédric 's slow , painful attempts to get back in touch with life , first through a cat he adopts , then through work in a local bar and finally contact with Pierre , who may be his next love . But here the story ends : A teenage passion , over within the year , another perhaps beginning . So what was it ? Almost Nothing ? Certainly not when you 're living it 
1 I agree that the movie is a little slow at spots having many scenes of mundane everyday life and no dialog . And I was n't impressed right after I watched it . However , after a few days , I realized that the movie stays with me and it evokes a melancholy mood which lingers in my mind . My appreciation of this movie increases . It certainly merits a higher consideration than those movies that are instantly forgettable.<br /><br />As many have commented , the movie is non - linear and that 's a hallmark of European film - making as opposed to the linear narrative form that Hollywood favors . I do n't really know whether it 's true or not . Many also dislike its confusing structure and lack of clear explanations . To those viewers , I do n't think there is much I can say to change their opinions . However , for others who have yet to see the film , DO expect to be challenged and DON'T expect the film to supply all the answers and you might come away enjoying it more than you would otherwise.<br /><br />The movie skips around a bit but really chronicles just 3 time periods . Pay attention to the hair style and you can easily separate out 2 of the 3 periods . It is also not as confusing as suggested ; just enjoy and it 'll all be clear at the end.<br /><br />Yes , lots of things are left unsaid or not shown , and lots of situations are left unexplored . But is n't that what life is like ? A lot of time you 're not sure of the motives of your friends / loved ones unless you confront them and even then , you can never be 100 % sure if they told you the whole truth . This type of movies forces us to interpret the reasons behind the actions . The movie does , however , leave enough hints for you to make some reasonable assumptions . For example , Mathieu is manic depressive , to the point of suicidal . Why ? I do n't know , maybe his life is not turning out exactly as he expects it ; maybe he misses his family but has n't forgiven his father for abandoning his sick mother at her hours of need ; maybe after all he sacrifices for Cedric , rearranging and indeed , shattering his life to be with him , he realizes that it is all " coming undone " . I think the director meant to show us that he has always been a little off , mentality fragile by that scene w/ the dead bird . Maybe he has a very sensitive psyche and all these stresses are taking a toll on him . But we 're also shown that he is not some animal torturing psycho by his loving interaction w/ the stray cat . Also , there is one conversation between the doctor and Cedric that sheds light on the reason behind the breakup and maybe the suicide attempt . The doctor asks him if everything is okay , and Cedric thinks so even though he cheated on Mathieu once , but that 's nothing , according to Cedric . Is that the only reason , we do n't know , there are probably others , all mixed up together . Is it paramount that we know exactly what they are ? I do n't think so , for this movie . Another telltale sign that they are ultimately not compatible is the historical ruins scene . Mathieu is interested in studying the ruins , Cedric is not . He is the one w/ the raging hormone who focuses only on the physical side without an intellectual side that Mathieu obviously needs.<br /><br />Finally , the ending is really rather hopeful and sweet . I was pleasantly surprised by the turn of events after the bleak tone that edges toward the end.<br /><br />I have two complaints for the DVD . One is the sound . It 's very soft . I had to crank up the volume to hear the dialog and then when it switched to a bar or outdoor crowd scene , it became too loud . The other is that the subtitles ca n't be turn off ; they stay on the screen . Most foreign movie DVDs not released by a major studio are shoddy this way unfortunately .
1 What seemed at first just another introverted French flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me , on second viewing , a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation.<br /><br />Spoiler of sorts follows.<br /><br />Poor Cedric ; he apparently did n't know what hit him . Poor audience ; we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch . These two guys just did n't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter . As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other , the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for Mathieu , an intellectual being , to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach.<br /><br />On a purely technical note , I loved the camera action in this film . Subtitles were totally unnecessary , even though my French is " presque rien . " I could watch it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more . This was a polished , very professionally made motion picture . Though many scenes seem superfluous , I rate it nine out of ten .
1 I found this film the first time when I was searching for some works in witch Stéphane Rideau had participate , still in an extraordinary ravishment caused by the astonishingly beautiful « Les roseaux sauvages » ( in Portuguese , Juncos Silvestres ) , by André Téchiné . I was searching for similar movies , in the come of age line . I found then « Presque Rien » , a movie where the director Sébastien Lifshitz deliciously amazes us , earning a nomination by the Cannes festival in 2000 . The story is about two guys , the kind « boy next door » , Mathieu ( Jérémie Elkaïm ) and Cédric ( Stéphane Rideau ) , who meet during the summer vacations . In a land far from where he lives , Mathieu spends is days at the beach with his sister . There he meets Cédric , a local , with whom he starts this estival and revealing relationship , much by means of the sensual and seducer personality that Stéphane Rideau gives his characters , ( in « Les roseaux sauvages » , 6 years younger , he still preserves the innocence of the sweet seducer , witch matures here in experience ) . Exemplar in directing , in the amorous sequence , in the intimate and confessing description that is made about a boys first facing his ( still ambiguous ) sexuality and great love . The first love , in its terrible progression ecstasy - despair . The best of the film is the best of France : the fervent passion , the hot and excited rationalism , the brownish beauty , the simple and natural acceptance made by the families , although not without surprise and first anger . Still , there is the beach , the luminosity , the lightness e simplicity of summer , the freshness of breeze , the surge&#8217;s melody , and the expressive eyes of an introverted Elkaïm ( hesitant , hurt , puzzled , passionate ) . The sex is not avoided nor exploited , it is treated as it is , with no exhibitionist intention . In virtue of pure talent , this is a work of drama of uncommon quality , without cheap sentimentalism , showing an inevitably real image of two homosexual in their prime youth as any ordinary person , although with a social fear of rejection and shame . It is well worthy being seen , especially by those who adore French movies ( although the DVD front cover is very lame , with the two actors in between tens of stars , greased with brilliantine ) . A movie witch , in my opinion , deserves an 8 - 9 !
1 Screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival under the title ' Come Undone ' , April 25 , 26 , & 27 , 2001 . The cinematographer uses techniques that add to the storytelling . Even with fall / winter backgrounds for the ' present ' and spring summer for the ' flashbacks ' there can be some difficulty following the continuity.<br /><br />Whether either lead is gay , the actors well - portray the budding relationship in real life terms ; from physical violence toward each other to their passionate lovemaking . The story pulls you into the characters a bit slowly in the beginning . But as the end approaches , you really care about where these guys will be next summer ! You , too , will want a sequel to find out .
1 I liked this film very much . The story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow . There is no resolution to the story whatsoever , and you are left to wonder what really happened . Since I like that sort of film I enjoyed this . I especially like the " dating " scenes between the boys and I was drawn into their lives . And of course any film with a naked Staphane Rideau will get a couple of extra points . ;-)
1 Deeply emotional . It ca n't leave you neutral.<br /><br />Yes it 's a love story between 2 18 years old boys . But it 's only the body of this movie . And it 's been removed . You only feel what happened with these boys . You feel the soul of the movie . With of course some action , some sex , but this is no pornography , too many feelings.<br /><br />It was only a summer " story " , and it became , from love to hate , almost to death , the most important time of their lives . I loved it , you will too , whatever your feelings are .
1 There is certainly emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship -- one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning . And there is also emotion in the inner - workings of Mathieu 's family dealing w/ his mother 's problems -- and how that comes to bear on their relationship . But the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered ( unless I 'm just too dumb to pick up on them ) . Why is Mathieu in a mental hospital ? What led to the boys ' break - up ? And the flashing back between present and past is a little hard to follow at first . It seems like the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills , or some male nudity . But as a love story or character study it is lacking and unsatisfying .
1 ' Presque rien ' is a story of two young boys falling in love during summer stay by the seaside . I do n't want to tell the plot , because it 's not what 's most important about this film ( but you can be sure that it 's interesting and original ) . The best part of this movie is the cinematography . The visual side of ' Presque rien ' is so amazing it deserves highest note . It leaves you charmed with its beauty.<br /><br />As for the plot , it is shown in uneven , rather complicated way . There is no simple chronology nor there are answers to all the questions the film brings . But this is what makes ' Presque rien ' even more interesting . I recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed .
1 i 'm gon na give it to ya straight ... this movie is amazing . foreign gay films are so fast surpassing American gay films in production quality acting and story . while so many American indie gay films are grainy , bad sound , amateur acting , trite story lines , and a surprising lack of any nudity or erotica , top - quality foreign gay films have been popping up like this one from France . the cinematography is beautiful , thought out , meaningful . the story is adult and complex ( but not difficult for anyone to follow ) , the acting is intense and professional . both leads are fantastic , as well as the entire cast . the boys are more than just good - looking and there 's plenty of full frontal nudity . you follow the entire year of these boys , from their meeting to the end . all the little nuances of a relationship 's , the details of falling in , and out , of love are there beautifully performed . it left me wanting more . check it out !
1 This movie has everything . Emotion , power , affection , Stephane Rideau 's adorable naked beach dance ... It exposes the need for real inner communion and outer communication in any relationship . Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay does n't mean there is n't quite useful insight for anybody in it . I would probably classify it as a gay movie , but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people . Mathieu 's incapacity to handle his emotions divulges the way our society does n't encourage us to act any differently , and that is what engenders the discord between him and Cedric . This is definitely a must - see ! ! ! !
1 The movie is very realistic . Absolutely , it does not belong to the Hollywood Cinema genre where every line must be pronounced in a perfect manner and where every move is precise . The actors playing the roles of the lovers do a GREAT job representing the characters ' feelings and thoughts - their everyday life adventures . Overall , the movie climaxes the viewer to a depressed state . This is where the realism of the whole story is apparent . Not everything happens the way we think it should happen . I can say though that the movie does not end on a bad note . We watch , we learn , we experience ourselves . That is probably the moral of this story .
1 The plot of the story and the performance of the lead actors are very much down - to - earth ! The romance between two teen - age boys on the screen was done in good taste . You can easily relate to their emotions if you are one but if you are not one , you can appreciate the kind of love the film is trying to impart .
1 Most Hollywood movies fail to capture the full range of experience of teenagers . This film demonstrates exactly how to do it right . It combines elements of humour , suffering , rebellion , etc . in a way that is comlex & sympathetic . The ending could be a bit clearer , but the fact that the director does n't spell everything out for you in advance before coming to the conclusion means that this film assumes a more intelligent viewer .
1 A very close and sharp discription of the bubbling and dynamic emotional world of specialy one 18year old guy , that makes his first experiences in his gay love to an other boy , during an vacation with a part of his family.<br /><br />I liked this film because of his extremly clear and surrogated storytelling , with all this " Sound - close - ups " and quiet moments wich had been full of intensive moods.<br /><br / >
1 This movie was more of a passage into manhood for one gay man , and how he must deal with everyone . His mother is depressed , his younger sister is a pain , his older sister is somewhat accepting . The relationship looks good with his boyfriend / exhooker and he leaves his family to try life with this first guy . Unfortunately , the new guy screws around on him and says it really did n't mean anything . Our young gay man goes bonkers and ends up in the looney bin and eventually leaves , dumping his new lover and starting over . We are left with him starting over and viewing , not participating , in happiness . So maybe things will go better for him in the future . The ending was kind of a downer but the whole movie was entirely realistic and so I will let this real ending slip bye with a high rating .
1 This movie has a special way of telling the story , at first i found it rather odd as it jumped through time and I had no idea what s happening.<br /><br />Anyway the story line was although simple , but still very real and touching . You met someone the first time , you fell in love completely , but broke up at last and promoted a deadly agony . Who has n't go through this ? but we will never forget this kind of pain in our life . < br /><br />I would say i am rather touched as two actor has shown great performance in showing the love between the characters . I just wish that the story could be a happy ending .
1 A lonely depressed French boy Mathieu ( Jeremie Elkaim ) on vacation in the summer , meets and falls in love with Cedric ( the gorgeous Stephane Rideau ) . Quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie . On one hand , I was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys . On the other I was getting annoyed -- the film constantly keeps flashing around from the past to the present with no rhyme or reason . It 's very confusing and pointless . < br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD!!!<br /><br />Also there are tons of plot holes -- Mathieu , at one point , does something that ends him up in the hospital . What is it -- we're never told ! Then he breaks up with Cedric and tells everybody else he 's living with him . Why ? We 're not told . Then he hooks up inexplicably with another guy at the end . Why ? No explanation . It 's clear Cedric loves Mathieu and Mathieu is living in the same town so ... However it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters so much . If only things were explained!<br /><br />Elkaim as Mathieu is not good . He 's tall , handsome and has a nice body -- but he ca n't act . His idea of acting is sitting around with a blank look on his face -- all the time . Rideau , on the other hand , is great . He 's VERY handsome , has a very nice body and is one hell of an actor . Also he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him . There is full frontal male nudity , lots of kissing and a fairly explicit sex scene in the movie which is great -- most movies shy away from showing male - male love scenes . This one does n't and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other.<br /><br />So , a frustrating film but somewhat worth seeing -- especially for Rideau 's nude scenes -- that is , if you like good - looking nude young men!<br /><br / >
1 The romance of the movie , which is also its main theme , is good and nicely presented . However , the surrounding of the love story is too lyric , graphical and unrealistic . Even worse , the psychology of the main character is weird and incomprehensible , exactly like the end of the movie . Do n't hesitate to watch this movie , if it attracted your interest , but do n't expect too much of it either .
1 This is an unusual Laurel & Hardy comedy with something of a split personality : at times it feels like two movies made in different styles spliced into a single short . Happily , each portion is funny in its own right , and the boys ' seemingly effortless clowning carries the day and synthesizes the film 's disparate elements into an entertaining whole . While I 've never heard a fan cite DIRTY WORK as his or her favorite Laurel & Hardy comedy , it 's nonetheless one that everybody seems to like.<br /><br />Our story is set in the home of Professor Noodle , who represents one key element of the story - line : a wildly over - the - top parody of Mad Scientist scenarios . This marks a rare venture into sci - fi territory for L&H ; Abbott & Costello and The Three Stooges tangled with mad doctors far more often than Stan & Ollie . In any event , the professor is obsessed with creating a rejuvenating serum that can make people younger , while his sarcastic butler , Jessup , expresses the viewer 's skepticism with rolled eyes and the occasional dry quip . Meanwhile , Stan & Ollie are chimney sweeps who show up at the Professor 's home the very day he perfects his solution . " Their " portion of the film consists of characteristic ( but first - rate ) slapstick involving the chimney , the roof , shovels , and a number of unfortunate mishaps . If you do n't enjoy watching these guys screw up a task then you probably wo n't like DIRTY WORK , but for fans of the team this movie is a feast . The highlight comes when Ollie plummets through the chimney , lands in the fireplace , and is then pummeled with bricks that fall onto his head with maddening rhythmic precision , one by one . I also like the shot of Ollie tumbling off the roof into a greenhouse ; the process work is so slapdash I suspect it was something of an inside joke , the way W.C. Fields ' movies would feature the world 's worst rear - projection screens.<br /><br />The slapstick stuff is great fun , but it 's the mad scientist motif that makes this film offbeat , and two supporting players deserve a tip of the bowler hat : prolific character actor Lucien Littlefield is terrific as the professor , delivering his overripe lines with relish and cackling with hammy glee , while Sam Adams is a stitch in the less showy role of Jessup the butler . As great as Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were in their prime , it 's always worth noting that their supporting casts at the Hal Roach Studio gave their films an enormous boost . So too , usually , did the background music of Le Roy Shield , but DIRTY WORK marks a rare occasion from this period that a Roach comedy has no musical accompaniment at all after the opening credits . Mood music might have enhanced the proceedings , but no matter ; this is a highly enjoyable comedy anyhow , and a prime example of what made Laurel & Hardy so popular in their day .
1 In many ways DIRTY WORK is a predictable L&H short on the surface with the boys going to sweep someone`s chimney . Guess what happens next ? That`s right slapstick at its most sucessful ensues .<br /><br />But there`s one or two things that seem untypical . Ollie for example is very unlikable , he`s arrogant , he`s rude , and not only to Stan look at the way he addresses the servant with " HEY YOU " and takes a childish huff very easily with his catchphrase being " I have nothing to say " . In short Ollie plays a bully in a very unlikable way and I much prefer to see him to play the arrogant coward where he`s always at his funniest < br /><br />DIRTY WORK also lacks the reportary regulars of the other L&H shorts like Finlayson , Long , Busch and Housman which means when we switch to the mad scientist plotline there`s a slightly creepy atmosphere that jars with the rest of the movie < br /><br />Having said that this is still a good short mainly down to Stan . Also watch out for a scene featuring a fish . Many jokes / plots from L&H feature fish and this is another one
1 The concept of having Laurel & Hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious . It guarantees some funny situations and silly antics , from especially Stan Laurel of course as usual.<br /><br />The movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula . It does n't really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending . It 's still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless , so it works for the movie.<br /><br />The supporting cast of the movie is surprising good . Sam Adams is great as the stereotypical butler and Lucien Littlefield goes deliciously over - the - top as the nutty professor.<br /><br />The movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences , which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed . It all helps to make " Dirty Work " to be one of the better Laurel & Hardy shorts.<br /><br />8/10
1 A LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short . The Boys arrive to sweep the chimneys at the home of Professor Noodle , a mad scientist who 's just perfected his rejuvenation serum . Stan & Ollie proceed with their DIRTY WORK , spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof . Then the Professor wants to try out his new potion ... <br /><br />A very funny little film . The ending is a bit abrupt , but much of the slapstick leading up to it is terrific . Especially good is Stan & Ollie 's contest of wills at opposite ends of the chimney . That 's Lucien Littlefield as the Professor .
1 I have seen Dirty Work several times and is probably my favourite Stan and Ollie short.<br /><br />In this one , Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and get the job to clean the chimney at the home of Professor Noodle ( Lucien Littlefield ) . While Noodle is doing mad experiments in his lab , Stan and Ollie cause much chaos trying to clean the chimney and make a mess of the living room . The end is where Ollie falls into a tank of special formula that Noodle uses for his experiments and this turns him into a chimp ! The best part is where Ollie falls down the chimney and loads of bricks land on his head , but he does n't seem to suffer much pain from this.<br /><br />Dirty Work is Stan and Ollie at their funniest . Great fun.<br /><br />Rating : 5 stars out of 5 .
1 Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I am happy to see any of their films . Professor Noodle ( Lucien Littlefield ) is nearing the completion of his rejuvenation formula , with the ability to reverse ageing , after twenty years . Ollie and Stan are the chimney sweeps that arrive to do their job , and very quickly Ollie wants to get away from Stan making mistakes . Ollie goes to the roof to help with the other end of the brush at the top of the chimney , but Stan in the living room ends up pushing the him back in the attic . After breaking an extension , Stan gets a replacement , a loaded gun , from off the wall , and of course it fires the brush off . Stan goes up to have a look , and Ollie , standing on the attic door of the roof , falls into the greenhouse . Stan asks if he was hurt , and Ollie only answers with " I have nothing to say . " Ollie gets back on the roof , and he and Stan end up in a tug and pull squabble which ends up in Ollie falling down and destroying the chimney . Ollie , hatless , in the fireplace is hit on the head by many bricks coming down , and the butler Jessup ( Sam Adams ) is covered in chimney ash smoke , oh , and Ollie still has nothing to say to Stan . The boys decide to clean up the mess , and when Stan tears the carpet with the shovel , Ollie asks " Ca n't you do anything right " , and Stan replies " I have nothing to say " , getting the shovel bashed on his head . As Ollie holds a bag for Stan to shovel in the ashes , they get distracted by a painting on the wall , and the ashes end up down Ollie 's trousers , so Stan gets another shovel bashed on the head . Professor Noodle finishes his formula , and does a final test on a duck , with a drop in a tank of water , changing it into a duckling . He also shows the boys his success , turning the duckling into an egg , and he next proposes to use a human subject , i.e. his butler . While he 's gone , the boys decide to test the formula for themselves , but Ollie ends up being knocked by Stan into the water tank with all the formula . In the end , what was once Ollie comes out , an ape , and when Stan asks him to speak , all Ollie ape says is " I have nothing to say " , and Stan whimpers . Filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film , it is an enjoyable film . Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians ' Comedian . Very good !
1 Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy films have very , very little plot . Instead , they give them a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious ! Films such as HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are among the funniest as you see the boys working or cleaning house . Here in DIRTY WORK , most of the film is akin to these other two films -- Stan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the film trying ( quite unsuccessfully ) to clean a crazy professor 's chimney . Seeing Ollie fall through the chimney , the boys making the house a total mess and the insane behaviors of Stanley all work together to make a very pleasing film.<br /><br />However , in an odd twist , there is also a really weird subplot that begins and ends the movie . It seems that the professor is truly a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger . Late in the film , you see him make a duck into a duckling and even a duckling into an egg ! Given that he then leaves the boys alone in the room , is it any surprise what happens next ? While this subplot was unnecessary , it worked well enough . What worked exceptionally well was the middle portion . Give the boys nothing exciting to do and you 'll be amazed at the hilarious results . One of the team 's better films and it almost earns a 9 .
1 This is by far the funniest short made by the two comic geniuses . From the time they walk in , to the time Hardy just falls off the roof , this keeps me laughing hysterically . I highly suggest that every fan of Laurel and Hardy should see this short . I also recommend all of the Ghost Series . If you are looking for laughs , see this movie and you will be happy .
1 Warning ! Spoilers ahead!<br /><br / > SPOILERS < br /><br / > I 've seen movie in German , so it might be , that I missed some clues.<br /><br / > Despite some weakness in the plot , it 's a movie that came through to me . I liked especially Lexa Doig 's acting . Sometimes I got impression , that she * is * Camille . But I ca n't stop wondering , what happened at the end with Bob , Cassie and baby . I belive , she , after initially being set on Bob , eventually ended up loving him and regretting what happened with his brother and being forced to lie to him . Otherwise it 's a bit strange , that she would carry his baby and love it . It 's up to viewer to decide - and I do n't like such endings . Dean Cain was as good as ever , Eric Roberts .. well , I 've seen him better but also worse.<br /><br / > I believe that the film is more an analysis of human relations and reacting in unexpected situations than a crime story.<br /><br / > Bottom line is , I liked it very much .
1 On first watching this film it is hard to know quite what has happened , but on a subsequent viewing it become more clear . I enjoyed this movie . Dean Cain was excellent in the role of Bob . Lexa Doig 's character was confusing to understand , at first , she was out to trap Bob but i really believe she landed up loving him although by then she had broken his heart . Dean Cain 's performance was an usual excellent . He gets better with every film he does . My only question at the end of the film was what happened to Bob , Camilla and the baby . It was left for the viewer to decide
1 The Movie I thought was excellent it was suppose to be about romance with a little suspense in between.<br /><br />Rob Stewart is a wonderful actor I do n't know why people keep giving him a bad rap . As for Mel Harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for Rob it 's only by five years.<br /><br />Rob had a lead role in his own TV series as well as one on the Scifi channel . I 'm sure you remember Topical Heat aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane.<br /><br />He also starred in a number of TV movies and is now making a TV Mini series.<br /><br />They need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at .
1 Hmmmm , want a little romance with your mystery ? This has it . I think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie . But how could the romance be ditched when the story 's borrowed from something called a Harlequin Romance novel , whatever the heck that is . Had the romance been ditched , the story might have been a little too weak . The mystery here was n't too bad , quite interesting but nothing on the level of Mission Impossible international espionage . Oh well . I thought Mel Harris was pretty good ; her short skirts , i think , added some sex appeal ... but this Rob Stewart guy probably could have been better cast , maybe with a more well known TV movie actor . The directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on - both could have been a little edgier , a little darker , more adventurous . One thing that was great about this was the use of real European locations . That could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in Canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like Budapest . Possibly a drawback was the director and/or cinematographer 's choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect . Not good . Had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen , picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background . This was just a tv - movie , though , so they had to add some Ummmph to the picture and some of that Ummmph came from the scenery . Overall , twasn't really a bad movie . I 'll tell you what , this was absolutely the best Canadian - Hungarian production I have ever seen ! ( and the only that i know of . ) I hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made - for - tv movie , giving it a grade of C-
1 I just watched this movie on Showtime . Quite by accident actually . If I would n't have only had 6 hrs of sleep for the past two days then I would n't have came home early from work . If I had n't came home early from work I would n't have seen this movie . I would n't have known what I was missing , but I would 've missed a lot.<br /><br />That 's the way this movie is . It 's almost playing on the Kevin Bacon effect . That and causality ( hence my verbiage above ) . Ever character is intertwined in some way or another . Action , reaction , interaction , non - interaction . This movie is just wonderful . I 'm going to have to find a copy to buy .
1 I Last night I had the pleasure of seeing the movie BUG at the Florida Film Festival and let me say it was a real treat . The Directors were there and they did a Q&A afterwards . The movie begins with a young boy smashing a roach beneath his foot , a man who is nearby parking his car sees the young boy smash it and runs to ask the kid ` why ? why ? did he have to kill that living creature ? ' in his rush to counsel the youth in the error of his ways , the man neglects to pay his parking meter , which starts off a whole chain of events involving people not at all related to him , some funny , some sad , and some ridiculous . This movie has a lot of laughs , Lots ! and there are many actors which you will recognize . The main actors who stood out in the film for me were : Jamie Kennedy ( from his comedy show the Jamie Kennedy Experiment , playing a fortune cookie writer ; John Carroll Lynch ( who plays Drew 's cross dressing brother on the Drew Carey show ) playing the animal loving guy who just ca n't get it right ; Brian Cox ( The original Hannibal Lecter in Manhunter ) playing the germaphobic owner of a Donut and Chinese Food Take Out joint . There is one line where Cox tells his chef to wash off some pigs blood that is on the sidewalk by saying " clean up that death " which is quite funny mostly because of Cox 's " obsessed with germs " delivery . The funniest moment in the movie comes when a young boy imitates his father , whom he heard earlier in the day yell out ` MotherF * * * * * ' , while in the classroom . Another extremely funny and surreal scene is when Trudie Styler ( Mrs. Sting herself ) and another actor perform a scene on a cable access show , from the film the boy in the plastic bubble . The actor who hosts the cable access show is just amazing he is so serious and deadpan and his performance as both the doctor and the boy in the plastic bubble is enthralling . There are many other fine and funny actors and actresses in this film and having shot it in less than a month with a budget of just about $ 1 million , the directors Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi ( who are screenwriters by trade , having written crazy / beautiful and the upcoming Tuxedo starring Jackie Chan ) have achieved a film that is great , funny and endearing .
1 There are so many " Hollywood " movies made now that are not only torture to watch , but also have no bearing on anyone 's life , whatsoever . Granted , movies do n't always have to have deep meaning , but it 's nice to know that there are still film - makers out there who care about telling " human " stories . I wo n't give away the premise of this brilliant film , however , the screenplay is surely one of the more complex and memorable ones I have ever seen in my life , and I 'm a 32-year - old film buff too ! Bug ranks top ten on my list of favorites , which includes : On the Waterfront , Sunset Boulevard , and Black Narcissus , to name just a few . This " moving " movie should become one of your favorites also- that is , if you have a heart !
1 OK so a 10 for a 2 1/2 star movie you ask? ... well see this one and maybe it will make more sense .. Hitchcock never blended scenes together better .... The film weaves scenes together flawlessly from the start and yet you do n't get that scattered feeling you sometimes get when a movie runs you through the many characters it attempts to develop . You sense that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves and then they do n't disappoint you when they do . Screenwriter / Producer Phil Hay 's surreal tale of life , blended with an absolutely superb soundtrack makes you think more about the 6 degrees of separation in life than the movie by the same title ... I will be looking for more good things from this producer in the future .
1 I recently bought this movie and I do not regret having it at all as a matter of fact I am very please have this movie to add to my collection . Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay , movie directors , took less than one month to film and spent about 1 million EUR to produce this great movie . This proves that not only big productions make great movies.<br /><br />The title of this movie fits in perfectly . In computer language BUG means program error which causes reactions in computer function . Our reactions can cause these negative side effects , but also great moments of beauty . The vertiginous happenings in this movie start with the death of a BUG . A man witnesses the " crime " on the other side of the road ... From there onwards everything gets complicated ... <br /><br />I point out John Carrol Lynch ( " Fargo " ) , Wallece , the man who can not make everything right at all .
1 This was a very entertaining movie and I really enjoyed it , I do n't normally rent movies like these ( ie . indie flicks ) however , I was attracted to the film because it had an incredible cast which included Jamie Kennedy , whom I have loved since the Scream trilogy . The movie director took a risk ( and it is a risky risk ) in telling the lives of many ( and I mean MANY ) different people and having the intertwine at various intervals . Taking that risk was a good idea because it 's end result is an exceedingly good film . < br /><br />The film has a few MAIN characters ; Dwight ( Jamie Kennedy ) - a disgruntled fortune cookie writer whose relationship with his girlfriend is on the rocks because of an argument . Wallace Gregory ( John Carroll Lynch ) - an airplane loader / technician who has a love for all living things ( except , perhaps meter maids ) and who despite his good heart has an increasing amount of bad luck . Cyr ( Brian Cox ) - the owner of a Chinese restaurant / donut shop who is a germaphobe and because of is his fear of germs places his assistant / cook Sung -(Alexis Cruz ) under pressure to keep up with his phobia . Ernie - ( Christopher Bauer ) is married to Olive - ( Christina Kirk ) who he is convinced is trying to ; stop him have fun , look ridiculous , go insane , and not live a normal life . They begin to have petty and almost crazy arguments and Olive seriously begins to have doubts about Ernie . Gordon - ( Grant Heslov ) is a man whose life is n't going very well , as bad things begin to add up in his life he decides to take it in hand . Mitchel - ( Jon Huertas ) is convinced that Gwen - ( Alexandra Westcourt ) is the girl of his dreams and that they are destined for each other , though she is more skeptical . He attempts to woo her every chance he gets and he certainly makes attempts ! Johnston - ( Michael Hitchcock ) has just been fired from his job and has doubts about his role as provider , he takes another job that he just is n't suited for . His wife Annelle - ( Arabella Field ) is comforting through out his job loss experience until she learns that Johnston was n't quite the loving husband she thought he was.<br /><br />All in all I definitely suggest this movie!<br /><br />-Erica
1 Worth watching twice because of the rapid - paced causal shifts among several compelling stories , " Bug " emerges as a wholly satisfying work of art that plays ever - optimistic love against myriad examples of frustrating reality.<br /><br />My favorite characters are Wallace ( John Carroll Lynch)whose overriding concern for life -- from that of a cockroach to the airline passengers for whom he is partially responsible -- frames the film ; Olive ( Christina Kirk ) , who spends considerable time creating surreal but tasty meals for her impossible husband Ernie ( Chris Bauer ) ; and Mitchell , a cable TV technician with unbounded trust in fortune cookie messages : " You will meet the girl of your dreams." < br /><br />Against such optimism are the forces of quirky reality , all generated by actions of the characters : parking tickets , a clogged drain in a Chinese food / donut shop , TV disruption , a crushed auto fender , an obliterated dinner reservation that eventually results in cancellation of a Hawaiian vacation.<br /><br />The film is funny : Olive getting drunk at a Chippendale performance , Johnston ( Michael Hitchcock)as a customer service rep attempting to deal with an irate customer , the germ - obsessive Cyr ( Brian Cox ) facing a restaurant inspector , Dwight ( Jamie Kennedy ) reacting to his girlfriend 's refusal to have children by writing hostile Chinese cookie fortunes : " Your girlfriend is lying to you " and the guy who falls asleep while manning a jackhammer because he spent the night looking for his girlfriend 's missing cat.<br /><br />A minor story with public cable access host ( Darryl Theirse ) and a local acting teacher reading from " The Boy in the Bubble " expresses the major theme : love comes from the heart.<br /><br />"Bug " entertains on much the same level as " trains , planes and automobiles " but on a lower budget and with a fresher eye .
1 This is a great movie ! Most of us have seen Jurassic Park , where the Chaos Theory is summarized by telling about a butterfly 's wings , causing a tornado on the other side of the planet . Well , Bug is all about that ( or at least something , do n't worry this is no spoiler ) I 'm definitely not a religious type and do n't believe in pre - destined stuff , fate , etc , but this movie surely makes you wonder if coincidence really exists ... <br /><br />further more , the acting and camera are excellent too , another prove that it 's still possible to make a good movie without a zillion bucks
1 As a producer of indie movies and a harsh critic of such , I have to say I loved this movie . It is funny and intelligent , well directed and entertaining . Hats off to the producers and directors for making a good one ! I 'll be watching for the next one . I gave it a 10 .
1 It is hard to describe Bug in words , it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood . It follows a narrative that is more fluid and interesting than anything I have seen lately in a Hollywood release . As its characters react to the chain of events in different ways , and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow , the audience is merely an observer . The almost Proustian narrative flow of thought to thought , the very spontaneity in the script will have you glued to the screen , waiting anxiously to see how it all works out in the end . And as far as the thematic elements ... there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy , to bright and beautiful , and then to tragic , all within the span of about a minute . And it works.<br /><br />This movie is pure magic . It reminds one why independent film is perhaps the brightest star the film industry currently has . Perhaps with more movies of Bug 's quality , people will start to take notice .
1 The Good Thing about this movie : The concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes . It also makes you think of those little things in life that could greatly affect the life of someone else without you ever knowing . Its a small world and this little movie shows us.<br /><br />The Bad Thing : There are too many characters and its hard to tell who the main character is but its still a great movie.<br /><br />Its a great movie and many people compare it to Magnolia which I have n't seen.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Not Rated --- I would rate it PG-13 for brief violence , some language and sexual situations .
1 This was surprisingly intelligent for a TV movie , and quite true to my own experience of bulimia . It was actually well - researched , and I can only assume it was written by someone who 's gone through a similar experience , because it had all the little details . The characters were quite well - drawn , and the performances by Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were great . I think what I like most was that they made them specific and smart , and there was no dumbing down of the reasons for Beth 's bulimia ( it was n't some " diet gone out of control , caused by the pressures placed on girls by the media , pressures we 're not actually going to address ... " ) . Her mother was n't completely clueless - too often on television they 'll take an issue that EVERYONE has some awareness of and try to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on earth who do n't ( " Diabetes ? What 's that ? Oh , my world is all askew , doctor , please explain it all to me as if I 'm a small child " , etc ) . It was brilliant that her mother was a psychologist and even she did n't see the signs . And the scenes where Beth was throwing up were n't OVERLY melodramatic and sensationalist , and concentrated more on bulimics ' need for secrecy , and their out - of - controlness . The scene where Beth tells her mother she 's bulimic would 've made me cry if there had n't been other people in the room.<br /><br />Okay , so I liked those bits . What did n't work for me so well was the ending , which headed back to the TV movie territory we know and do n't particularly love , but I guess they had to wrap it up . " You , too , can cure your child 's eating disorder , if you have lots and lots of money and live in America ... " < br /><br />And can I just say again that I really like Mare Winningham . She 's great .
1 I cried my heart out , watching this movie . I have never suffered from any eating disorder , but I think this must be a very true picture.<br /><br />Alison Lohman is excellent ! She expresses these feelings amazingly well . My teenage years came back to me so vividly . Anyone who has gone through difficult times as a child or teenager will be able to relate to this movie . I recommend you all to see it!<br /><br />The music is great too - I 've now discovered Diana Lorden.<br /><br />I'm also looking forward to seeing Alison Lohman in White Oléander , because I am positive she is perfectly suited for the role as Agnes .
1 This was a pretty good movie , I liked it . I thought it was a pretty accurate look at bulimia and how it 's not about dieting , it 's about having a pain so deep that they have to find a way to deal with it and they choose this . Beth was a very accurately drawn character and in the scene where she confronts her mom about the eating disorder you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she is feeling . I also think one of the best lines in the movie is where Beth yells the words , " It 's not about you . " to her mother . Those words were so true and added so much to that scene in the movie . I think that that scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie .
1 If you havn't seen this movie I highly recommend you do . It 's an excellent true story . I love Alison Lohman she is so talented side note : I also loved her in 7th heaven . The whole story line is amazing and the way they chose there characters waz awesome . The acting in this film is < br /><br />very awesome .
1 This is a film which should be seen by anybody interested in , effected by , or suffering from an eating disorder . It is an amazingly accurate and sensitive portrayal of bulimia in a teenage girl , its causes and its symptoms . The girl is played by one of the most brilliant young actresses working in cinema today , Alison Lohman , who was later so spectacular in ' Where the Truth Lies ' . I would recommend that this film be shown in all schools , as you will never see a better on this subject . Alison Lohman is absolutely outstanding , and one marvels at her ability to convey the anguish of a girl suffering from this compulsive disorder . If barometers tell us the air pressure , Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure with the same degree of accuracy . Her emotional range is so precise , each scene could be measured microscopically for its gradations of trauma , on a scale of rising hysteria and desperation which reaches unbearable intensity . Mare Winningham is the perfect choice to play her mother , and does so with immense sympathy and a range of emotions just as finely tuned as Lohman 's . Together , they make a pair of sensitive emotional oscillators vibrating in resonance with one another . This film is really an astonishing achievement , and director Katt Shea should be proud of it . The only reason for not seeing it is if you are not interested in people . But even if you like nature films best , this is after all animal behaviour at the sharp edge . Bulimia is an extreme version of how a tormented soul can destroy her own body in a frenzy of despair . And if we do n't sympathise with people suffering from the depths of despair , then we are dead inside .
1 This was the best movie I 've ever seen about Bulimia . It hit the exact spot of what Bulimia is really about and how it 's not always about being skinny and dieting . It showed how people with Bulimia tend to think about things such as their outlook on life , friends and themselves . The best line and the part that really shows what the problem with Bulimia is , is when Beth says,"It 's not about you ! " That line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem . It showed that people with Bulimia do n't have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else . It has to do with them and them only . It shows that it 's time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention all on themselves . It showed that Beth needed to call out for attention at that moment and she needed her mom 's attention at that time the most .
1 well i was n't sure what the film was going to be like as i had only seen a little clip but i was thinking its going to be good and i was right i watched it twice on the day i got it and well it is my favourite film.<br /><br />i think Alison Lohan played the part of beth really well she is such a grate actress and the writer must have gone into a lot of research to find out about bulimia although the ending when beth is in the hospital an has 2 Horus observation after meals because iv been told like 1 house is OK and also that hospitals does n't help bulimics as iv been told which is probably why I 'm still at home even tho my sister and mum would like to have me hospitalised as i to have bulimia but this is a grate film i recommend it to any one with or with out an eating disorder or for people who know some one with eating disorders as it can let them in to the lives of a bulimic person and see the world how they do a bit over all a grate film and i recommend it to any one and any type of person
1 " Darius Goes West " is the touching story of a brave teen coping with Duchenne 's Muscular Dystrophy and his personal quest to see the Pacific Ocean . He receives help and encouragement from a group of young men who love and care for him while going on this quest.<br /><br />The story has a natural drama and honest portrayal of the commitment of young people to help one of their own stricken with this incurable disease.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks young people are self - centered and narcissistic will find this movie to turn that stereotype on its head . It is the power of the young people and their engagement with Darius ' plight that is very compelling in this documentary .
1 I have one word to someup this movie , WOW ! I saw " Darius Goes West " at the Tribeca Film Festival . People in the theater were sobbing . This movie shows the hardships that Darius sufferes with Muscular Dystrophy . The movie was very well done and really made you part of the movie , I WAS SO emotionally moved by the movie because it made us remember that we are very fortunate to be perfectly healthy , some people in this world are less fortuate then us . And sometimes we should give them a had and help them , to the very end . I would give them ten stars , they gave Darius a had when they were n't asked to , they did't do it for the money they did it for a friend in need , Darius , the world should know , Darius went west .
1 Darius Goes West is a film depicting American belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough . This wonderful fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking film shows a young man who never expected , but longed to see , what was outside the confines of his lovely city of Athens , GA . Darius wished to see the ocean . His longtime friends Logan , Ben and several other good friends decided to make Darius ' wish come true . They started small - Ben & Logan 's mom started an email campaign to bring awareness to Darius ' condition : Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and to raise funds for the fellas to take Darius to not only see the ocean but to see these great United States . To say the young college buddies succeeded in bringing hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement . They realized Darius ' dream and then some . They put their lives on hold while showing love , care and tons of fun to Darius while helping Darius see how he can in turn show those same traits to others suffering from DMD . Darius went on to volunteer for the Red Cross - sitting in his chair collecting money ( along with his buddies ) outside a local grocery store . His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams do come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you . Give Darius and all the guys an Oscar - no one else deserves it more . Martha Sweeney .
1 Darius Goes West is an amazing documentary about a teenager ( Weems ) with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy , and his 11 friends who take him on a cross - country trip to see if " Pimp My Ride " will pimp out his wheelchair.<br /><br />I recently watched this movie at the Sunscreen Film Festival . It played twice over the course of the festival . This movie is an amazing story about the human spirit , and the spirit of Weem 's friends . I do not say this often about movies , but after watching this movie , I feel moved to do something towards the cause . Every festival this movie has taken part in , this movie has won an award of some kind . It is in the Tribeca Film Festival , and it is going to London and Athens , Greece . I would not be surprised if this movie went all the way to the Academy Awards . It is snowballing out of control . If anyone has a chance to see this movie , wherever it is playing , go ! Take as many people as possible , and go ! It is heading to New Orleans for a film festival , then on to Atlanta and Palm Beach , FL . Darius is from Georgia , so I expect the tickets for the Atlanta showing will be sold out quickly , if they are not already . Please , go see this movie ! DGW ( talk about it)<br /><br />-Kish
1 This movie is a touching story about an adventure taken by 15-year - old Darius Weems . Darius has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy , a still un - curable disease that took the life of his brother at age nineteen and is the number one killer of babies in the United States . Him and a few close friends travel across the country to Los Angeles with the goal of getting his wheelchair customized on MTV 's , Pimp My Ride , one of his favorite shows . The journey begins in Georgia , where Darius grew up and has never left . The gang head west for a trip that all its participants will never forget . Darius gets to ride in a boat for the first time , ride in a hot air balloon , swim in the ocean and visit sights he 's always wanted to see like the Grand Canyon and New Orleans . The filmmakers here clearly have an emotional connection to the material . They make no money from sales of the $ 20 dvds . $ 17 goes toward researching the disease and $ 3 goes toward making more copies . The film has won over 25 awards at festivals and I agree with the quote given to the film by Variety , " Certain to stir hearts " .
1 This is my first CG animated film that I 've ever seen . Usually , the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them . Not Ice Age . I wanted to see it the moment I saw the trailer with Scrat , the hilarious sabertooth squirrel.<br /><br />Ice Age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch . The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby , set 20,000 years in the past . The visuals were great . Simply beautiful . It 's one thing to create convincing aninmation , it 's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and Ice Age is great to look at with its stylized visuals . Blue Sky Studios is a company to look out for in the future .
1 I ca n't stand it when people go see a movie when they know they wo n't like it . My mom likes violent movies , so why did she see it ? She rated it just to bring down the rating . So I know that 's why it did n't have a higher rating . I give it a 6/10
1 The movie itself was ok for the kids . But I got ta tell ya that Scratch , the little squirrel , was the funniest character I 've ever seen . He makes the movie all by himself . He 's the reason I 've just love this movie . Congradulations to the crew , it made me laugh out loud and always will !
1 No day passes without a new released computer animated movie , so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects . After watching Ice Age I felt that 's it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre.<br /><br />But it 's because I am a Big Guy now , and I am pretty sure that this is a very enjoyable movie for children ( maybe up to 14 ) . The story is quite simple , and the " actors " are funny in a cute way , without any crude or complex humour . Even the " evil " is lovely , fluffy big cat with those funny teeth . And the story has a happy end , which was a small disappointment for me ( knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way ) but a great thing for children . And apart from some fights nobody dies ( not even when he gets stomped on by a mammoth , several times ) , which made a cartoony feeling.<br /><br />The computer animation part is nice but nothing special , apart from some really nice cartoony feeling scenes , when you feel like walking in a nice painting or pages of a comics . [ Which means lots of work nevertheless!]<br /><br />There were some gags which made me smile - I accept , the creators tried to satisfy those grownups - but they are hard to spot and ( in my opinion ) better left unnoticed , since it does not feel to fit into the story.<br /><br />Overall it 's a nice movie , but it 's rather in the ideal - world - and - fluffy - animals - for - children disney cliche . If you do n't hate cute animals making funny things , watch it at least once .
1 Shrek , anyone ? Well , imagine Shrek in the ice age . Remember the ending of Shrek ? Of cause you do . Now , imagine , that Shrek turns into a human , and so does the princess . Get it ? Nice animation , actually , much more of an art work than Pixar and Disney pictures , which are trying to get as close to reality as possible in their drawings . Strong one - liners , some social comments that kids wo n't understand , the good guys win . One thing more : Scrat . By the way , how does everybody know his name is Scrat ? 7/10
1 An interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger , a sloth , and a mammoth , who saved a baby , who was close to be killed by a group of tigers during the ice age . The morale of the film shows that good behavior with the others may bring benefits at the end . One of the tigers in the group got an order to finally capture the baby , who was hardly saved by his mother when the tigers attacked her community . The baby was then rescued by the sloth and the mammoth , but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby . They went through very troublesome paths with plenty of danger , and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the mammoth . At the end the group of tigers tried to capture the baby but the mammoth helped incredibly by his tiger colleague was able to overcome this attack and to give the baby back to his father and the community to which he belongs .
1 When I saw the trailers I just HAD to see the film . And when I had , I kinda had a feeling that felt like unsatisfied . It was a great movie , do n't get me wrong , but I think the great parts where already in the trailers , if you catch my drift . It went very fast and it rolled on , so I was never bored , and I enjoyed watching it . The humor was absolutely great . My first contact with a sloth ( .. or something like it ) .
1 I looked at this movie with my child eyes , and I was n't disappointed . The story is well - known , some abandoned orphan has to be brought to his parents by an improbable trio ( mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal ) ... And I do n't want to forget to mention the incredible small fury animal with his hazenut . This one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture.<br /><br />Briefly : it works , it is funny and it is a " must - see " with your children ( they 'll like it ) .
1 Had fun watching this film .. despite the feeling I got a lot of the time , that this film was almost copying Monsters Inc. There 're quite a few things that are extremely similar between the two , the relationship between an animal / monster and a small child , other animals trying to break that relationship , etc . It felt like that pretty much throughout the film , to me.<br /><br />One of the redeeming features though , is Scrat :) Very very funny character , even if he serves no purpose :)
1 Ok , at the beginning it looked like " Shrek " - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief . Then it evolves into something really compelling , as the gauntlet is set . And the result is an enjoyable movie , which has moments that I agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch ( Manny 's past , for example ) . The premise has been obviously worked for a long time , so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets ( only ice caps and rocks ) , and three characters . It 's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it . As I said , it can be tear - jerking at some times , so , kids , be warned . The real letdown is the animation . This was n't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek , and it shows . The humans are unrealistic , and we have seen better examples of CGI before . But do n't let this stain the record : as a solo effort , " Ice Age " is commendable . And it will gather many fans , I have no doubt . Oh and yes , the moments with that small mouse are priceless , and show - stealing .
1 I am not going to lie , this is a great movie . I saw it about 4 months ago at my local theatre . I saw it a second time , and I was somewhat bored in the slow scenes . Sid ( the sloth ) is not all that flattering , but Diego ( a mountain lion , I think ) is really good in the movie . The animation is outstanding , and the story has a touching ending . It is worth taking kids 10 and under to , but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring . Also , the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting . Like I said , it is a pretty good movie , but I would rate " Toy Story 2 " or " Shrek " higher . 8/10
1 There are very few movies that are so funny as this one . I was lucky enough to watch this movie at a theater " reserved " for movie buffs like me , so it was not so embarrassing sitting there laughing till my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves were all wet from drying my eyes ... <br /><br />At times the story was a bit " slow " , but that is perhaps for the best - a bit of rest in - between the rolling amongst the aisles ( I nearly fell out of the seat ... ) was most welcome .
1 * May contain spoilers * * May contain spoilers*<br /><br />In the age of Shrek(the movie ) & Pixar(the studio ) , this is a much more traditional animation film . It put together some characters that normally would n't be seen together(not to mentioned , try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father ) . They begin as enemies and end as best friend . If this sound like a Disney film , it is(only made through 20th Century Fox ) . The trailer to the movie was one of the best I 've seen in ages , but the movie does n't live to the expectation the trailer set . The problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film did n't made up their mind who is the target audience of the film . Yes , there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but the film is mostly aimed at children . The parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min . their children 's attention is focused on something else than them . The backgrounds are excellent and the voice are good but this is nothing more the a nice film . Children will love this film , adults will only like it .
1 A glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never - ending wet - slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes 2001 : A Space Odyssey . Miles apart in vision , but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless . A magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel - like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn . You 've probably seen this scene in the trailer , but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and , results , an avalanche . The horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible . < br /><br />The movie traces two characters , a mammoth named Manfred ( Ray Romano ) and a buck - toothed sloth ( John Leguizamo ) as they try to migrate south . They find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them . They are joined by a saber tiger named Diego ( Denis Leary ) whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan , by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap . Diego 's meat - eating family wants the mammoth most of all , but Diego 's learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end . < br /><br />There are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip , including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in Shrek . Characters contemplate on why they 're in the Ice Age , while they could have called it The Big Chill or the Nippy Era . Some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming . Another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends : ` All the great guys are never around . The sensitive ones get eaten . ' Throwaway lines galore , whimsical comedy and light - fingered adventure makes this one pretty easy to watch . Also , food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that they consider dandelions and pine cones as ` good eating . ' < br /><br />The vocal talents of Romano , Leguizamo and Leary make good on their personas , while the children will delight in their antics , the adults will fancy their riffs on their own talents . There is some mild violence and intense content , but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age - old battle of good versus evil , and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties . The animators also make majestic use of background landscapes that are coolly fantastic.<br /><br / >
1 I love cartoons . They can show things that films with ' real ' actors and scenery can not - though computer effects are changing that more and more . They can push the boundaries of satire ( ' The Simpsons ' ) , good taste ( ' South Park ' ) , spectacle ( ' Aladdin ' ) , or reality ( ' Toy Story ' ) . There are some good examples of this in ' Ice Age ' , such as when we see a motley herd of now - extinct mammals migrating across countryside , chatting like old friends . Such scenes are a pleasure to watch , as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time , usually in a way that makes us laugh . While Ice Age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time , it 's a really fun film . Sit back , enjoy the deliberate anachronisms , the lovely backgrounds and the belly - laughs.<br /><br />The story follows Manfred the grumpy mammoth , Sid , an idiotic sloth , and Diego , a sabretooth tiger , as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons . On the way , naturally , they have a whole lot of problems . Also popping up throughout the journey is Scrat , history 's unluckiest rodent , who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter : in glaciers , on top of dead trees , in ice - caves . His opening scene is a classic.<br /><br />It 's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character - building moments thrown in , but some of the scenes , such as the nappy - changing or the dodos , are hilarious , the animals are likeable and it looks good . There is one quite touching moment too , when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred 's eyes.<br /><br />Not a must - see , but good for a fun hour or so.<br /><br />7/10
1 Born Again the Limerick : < br /><br />If a man could come back from the dead < br /><br />And live in a little girl 's head < br /><br />Revenge he would get < br /><br />For the murder he met < br /><br />By the guy that 's now in his wife 's bed.<br /><br />For me Born Again is a highly under - rated , classic episode that makes up a part of what defined The X - Files for me before I started watching it . I saw a few segments before when the show first came on and I was much too young to watch it such as parts of The Jersey Devil , but I very specifically remember watching this episode as an 11 year old and being absolutely creeped out by the scene where they guy gets choked to death by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the little girl . I tell you I could n't sleep for weeks ! For this reason the episode has a special aura about it now of the creepiness factor that I have since grown to enjoy . Its enough to let me look past some of the obvious flaws in the plot such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really began to exact his revenge . Or what she was doing just randomly sitting on a bus in the middle of the night . You 'd think her parents would have been worried . And maybe they were we just do n't really see that part of the story . And was was with the telekinesis ? Other than adding the really cool Carrie factor to the already creepy story , there really was n't any kind of good explanation for it . But even with its little flaws , in my mind this is a classic episode and has little to no reason for me to not like it . 10 out of 10 .
1 Hmmm , yeah this episode is extremely underrated.<br /><br />Even though there is a LOT of bad writing and acting at parts . I think the good over wins the bad . < br /><br />I love the origami parts and the big ' twist ' at the end . I absolutely love that scene when Michelle confronts Tony . It 's actually one of my favorite scenes of Season 1 . < br /><br />For some reason , people have always hated the Reincarnation episodes , yet I have always liked them . They 're not the best , in terms of writing . but the theme really does interest me,<br /><br />I'm gon na give it a THREE star , but if the writing were a little more consistent i 'd give it FOUR .
1 Born Again is a okay episode of Season 1 . The reincarnation bit , in my opinion , is cool . The more I watch it , the more I like it , yet it will never rise above ' Very Good ' for me . Even though it is not very memorable , i 'll always remember it as the reincarnation episode . Anyway , now I will say what is good and bad about this episode,<br /><br />The Good : Oragami . Oh Yeah!<br /><br />That Fish tank was nice . = ] < br /><br />Thrown out of a window . Very classy . x]<br /><br />The Bad : Marry your Best Friend 's wife ! ? O_O < br /><br />What a random pick to reincarnate.<br /><br />Why did n't the guy who died by having his scarf tangled up , try to take his scarf off instead?<br /><br />Conclusion : Okay episode , not very memorable . 7/10
1 Zombi 3 has an interesting history in it 's making . Firstly , it is a sequel to Fulci 's hit Zombi 2 , with Zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to George A. Romero 's Dawn of the Dead aka Zombi . Confusing enough ? Basically , none of the films have anything to do with one another , but who cares when they make money . I guess Fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through Zombi 3 when he decided to walk out . Bruno Mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time.<br /><br />Zombi 3 's plot is your typical zombie fare . Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines , terrorists steal it unleashing a plague , and zombie run amok . The scientists want to create an antidote , while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice . There are also brief inserts of a Radio DJ preaching about how we treat the planet . < br /><br />Overall , I actually liked this film . I heard horrible things , but I find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable . The film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution , corrupted military , Man playing God , etc . I get the feeling this was at one point a serious film , but it veered off in a weird direction , presumably when Mattei came on board.<br /><br />Besides ripping off other zombie flicks , this was very reminiscent of Romero 's The Crazies . You hear the Radio DJ breaking the good news with , " When you see the men in white suits & gas masks , Run to them for Help . " This is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies . Later , they straight up steal a scene from Crazies in which one of the regular , uncontaminated people is killed by mistake.<br /><br />The gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner . How is it cool ? Let me count the ways  1 . Zombie Birth 2 . Flying Zombie Head 3 . Zombie Birds . 4 . Zombie with no legs swimming in a pool . My favorite zombie was the machete - wielding maniac at the gas station . He was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl.<br /><br />Favorite Quote  When a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie , the scientists asks , " Do n't you think that once the ash is in the air , it will fall to the ground , and contaminate everything ? " To which the Sargeant boldly replies , " Now you 're talking science fiction . " He also continues to mention the " Science Fiction " told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies.<br /><br />Extras : Gallery , Trailers , and Interviews , most notably the one with Mattei where he insists he directed 40 % of the scenes , yet can not recall which ones or any other significant details.<br /><br />Bottom Line : A must see for zombie and Fulci fans.<br /><br />Rating : 7/10<br /><br />Molly Celaschi www . HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com / HorrorYearbook
1 Although it 's not as creepy as it 's cult classic predecessor ( ZOMBI 2 ) I actually like this one better . This is because of it 's faster pace , better settings , and cool 80 's soundtrack . It 's loaded with action and has sweet gore effects by Lucio Fulci . The zombies do n't quite look as nasty as in ZOMBI 2 but they still look good . It was made pretty well but it definitely has it 's share of cheesiness ; for instance some zombies move really slow while others are as quick as ninjas . some are braindead while others say funny lines , but who expects consistency when it comes to Italian horror ? There 's even a flying zombie head ! How rad is that ? Definitely a must see for gorehounds and zombie fans . it 'd probably satisfy most fans of action movies as well . Also check out Zombi 4 .
1 Off the blocks let me just say that I am a huge zombie fan so I do n't make statements like the above lightly . Secondly let me say that this is an Italian zombie film and Fulci only directed 15 minutes of it before handing over to Bruno ( Rats , Night Of Terror ) Mattei . This is no Dawn of the Dead folks.<br /><br />That said this is easily one of the most entertaining zombie films I have ever seen . < br /><br />The script is wonderfully horrible . Just check out the two scientists trying to find an antidote ( " Let 's try putting these two molecules together " ) . < br /><br />The zombies come in all varieties . From moaning shufflers , to machete wielding maniacs , to birds ! < br /><br />The gore is plentiful . Legs are bitten off , arms amputated , stomachs burst open . < br /><br />The pace is fast , flying from one zombie attack to the next . < br /><br />Then there 's the head in the fridge . Oh the head in the fridge ! One of the greatest moments in horror since Ash got his hand possessed in Evil Dead 2.<br /><br />You should know already whether you 're the sort of person who 's going to like this sort of film . Get some mates and some beer and you 'll be in for a fun night.<br /><br />Did I mention the head in the fridge ? ! ? ! ?
1 Yeah sure it 's cheesy , it 's not Zombie , but it 's not that bad either . It has Beatrice Ring which is a huge bonus , and it 's entertaining . I had the good fortune to meet Fulci later in his career and he remained philosophical about the experience , as he was never completely satisfied with it . It is well worth a search out , especially for genre and Fulci fans . It is a film that is far too often dismissed out of hand .
1 A terrorist attempts to steal a top secret biological weapon , and in the process of trying to escape , he is infected when the case containing the deadly agent is compromised . Soldiers are able to retrieve the case , but the terrorist makes his way to a hotel where he attempts to hide out . They eventually make it to where he 's hiding , and " cleanse " the hotel and its occupants . Unfortunately they dispose of his body by cremation , and if you 've seen Return of the Living Dead , you know what happens next.<br /><br />Zombi 3 has been widely panned by critics and zombie fans alike , as a complete mess of a movie . While that 's a fair assessment , it 's not without it 's high points . For one thing , it has plenty of bloody deaths to keep gore - hounds happy . There 's an abundance of zombies that seem to come out from everywhere possible . They 're in the water , the rafters of houses , hiding in trees , and for some reason , they like to hide under a bunch of dead brush , only to spring out to attack as the heroes try to escape . There 's even a flying zombie head that hides inside a refrigerator . You have to see it to believe it , as that scene alone makes Zombi 3 required viewing IMO . It may have some terrible editing and some very questionable acting , especially from the doctor who has to be one of the worst actors I 've seen , but Zombie 3 is still a very entertaining movie . Sometimes it 's nice to sit back and watch a movie that does n't require anything more than your time and an open mind . Zombi 3 fits that bill , and then some . It 's even more enjoyable if you pop open a few beers , and watch it with some like minded friends . I give it an 8/10 , just because of sheer enjoyment .
1 Wow this was a great Italian " ZOMBIE " movie by two great director 's Luci Fulci ( " ZOMBIE " ) and Bruno Mattie ( " HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD " ) Lucio started this movie and was ill so the great Bruno took over and it turned out surprisingly better than I expected it to turn out so if you have seen " HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD " directed by Bruno Mattie and if you saw " ZOMBIE " directed by Lucio Fulci and liked both or one of theme then this is a movie you must watch it has great " ZOMBIE " make - up witch equals great looking " ZOMBIES " has a funny " ZOMBIE " flying head!And " ZOMBIE " birds that spit acid at you and turns you into a " ZOMBIE " ( That Only Happed To Two People ) but they are mainly just the great toxic " ZOMBIES " like in Bruno Matties " HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD".So if you like Italian " ZOMBIE " movies or just " ZOMBIE " movie 's in general than check this one out its a great Italian " ZOMBIE " movie !
1 We have high expectations with this one . . . because its Zombi 3 the official sequel to Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci . . . however . . . its co - directed by Bruno Mattei ( from Night of the Zombies ) and not written by Dardino Sachetti but by Claudio Fagrasso ( Night of the Zombies ) and its shot in the Phillimines like Night of the Zombies and resembles Night of the Zombies ( Hell of the Living Dead ) a lot . as a result its more like a companion to Hell of the Living Dead than Zombi 2 . Fabrazio DeAngelis who produced Zombi 2 and its editor Tomassi ( ? ) and efx gianetto De Rossi gave Zombi 2 its magic . . . Zombi 3 is not magical . . . its like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the peanut - butter . But over the years , I 've grown to accept Zombi 3 . I could swear I saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room . . . there was a senseless Fulci - cut and the Mattei / Fulci - cut is the one on DVD .
1 Nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of Italian zombie - flicks , but  honestly  why would we bother ? Every single film in the Zombi-"series " delivers great fun , nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and " Zombi 3 " is no exception to this , despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting . This film began as an interesting Lucio Fulci project , who had to elaborate further on his " Zombi 2 " success , but it ended up being a typical Bruno Mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films . The screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity , every ingenious idea from George A. Romero 's " Night of the Living Dead " and " The Crazies " is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at . Yet all this did n't upset me for one moment because the sublime over - the - top gore compensates for everything ! On a secret army base at the Phillipines , scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus " Death One " and prepare it for transport . After a failing attempt to steal the virus , the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie - ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village . The last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area . This movie is comparable to Umberto Lenzi 's " Nightmare City " . Truly Bad ... but incredibly entertaining with fast - paced action sequences and several very creative zombie - madness situations . The undead birds were original , for example , and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well . The infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it 's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant Italian zombie flick . Recommended to the fans ; do n't mind the negative reviews .
1 This movie is awesome on so many levels ... and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on.<br /><br />Just remember this : When you 're watching Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies ... be they good or bad ... THIS is the formula that they are using . THIS is what makes zombie movies so great.<br /><br />And what makes it BETTER than great is the story behind the movie . A simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know.<br /><br />All in all , it does n't linger . There 's never a point where you think to yourself " c'mon , get on with it " ... it moves quick and corners nicely . This is the sporty , little Italian number of zombie flicks.<br /><br />So awful , it 's wonderful ! If your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek ... rent it , buy it , love it.<br /><br />As a great trivia note : If you 're watching it on DVD , you 'll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen , underneath the musical score ... Well ... that 's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer ... which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop .
1 I 'll be honest with you ... I liked this movie . It 's a great zombie flick that is packed with action , original ideas , good acting , but is also packed with bad Zombie effects . Part IV , entitled " After Death " is also good . I would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere.<br /><br />10 out of 10<br /><br />Fans of Horror Movies like this should Check out Puppet Master , Skinned Alive , Slumber Party Massacre , Sleep Away Camp , and other Full Moon Pictures flicks . For other recommendations , check out the other comments I have sent in by clicking on my name above this comment section .
1 A nicely done thriller with plenty of sex in it . I saw it on late night TV . There are two hardcore stars in it , Lauen Montgomery and Venus . Thankfully , Gabriella Hall has just a small part .
1 This low - budget erotic thriller that has some good points , but a lot more bad one . The plot revolves around a female lawyer trying to clear her lover who is accused of murdering his wife . Being a soft - core film , that entails her going undercover at a strip club and having sex with possible suspects . As plots go for this type of genre , not to bad . The script is okay , and the story makes enough sense for someone up at 2 AM watching this not to notice too many plot holes . But everything else in the film seems cheap . The lead actors are n't that bad , but pretty much all the supporting ones are unbelievably bad ( one girl seems like she is drunk and/or high ) . The cinematography is badly lit , with everything looking grainy and ugly . The sound is so terrible that you can barely hear what people are saying . The worst thing in this movie is the reason you 're watching it - the sex . The reason people watch these things is for hot sex scenes featuring really hot girls in Red Shoe Diary situations . The sex scenes are n't hot they 're sleazy , shot in that porno style where everything is just a master shot of two people going at it . The woman also look like they are refuges from a porn shoot . I 'm not trying to be rude or mean here , but they all have that breast implants and a burned out / weathered look . Even the title , " Deviant Obsession " , sounds like a Hardcore flick . Not that I do n't have anything against porn - in fact I love it . But I want my soft - core and my hard - core separate . What ever happened to actresses like Shannon Tweed , Jacqueline Lovell , Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson ? Women that could act and who would totally arouse you ? And what happened to B erotic thrillers like Body Chemistry , Nighteyes and even Stripped to Kill . Sure , none of these where masterpieces , but at least they felt like movies . Plus , they were pushing the envelope , going beyond Hollywood 's relatively prude stance on sex , sexual obsessions and perversions . Now they just make hard - core films without the hard - core sex .
1 Great softcore sex , revealing and sexy , and plenty of it . Ignore the ignoramus who does n't realize that raunchy IS sexy if done the right way . If you " erotic , " go watch that Red Shoes Diary junk . If you want hot and exciting softcore done properly , this is the movie to watch . If you like the more explicit Skinemax films , you 'll like this one . Great softcore sex , revealing and sexy , and plenty of it . Ignore the ignoramus who does n't realize that raunchy IS sexy if done the right way . If you " erotic , " go watch that Red Shoes Diary junk . If you want hot and exciting softcore done properly , this is the movie to watch . If you like the more explicit Skinemax films , you 'll like this one .
1 This flick is sterling example of the state of erotic B - movies : bad porn movies without the hardcore sex . The plot in this one is n't so bad as these things go ; it involves a female lawyer trying to prove her lover is innocent of killing his wife . The rest of the movie , however , leaves something to be desired . Bad acting , bad direction , bad looking woman , bad sets , bad cinematography , bad sound and bad sex scenes . The filmmakers should learn the difference between raunchy and erotic . They do n't even have the common sense to have Gabriella Hall naked or in a love scene.<br /><br / > How dumb is that ?
1 I really thought this was n't that bad . Not a great work of art but Dermot M was the stronger performer by far . Patricia Arquette was overacting much of the time . He was actually playing cello which was very impressive , and his lines were never forced . Besides , he is an incredibly Beautiful Man . Really sexy . Add that to the talent , and most anything he 's been in is a lot more tolerable . He always gives his all even if some of the projects he 's been involved in did n't quite hit the highest mark .. Not the fault of the actor in most cases . He 's unfortunately been in some strange films that just did n't resonate at the box office . Always with A - list actors but just not always a " hit " . But he is " worth every penny " of any DVD rented or purchased . See The Wedding Date with Debra Messing - one of his best overall films . WORTH EVERY PENNY ! ; ) ( if you have n't seen it yet , do , then you 'll understand that quote ! )
1 I first saw this movie when I was a freshman in high school , and the film has stuck with me through the years . It 's not about the soundtrack , or cinematography , or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting , it 's about the educational purpose , and the message behind that is the most important . It 's not a sin to have a child when you 're a teenager and still in high school , and it 's not really a bad thing , either , but it is a problem . Tons of girls I knew are all having children now , and I guess they never watched this great movie , and if they did , they clearly did n't get the message behind it all . It 's about not taking chances when you 're in a sexual relationship . Any girl can get pregnant the first time . It 's not a myth . You do n't necessarily lose out on your dreams , but they do have to take a backseat in your future because you have a child to think about first.<br /><br />This movie has a clear message behind it : JUST SAY NO !
1 I saw this film on True Movies ( which automatically made me sceptical ) but actually - it was good . Why ? Not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue ( of which there is little ) but because actually , despite what people say I thought the film was accurate in it 's depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy.<br /><br />It 's NOT Dawson 's Creek , they 're not graceful , cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge . They 're kids and they act like kids would . < br /><br />They're blunt , awkward and annoyingly confused about everything . Yes , this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but I do n't think so . Dermot Mulroney gives ( when not trying to be cool ) a very believable performance and I loved him for it . Patricia Arquette IS whiny and annoying , but she was pregnant and a teenagers ? The combination of the two is n't exactly lavender on your pillow . The plot was VERY predictable and but so what ? I believed them , his stress and inability to cope - her brave , yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together . I think the characters , acted by anyone else , WOULD indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they were n't . It reflects the surreality of the situation they 're in , that he 's sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby . I felt angry at her for that , I felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her . I felt it all.<br /><br />In the end , I loved it and would recommend it.<br /><br />Watch out for the scene where Dermot Mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session - career performance .
1 This is a very good , made for TV film . It depicts trouble in suburbia circa 1970 's and the sort of neighbors one certainly does not want to have around . The worst & most upsetting part of the film was when the punk teenagers killed the family dog . The teens do everything to annoy and harass this poor family . But boy ! , does the lead character take vengeance on those punk teenagers in the end . The father / homeowner surely does not take all of the aggravation from the punk teens lightly and is quick to retaliate after lack of help from the police that is . He stands up to them and protects his home and his family . A very good actor .. I might add.<br /><br />I watched this on TV when I was like 8 or 9 . I have never seen it again on TV and would like to . Definitely a good one ! It 's the sort of movie one may catch on a weekday night very late at night and ca n't stop watching or an afternoon film on a weekend . It 's the kind they just do n't show anymore.<br /><br />It is definitely worth seeing !
1 This is a great movie from the lost age of reactionary made - for - television drama . My all - time favourite actor , Robert Culp skillfully plots a trajectory through uptight liberal fairmindedness and faith in the system , kneejerk conservativism and fear of crime , and homicidal psychosis . The teens are a collection of pure sneering evil stereotypes , and the eventual message of this film makes episodes of Dragnet look evenhanded by comparison . But what really shines in this is the great pace of the movie , building the fear and paranoia by degrees , as well as the feel of the whole California setting . The cars are really great as well , as I recall . I give this film a 10 , and I defy anyone to watch this film and not enjoy every minute . Remember , just because it 's made - for - television does n't mean it is n't great art .
1 Robert Culp ( they call his character " doctor" ... I think he 's a vet or something ) and family move to an affluent , low - tax , zero - law - enforcement suburb . Lantern - jawed Culp and his dog are nearly killed when some local idiot neighbor kids get drunk and " go cruising " through his front yard at 60 mph . He presses charges , which arouses the kids ' ire , and suddenly him and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign.<br /><br />Marilyn Manson , er , Marlyn Mason rather , plays his fretful , boiled - celery wife , who urges him not to use violence against his sneering nemeses , and who really just wants to move somewhere with decent public services . But The System is getting Culp nowhere , and he 's not about to leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music . And we all know what movie people do when The System fails ... (but this is based on a true story , which makes it even better).<br /><br />It should be noted that while the villainous hooligans do have convenient ' 70s funk - o - matic " teenage " theme music that warns us when they 're up to no good , this film actually ends up treating the age brackets even - handedly ( really ! ) . It does n't make a big generational thing out of it . Kudos for that.<br /><br />Anyway , if you like dogs ( or at least believe in protecting their civil rights , like me ) , and you like justice , and you like fire , and you like justice for dogs by way of fire , and you think people who skitter nervously out of troubled communities are " too damn soft , " then this flick 's ethos is up your alley . No , it 's not really " good , " at least not in any widely recognized sense of the word . There 's nothing subtle or understated or clever about it , it 's just sort of a feature - length PSA for vigilantism . It does , however , capture the feeling of some memorable scenes in other , beloved works . Remember in Frank Miller 's The Dark Knight Returns when Batman leads the Mutants on horseback to reclaim Gotham City ? Remember that scene in A Christmas Story where the kid pounds the bully 's face in ? Remember how cool that was ? Or do you just really hate being looked at funny by your neighbors ? Yeah , mon.<br /><br />Unfortunately , this was a 1973 made - for - TV movie that I just happened to catch at 4 am on my local WB affiliate , and it 's probably not destined for DVD release . But after being inspired by this film , do you think I 'm gon na just sit here and take it ! ? !
1 I remember this movie . Quite intense for an 11 year old . Good editing , I felt terrible for the St. Bernard . I 'd watch it again if it were rebroadcast , but the signal is passing Pluto as I write this . Robert Culp . A highlight of his career . I am just glad I did n't live in THAT neighborhood . Oh those 70 's . What a decade . If they remade it I bet it would be very violent and bloody . So what are they waiting for ? An excellent movie for pre - pubescent suburban boys . It was very intense . I think it was filmed in Los Angeles . Certainly not made in Lodi NJ . The shot with the St Bernard was the best and obviously the most haunting image from the film ... and then they left the carcass on the stoop . Rotten kids .
1 Outrage is pretty good movie ! Robert Culp was very good in the movie and was perfect for the part ! Its hard to believe that this is a true story but what can you do ? When I watched this I thought why do they have to do all of those things . It is n't right but they learned their lesson when they picked on the wrong man ! Anyway if you ever see this movie on TV watch it because its a good one !
1 Being the first feature film with Robert De Niro ( although not released for years later ) , this is worth the watch . De Niro 's role is n't huge , yet amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent another friends marriage only to later chase him down to force him into it . Any die hard De Niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by arguably the best actor today .
1 This Peabody Award winning episode is one of the highlights of the 1st Season where a holodeck malfunction traps Captain Picard , Beverly , Data , and a Starfleet historian named Waylan within a 1930 's San Francisco setting . This episode is an homage to Raymond Chandler 's " Maltese Falcon " where Patrick Stewart assumes the Humphrey Bogart role - complete with fedora and trenchcoat . The office itself is almost an exact replica of the one featured in Bogey 's " Maltese Falcon . " < br /><br />This episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious insect race called the Jarada that communicate with mostly a high - pitched buzzing sound . Communication with this alien race is difficult , and it is up to Picard to communicate with this race in their native tongue so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin . The best part of this episode , though , is the appearance of the famous Hollywood B - actor Lawrence Tierney in the role of the gangster Cyrus Redblock . He was such a handsome man back in the 1940 's . Oh , well ...
1 This episode introduced the Holodeck to the TNG world . The Jarada have to be contacted and a precise greeting must be delivered or it would greatly insult them . A tired Picard decides to take a trip into the Holodeck and a wonderful adventure begins . The settings are superb and almost movie like . Alas , the Jarada probe sent shortly thereafter damages the holodeck and all it 's safety devices stop working . Picard and now guests must outwit the mobsters of gangland 40s America and return to the Jarada rendezvous . Picard greets the Jarada correctly and a new day dawns between Humanity and the Jarada . This gem of a first season episode set the holodeck for many interesting and unusual adventures to be had there
1 " The big goodbye " introduces us to the first holodeck adventure , in this case Captain Picard posing as private investigator Dixon Hill . This episodes creates some sort of standard pattern , repeated several times on TNG as well as DS 9 and Voyager . After entering the holodeck something goes wrong and the characters have to deal with the program under different circumstances beyond playing a game ( represented by the failure of the holodeck 's safety program ) . < br /><br />This concept is used to expand Star Trek 's possibility and enabling a kind of genre - mix . Picard 's Dixon Hill stories are examples of 1940s crime fiction and their representation on the screen are referred to as Film Noir often having the stereotype antihero in the lead ( see for example Chandler 's Marlowe stories or Polanski 's all time classic " Chinatown " ) . Star Trek never focuses on the story ( mostly it 's a simple " how - do - we - get - out - of - here " scenario ) but enables the actors to take a different approach to their characters . Those Holodeck " games " are commonly used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members . Therefore the technical aspect is always neglected and from that point of view the stories are never sound ( but did Star Trek ever had a technical , scientific point to it , I mean besides some utopic concepts?).<br /><br />"The big goodbye " shows a relaxed Patrick Stewart , a McFadden that hardly ever looked better in a Star Trek episode ( at least the early ones ) and Data has some great scenes , too ( although I find it hard to believe that pulling the lamp 's plug out of the wall would have really surprised him , for the fact that he 'd done research on that period and its customs ) . Wesley continues turning peaceful Trekkies into potential murderers ( why did n't they take him to the holodeck and let the gangsters finish him off ? ) but all in all this one 's fun ...
1 According to the book The Last of the Cowboy Heroes which is about Joel McCrea , Audie Murphy , and Randolph Scott , the author says that Albuquerque was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost . Had n't been seen in years.<br /><br />Good thing for western fans somebody was doing some spring cleaning at Paramount because a print was apparently found and now it 's out on the open market . Albuquerque is a pretty good western too with Scott involved in a family feud with Uncle George Cleveland.<br /><br />George Cleveland sends for his nephew Randolph Scott with the intention of making him part of his freighting business , headquartered in the fast growing settlement of Albuquerque . Cleveland is more than just a business owner , he 's the town boss which he runs from a wheelchair . He even has the sheriff in his pocket . < br /><br />Randolph Scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing . That includes not backing relatives up when they 're villains . He goes to work for a rival outfit headed by brother and sister Russell Hayden and Catherine Craig.<br /><br />Cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks and he even sends for a western Mata Hari in the person of Barbara Britton to worm her way into the confidence of his rivals . Barbara 's great as the homespun vixen who develops her own agenda.<br /><br />Randolph Scott 's original home studio was Paramount , it was where his first studio contract was with . Albuquerque marked the last film he ever did for Paramount and they gave him a good one.<br /><br />Note also Lon Chaney , Jr. , who is George Cleveland 's chief henchman , a rather loathsome bully of a man and Gabby Hayes , who is just Gabby Hayes.<br /><br />Albuquerque must have been loved by Republicans across the nation in 1948 with its chief villain as a town boss who rules from a wheelchair . A certain Democrat from a wheelchair had made hash of them for four straight presidential elections and he was gone . They had high hopes of winning the White House that year too , but things went awry and they had to settle for an ersatz boss getting his comeuppance in Albuquerque . I 'm not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot . My guess is he was injured and played the part that way because he had to.<br /><br />Still Albuquerque must have had great appeal to the GOP market .
1 Albuquerque is a film that has all the elements of a class A western , except one : the story , that really belongs to a class B or C. That was acceptable at the time the film was made , when people were so thrilled to see a western in color , but nowadays it just looks very primitive . Nonetheless for people who enjoy old westerns , it is entertaining , the original color and sound are very well kept on the DVD that recently came out . Gabby Hayes is a good sidekick , Lon Chaney is mean as always , and Randolph Scott a bit more cheerful than usual . In a film named Albuquerque you would expect to see something that would remind you of the city , but the town that is shown here could be just anywhere .
1 Randolph Scott is heading into Albuquerque to take a job with his uncle . However , on the way there , the stage is held up -- even though they are not carrying a strongbox . However , a nice lady on board is concealing $ 10,000 for her and her brother 's business ... and the robbers seem to know this.<br /><br />Once in town , Scott goes to this uncle about the job . However , he soon learns that this uncle is a jerk -- the typical bad guy from Westerns . You know , the rich guy who only wants to become richer by cheating and stealing and threatening until he owns everything . And , it just so happens that this jerk was behind the robbery . Scott demands that the uncle returns the money and then Scott goes into business with the nice lady and her brother.<br /><br />Not surprisingly , this is NOT the end of the problems --- just the beginning . Again and again , intrigues of various types occur to try to crush the uncle 's opposition . One trick is to bring in a pretty lady to befriend Scott and his partners . She 's a crack shot and it looks bad for Scott -- until he figures out why she 's come to town.<br /><br />Unlike most later Randolph Scott films , this one shows Scott as a bit more headstrong man . All too often in his films he 's the last one to suggest violence , but in this film he 's quick to suggest a lynching ( screw the law , let 's have a hangin ' ) and later he 's quick to threaten the uncle . What a surprise to see him as such a hot - head -- though in most other ways , he 's the same old Scott you 'd expect.<br /><br />As far as the film goes , there 's nothing particularly unusual about it . Gabby Hayes plays the usual character , Scott is a hero , the baddie can not be reasoned with and ultimately is destroyed and Scott gets the girl . Despite this very typical plot , it 's all handled very well and as a result is well worth your time.<br /><br />By the way , there are two weird scenes in the film . First , late in the movie , there is a fist fight between Scott and the uncle 's # 1 henchman , Lon Chaney , Jr .. In it , Chaney smokes as he fights -- something I never saw before and I did admire how he could puff away as he got his butt kicked . Second , get a load of that runaway cart scene with the whip -- now THAT was one impossible feat !
1 It begins with several of the principles on a stage run to Albuquerque . Gabby Hayes(Juke , sounds like Duke ) is the driver and begins his usual tirade against women in general , with his girlfriend Pearl being an exception . He then relates a garbled version of the biblical story of Samson to justify his retention of long whiskers against the wishes of Pearl , who is the town barber , no less , and who claims if everyone followed his example , she would be out of business . This point will return to dominate the last scene in the film . Gabby seems an irritation to some reviewers , but is a definite plus to this one . It 's too bad he was n't in more of the better Randoph Scott westerns to help lighten up Randy 's usual iron - jawed demeanor . Also on this stage are Randy(Cole Armin ) , his future wife(Cathrine Craig , as Celia Wallace ) , whom he is getting acquainted with , and a little girl(Myrtle ) , to whom he soon becomes a hero when he rescues her from the runaway stage after it is held up by henchman of Randy 's wheelchair - bound uncle John Armin(George Cleveland ) , who essentially runs the town.<br /><br />Randy soon learns that his uncle , and by extension , himself , is not exactly popular among the town folk . He does , however , quickly form a useful friendship with Gabby . After he learns that uncle John was responsible for the stage holdup of his business competitor , Celia Wallace , and the associated murder , he demands that uncle John return the money and decides to work for Celia and her brother Ted(Russell Hayden ) , instead of for uncle John . < br /><br />As his rival 's prospects rise , uncle John decides to plant an informant(Barbara Britton , as Letty Tyler ) in the Wallace office , to keep him informed as to when they are delivering ore from the mines to town so that he can sabotage their run . When this does n't work , he resorts to the draconian tactic of staging an arson of his own office , for which Randy is blamed . Unfortunately , when the fire was discovered , Randy was in Letty 's apartment confronting her with suggestive evidence that she was tipping off uncle John . Myrtle and Letty testify that he was in the apartment when the fire was discovered . This puts him and Letty in the dog house with Celia(his apparent beau ) and Ted(who hopes to woo Letty ) . This news also ends Uncle John 's trust in Letty as an informant , and he suggests she leave town . Instead , she switches sides and tells the Wallaces why Randy was in her apartment . Uncle John tries once again to sabotage their ore run , and when that fails , there is a general shootout in town . You can guess the results.<br /><br />The plot is well constructed and executed , with complicated relationships between the principles , and with a variety of obstacles for Randy to overcome , with the sometimes aid of his associates . At least , Randy was spared the necessity of bringing his uncle to justice . Uncle John had a choice to avoid assassination , but arrogantly trusted that a woman would n't have the guts to carry out her threat . The presence of Hayes and two beautiful wholesome single women , as well as little Myrtle , much helped to lighten the otherwise tense atmosphere in this battle for survival , as uncle John put it.<br /><br />It seems odd that Barbara Britton , the " bad " girl , gets top female billing over Catherine Craig , Randy 's love interest . Barbara 's on camera time was much more limited . < br /><br />Those who grew up on the Lassie TV series featuring George Cleveland as " Gramps " will be surprised to find him playing such a mean controlling villain . We may wonder if his wheelchair - bound status has a bearing on this persona . This leaves him with few options for making a living in the wild West . Without apparent family to help support him(except Randy ) , he ca n't afford to have some upstart beat him out of the most profitable business in town . On the other hand , from his conversations , he probably achieved his status as the town " boss " before becoming wheelchair - bound .
1 I remember this series so well . It was excellent - such strong and compelling characters , stylish and sexy ... and so different to everything else on offer at the time - and now ... I am sure that it inspired the also excellent Canadian drama " Traders " . < br /><br />Both season 1 and season 2 are available on DVD region 2 in the UK . Its a treat to watch the series again.<br /><br />Season 1 is 13 episodes and season 2 seems to be 10 episodes.<br /><br />Unfortunately , it seems to have ended after 2 seasons.<br /><br />This series was a lot of fun.<br /><br />Sometimes you can get it on special at Amazon.co.uk
1 I agree that Capital City should be on DVD . I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot . It was nice to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry for a change . I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in . I ca n't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes . I liked William Armstrong as Hudson 's flamboyant charming friend in the series . When they aired this show in the New York City area , it was always late at night or at off times . The show is less than an hour long . I felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting . I did n't care for Sylvia but missed the actress , Julia Phillips - Lane in the previous season . I felt this show took chances and often it worked . It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London . The American characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their British counterparts . I also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British . I liked watching Julia Ormond in an early role . I felt this show should have lasted longer . I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour . They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have been a hit in America .
1 ' Capital City ' fans rejoice ! This first season of this series is now available from Network DVD and I 've recently got my copy ! Although very much an ensemble piece of key ' maverick ' trading floor characters ' CAPITAL CITY ' does present us with various moments through both its first and second season when each member of the team plays a significant part in a particular central or peripheral plot line . The cultural mix ( English , Irish , American , German , Polish ) of Head Trader Wendy Foley 's ( played by Joanna Phillips - Lane ) group of staff is balanced with their own distinctive mannerisms , interests and personalities which helps to make the rather unfamiliar and , to most people , seemingly sterile subject of financial trading reasonably engaging through the engaging performances of the cast . In fact this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather staid and old - fashioned senior management of Shane Longman as represented by Lee Wolf ( Richard Le Parmentier ) and James Farrell ( Denys Hawthorne ) . I suspect that such an unconventional way of working as employed by Wendy 's team would not have become a reality had it not been for youthful reclusive ' free spirit ' Peter Longman inheriting his thirty per cent stock in the company from his father and allowed a more trendy , relaxed modern way of business become a reality . To a certain degree Wendy 's ( I am led to believe ) immediate supervisor Leonard Ansen ( John Bowe ) follows the establishment in the traditional manner of running the company however his fondness for Wendy rather sees him occupying the ' middle ground ' on most occasions . The main interest in the series , I believe , stems from the simmering romantic attraction between Douglas Hodge 's Declan and the cool self - assured blonde haired German trader Michelle Hauptmann ( played by Trevyn McDowell ) which had viewers continually wondering if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendship / fondness that they undoubted have.<br /><br />Looking forward to browsing through this title , and hopefully the second season of thirteen wo n't be too far away !
1 " Batman : The Mystery of the Batwoman " is about as entertaining as animated Batman movies get.<br /><br />While still true to the feeling of the comic books , the animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series . Bruce Wayne looks much like he has before , but now he appears somewhat less imposing . The Dick Grayson Robin has been replaced by the less edgy , more youthful Tim Drake Robin.<br /><br />Kevin Conroy , as usual , invokes the voice of Batman better than most live action actors.<br /><br />Kelly Ripa did a much more decent voice - acting job than I was expecting.<br /><br />As in the live action Batman films , the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the villains . My all - time favorite , the Penguin , is here . His design is sleeker than it has appeared before , hearkening more to the Burgess Meredith portrayal of the ' 60 's than the Danny DeVito portrayal of " Batman Returns . " David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the Penguin 's voice . The Penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning sophisticate , just as he most commonly appears in the comics . Hector Elizondo 's voice creates a Bane who 's much more memorable than the forgettable version in " Batman & Robin . " And finally , Batman has a descent mystery to solve , putting the " Detective " back in " Detective Comics " ( that is what " DC " stands for , after all . ) The revolution to the mystery is a delightfully sneaky twist.<br /><br />The score adds to the mysterious ambiance of the movie . It sounds like a mix between the score from " Poirot " and the score from " Mission : Impossible . " All in all , it 's more entertaining than your average cartoon .
1 This Batman movie is n't quite as good as Batman mask of The Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero But it is still a good installment to the Batman cartoons I say it is equally good as Batman Beyond The Movie . This movie is good for all the same reasons The storyline is good not quite as good as the other one 's but still pretty good it has lots of action in it The Cartoon effects are good The voice of actors are really good such as Kevin Conroy as Batman/ Bruce Wayne , Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon , Efrem Zimbalist Jr. , Eli Marienthal as Robin . The villains are good such as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman , David Ogden Stiers as The Pequin , Hector Elizondo as Bane . So I am sure you will not be disappointed with batman Mystery of The Batwomen . So make sure that you rent or buy batman Mystery of The Batwoman the movie because it is really good.<br /><br />Overall score : * * * * * * * out of * * * * * * * * * * < br /><br / > * * * out of * * * * *
1 For starters I have always been a fan of the Batman cartoons because the theme is so universal , ' that everyone alive has an alter - ego ' . This is true in the Mystery of Batwoman . While the overall story is good I 'm disappointed that they have n't really done much for the franchise with this.<br /><br />Throughout the movie , you are trying to find out who the identity of Batwoman is , unfortunately you can find out by easily looking at the cast of credits posted on this website ( so if you have n't seen it already do n't go there ) . I was sort of disappointed that they did n't make the movie longer . 75 minutes is way too short for any movie . The secret identity of batwoman also comes far too early in the movie , sort of midway , and becomes anti - climatic afterward because you know the good guys will always win and that the new character known as Batwoman will disappear after the movie is over.<br /><br />I'm also not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie . I love the sleek new characters but there should be some more detail where detail is called for . Some parts of the animation look so awkward and rigid that it grabs your attention right away diverting your attention away from the storyline . I also did n't really like the bright atmosphere used in most of the scenes , it sort of loses its dark and gothic feel which is Batman . Similarly we should 've gotten to know more about batwoman 's personality so that we can build the same deep compassionate feeling that we do with Bruce Wayne . Also I think the fight with Bane should have been done better . In typical children 's fashion the bad guy meets his demise too easily either by tripping , falling , getting electricuted or doing something dumb that works against them . Come to think of it there was n't even one drop of blood spilled in this movie either.<br /><br />Bottom line , its a good entertaining flick and I recommend anyone who 's a Batman fan to watch it . It has good storyline , universal appeal and even great acting to top it off . I just wish that they could have delivered more permanent change to the story by making Batwoman stay to make things more interesting . Not just introduce her and then kick her off once she 's done . I 'd also like to see someone else figure out the mystery for a change finally . To have some other than Batman solve the mystery and fill him in later with the details.<br /><br />I hope there are more animated movies to come and look forward to the time when we will actually be able to see the breakup between Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordan . He 's been stringing her along forever and does n't even like her and I ca n't believe that she was dumb enough to fall in love with someone 20 years older . I also want to see the time when Tim Drake leaves because he is getting sick of the old man . In short I want to see all of the things that led the characters to where they will be in Batman Beyond . Otherwise the same repeated formula will just end it faster than if they just decided to move on with the story.<br /><br / >
1 The original animated Dark Knight returns in this ace adventure movie that rivals Mask of Phantasm in its coolness . There 's a lot of style and intelligence in Mystery of the Batwoman , so much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin.<br /><br />There 's a new crime - fighter on the streets of Gotham . She dresses like a bat but she 's not a grown - up Batgirl . And Batman is denying any affiliation with her . Meanwhile Bruce Wayne has to deal with the usual romances and detective work . But the Penguin , Bain and the local Mob makes things little more complicated.<br /><br />I did n't have high hopes for this ' un since being strongly let down but the weak Batman : Sub Zero ( Robin is n't featured so much here!)but I was delighted with the imaginative and exciting set pieces , the clever plot and a cheeky sense of humor . This is definitely a movie no fan of Batman should be without . Keep your ears open for a really catchy song called ' Betcha Neva ' which is featured prominently through - out.<br /><br />It 's a shame the DVD is n't so great . Do n't get me wrong there are some great features ( the short ' Chase Me ' is awesome ) and a very cool Dolby 5.1 soundtrack but ... the movie is presented in Pan and Scan . Batman : Mystery of the Batwoman was drawn and shot in 1.85:1 but this DVD is presented in 1.33:1 an in comparison to the widescreen clips shown on the features there IS picture cut off on both sides . I find this extremely annoying considering Mask of Phantasm was presented in anamorphic widescreen . Warner have had to re - release literally dozens of movies on DVD because people have complained about the lack of Original Aspect Ratio available on some titles . Why they chose to make that same mistake here again is beyond me.<br /><br />I would give this DVD 5/5 but the lack of OAR brings the overall score down to 4/5 . It 's a shame because widescreen would have completed a great DVD package .
1 THIS POST MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS : < br /><br />Although it was 5 years after the series ended and WB was currently working on Justice League , this animated movie is a welcome addition to the video library . Why ? Well , if Mask of the Phantasm compliments the first 70 episodes of Batman : The Animated Series and SubZero compliments the 15 episodes of the Adventures of Batman and Robin , then Mystery of the Batwoman compliments the final 24 episodes of the Gotham Knights version of Batman . Kevin Conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection . I admit I was a bit leery when I heard about Batwoman and all I could think about were the old 50 's comics of Batman . But I was blown away by the Batwoman character , her look , her costume ( which I assumed inspired Bruce Wayne to create the costume on Batman Beyond)and the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who Batwoman is all the way through . If you want to know who Batwoman is , then buy or rent the DVD . Barbara Gordon makes a cameo appearance and I think the writers were trying to hint that Bruce and Barbara had something going on between them like they did in Batman Beyond . Tim Drake appears as Robin , but his role is a small one and sadly , there is no sign of or mention of Dick Grayson alias Nightwing , which leads me to believe he has established himself in Bludhaven ( his city in the comics).<br /><br />Of the three suspects for Batwoman , my favorite is Kathy Duquesne , who looks an awful lot like Halle Berry . Kelly Ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects . When it comes to the villains , I 'm glad the Penguin was one of them , but I did not like the fact that they replaced Paul Williams with David Ogden Stiers . Pengy just did n't sound right . Same thing goes for Robin . The new guy did okay , but just as I was starting to get used to Matt Valencia , they replaced him . It 's interesting to note that Kevin Michael Richardson , who voices Carlton Duquesne is now the voice of the Joker in " The Batman " series . And we finally see what Rupert Thorne looks like revamped since he did n't show up in the Gotham Knights episodes . The late John Vernon will be missed . Although I enjoyed Henry Silva as the voice of Bane , if he had to be replaced , they got the right man in the form of Hector Elizondo . I only wish they could have used Two Face , Riddler , or the scary new version of the Scarecrow.<br /><br />The musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb . I wish that was on a soundtrack and I especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented Cherie in the Iceberg Lounge along with her song , Betcha Neva . While some feel that this movie is weaker than the Mask of the Phantasm and Subzero , I find it just as strong and enjoyable as the rest , plus like I said earlier , it 's a full length movie based off the Gotham Knights version of Batman , which I think gives a good balance . I would at least recommend renting this DVD first before buying it for those who might be leery of this movie , but personally , it 's well worth the purchase . I give Mystery of the Batwoman a 9 .
1 An enjoyable Batman animated film . Not on par with " Return of the Joker " or " Mask of the Phantasm " , but solid nonetheless . I liked how the movie kept you guessing as to who Batwoman was . There was nice twist . Nice action sequences . I 've always been of the opinion that the Batman cartoons are better then any of the pitiful Batman live action film sequels . The trend continues here.<br /><br />7.5 out of 10
1 It aired on TV yesterday , so I decided to check it out . This was one of the last Bruce Timm / Paul Dini DTV projects related to their old 1992 Batman the Animated Series , after that Jeff Matsuda came along and re - imagined Batman with his new The Batman series , but anyway , the story of this new Batman movie centers around the appearance of a new vigilante known as Batwoman , however Batman feels the need to stop her because of her extreme methods , and also in the meantime take down The Pengiun and Ruphert Thorn who both are secretly working with Carlton Duquesne(who 's having family troubles ) and another villain(which is later revealed in the movie ) on a weapons smuggling operation , they also put a bounty on the Batwoman . The question is : who is this mysterious Batwoman and is it possible that they could be more then one ? It 's up to Batman to solve this mystery and stop Penguin 's latest operation . For an animated movie , it has a fairly complex plot and a serious tone , which is good . Another plus was the complete redesign of the Penguin who looks much more like the sophisticated Mob Boss we 're used to seeing in the comics , unlike his previous designs that borrowed elements from Tim Burton vision of Pengium(sewer rat and circus freak ) . Even though the movie contains a love subplot it 's never carried that far and does n't derail the movie like say , Batman Forever . The voice acting is standard quality for these direct - to - video projects(if only Batman : Mask of Phantasm took this route ) , Kevin Conroy still shines as Batman / Bruce Wayne . And like I said despite running for some very short 80 minutes , it manages to make a pretty good(and complex ) storyline complete with a few minor twists and bucket loads of action . There are a few downsides , however , Nightwing is nowhere to be seen , and I 'm sure Barbara Gordon and Bruce Wayne do n't click as a couple , even though is just referenced , Tim Drake(aka Robin ) does very little in the movie and to be quite frank , I was never a big fan of Paul Dini and Bruce Timm 's Batman character design(especially in their Batman shows post - BTAS ) , this The New Adventures of Batman and Robin , well , it kinda makes Batman look fat then rather a well - built bulked up individual(kinda like the Jeff Matsuda character model from The Batman ) . Bruce Wayne seems a bit awkward , those blue eyes make him look more like Clark Kent then Bruce(though it 's true they do look very much alike ) . Another downside is Rupert Throne(no explanation as to why he is in this deal , but it 's safe to say he 's has goons and what 's a cut of the deal ) which does very little more then hang out with the Penguim or get himself hurt every time he points a gun at someone(count how many times this happens in the movie and you 'll be surprised . Overall , a good Batman animated movie , worth at least a rental .
1 Batman : Mystery of the Batwoman is the latest animated Batman straight to video / DVD movie to be released . ( Minor Spoilers Ahead ) The plot revolves around a new crimefighter , the Batwoman , who seems to be personally involved , for whatever reason , in stopping a major arms shipment.<br /><br />Although the movie is interesting enough , it 's not as good as ' Mask of the Phantasm , ' ' Sub - Zero , ' or ' Return of the Joker . ' The main reason being is that it does n't give off the emotional appeal the other movies did . At the end of this movie , we do n't really feel sorry for anyone as we did in the others , especially , ' Sub - Zero . ' There is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us . Even the Batwoman is not really a ' tragic ' character ( as Mr. Freeze or Phantasm were ) . Not only that , but Batwoman 's alter ego seems so incredibly ' stiff ' and dull that the viewer does n't really care what happened to her that caused her to put on the mask or what happens to her at the end and therein lies the main reason we do n't get this special emotional appeal.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong , I did find the movie enjoyable . It does have its moments , such as , when the audience finds out who Batwoman really is and seeing an old villain return who was last seen in the original ' Batman : The Animated Series . ' The action is also very enjoyable with some very suspenseful moments.<br /><br />If the Batwoman 's background was more interesting , this movie would have been better than ' Return of the Joker ' in my book , but as it is now , it 's in 4th ( out of 4).<br /><br />As for the animation , it 's the same as The New Batman Adventures ' cartoon from the mid to late 1990 's . The score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated Batman films , but it 's still good nonetheless.<br /><br />I do recommend buying this DVD because , despite its flaws , it is enjoyable . But just remember , it 's not as good as the other Batman animated movies.<br /><br />7/10
1 In 1993 , with the success of the first season of Batman : The Animated Series , Warner Brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit - show with producing a feature - length movie , originally slated for Direct - To - Video , but bumped up to theatrical status . It would become known as Batman : Mask of the Phantasm . Ten years after Phantasm , we have had an additional three feature - films released from the boys at the WB , Sub - Zero , Return of the Joker , and now , Mystery of the Batwoman joins the family.<br /><br />The plot is basic and in many ways similar to Mask of the Phantasm : A new female vigilante modeling herself after Batman has begun targeting operations run by Gotham mob boss Rupert Thorne and Oswald Cobblepot AKA The Penguin . Now , Batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the Batwoman before she crosses the line.<br /><br />The animation is the sleeker , futuristic style that was utilized for Batman : The Animated Series ' fifth and sixth seasons ( AKA The New Batman Adventures ) . , it 's quite nicely done , and just as sleek as Return of the Joker 's animation . There is also some use of CGI , but it 's minor compared to the overabundance of it in Sub - Zero . The music was alright . Different and exotic and similar to the Justice League score , although the points in the score when the old animated Batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans ' rodent - shaped hearts.<br /><br />Kevin Conroy , as always , does a wonderful job as Bruce Wayne and Batman . It 's also great to have the old Batman : The Animated Series alumni back ; that includes Bob Hastings ( Commissioner Gordon ) , Robert Costanzo ( Detective Bullock ) , Tara Strong ( Barbara Gordon / Batgirl ; her cameo hints at the romantic - relationship between her and Bruce that was mentioned in Batman Beyond ) , and Efrem Zimbalist Jr.(Alfred).<br /><br />Villains were also great - especially given that Rupert Thorne , the old mob boss from the original series , appears for the first time since the fourth season.<br /><br />Overall , while not quite reaching the standard set by Mask of the Phantasm ten years ago , MOTB carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated Batman films . And if you have the DVD and are a hardcore fan , you will love the five - minute short Chase Me .
1 I always said that the animated Batman movies were much better than the live action films.<br /><br />I've seen all of the animated films , but out of the bunch , this is the poorest , and it 's rather disappointing.<br /><br />"Mask of the Phantasm " would rank as the best , then " World 's Finest " , then " Sub Zero " , then " Return of the Joker " , and finally this ranks last.<br /><br />In this newest animated movie , there 's a mysterious new batgirl in Gotham and Batman is intent on discovering whether she 's friend or foe as she sets out on a quest for vengeance.<br /><br />But as Bruce gets involved with three young women , he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new batgirl.<br /><br />The tone in this film is unusually light considering most of the films are grim and bleak , which was rather disappointing . Bruce acts strangely out of character most of the time , the villains are re - used from the last films , and while the action scenes are exciting , they 're really nothing new . It also lacks the dramatic impact the other films have , especially that of " Sub - Zero " which was heavy in drama and character development.<br /><br />Everything in the film feels pretty recycled and the supporting characters are charming but no one is actually worth rooting for.<br /><br />All the while , I really enjoyed this , I had a blast , and the identity of the new batgirl is surprising , but this was n't as exciting as I 'd hoped.<br /><br />(**half out of * * * * )
1 I thought the film could be a bit more complex , in a psychological sense perhaps , but the action and voice acting were top notch . The animation was heavy CG in many scenes , but very good ones at that . This is one of the Batman Returns / Forever type films , which include romances and the conflicts of Wayne and motives for dating . 007 fans would love this , and so would the females , great theme song ! Wayne was portrayed very well in this film , and the Penquin was back to his true form , no mutant genes in him this time ! I liked the fact Robin was n't used too much , Tim Drake was just a good computer nerd , somewhat of an Indigo child or mind of the future.<br /><br />The supporting cast was made up of some soap opera stars , decent talents and the characters were drawn to look like the voice actors too . Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this film.<br /><br />I rate this below Phantasm , Return of the Joker , and Batman vs. Dracula , but liked the smarter script better than I enjoyed Subzero . 7/10
1 I give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting " guess who " game . The movie , however , needs more Robin in it . He appeared in the movie in the beginning and sporadically throughout the rest . I always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new Robin character , let alone Knightwing . This movie just continues that bad tradition . The movie spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his romance which would n't be so bad in one movie if the romance was n't so unbelievable . It is still a good movie if you are a Batman fan and I would recommend watching it .
1 Once a year " comes " a movie like that and makes things easy for you . You do n't have make an effort to think it is good , it 's just is . You enjoy it while you watch it , and you take it home with you . I ca n't say it is totally flawless , but it 's near . Acting - great , story -interesting and with elements of suspense . It 's a small family story , pretty much predictable , but it 's not the secret itself that matters . it is the way the it takes the blind girl to reach it . I was impressed by the way the director portrayed their deep relationship ( the blind girl and her cousin ) . The only thing I did n't like that much is the actress that played the mother , she was too tough and without necessity . Keren
1 I wo n't give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to Israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide . It unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life . As she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates , it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion . The film is expertly paced and the acting , especially by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara , the blind woman , is excellent . Israeli film has definitely come of age and is now fully competitive with other foreign films , though few have found a large audience in the U.S.
1 Although there is melodrama at the center or rather at the bottom of this film , the story is told beautifully and subtly and the acting is superb.<br /><br />Yaara , studying at Princeton , returns to her native Israel for the funeral of her oldest and dearest friend , Talia . Because Yaara practically lived with her friend 's parents after the death of her own mother , she has lost her adoptive sister . And because Yaara , blind from birth , has been guided and guarded by Talia , her friend 's suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicable.<br /><br />Inevitably , the blind girl is the one who determines to solve the mystery of this death . Though without sight , she has insight . Though she can not see , she is able to find what is out of sight than the " normal " people around her . The film thus becomes an absorbing mystery as Yaara scours for clues in memories of her relationship with Talia , in her adoptive family 's house , in tapes , diaries , and people in Talia 's past and present.<br /><br />Told from Yara 's point of view , the film is also seen from her point of view , as she visualizes what she hears , believes , and imagines . The solution to the mystery is rather conventional , but the search is conducted with such subtle care and the answer rendered so beautifully and without fanfare , that the pat moment is easily forgiven . The truths emerge gradually yet inexorably , clarifying not only Talia 's life , but also her relationship with Yaara . Tali Sharon , as Yaara , uses her mobile face and voice effectively , and is utterly believable as both the adult and teenage girl . We accept fully her ability by the film 's end to find her place in the world more confidently.<br /><br />Noteworthy is the precision by which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never become tedious , the dead - on acting by the minor characters , and the interesting decision to represent Talia only as a teenager . I will quibble with Yaara 's final declaration as stands with Gadi , Talia 's last boyfriend , at a cliff 's edge , but that trip to the edge is so fascinating that the image will remain in sight longer than her words will be recalled .
1 The story is being told fluidly . There are no interruptions . The flash backs are woven into the present seamlessly . Casting was superb . Young Ya'ara looked very much like Ya'ara would have looked at that age . Her portrayal of a blind person was done convincingly . Director Daniel Syrkin have done a superb job in getting the various actors to work together in this story . The Cinematography is very good . You feel like you are with Ya'ara and Talia walking toward the ocean to the edge of the cliff . The English subtitles follow the Hebrew script very closely . It is interesting to note that even though " Out of sight " is not a direct translation of " Lemarit Ayin " Both names are very appropriate to the story .
1 I was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie . I thought the writer - Sue Smith - very clearly summarised what the film was about . However , the movie really did n't need explanation . I thought the themes were abundantly clear , and inspiring . A movie which deals with the the ability to dare , to face fear - especially fear passed down from parental figures - and overcome it and , in doing so , embrace life 's possibilities , is a film to be treasured and savoured . I enjoyed it much more than the much - hyped ' Somersault . ' I also think Mandy62 was a bit unkind to Hugo Weaving . As a bloke about his vintage , I should look so good ! I agree that many Australian films have been lacklustre recently , but ' Peaches ' delivers the goods . I 'm glad I saw it .
1 This story is beautifully acted . It is both sad and heartwarming about a young girl 's journey to discover where she has come from and where she is going . Stephanie was adopted by her mother 's best friend after her mother and father were killed in a car crash , and ever since she has been labeled the ' miracle baby ' , she is dyslexic and is finding life a bit tough . Her findings along the way affect those closest around her . Her relationship with her guardian and her guardian 's ex boyfriend are handled very delicately and sensitively , and the whole of the supporting cast are genuine , 3 dimensional and believable . Set around a peach canning factory in small town Australia , this is a warm gentle , erotic film , and leaves you with a pleasant feeling when the credits close . After reading some of the other rather shallow comments about Hugo Weaving , I would like to add that I think he was brilliantly cast , and was extremely sexy . No , he is not Brad Pitt , but that does n't mean that he is n't attractive .
1 I really enjoyed the performances of the main cast . Emma Lung is courageous and interesting . The director has developed performances where the characters are not one dimensional . A complex story with the changing between eras . Also appreciated the underlying story of the unions losing power and the effect of a large employer closing on a small town . I do not agree with the comment that the older man has to be attractive . There have be many relationships with older men and younger women - without the male being good looking . Depth of character can be appealing to the not so shallow . The film has a good look and the cinematography is also good .
1 Let me be the first non Australian to comment on this :) I got the movie for Hugo Weaving and I watched it to the end . It 's one of those " drama of life " films , as my mother used to call a movie that depicts a real life story with no extraordinary events and that is mostly descriptive.<br /><br />I liked the light and the girls . The rest was without too much fault , but without too much merit either . I yearned for something like The Interview , or at least some matrix villain element here and there , but nothing out of the ordinary . The story does teach one about facing one 's own destiny and break free from the environment others build for you , but this happens when the life giving peach factory in the area is about to close , so not much of an effort to change things is required.<br /><br />The " smart " American Beauty sound - alike song in the background could have been part of a larger soundtrack , but just that one playing over and over again became annoying after 100 minutes of film.<br /><br />In the end , I guess it did his job of presenting a part of Australian life , but to me it did n't seem specifically Australian ( it could have been placed anywhere ) and it did n't seem attractive as a story.<br /><br />I guess one must be in a certain mood to like the movie .
1 Sensitive film does lack brilliance and , to some degree , narrative structure , but is nevertheless superbly shot and performed . However , the narrative structure point is debatable . While it gives the impression of tying off loose ends nicely in the final scenes , and connects its thoughts with what might be described by the modern viewer as a " story " , I 'm sceptical as to whether this feel * needs * a " narrative structure " that is definite and detectable . Inevitably , it will be compared with SOMERSAULT in that its central protagonist ( I 'm not sure that 's the correct word ! ) is a young , and very young - looking , woman , whose newly discovered sexuality both confuses and empowers her - although of course Cate Shortland 's film tackles this aspect better . But while the possibility exists for reckless viewers to dismiss this film as a cliché , PEACHES is , in some ways , much more ambitious than SOMERSAULT . Perhaps that 's where it does n't quite make it . It 's certainly very different to Monahan 's first feature - THE INTERVIEW ! I 'm not quite sure how the sex scenes between Weaving and Lung added to the story . Who knows - maybe they did . They certainly rammed home the compromised and flawed nature of Weaving 's character - although I personally think this was achieved without the need for these scenes.<br /><br />*****JUST SAW THE FILM AGAIN*********<br /><br />On a second viewing , I can see how some would dismiss it as a telemovie dressed up as a feature . But I 'm not sure how distinct these ' categories ' are anymore , or even if we should be making that distinction . In any case , I do think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from Hallmark efforts . On the other hand , the film 's structure is very formal , and its content is hardly challenging , at least in the way SOMERSAULT , TOM WHITE , THREE DOLLARS , THE ILLUSTRATED FAMILY DOCTOR , LOOK BOTH WAYS and THE HUMAN TOUCH are . The performances are all good , but I did come to the realisation that the main reason I was enjoying the film was because it fit the " Australian " genre , without necessarily adding anything ... and I can understand that this can be a fairly good reason for another person * NOT * to like it ! Indeed , it was n't until Lung enters the room in her Vietnamese dress that the film really begins to pack a punch . But that leads us into another debate - * should * we expect that a film must challenge us all the time ? Certainly I enjoy being challenged by a film ( or a book , or other people ) , but is there no room anymore for what is simply a nice story?<br /><br />I have n't deleted my initial post on this film , because I 'm all too aware of the Orwellian overtones of such an act . But I would downgrade my initial rating from an 8 to perhaps a 6.5.<br /><br />As for nominations for AFI Best Film , my votes go to THE HUMAN TOUCH , THREE DOLLARS and LOOK BOTH WAYS - and I think LOOK BOTH WAYS should win .
1 How you could say that Peaches , with its complex narrative dealing with a multitude of issues , is " a small TV idea " is beyond me . Besides I can think of many films that have " a small TV idea " in their plots . Your obvious dislike of the TV industry ( " Sue Smith has failed to rise above her television background " ) is confusing . particularly as you are having such " a great time " working in TV . If only we could all be so talented as Ms Smith ( no , I am not a friend or relative ) - AFI award winning Brides of Christ , Road from Coorain , etc . All made for TV . Come to think of it , what about those other " small TV ideas " like " Against the Wind " , " Bodyline " , " The Dismissal " , " Scales of Justice " , " Blue Murder " , " Water under the Bridge " , etc . I think Peaches is a good entertaining film which had me interested , and most of my friends as well , from start to finish . It is far from flawless yet I think it is among the best Australian films I have seen over the last couple of years . Who knows , with a few more viewings ( there 's so much to think about ) , it might just be up there with classics like " The Year My Voice Broke " , " The Devil 's Playground " . I really did enjoy this film much more than " Somersault " and " Three Dollars " . These films , I think , had their moments - surreal , atmospheric , realistic and dealing with important contemporary issues , but as for sheer entertainment for mr.and mrs average movie goer and me , it was very ordinary if not boring . When I go to a movie , I am always conscious of the audience 's reaction to a film ( through in- cinemas reactions and overheard conversations in the foyer and loo ) . Some came out of Peaches shaking their heads , some with negative criticisms , but many seemed to have enjoyed the experience .
1 Peaches is truly a marvelous film . I write this to refute a review from someone called ' Auscrit ' , that has appeared on this site . First of all the idea that either Monahans first film ' The Interview ' is somehow TV is an extraordinary statement . Here is a film that has been significantly praised around the world as is simply one of the best Australian Films ever made . It fully deserved to win best picture . Peaches is a brave , bold and courageous departure . For me it works on every level and I have now seen it twice . Monahan is a filmmaker who is demonstrating great skill and incredible sensitivity . For ' Auscrit ' to make the comment that it is another TV movie etc and that Hugo Weaving is no good simply does not ' get ' the film . Or more particularly does not want to get it . Frankly it is the sort of comment that one expects from either another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both . Or someone from inside the industry either distribution , exhibition or bureaucracy . Your average punter , I have found just does not write comments like that . I have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film Sommersault . One has to wonder what people think they are looking at . Unfortunately in Australia at the time SS was released the push was , if you did not like it then there was something wrong with you not the film . This manipulation of the media is pretty common down under . The reality is the only similarity between the two films are that they are rights of passage films . Unfortunately for me SS is a film about nothing , that could have been told in 15 minutes . I see it as a one dimensional film about anxiety . Peaches in comparison is a master piece . Personally I can not wait to what Monahan does next as he is clearly way ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema . In conclusion if the film does not win all at this years AFI 's and IF awards , then it is a rigged game . As for Auscrit , please find something more constructive do with your time
1 I had initially heard of TEARS OF KALI a while back and it sounded like something I 'd be into , but with all the films I have coming in on a regular basis , it kinda fell off my radar . While roaming around the local WonderBook ... I spotted the box for this one and grabbed it up . I have to say I 'm pretty glad I did . TEARS OF KALI is a strange , gory , sometimes downright creepy film which is somewhat constrained by it 's obviously low budget - but is still an entertaining and worthwhile watch.<br /><br />TEARS OF KALI centers around the fictional India - based Taylor - Erikkson cult group , that practices meditation and other rituals in the pursuit of facing and banishing the individual 's " inner demons " - but apparently these techniques work either all too well or not well enough ( depending on your viewpoint ... ) as dark forces are not only exorcised , but also unleashed upon hapless victims.<br /><br />The film is told " anthology - style " , with a short but memorable and " eye - opening " intro sequence , and then proceeding into the three stories that make up the bulk of the film.<br /><br />The first ( SHAKTI ) is about a journalist who visits one of the cult - members who is being held at a mental hospital . The journalist goes in under cover of wanting to research the Taylor - Erikkson cult , but we find that her true motives may hit a little closer to home . When the interview takes a violent turn , the journalist finds that she may have gotten in over her head ... <br /><br />The second part ( Devi ) concerns a violent young man who is sentenced to psychological rehab in lieu of a prison sentence for beating a young man into a coma . We find that the treating doctor in question is actually a Taylor - Erikkson " alumni " , and his rehabilitation methods are far from the norm ... <br /><br />The closing story ( KALI ) revolves around a quack " faith - healer " and his assistant who perform " miracles " for a fee . When the healer unwittingly helps one of his clients and actually expels a force which had been possessing her , the demon is now free to roam and looking for a new host ... <br /><br />I got ta say I really enjoyed TEARS OF KALI . There are some faults with the film that keep it from being truly excellent - but it is an original and ambitious film for what it is . My biggest gripe with the production is the poor and uninspired over - dubbed dialogue . The dubbing is sub - par and I would have much preferred to have a subtitled option with the original language track . Some reviewers have said the acting is poor , which I do n't necessarily agree with . I think that the dubbing is so lack - luster that it makes the performances seem stunted , which is n't really the case . In fact , a few of the performances are pretty damn chilling ( the " doctor " in the second segment , and the " client " in the third readily come to mind ... ) and notable . The gore FX are very well done for a low - budget film , with some graphic scenes of eyelid - removal - via - cuticle - scissors , a pencil - in - the - throat - suicide , some decent ( but irritatingly " shaky " ) self - flaying , and a few other goodies thrown in for good measure . Not as rough as some of the more " extreme " gore films out there , but definitely stronger than your average horror fare . I also found the story concerning the cult - group to be intriguing and a welcome change to the typical horror - story nonsense . There are plenty of scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension , the likes of which I have n't come across in a while . Although flawed in some fundamental ways , I still think TEARS OF KALI will appeal to most " underground " horror viewers - some scenes may prove too much for the more mainstream viewer . Definitely Recommended - 8.5/10
1 I saw this movie on the BIFFF Festival in Brussel , spring 2004 . What a surprise ! This German production , a stylish and imaginative shocker , is one of the scariest flic i have seen . Be warned : this is not a joke ! This terrorizer has a big cast of good actors ( as an example : Peter Martell as a European guru has a strong presence ) , excellent direction , nice production design , a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore sfx like Italian horror movies in the eighties . Flesh ripped clean to the bone ... and the blood runs red ... this savage Heart Stopper will grip you ... and give you some dark dreams ... A must - see ! !
1 Three horror stories based on members of a transgressive Hindu cult that return home but changed in some way . In the first story our former cult member is now in an insane asylum and is visited by a reported who wants to find out about what went on at the cult . Somewhat slow going as story is told in flashbacks while the two sit on chairs and face each other . Reporter is particularly interested in what lead to the death of the participants . What seemed rather boring suddenly turns very exciting with a surprising twist in the story . Things get quite bloody.<br /><br />Second story has a violent young criminal visiting a psychiatrist for mandatory therapy . The patient seems to have some type of agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the task . Again , things slow down a bit and get weird . Then there 's a strange twist in the story that is very well written and surprising.<br /><br />Final story deals with spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove the persons illness from them with his hands . One of the patients is a former cult member , so the successful healing gets more complicated . Again , we are surprised by a twist . Has a pretty gory scene in there.<br /><br />There some nice female full frontal nudity as well as male full frontal nudity for some reason . I found the stories to be very well written and the director succeeds entirely in setting up each story with its surprising twist and the gory aftermath.<br /><br />Note : review of the German DVD .
1 This is a trio of tales , " Shakti " , " Devi " , and " Kali " , about an experimental commune ( or some such thing ) called the Taylor - Eriksson group , which took people on journeys inside themselves and into the realm of the unknown , and left a bit of damage here and there , I 'd say . Many years later some of that damage is still lurking and waiting for the right moment to show itself . Shakti tells the tale of a woman whose husband died mysteriously , in fact , he was torn apart , and the suspect was a man that may not have existed . Seems this woman is able to project some inner demon , or so finds out the sister of the man who was killed when she attempts to talk to this woman while posing as a reporter . Devi tells the tale of a young man who wants to " jump out of his skin " . He 's a skinhead , a speed freak , and is sent to see a psychiatrist who just happens to be a former member of this commune , which results in the good doctor helping the young man to realize his desire . This is probably the best of the three segments . Kali tells the tale of a healer , who attempts to " heal " this woman who was a part of this commune and lets loose some kind of demon that has lived in this woman , but one wonders if he did it or if SHE loosed it because it could not survive in her any longer . All three of these tales are pretty creepy and suspenseful because you 're never really sure what to expect , and the premise and the settings are so unlike those of conventional horror films that it adds to the strangeness . This has a sort of low - budget look and feel to it but it also manages to conjure up a pretty creepy atmosphere throughout , much to its credit . I watched this with my mouth hanging open a good portion of the time and when the real scares ( and gore ) came it hit pretty hard . I found this to be a very interesting and disturbing film and liked it a lot . A good little find , this one , I 'd give it 8 out of 10 .
1 one of the best low budget movies from Germany ! is this is the dark side of new age ? if you believe in esoteric , please do n't watch this movie ! it blows all your positive fantasies away . this movie shows that beyond the peaceful façade of spiritual soul searching lies a world of extreme transgressions and terror . i hope there will be a 35 mm copy soon ! Andreas Marschall 's first film is just the beginning of a new area , making movies with a few euros ! i 'm waiting for the second hit !
1 Its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one , but for me Tears of Kali is one of the horror highlights of the 00 's and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece . An anthology horror , it takes on the story of the fictional Taylor - Eriksson Group , a cult of sorts based in India whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche , with unpleasant results that echo down the years . With bookend segments set in India the film is made chiefly of three stories set in Germany , illustrating the aftermath of the work of the Taylor - Eriksson Group , with some pretty nasty gore at times . Its an interesting set up as these things go , but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror . Bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients , healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals , dark forces unbound by time , place or even personality . Good examples of this are found in the first story especially , dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital . Previous to this story we have seen Lars Eriksson and notably his wonky ( lazy ? ) eye , we also see him healing or at least comforting a patient . The lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as Eriksson healing a fellow patient , also as she wraps up the canvases from the art class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen , a face with lazy eye like Erikssons . There are also references to folk in minuscule roles , extras and walk ons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film , showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and able to almost infect others . There is more to the film philosophically than just evil within , it is a film about death , suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from Hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect ( at least from the research that I did on wikipedia ) . Writer / director Andreas Marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for his skill in constructing the film . As well as being thoughtful , the film is pretty chilling too , the soundtrack of Bharti India and Panama John has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances , Michael Balaun as a sinister doctor and Cora Chilcot as a freaky patient especially good . The third story also has a fine turn from veteran Mathieu Carrière as a faith healer . The biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well . So , the film is n't quite as gripping as it might be , the acting occasionally off and the pacing too , but mostly I thought it was pretty great , if a shade short of its possible brilliance . Well worth a look for adventurous horror fans I think .
1 Tears of Kali is an original yet flawed horror film that delves into the doings of a cult group in India comprised of German psychologists who have learned how to control their wills and their bodies to the point that they can cause others to be " healed " through radical techniques ( that can trigger nightmarish hallucinations and physical pain and torture ) to release the pent - up demons inside them.<br /><br />The film is shown as a series of vignettes about the Taylor - Eriksson group -- the above - mentioned cult group . The first segment is somewhat slower than the rest but serves fine to set up the premise for the rest of the film . The rest of it plays out like a mindf@ck film with some of the key staples thrown in the mix ( full - frontal nudity , some gore ) to keep you happy.<br /><br />I say check this out . May not be spectacular , but it 's concept is pretty neato and it delivers in the right spots . 8/10 .
1 This movie has its ups and downs , but to me the good stuff in this movie very much outweighs the bads ... <br /><br />What 's not so good about the movie are indeed sometimes the dialogue , the sounds , the lighting(am I the only one who noticed the way the sets were lighted was amateur , and the acting .... <br /><br />What is very good are the highly original storyline , the very intense atmosphere , the gore factor which is very high , and the effects which are done supremely.<br /><br />So , definitely worth watching , or maybe even a must - see for all you horror and gore fans ....
1 The plot is real horrific , the atmosphere really depressive , unusual for a low - budget production like that , and at least , for a German production . A little bit of Indian spirituality , mystic thriller and slasher movie mixed together . The development of plot and characters are great , the sets very close to reality , without any studio - atmosphere . It could be perfect , but at unfortunately some things were a little bit disappointing , what do n't inevitably have to be typically for low - budget movies:<br /><br />1 . ) The cast sometimes is not more than average . Almost every actor look like a layman . Some of them do a good , or a very good job , but some are acting like the actors of crappy German court - shows ! But I was very , very disappointed of the acting of Mathieu Carrière ! His acting ( in a lots of of his older movies his acting was fine ) here was below - average ! But that could be the reason , why he today takes part in crappy German soaps or TV - series on private channels.<br /><br />2 . ) The dialogs are sometimes on soap - opera - level . < br /><br />3 . ) The bad sound made it sometimes very hard to understand , what the characters are saying . I saw it on DVD and was glad to could rewind and to listen it again . It caused by the set ( big halls as in the hospital or with the esoterically group ) and sometimes the strange dialects of the actors!<br /><br />But all in all , it is an interesting movie , worth to watch it , far beyond the commercially movies , which are often more terrible .
1 Theodore Rex is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time , and is certainly a milestone in human culture , civilization and artistic expression ! ! In this compelling intellectual masterpiece , Jonathan R. Betuel aligns himself with the great film makers of the 20th century , such as Francis Ford Copola , Martin Scorcese , Orson Welles and Roman Polanski . The special effects are nothing less than breathtaking , and make any work by Spielberg look trite and elementary . At the time of it 's release , Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar of film - making to levels never anticipated by film makers . The concept of making not just a motion picture featuring a dinosaur , but adapting an action packed , thrilling detective novel , co - staring a " talking " dinosaur with a post - modern name such as " Theodore " , and an existential female police officer changed humanity as we know it . The world could never be the same after experiencing such magnificent beauty . Watching Theodore Rex is much akin to looking into the face of God and hearing Him say " you are my most beloved creation . " This is one of the few films that is simply TO DIE FOR ! ! !
1 Compelling and Innovative ! At the beginning of this criminally underrated Whoopi Goldberg flick the writers draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and the 1941 Orson Welles classic " Citizen Kane " . The writers are justified in drawing such a seemingly disparate parallel , but the viewing public is too often hoodwinked into seeing overly hyped Hollywood schlock to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two movies . In " Citizen Kane " Charles Foster Kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his underlings , much like Whoopi Goldberg in this movie . This movie is about finding love in everybody 's differences . It is an epic examination of the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society that is dominated by greed and self - absorption . Whoever paired Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex formulated a dyad for the ages , with the only justifiable comparisons being Bogey and Bacall , Hepburn and Tracy and Hall and Oates . If you would love to watch an uplifting , celluloid philosophical examination of some of humanity 's deepest drives ; Bergman - esqe but not as depressing , Theodore Rex should be viewed immediately !
1 This movie is excellent and I would recommend renting it for anyone whose local video store owns it . Or , even better , you could buy it because chances are you 're going to watch this over and over . I can remember watching this movie as a kid and it was great back then . But after watching it again yesterday I 've found it to be amazing.<br /><br />A good blend of comedy ( although not as great as " Mr Magoo "- another one of my favorites ) and action . This deserves 10/10 and I 'm hoping that they will make a sequel soon ( fingers crossed ) . If you do babysitting or have to look after young children for anything then I 'd recommend renting this movie as it will keep them entertained for hours :) .
1 I enjoyed it . In general , I 'm not a fan of comedies and comedians , but I do like Whoopi . I 'm also partial to Sci / Fi Fantasy . And the dinosaur craze . I read for pleasure , but when I 'm feeling over - stressed or really mind - dead , I watch TV & movies to escape . Theodore Rex enabled me to do so . That makes it a success in my eyes ! I did n't even walk away to do something else while it was running . Whether or not it was rated as " good " or not does n't really matter to me . And no , I 'm not a juvenile . Nor am I a moron .
1 This is the best piece of film ever created Its a master piece that brought a tear to my eye . Ill never forget my experience watching it . I do n't understand why people do n't think as I do The dinosaur turns in a performance reminiscent of De Niro in Raging Bull , Pacino in Scarface , and Crowe in Gladiator combined . This should be released on DVD in Superbit format so I can fully enjoy it like it was meant to be enjoyed when they produced and filmed it . Whoppi Goldberg truly turns in the performance of a lifetime as a tough , gritty cop who is against her will teamed with a hot shot dinosaur as her partner then the hi - jinx ensues to say the least . By the way I 'm saying the complete opposite of what is true this movie is utter garbage .
1 Oh , boy , God bless the 1970 's , we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade : The Exorcist , Jaws , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Halloween and now , Raggedy Ann & Andy : A Musical Adventure . This movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world , I mean seriously , this movie scared the heck out of me . My sister had this movie in her VHS collection and I was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money . What the heck ? It 's kinda funny how this movie is the 1970 's version of Toy Story , pretty much down to a key , only this was a thousand times scarier , Disney had Alice in Wonderland to get into the drug trips for the children.<br /><br />Whenever Marcella leaves the room , Raggedy Ann , along with her brother Raggedy Andy and a whole nursery full of colorful toys come to life . On Marcella 's birthday , a new doll , Babette , arrives from Paris , France to the United States of America . Babette is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll , but the friendly Raggedy Ann does everything she can to make Babette feel at home . However , the pirate Captain Contagious kidnaps her . Raggedy Ann and Andy set off to try to rescue her before Marcella discovers Babette is gone . Out in the world outside the nursery , the two meet the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees , a blue toy camel who has been cast off by past owners and is now heartbroken and lonely . After Raggedy Ann and Andy hitch a ride on the Camel , he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking , runs over the edge of a cliff , into a deep pit . In this pit they encounter the Greedy , who is a giant gluttonous blob of taffy who eats constantly and is never full . The Raggedys and the Camel narrowly escape being consumed by the Greedy and continue their journey to find Babette   and believe me , it just gets weirder from this point on.<br /><br />While this movie was certainly disturbing and I just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie , this was actually pretty creative . Back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it , you can tell that they did that with Raggedy Ann & Andy : A Musical Adventure . This certainly was n't the worst movie I have ever seen , I just do n't know who to recommend it too . As scared as I was , I have to admit I 'm glad I watched it , sometimes you need a " WTF ? ! " movie to spice up your selection , believe me when I say that Raggedy Ann had no problem in doing just that with me . It 's official , that doll is just plain creepy , let 's just put it this way , there 's a giant caramel river that is eating everything , a king who 's head keeps getting bigger as he laughs , a bizarre thing that humiliates Raggedy Ann and her brother , a strange almost incest between Ann and Andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs . Yikes.<br /><br />7/10
1 Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy THE MOVIE is about dolls that come to life when the humans are n't around . In this adventure they must rescue a kidnapped french doll named Babette from the captain of pirates . On their way they journey though Deep Dark Woods , Taffy Pit , and even Looney Land . Will the aide of their new friend The Camel With Wrinkled Knees help them or just slow them down with his hallucinations of his friends leaving him ? How will they escape the Kookoo king and his henchmen ! ? What will their owner Marcella say when she sees her 7th birthday present doll gone along with her other toys ? Delightful surprises await the two adventurers.<br /><br />All scores are out of a possible 10 : Story : 8 - Very cute . Dolls that come to life when the master is n't around . Not just that because they go out into many many different places , but they are in an imaginary world so anything can happen . Meeting new characters , going to different places finding new friends , its great . The characters all work so well in this too and who does n't love pirates ? ! Acting : 8 - Every character suits their voice so well . Specifically the Marlon Brando taffy pit enemy , The Greed . The french doll has a very uptight french accent , the evil Hitler - esquire king Kookoo ( who s got hair that resembles Simpson 's Sideshow Bob ) plays his role very well , and the sorrow old black man voice for Camel works perfectly . Why is it that old dubbed animation was soo much better than new ones ? Music : 10 - Nothing short of perfection here . The songs have been in my head for years , and re - watching it nearly 20 years later , i can still remember each and every one of them and will now be able to know exactly where these tunes come from . Joe Raposo of " Sesame Street " fame did an excellent job with the songs for this and everyone sings real well.<br /><br />Editing : 6 - Heh , this is where it 'll get confusing . I mean how far did the Raggedy 's walk anyway ? A lot of events just seem to occur one after another and there 's no telling WHO the other dolls and toys were as you never see them in the real world of the movie , but it does follow some sort of path and you know they 'll eventually get to where they need to go , its just pretty hard to follow at times.<br /><br />Uniqueness : 8 - Between this and Unico i 'd have to say there 's parts in both movies i will never forget no matter how hard i try to . Mainly the scary parts . I 've probably mentioned already how older movies were Much creepier than animation of today but this takes the cake in the scary factor . Outside of the South Park movie and some Disney films there 's almost no animated musicals , or good ones of that coming out so its very unique.<br /><br />Worth : 8- Its classic . Worth the hunt to get a good copy that s for sure , but the VHS copies are probably all stretched out by now . The DVD version is sold on Ebay all the time and it 'll definitely be something you 'll watch more than once . If anything get it for the nostalgia purposes.<br /><br />Overall Score ( Not an average ) : 8 - Its a wonderful timeless musical made in the late 70s and can still be enjoyed today . Its characters are all unique and the songs are great . So great you might find yourself humming them time and time again . Give your favorite stuffed animal a hug today ! Reviewer 's Insight ( Including bias ) : This is n't like the Raggedy Ann TV series made a decade later . This was way more darker and real world . The effects in this seem like a lot of other acid - trip cartoons from the 70 's , in particular , Yellow Submarine . Still , its given me memories I 'll never forget , and might still influence things today . It was n't easy to find but it 'll remain a treasure to keep in my collection of DVDs and videos forever .
1 I saw this jolly little film at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS . I did n't know it had been in a theater at all . To rate it from a kids point of view I 'd give it 4 out of 5 stars , because being a young boy at the time , it seemed a little " girlish".<br /><br />The climactic scene where Gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you outgrow that sort of thing . < br /><br />When I re - discovered it a Blockbuster Video in 1995,I had to revisit it ! I still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit " old " . I do n't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it was n't on VHS.<br /><br />It 's out there . Might even be on DVD by now , at least I hope it is . I want to share it with my kids someday ! 10 stars on here , it 's still a great kids film . ( end)<br /><br />09/08/2009 : Finally found a VHS copy ! ! Woo - hoo !
1 I saw this movie at the theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old . I loved it then , and have recently come to own a VHS version . < br /><br />My 4 and 6 year old children love this movie and have been asking again and again to watch it . < br /><br />I have enjoyed watching it again too . Though I have to admit it is not as good on a little TV.<br /><br />I do not have older children so I do not know what they would think of it . < br /><br />The songs are very cute . My daughter keeps singing them over and over.<br /><br />Hope this helps .
1 Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I ever saw in the theaters . My dad took my sister and I , and the funny thing is - when we got home , dad asked us " what do you want to do now ? " and we said we want to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again ! lol , and my dad actually took us back to the theatre to watch it again -- at least that 's how I remember it . I was five years old at the time.<br /><br />This movie was pretty scary for a five year old . The scene with the giant ocean of sweets , and the hypnotic camel scene .. i do n't remember a lot from this film , naturally , the beginning was magical , and a few scenes -- I wish I could find it again , and will likely seek it out now.<br /><br />I remember I loved Raggedy Ann & Andy .
1 This is a very strange film by director / animator Richard Williams . All who know of William 's work know it 's a bit off - kilter ( if not ingenious ) but this one takes the cake.<br /><br />It features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owner 's new French doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way . The strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality ; its strange character designs , its powerful animation , and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary . Williams ' brilliant animation portrayed Raggedy Ann and Andy as real rag dolls , floppy and darned , rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls , which made it more believable ( at least in a visual sense ) . The animation shines on the bring us the Camel - with - the - Wrinkled - Knees , whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end , the silent - movie chase with Sir Leonard Looney and , of course , the Greedy.<br /><br />The Greedy animation , on its own , is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation I 've ever seen . There 's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop -- and every second it 's something new . Living in what was deemed " the Taffy Pit , " the Greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets . He sings a song that I ca n't help but feel hold some sexual undertones , then tries to kill Raggedy Ann for her candy heart.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this film is that there are too many songs . It continuously bogs down the movie 's pace because there are SIXTEEN of them . There are about six good songs ( which should have been the only ones ) including " I Look , And What Do I See ? " , " No Girl 's Toy " , " Blue " ( though they did n't need to make him sing it twice ) , " I Never Get Enough " , " Because I Love You " and maybe " I 'm Home . " The others just seem unnecessary and frankly are n't too amazing to listen to.<br /><br />This is a weird film with strange undertones , but if that 's what you 're looking for , you wo n't find better .
1 Now here 's a film straight out of my childhood , my family used to taped ; but it kind of got tapped over and losted over the years . Now I was fortunate to watch the whole film on youtube.com ; I had love this wonderful film when I watched it as kid , and after watching again ( online ) , I still do today . My favorite song from the movie is " Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers " ( I will always remember that sweet song forever ) . < br /><br />I was surprised when I looked at the opening credits ( on who animated who),that some of the animators date back to 1930s ( WOW ! that 's like 47 years ) .
1 I have very fond memories of this film , as I saw it with my two younger sisters when it first shown theatrically in 1977 and I was eight years old . Apparently it was deemed a failure - and is now practically forgotten ( the pan - and scan videocassette - which never did justice to the picture or it 's ambitious Panavision compositions is now out - of -print . ) The film is very stylized ( shades of YELLOW SUBMARINE ) and admittedly uneven . Some of the characters and sequences are exquisite while others are somewhat juvenile and undistinguished . The sad discarded blue camel ( shades of Eeyore ) and his blue song are truly heartwarming . Joe Raposo 's songs are for the most part simply beautiful . Definitely a worthwhile curiousity that will probably ( sadly ) fall into total obscurity .
1 I believe I received this film when I was a young buck . I remembered watching it as a child , but i could never find the film . I remembered good ol Rageddy Ann , Andy , Babette , the Greedy , King Koo Koo . I searched high and low for this movie and still no luck . But one day when I was moving out of my childhood home I had found it . We were reunited . I am 17 years old now . I still watch it . All the time actually . It 's one of the funniest and touching movies I have ever seen and enjoyed at the same time . And personally I think they should make a sequel . Mmm , yes a sequel indeed . Now i am even considering getting the captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body !
1 Personally , this is one of my favorites of all time ! no , i 'm not 10 .. i 'm 30 ! i own an old , original VHS of this that i bought from a rental store . i 've watched it countless times .. <br /><br />while it 's an amusing movie for kids , it 's an intriguing movie for adults . i once saw this movie whiile i was .. not sober . my eyes were opened to things i had never noticed before . i saw morals being strongly encouraged , both overtly and somewhat subliminally .. i wish i could remember all the things i noticed in particular , but it 's been a very long time since then . rest assured , there are TONS of things that are alluded to throughout the movie . if you get the chance to view it .. not sober .. do so , you wo n't be disappointed .. as a matter of fact , you will probably feel rather happy and warm.<br /><br />unique and wonderful !
1 Richard Willaims is an animation god . He was hampered in directing this film by the producer . The final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story , but some amazing moments of animation ( like Emery Hawkins ' " Greedy " ) . Joe Raposo 's repetitive music does n't help either . It was made in wide screen so the VHS does n't show it in all it 's glory , let 's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday . Still it 's worth watching for some eye popping animation .
1 Never when I was a child did I love any movie more then this one . I would love to own it . I watched it every Sunday they played it on the Family Film Festival . It is an enjoyable film suitable for the whole family and the songs are wonderful .
1 The last time I saw the movie I was around seven years , so my opinions might be jaded over time . At the time I enjoyed the filming that switched between cartoon and live action . At the time I felt sad for the blue camel and his sad life . Also I felt glee when after Captain Contagious kidnapped the heroine ( a princess or toy shepherdess ) the tables the were turned on him . Unfortunately the producers never decided to transfer this movie to VHS , so all I have are twenty year old memories . I am sure that if I saw the movie again I would consider it corny and sappy , but I really enjoyed it the movie at the time .
1 This Raggedy Ann and Andy Movie is so adorable . We love watching Ann and Andy sing and dance , along with the camel with the wrinkled knees . This movie is what made the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees so popular , singing his song , " I 'm nobodies I Love You " . If you love Raggedy Ann and Andy Watch the movie and you will see why it 's a movie the kids love , and adults !
1 ... in our household . Like everyone else who has commented on this movie , my brothers ( 7 & 4 years old at the time ) and I ( 10 ) would watch this movie over and over again . We all loved Star Wars , but we always went back to this one because of the great songs and the adventure . We all loved the Camel and would sing at the top of our lungs with him during his song . There are some slow moments ( the time spent with King Koo - Koo in his court ) and we generally got bored after The Knight 's song ( " The reason that I { sound effect } is because I loooooove you " ) , but we loved the journey to rescue Babbette and the ending and were all a little freaked out by the picture of King Koo - Koo floating there dominating the entire horizon , laughing maniacally at the end . I still to this day sing " Hooray for me ! Babbette of gay Paris ! " around my friends ( I 'm 33 now ) who just look at me as if I 've lost my mind ; however , when I 'm singing it I 'm 10 years old again remembering the wonderful year of Star Wars .
1 I vaugely recall seeing this when I was 3 years old , then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon . Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it and since I was then able to comprehend things better , I thought it was a good movie then . Fast forward to Just a few weeks ago ( June 2006 ) when I re - re discovered it thanks to some internet articles / video clips and it 's just not the same movie . I 'm sure it 's still good with the kids , but to us 20 - 30 somethings it 's definitely got " Cult Status " written all over it . It 's a shame that the original production went through a painful process ; if Fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today . Maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be , but that 's for Fox to decide . I 'm rambling here , I know . I Still think it 's a great film , but it could be better than great .
1 ONCE UPON A TIME , there were different types of movies . These different movies coexisted even though each one had something different to offer .... <br /><br />This seems obvious at first , but I thought I 'd point it out during this review because it seems a few people may have forgotten . This is just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans . That 's all it is . It does n't claim to be anything else or anything grander . People who deride it as something that fell short of a promise are n't seeing the whole picture- literally . After all , Hollywood makes movies all the time that are shameless vehicles for people ( Bodyguard or The Preacher 's Wife w / Whitney Houston are 2 examples that spring to mind.)<br /><br />First I 'd like to address the movie as a vehicle for Pavarotti . There are worse things in this world-- and worse movies . The singing is fabulous and the selection of arias is fun . The movie starts with Schubert 's Ave Maria and then Leoncavallo 's Matinatta . Pav sings arias from La Gioconda , Manon Lescaut , and Turandot but also sings popular music such as " I left my heart in San Francisco " and the song that was nominated for an Oscar & Golden Globe , " If we were in Love " w / music by John Williams & lyrics by Alan & Marilyn Bergman- all 3 previous Oscar winners.<br /><br />The story is n't that bad . It was built for Pavarotti so of course it 's not going to be something that 's profound or universally applicable to the average movie viewer . It 's a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized by a bad night at the opera years ago . When asked to sing again at the same place , the " MET " in NYC , he loses his voice from fear . Doctor Pamela ( or Pah - MAY - lah in Italian : ) ) played by Kathryn Harrold- gives him a shot to cure his psychosomatic reaction . He offers her the chance to have a fling with him and she reluctantly accepts.<br /><br />They embark on an affair , she knowing he 's married & promising not to fall in love with him and him thinking she will be just another woman . Despite all that , they fall in love ( thus the song , " IF we were in love " ) and with her help , he overcomes his fear & goes back to the MET where he triumphs . I wo n't tell how it ends , but it 's fairly predictable . Which is n't always a bad thing . < br /><br />The performances in this are n't that bad . Pavarotti ( who plays Giorgio Fini ) is n't an actor , so if you 're expecting a Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks performance , YOU are deluded , not Pavarotti . He knows he 's not a thespian . What he is is cute , charming & charismatic . He is having fun himself , and if you can just let yourself have fun too , it 's not so bad . One funny line is when he tells Pamela ( Harrold ) that she 's a " thirsty plant , Fini can water you ! " and of course , she says , " I do n't want to be watered on by Fini ! " Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a nice job as a semi - uptight woman who learns from this extravagant man to live a little . One of my favorite lines in the movie is : " Life never has to be life size . " And there 's Eddie Albert who does his usual good job as Fini 's manager . There are several " themselves " cameos by real conductors , singers , etc . and it is filmed on location at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center . < br /><br />If you like opera , if you like Pavarotti , or if you can just let yourself go & enjoy a " little fling " just like he proposes in the movie- then you can enjoy this movie for what it is . I know I do- EVERY time . : ) < br /><br / >
1 Yes , Giorgio , is a feel good movie . A little romance , great music , beautiful scenery , comedy , ( a great food fight ) , and a little taste of bittersweet are the ingredients of Yes , Giorgio . Any movie buff would enjoy this film . Those who require massive special effects , should look elsewhere . Most of us need a little escape now and then , and how better to do this , than with a feast for the eyes , ears , and heart ? A must see !
1 I watched this movie with my mother when I was in high school many years ago . I definitely was not the least bit interested in opera at the time , but he changed my views . I enjoyed this movie very much and have truly enjoyed opera ever since . I even bought several of his CD 's . Who cares what his acting abilities were , he basically just played himself , which was adorable . He was so charming , so charismatic ; I honestly just wanted to hug him . I feel very sad that so many are criticizing him so harshly . It was so straight , did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions . He deserves to be respected and admired for his talent . He will definitely be missed ! ! !
1 I saw this movie when it came out when I was 17 years old and into classic rock ( still am ) ... < br /><br />I never liked opera before because I hate soprano voices , but he changed all that . He was adorable in the movie and had such an amazing voice . < br /><br />I heard on CNN that he died tonight at home of pancreatic cancer , he will be missed , and he definitely left his mark on this world.<br /><br />I hope to buy this movie if I can find it , watch and enjoy . * smile * Maybe I should head over to Amazon.com and have a look before it 's sold out .
1 I remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 & loved it then . About 4 years later I had the privilege of seeing Luciano Pavarotti sing at the Metropolitan Opera house in New York ( in Tosca ) so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night . What 's not to like about this film ? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti ( Fini ) was at his best and still looked great . The story is actually very funny in parts & the ' food fight ' scene is still one of the funniest I have ever seen . The hot air balloon flight over the Napa valley was beautiful & so was the song he sang " If we were in love " ( one of the few times Pavarotti sang in English ) . And hearing the duet of Santa Lucia gorgeous . Get real folks , this was a film about an opera singer called Georgio Fini who just happened to be played by Pavarotti . Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles.<br /><br />I am VERY glad that I still have this almost worn out VHS tape of this movie but I would love this to be released on DVD especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us because I think this includes the best performance of Nessun Dorma sung by him still on film today !
1 Okay , let 's face it . this is a god - awful movie . The plot ( such as it is ) is horrible , the acting worse . But the movie was made for one reason and one reason only , like all of those awful Mario Lanza movies ... just to hear the voice of the star , in this case Pavarotti in his prime . Okay , so maybe the Lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit on women , but this movie is about hearing Luciano . That alone is worth watching the movie . A big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears , finds humility and love along the way , and belts out a lot of hit numbers , too.<br /><br />I must admit I 'm prejudiced on a number of levels . I 'm Italian . I 'm a big Pavarotti fan ( is there anything about Pavarotti that is n't big , including his fan base ? ) . And when I first saw this movie I was going out on my own , seeing the height and depth of Life 's possibilities and in love for the first time . So as awful as this movie is , the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deep of life and love again.<br /><br />Yes , it 's corny and awful . But the voice is immortal and timeless , and the voice is what it 's all about . So I give this movie a high rating in hopes that someone who has never heard Pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love , especially since he is now gone . Like Italian food that you 've never tried before , try it ! You may be pleasantly surprised , as a Luciano lover or prospective Pavarotti peep .
1 As someone else commented , this is a feel - good movie . It 's got glorious scenery and the wonder - filled voice of Luciano ! I 've seen this movie many times and just saw it again this afternoon . I 'd forgotten how much I miss Pavarotti 's singing of Nessun Dorma and I need to get out the CD ! It 's a great movie to just while away the afternoon engrossed in fun and reverie . Eddie Albert is grand as the agent and a bit over the top , but all agents are just that anyway . The Italian countryside is gorgeous but nothing tops the balloon ride for the perfect view . If you need acting of Olivier proportion , this movie is n't for you . If you just want a flight of fancy and some wonderful music , watch this film . Just enjoy !
1 " Yes , Georgio " is a light - hearted and enjoyable movie / comedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music . It 's not my favorite movie but it is a movie I have enjoyed seeing more than once . Some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy Pavarotti , they would likely be better served by picking up an opera DVD . Although , a full opera might be a better representation of Pavarotti 's operatic talents , oftentimes , an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person . " Yes , Georgio " permits Pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would not.<br /><br />Many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable ; I do n't agree . Enormously talented people can be both self - centered and charming - charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people . Additionally , people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own . Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the other.<br /><br />Relax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities . The ending scenes from Puccini 's Turandot alone are worth the time to get there .
1 We first watched this film as part of a festival of new Argentine films in 2000 at the Walter Reade . Although we liked it , we did n't think it was extraordinary . Watching it for a second time , we found a different meaning in this look at life in Buenos Aires.<br /><br />The film takes place in one of the darkest days of Argentina , as the DeLaRua administration was ending . The country was in turmoil after the economy , which had flourished earlier in the 1990s , under the artificially climate President Menen created . It was a time when bank accounts in dollars were frozen and people got themselves living a nightmare.<br /><br />The story begins just as Santamarina , a bank employee , is fired because the collapse of the economy . Instead of receiving sympathy from his wife , she locks him out of the apartment and he , for all practical purposes , becomes a homeless man . He takes to the streets trying to make ends meet.<br /><br />The other story introduces us to Ariel , a young Jew , interviewing for a job in a Spanish company . It 's almost a miracle he gets the job . His father , Simon , owns a small restaurant in the Jewish quarter of " El Once " in the center of the city . Things go from bad to worse , when Ariel 's mother dies suddenly . Only Estela , the young woman who is in love with Ariel , comes to help father and son.<br /><br />Santamarina , who is a clean man , has to resort to take showers wherever he can . He chooses a ladies ' room in one of the subway stations . When the attendant , Elsa , finds him naked , she becomes furious , but she comes to her senses when she realizes the unhappy circumstances of this man who has seen better times . They become romantically involved , and Santamarina in one of his trips through the street garbage , finds an infant . Elsa , while surprised , wants to do the right thing . But Santamarina convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives will cement their love.<br /><br />Ariel , who has met the gorgeous Laura at work , begins a turbulent and heavy sexual affair with his beautiful co - worker , who unknown to him , is involved in a lesbian affair . Ariel who free lances by photographing weddings and other occasions , feels a passion for Laura , but he realizes what Estela has sacrificed in order to help his father and still loves him.<br /><br />Daniel Burman , whose " El Abrazo Partido " we thought was excellent , did wonders with this film . Things are put in its proper perspective after a second viewing recently and we must apologize for not having perceived it the first time around . If anything , this second time , the nuances of the screen play Mr. Burman and Emiliano Torres wrote , make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country was living during those dark days.<br /><br />Daniel Hendler , who plays Ariel , has collaborated with Mr. Burman before to surprising results . He is not ' movie star pretty ' , yet , he is handsome . This actor projects a tremendous sincerity in his work . Enrique Pineyro is another magnificent surprise . His Santamarina is disarming . In spite of all the bad things that have fallen on him , he keeps a rosy attitude toward everyone he meets . Stefania Sandrelli , the interesting Italian actress , makes a great contribution to the film with her Elsa . Hector Alterio , one of the best Argentine actors plays the small part of Simon . The gorgeous Chiara Coselli is seen as Laura and Melina Petrielli appears as the noble Estela.<br /><br />"Esperando al mesias " proves Daniel Burman is a voice to be reckoned with in the Argentine cinema .
1 This outstanding Argentine independent film is one of the very best of the year 2000 from all South America , including Argentina , which is producing an astonishing number of quality films since 1999 . In 2000 alone , Argentina released many quality films , which broke Argentine B.O. records . A half dozen were internationally acclaimed , like this one , at important world film festivals . After viewing this film , one can see how home grown Argentinian films were able last year to recapture 20 % of its national movie market.<br /><br />Directed by one of Argentina 's best directors , Daniel Burman , this film examines effects of globalisation worldwide , but emphasizes its impact on Argentina , and particularly the Jewish community of Buenos Aires . Daniel Hendler is wonderful as the nice Jewish boy , trying to survive and even succeed in today 's business climate . Hector Alterio , one of the great actors of Hispanic Cinema worldwide , is perfect as Simon , the Jewish father , as is the rest of the cast , which includes Spanish and Italian stars.<br /><br />So many current themes in urban Western societies are explored , I do n't have enough space to go into detail . Daniel Burman cleverly weaves them into the plot with different characters personifying diverse dilemmas . If this film plays at a festival near you , or on video , do n't miss it !
1 I was pleasantly surprised to find that How to Lose Friends and Alienate People was nowhere near as ' gross - out ' a comedy as the trailer had led me to expect . I rapidly became absorbed in the unfolding of the narrative and remained engrossed throughout . Pacing of the more visual humorous content was , I thought , spot on . ( I mean I got the impression I was witnessing Pegg 's attempts at restoring lost control very much ' in real time ' , so to speak . ) At other moments there was time allowed to share the main protagonists ' ( i.e. Pegg 's and Dunst 's ) reflection on how events were affecting them and what had led them to where they now found themselves . All the characters were well cast , to some extent interesting in and of themselves , and generally quite likable . ( Any apparent ruthless ambition displayed tended to be tempered by a corresponding good natured resilience . ) An entertaining , intelligently scripted , brilliantly directed and superbly acted film that I would thoroughly recommend .
1 I had been looking forward to How to Lose Friends & Alienate People for months , particularly due to the fact that Kirsten Dunst and Simon Pegg were starring . Simon Pegg is a comedic genius and Kirsten Dunst has always been a favorite actress of mine . How to Lose Friends & Alienate People hit the spot ! Of course not perfect , but very enjoyable and funny . How to Lose Friends & Alienate People follows the life of Sidney Young , a smalltime , bumbling , British celebrity journalist , who is hired by an upscale magazine in New York City . In spectacular fashion Sidney enters high society and burns bridges with bosses , peers and superstars . After disrupting one black - tie event by allowing a wild pig to run rampant , Sidney catches the attention of Clayton Harding , editor of Sharp , and accepts a job with the magazine in New York City . Clayton warns Sidney that he 'd better impress and charm everyone he can , if he wants to succeed . Instead , Sidney instantly insults and annoys fellow writer Alison Olsen ( Kirsten Dunst ) . He dares to target the star clients of power publicist Eleanor Johnson ( Gillian Anderson ) . He also upsets his direct boss Lawrence Maddox ( Danny Huston ) . Sidney finds creative ways to annoy nearly everyone . His saving grace , a rising starlet Sophie Maes ( Megan Fox ) who develops an odd affection for him . In time , Allison 's friendship might be the only thing saving Sydney from his downward spiraling career . The storyline is very interesting and the acting was top notch with what the actors were given . Simon Pegg is still hilarious as ever ! He makes Sydney bumbling , obnoxious , and annoying as real as it gets , but later in time making Sydney not just likable , but also a real character who you root for in the end . Kirsten Dunst and Jeff Bridges were brilliant ! Kirsten had some very wonderful acting and hilarious scenes , and Jeff Bridges is just Jeff f*cking Bridges ! How can you not like him ? ! He makes Clayton a very humorous character with some wit and overall you just love the guy . Gillian Anderson , Megan Fox , and Danny Huston were great as the supporting cast . Each had their own personality that were overall pretty unlikable , but that 's what just made the film work . One thing I did n't enjoy was how one dimensional some of the characters were . I understand that most were the supporting cast , but some of the cast was underused and could 've given the film some more spice to it . How to Lose Friends & Alienate People will never be on anyone 's top 10 films ever , or even top 10 comedies ever , but it has a very high entertainment level and some scenes may even charm you as well . How to Lose Friends & Alienate People is definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the year ! 8/10
1 I had fun watching this movie , mainly due to Simon Pegg , who has quickly become a solid box office draw for comedy films.<br /><br />He is hired from his dead end London publishing job by big shot NYC media mogul Jeff Bridges , as a writer , for one of his celebrity rags.<br /><br />After paying his dues , he makes it into the higher echelons of celebrity writing hackdom ( the " seventh room " ) , where he gets to be a minor celebrity himself . The storyline is very funny , and Gillian Anderson puts in an impressive supporting role as a cutthroat publicity agent.<br /><br />Along the way to success , he finds the true meaning of love , etc.<br /><br />The formulaic plot aside , the movie was very funny , mainly due to Simon Pegg , Jeff Bridges , and Gillian Anderson . Kirsten Dunst was good as the love interest . The rest of the supporting cast did its job well.<br /><br />This was a good comedy & well worth checking out at the theaters .
1 Oh dear we do n't like it when our super - hero love interest develops a brain do we?<br /><br />Something has happened to people , they have lost the ability to enjoy , a simple feel - good , love story / comedy ? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny , sexy and real . I laughed out loud ooh at least five times and I 'm not ashamed to say had a tear in my eye a couple of times too . The cast , acting and script is great , I watch a lot of films right across the board and I have n't seen one in this genre that has been as successful . Those who disagree please tell me where I can find some ! I 'm sure the book is good too but I think you have to judge it on its own merits .
1 Amazing performance from Simon Pegg who just gets better and better with every role . As usual he plays the part of a very cringy character who makes you want to hide behind your cushion in embarrassment for him sometimes , but that s what Pegg is all about.<br /><br />The laughs were regular and eye watering and everyone of them aimed at Penn . The movie was very cleverly put together where every character plays a very sophisticated and serious part with Penn being the only humour involved which is a huge credit to the Director Robert Weide.<br /><br />And I ca nt let this one go without a quick round of applause to Gilliam Anderson who shone throughout . Highly recommended to all .
1 Pegg has had a few hits in the past few years , starting with " Shaun Of The Dead " in 2004 , movie on to " Hot Fuzz 2007 " , early 2008 he came out with " Run Fat Boy Run " and now comes this , " How To Lose Friends And Alienate People " which is in many ways one of my favourite comedy 's of the year.<br /><br />The film is about Sidney Yound , a man who writes a failing magazine who makes fun of celebrity 's mostly because he is not one of them . Anyway , one of the most successful magazine owners ( Played By Jeff Bridges ) invites him ( Out of nostalgia ) to work at his magazine . Sidney is of course excited and moves to America , there he meets a girl currently writing a book , and hilarity ensues.<br /><br />This film is great and I hope more come out like it in the near future . Pegg has once again given people everywhere another good film and I ca nt wait to the see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy " Paul " . I Rate this film 81 % .
1 Romantic comedy is not the correct way to describe " How to lose friends & alienate people " . The underlying romance in the plot is , for the most part , displaced by a far more interesting " rags to riches " tale . Although the central line of the story is somewhat rushed passed , in several screen shots , it does have a sense of ; getting the " nitty gritty " out of the way , focusing on those key relationships which make " office politics " and using those almost irrelevant scenes , used purely for comic effect . Yet it works so well , especially with Pegg in the front seat . The film is ultimately very clever , playing well on the trans - Atlantic relationship Pegg shares with his co - stars and merging the cross between the high and low -life society quite well and quite refreshingly in a storyline that despite predictability is somewhat of a unique journey . The different characters in the film are presented well and casting is definitely a plus point on the film . Both the " trading places " relationship between Pegg and Huston and the " love , hate " relationship between Pegg and Dunst do work so well in a story that is , for want of a better word , charming . Even Fox , whose main asset is of course sex appeal , shocks with what turns out to be quite a dark character and acts that " bimbo " role all to well . Its one of these films where every little detail does pay tribute to a great piece of work . From transsexual strippers to an amazing soundtrack it all meshes nicely into what can only be described as clever comedy .
1 Well here comes another , well , romantic comedy ... but unlike all others movies of this genre , this is by far the best I have seen in a long while .. <br /><br />I'll admit , at first I wanted to watch this movie because of Megan Fox , and a little because of Simon Pegg ... <br /><br />First of all , if you have watched a decent amount of movies , you will know that Sidney and Alison would be together at the and of the movie , one way or another ... but from the beginning to the end of the movie you wo n't know how ... <br /><br />Okay , now this movie is just made for Simon Pegg . I ca n't see any other actor in the role of Sidney , and I 'm sure this would be a very weaker movie if not for Pegg 's great performance.<br /><br />There is a number of great gags and jokes in this movie that kept me laughing really hard , courtesy of Simon Pegg 's character Sidney ... but I think everyone in this movie is good . For example , Kirsten Dunst is really solid in this movie ( I usually do n't think of her as any more than an average actress , but she was really good in this one ) , then there 's Jeff Bridges , there 's Gillian Anderson , and of course Megan Fox who plays spoiled bitchy star Sophie Maes ... great role for her ... <br /><br />All in all , while I usually do n't agree with ratings her on IMDb , this time I would completely agree with them ... <br /><br />Go and see this movie , it is really light - hearted and positive , and I recommend it deeply ... My rating 7 out of 10 ... well 7.5 actually ...
1 ' How to Lose Friends and Alienate People ' is an entertaining , if loose , adaptation of Toby Young 's memoir of the same name . It 's also a great title for helping to fill up the line requirement in IMDb reviews ! The basic gist is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatised , but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly Hollywoodised . Simon Pegg , despite playing an essentially irritating person , is his usual likable and funny self and pretty much carries the film . Strange to think only a few years ago he was just a TV sitcom guy and now he 's rubbing shoulders with Hollywood names . There 's a good supporting cast and it 's an amusing , easy watch - kind of a male ' Ugly Betty ' , but funnier .
1 How to lose friends and Alienate people came out in 2008 . It bombed at U.S. Box offices . It 's an absolutely hilarious film with a great cast . Simon Pegg is great playing Sidney Young , who wrote the book " How to lose friends and Alienate people . I know it 's not a true story . The only way I know that is because Sidney wants to go out with an actress named Sophie Maes . Sophie Maes does n't exist , but other than that , the film could be real . How to lose friends and Alienate people is probably the funniest film of 2008 , and I think you definitely should see it . As I said earlier , the film has a fantastic cast including : Kirsten Dunst(Spider - Man , The Virgin Suicides ) Danny Huston(The Number 23 , 30 days of night ) Gillian Anderson(The X - Files ) Megan Fox(Transformers , Confessions of a teenage drama Queen ) Jeff Bridges(The Big Lebowski , The Vanishing ) Overall , How to lose friends and Alienate people is hilarious . I think Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst do work well together , and I think you should see it . Though there is some odd nudity including Trans - sexuals , it 's a hilarious and awesome comedy . One of Simon Pegg 's best.<br /><br />The Plot : Sidney Young , a journalist from England , travels down to New York to work at Sharp magazines . While there , he meets an actress named Sophie Maes and tries to sleep with her before his boss does .
1 Sidney Young ( Pegg ) moves from England to New York to work for the popular magazine Sharpe 's in a hope to live his dream lifestyle but struggles to make a lasting impression.<br /><br />Based on Toby Young 's book about survival in American business , this comedy drama received mixed views from critiques . Labelled as inconsistently funny but with charm by the actors , how to lose friends seemed as a run of the mill fish out of the pond make fun at another culture comedy , but it isn't.<br /><br />This 2008 picture works on account of its actors and the simple yet sharp story . We start off in the past , then in the present and are working our way forwards to see how Young made his mark at one of America 's top magazines.<br /><br />Pegg ( Hot Fuzz ) is too likable for words . Whether it 's hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing his sidekick the nature of the law the English actor brings a charm and light heartedness to every scene . Here , when the scripting is good but far from his own standards , he brings a great deal of energy to the picture and he alone is worth watching for . His antics with " Babe 3 " are unforgivable , simply breathtaking stuff as is his over exuberant dancing , but he pulls it off splendidly.<br /><br />Bridges and Anderson do well at portraying the stereotypical magazine bosses where Dunst fits in nicely to the confused love interest . Megan Fox , who stole Transformers , reminds everyone she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotype film star . The fact that her character Sophie Myles is starring in a picture about Mother Teresa is as laughable as her character 's antics in the pool . To emphasize the point there is a dog , and Pegg rounds that off in true Brit style comedy , with a great little twist.<br /><br />Though a British film there is an adaptation of American lifestyle for Young as he tries to fit in and we can see the different approaches to story telling . Young wants the down right dirty contrasted with the American professionalism . The inclusion of modern day tabloid stars will soon make this film dated but the concept of exploitation of film star 's gives this edge.<br /><br />Weide 's first picture is not perfect . There are lapses in concentration as the plot becomes too soapy with an awkward obvious twist and there are too many characters to be necessary . The physical comedy can also be overdone . As a side note , the bloopers on the DVD are some of the finest you will ever see , which are almost half an hour long.<br /><br />This comedy drama has Simon Pegg on shining form again and with the collective approach to story telling and sharp comedy , it is worth watching .
1 UK newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know Toby Young , the journalist on whose real - life experiences this movie is based . The key word here is " based " . How To Lose Friends is a fictitious romcom.<br /><br />Sidney Young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in New York , where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally Getting It Right and Making It . This involves him selling out , and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity . However , they are not overdone : the main substance remains a comedy which centres around Sidney 's misadventures . The script has its cake and eats it in that Sidney is a stupid , well - meaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart , moderately obnoxious skilled writer . This contradiction is never that much of an issue , because Simon Pegg ( as Sidney ) projects likability too well.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges underplays Sidney 's editor a little too effectively , and Kirsten Dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of Sidney 's affections And , with regard to Megan Fox ( who plays an airhead bimbo starlet ) , I can say only this : just say the word , Miss Fox , and I will leave my wife , sell all my belongings , and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort . Of course , given that I 'm a fat 56-year - old English accountant , you might not find my offer too enticing , but it 's there on the table anyway . Given how short her career has been so far , one might think it is a little too soon for Megan Fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become : however , she does it sweetly , with some skill , and extremely sexily . This girl will go far.<br /><br />There is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers - Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson from the UK , Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston from the US.<br /><br />There are several laugh - out - loud moments , and I smiled most of the way through . As ever , the F - word makes appearances when it really does n't need to , although at least a couple of these are very funny .
1 Weak start , solid middle , fantastic finish . That 's my impression of this film , anyway . I liked Simon Pegg in the two films I 've seen him in--- Hot Fuzz , and Shaun of the Dead . His role here , though , took a completely different turn . Shows his range as an actor , but nonetheless I really disliked th character as he was portrayed at the beginning.<br /><br />There 's a kind of humour I call " frustration comedy . " Its supposed " jokes " and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments . Much like the Bean character Rowan Atkinmson plays . There are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too . I do n't mean to bash them here , so will not.<br /><br />But do be warned that if you are like me , and you dislike smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots , Pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film . It DOES get better , however.<br /><br />I read somewhere that this is based on a true story . Hmmm . Maybe . The film 's story stopped being annoying , and became kind of a triumph of the " little guy " in the final third . I do n't need all films to be sugar and light--- but coincidentally , as this film got better , it also started to be more and more of a happy ending.<br /><br />It was also a pleasure to see an old favourite , Jeff Bridges , play a role so masterfully . I liked " Iron Man , " but was saddened by the fact that Bridges ' character was a villain . Purely personal taste , of course , as his acting in that was superb . Nonetheless , he was a marvel here as the Bigger Than Life man of vision , the publisher of Sharps . It was nice to see him in a role that I could actually enjoy.<br /><br />Overall then , I liked it ! I just wish I had come in 40 minutes late , and missed the beginning .
1 I am a huge fan of Simon Pegg and have watched plenty of his movies until now and none of them have ceased to make me laugh . Neither did How to lose friends and Alienate People.<br /><br />This movie is essentially about a man good as pissing people off . However , he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that might just make him famous . But in the end he ends up doing them , the culture of life.<br /><br />The movie is well toned with humor , romance , good acting and also a bit of a lap dance . Its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends .
1 This movie is about basically human relations , and the interaction between them . The main character is an old lady who at the twilight of her life starts a journey to her past , doing an analysis of how she lived her life . This journey is precipitated because of the sons economic crisis and his intentions to put her in a nursing home . It is a very honest look to some issues that we all ask ourselves at some point in life , and there is plenty of secondary ideas to discuss in this movie such as family legacy , real love , marriage or destiny . although this type of movie melodramas are nothing new , this one can be useful to watch it with family members to discuss some ideas . There is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very believable , but because of the time some characters are maybe not fully developed . I really recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon .
1 I saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages for it to be released here in Canada ( still only in limited release ) . It was worth the wait and then some . I am a very avid reader of Margaret Laurence and was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a film . I actually ended up liking the movie better than the novel . I liked that the character of Bram Shipley was a bit less harsh , and that there seemed to be more of a love story between Hagar and Bram , which made the scenes at the end of Bram 's life that much more moving . The loss seemed stronger . Hagar was not any more likable on film than in the book , but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in this role . She WAS Hagar through and through . Christine Horne was brilliant and has many more great things ahead I am sure . Her scenes with Cole Hauser were electrifying . I could go on and on , overall a 9 * out of 10 . Fantastic and ca n't wait for it to come out on DVD , a must own for my collection !
1 In Canadian director Kari Skogland 's film adaptation of the Margaret Laurence novel The Stone Angel Ellen Burstyn is Hagar Shipley , a proud and cantankerous woman approaching her nineties who wishes to remain independent until the very end , stubbornly refusing to be placed in a nursing home by her well - meaning son Marvin . Filmed in Manitoba , Canada and set in the fictional town of Manawaka , The Stone Angel is a straightforward and conventional interpretation of the book that has been required reading in Canadian high school English classes for almost half a century.<br /><br />The title of the film comes from the stone statue erected on Hagar 's mother 's grave which serves as a metaphor for Hagar 's inability to express emotion during her tumultuous lifetime . Burstyn brings vulnerability and humor to the role but is a bit too likable to fully realize the ego - driven , self - defeating character who managed to alienate her wealthy father , her well - meaning but alcoholic husband , and both of her sons . As she nears the end of her days , she reflects that " pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear . I was alone , never anything else , and never free , for I carried my chains within me , and they spread out from me and shackled all I touched".<br /><br />Confronting having to spend her last days in a nursing home , Hagar looks back at her life and looks at her failed relationships , her recollections shown in flashbacks without voice - over narration . The story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl . Chaperoned by her Aunt Dolly , she meets her future husband , the previously married Bram Shipley ( Cole / Wings Hauser ) , a poor farmer whose reputation in the town is sullied because of his association with the Native American population . The young Hagar is played by Christine Horne who is exceptional in her first feature role . Despite Hagar 's pleading , her relationship with Bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose refusal to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot . This is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of Manawaka , condemning the young couple to a life of poverty.<br /><br />Going through the motions of her marriage to Bram , Hagar withdraws from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town 's upper classes . When she produces two sons , Marvin ( Dylan Baker ) and John ( Kevin Zegers ) , she is unable to give them the love that they need . " Every joy I might have held in my man or any child of mine or even the plain light of morning " , she reflects , " all were forced to a standstill by some break of proper appearances  When did I ever speak the heart 's truth ? " Like the biblical Hagar who fled to the desert because she could not tolerate further affronts to her pride , Hagar leaves Manawaka to live in Ontario but eventually returns to the Shipley farm.<br /><br />As the scene shifts back to the present , Hagar runs away to an abandoned house near the ocean that she remembers from her childhood to escape from being placed in a nursing home by Marvin and his wife Doris ( Sheila McCarthy ) , Here she meets a young man named Leo ( Luke Kirby ) who takes an interest in her and compels her to look at and take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life . The Stone Angel pulls out all the emotional stops but never fully develops its characters to the point where I felt any stake in the story 's outcome , although the spirited performance by Ellen Page as John 's devoted but naive girlfriend and the moving final scenes bring a new energy to the film 's second half .
1 Any movie that shows federal PIGs ( Persons In Government ) to be the power - mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me.<br /><br />Alas , the script supervision and editing and even , at times , the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good moments.<br /><br />I saw the original way back when it was new and hated it , despised it , loathed it . Thought it was a terrible , irrational piece of junk.<br /><br />Now , though , I do n't remember why.<br /><br />I believe the two should not be compared or even connected.<br /><br />Consider them as two different movies.<br /><br />Rate them as two different movies.<br /><br />This " Vanishing Point " provides a rallying place , a banner for people who want to encourage individualism , who believe in human rights , who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is , especially the federal government.<br /><br />"The Voice " wears a cap bearing the state motto of New Hampshire : " Live Free or Die . " At one time it would have been the motto of most Americans.<br /><br />Despite its obvious flaws , " Vanishing Point " is a film to cheer .
1 To start off with , since this movie is a remake of a classic , the rating has to be lowered already . Since this version stars Viggo Mortensen in the lead role of Kowalski , it helps.<br /><br />Isn't this just like the United States government though , to terrorize one of its own citizens . Sounds like Jason Priestley 's character from the movie ! But it is the truth , the government would do anything possible to destroy a man 's life for trying to get home to his wife . A wife , who is in labor no less , and may not make it.<br /><br />"There was a time in this country that the police would escort a man to his pregnant wife . " The words of the Disc Jockey.<br /><br />There were some great shots of scenery in this film , and great car chases and a lot of spirituality . After much consideration , I gave this film a 7 .
1 I have to say , I loved Vanishing Point . I 've seen the original , and this is a pretty good remake of it . Even though it did n't follow the original storyline ( that 's why I gave it 8 out of 10 ) , it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline.<br /><br />As for the car , well the DJ 's comment at the end about the Challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable ( And if you look , the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145 - 150 ) , but even though I did n't see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine , the original storyline had a supercharged Hemi , so it 's possible . For those of you who say aerodynamics would n't allow it , the normally aspirated Chrysler 300C of today can go 168 mph , and if you look at that thing , going on a highway with it it 's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph . Plus , in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the Challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic .
1 SPOILERS THROUGH : < br /><br />I really am in the minority on this one but I liked this movie . It 's not a classic but it 's definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride . I definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating.<br /><br />Perhaps the reason I liked it is because I have n't seen the original . Something tells me that with a movie like this it 's strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus , have little to compare it to . This was not a masterpiece but I did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original.<br /><br />There were a few things I liked about it . One was the casting of Kowalkski . Viggo Mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role . Since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders , he really needed to be excellent and he was . This was a great role for him.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that it 's made for television . I had no idea this was the case when watching it . It sure seemed like a major motion picture and I would never have guessed this was not a big screen release.<br /><br />I also found the story to be very absorbing . I 'm not one for action movies but I got sucked into this . Plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama , mysticism , a love story , quirky people every which way you turned . ( I did n't even recognize Priestly . ) And it was touching . This was not a great movie but it is watchable.<br /><br />And then there 's the ending . It packs a strong punch and if one 's been involved in the story up to that point , it 's very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end . I am not sure how I feel about the ending . The implication was that Kowalkski survived and though I 'm highly skeptical of HOW that would be possible , it is a movie and realism is n't an ingredient that 's always in the mix when making a movie.<br /><br />So I 'd have to say I found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way , which I do n't usually like but for some reason , is almost forgivable in this movie . Admittedly , a lot of things were just props for the plot(could the villains have been anymore stereotypical ? ) But the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well . However , having said that , I will admit I can understand why someone who 's a major fan of the original would hate this version because , though I have not seen the original , I have seen many original movies I loved being remade with terrible results . ( My big dislike is actually sequels . ) But I can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality.<br /><br />People have compared this to Smoky and the Bandit . How about a road version of " Legends Of The Fall " meets " Thelma and Louese " as well ? I sure felt touches of both films(both of which I 'm a fan of . ) I do not think however , that this was a great film . It was better then average to me but far from great . But it was an absorbing , adrenalin fueled , touching movie with excellent casting of the main character . My vote is 7 of 10 .
1 Sure , it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny , but at least the filmmakers did n't try . While most TV movies border on the brink of mediocrity , this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it . The cinematography was pretty good for a TV film , and Viggo Mortensen displays shades of Aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules . Most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy , but the scene with the mountain lion was intense . I was kind of annoyed by Jason Priestly 's role in the film as a rebellious shock - jock , but then again , it 's a TV MOVIE ! Despite all of the good things , the soundtrack was atrocious . However , it was nice to see Tucson , Arizona prominently featured in the film .
1 its not as good as the first movie , but its a good solid movie its has good car chase scenes , on the remake of this movie there a story for are hero to drive fast as his trying to rush to the side of his ailing wife , the ending is great just a good fair movie to watch in my opinion,<br /><br / >
1 Sure this was a remake of a 70 's film , but it had the suspense and action of a current film , say Breakdown . He 's running , desperate to be with his hospitalized wife , the police are the least concern . The chases were very good , the part with him being < br /><br />cornered at a rest stop was well done , the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger . This is better than Bullitt , a boring movie with what , a muscle car chase that was filmed badly ? Vigo 's character knew what he had to do to escape Johnny Law , few movies had the effects - night vision , CB radio - okay I forgot the name of the movie , guy has 76'Caddy souped up , toys with guy he upset . The ending is great , you ca n't tell if he fakes his suicide or not , a very good did - he - make - it - or - not .
1 I really liked this version of ' Vanishing Point ' as opposed to the 1971 version . I found the 1971 version quite boring . If I can get up in the middle of a movie a few times(as I did with the 1971 version ) than to me , it is not all that great . Of course , this could be due to the fact that I was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out . However , I have seen many remakes , where I have liked the original and older one better . I found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version . In my opinion , I felt the 1997 version had more excitement and was n't so " blase".(Boring )
1 This is definitely an appropriate update for the original , except that " party on the left is now party on the right . " Like the original , this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty . It is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an over - zealous , and over - powerful federal government . Kowalski serves as a metaphor for Waco and Ruby Ridge , where the US government , with the cooperation of the mainstream media , threw around words like " white supremacist " and " right wing extremists as well as trumped - up drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its ' citizens rights , with the willing acquiescence of the general populace . That message is so non - PC , I am stunned that this film could be made - at least not without bringing the Federal government via the IRS down on the makers like they did to Juanita Broderick , Katherine Prudhomme , the Western Journalism Center , and countless others who dared to speak out . " Live Free or Die " is the motto on Jason Priestly 's hat as he brilliantly portrays " the voice , " and that sums up the dangerous ( to some ) message of this film.<br /><br / >
1 This film was Excellent , I thought that the original one was quiet mediocre . This one however got all the ingredients , a factory 1970 Hemi Challenger with 4 speed transmission that really shows that Mother Mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars ! I was in Chrysler heaven every time Kowalski floored that big block Hemi , and he sure did that a lot :)
1 Brilliant use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies . The voyeuristic element during the scenes ( Santa & Pedro summarize society 's behavior peering through a telescope ) is unique ( and obviously Jean - Luc Godard , although he was subtle , stole this theme in his film " Pierrot le - fou " ) . Highly recommended !
1 Shawshank , Godfather , Pulp Fiction ... all good films . Great films . But nothing , and I mean nothing lives up to the greatest Christmas movie of all , Santa Claus.<br /><br />The film is so great and has so many messages , I cried while watching it . Seriously , this is one of those movies you need to watch 10 times . When we see Pitch get told he will have to eat ice cream , we see the sadness in his eyes , and we feel the deep sorrow , and then we wonder ... what is so bad about this ice cream ? Is it implying that we as humans are treating ice cream as good when all it does is make us evil ? Think movie makes you think.<br /><br />This movie has the best rendition of Santa Claus ever . Unlike other Santas , he is a normal person . We see him imprisoning children and spying on kids dreams , and we wonder ; is the Santa we believe in really that good ? Also , this Santa actually mentions Christ , the whole meaning behind Christmas.<br /><br />You owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece . We should just stop making movies and air nothing but this epic 24/7 . Whether it 's Christmas or not , this movie gets a 500/10 . Whoever says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool .
1 My mother took me to see this film as a child and I long to see it every year as I do all of my other Christmas favorites . What I remember most was the silly Devil and Santa looking through his telescope . I waited and looked through the T.V. Guide each year after that to see when it would be shown . I would usually find it playing on a Saturday afternoon . I only found the movie in English which took something special away from the film and have longed to find a copy of it in Spanish . I hold this film dear to my heart and have never suffered from nightmares as others might suggest . Yes , it is a different film about Santa Claus and that is what makes it special and unique . I ca n't wait to get a copy of this film and watch it with my children as I explain to them my favorite parts and memories ! !
1 There are some things I will never understand ; why underwear comes in packs of threes when clearly that s not enough is an example . Similarly , I will never understand this film , and that is brilliant . If you approach this film expecting an actual movie , you might as well be approaching Satan expecting a hug ; although that may well be possible if you greet this film 's Satanic figures . Take Pitch for instance ; the most ineffectual , camp , unhellish portrayal of a devil since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create a ten foot Satan costume from red body paint and horns covered with condoms . However , it does create some of the most hilarious moments of any film ever . Seriously , this is no understatement . The same can be applied to every other character , bar the little girl who acts so sickly innocent she 's probably overcompensating for some serious crime she 's part of . Then again , if Santa 's inter - space recon station is real , there is no chance she could have avoided him this long . Put simply , if you have n't seen this movie , you can not consider yourself a serious buff . The achingly funny characterisation , acting , concept , and almost - under - the - radar racism makes this a must see above any film to date ( if you 're after pure laughter that is ) .
1 I saw this movie when Mystery Science Theater ran it in 1993 . It is the worst thing I 've ever seen . So bad in fact , that by sheer freakiness , this movie must get a ten rating because it has to be seen to be believed . < br /><br />Whoever wrote this script with children in mind should be beaten . I mean , really , the Devil vs. Santa ? Visions of Hell ? Creepy laughing wind - up reindeer ? Forced Child labor with racial stereotypes ? It ai n't Sesame Street , that 's for sure . As Crow exclaims during the MST3 K showing , " This is good ol' fashioned nightmare fuel ! " < br /><br />There 's plenty of weird innuendo and screwed up theology . Merlin ( presumably the Arthurian Merlin ) hangs out with Santa in his crazy castle in the clouds ( i.e. Heaven ) . Santa talks about baby Jesus and sends letters to " Mr. Stork " for children who ask for siblings . There are symbols around the castle that either look like pentagrams or RAF stars . < br /><br />My best friend and I have watch it every year since 1993 and we subject anybody we can hold down for 2 hours to watch it with us .
1 Perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing , albeit , completely corny , to adults . Not a bad film for a low - budget job . Children will be amazed with Santa 's workshop and the " magic " that enables him to enter homes through chimneys that appear too small , or homes that have no chimneys at all!<br /><br />Kids will thrill over the Santa 's success at thwarting the nasty devil named Pitch ( complete in classic red outfit with horns and tail ! ) . They will sympathize with the poor little girl who 's greatest wish is to have a little doll to love . And the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents . And what child does not know someone at school who are just like the nasty boys that are enlisted by Pitch to help capture Santa and ruin Christmas ? In the end , everyone , including the nasty boys , get just what they deserve for Christmas!<br /><br />The film will endear children to both Santa and the message of love he delivers to people throughout the world.<br /><br / >
1 Just get it . The DVD is cheap and easy to come by , the length is now standard and you 've gone long enough without it . ( When home video started , there were at LEAST three versions with parts missing .. ) Everything you 've read is true . There is no defending it , and no living without it . The color is lush and wonderful to look at , and the production values are pretty good for a Saturday afternoon kiddie epic . But no question .. the whole Santa Vs . Satan angle is so jaw dropping STRANGE it made the movie a hit at the time and a cult fave once home video really got underway . How good / bad / strange/ is it ? I only saw the TRAILER as a kid , and remembered IT for nearly 30 years .. including Murray 's over the top voice over .. I told my older sister , and she called me a liar and could not believe it was POSSIBLE for ANYONE to make a movie where Santa vs . Satan .. Add to it stuff like Santa asking for the Virgin Mary 's blessing before setting off on Christmas eve , kids wanting to capture him and make him their SLAVE .. and an international kiddie sweat shop .. and it probably comes close to a lot of nightmares kids had in the 60 's .. Like others here , I watch the thing every holiday season now . ( My version of choice is The Mystery Science Theatre 3000 edition ) . But any old way you choose it , the movie is a demented masterpiece and a total must ( along with Brianiac , by the way .. ).It never fails to make me laugh . Better , I think , then SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS . Parts of it can still make you cringe or just creep you out.(How many parents do YOU know go out for cocktails on Christmas Eve ? " If you get bored , just go downstairs and play the piano . " DANG .. ) Freaky , boring , disturbing , funny , childish , strange .. hey , what more can you want ?
1 I saw this movie when I was a little girl . And I have enjoyed it every time . Sure the graphics are a little cheesy , compared to now , but back in the 70 's it was great . I saw it in the original Spanish version only and thought it was wonderful . That was how I remember my Christmases were with my family - magical . Santa Claus was amazing and I could n't wait for him to come back each year.<br /><br />If you have a child / children and speak Spanish , bring them up watching this old fashioned version of " Santa Claus " . It 's a different version than we are used to today , but who says there is one way?<br /><br />It 's a fun movie to watch . It teaches children good vs. bad . I do n't know how the English subtitled version is or if there is an English one of this , but the Spanish is the best . Enjoy and Happy Holidays ! Feliz Navidad !
1 I was a bit scared to watch this movie due to its rates . But living in Italy titles like this never ever come across and I love step so much that I decided to give it try . And how surprised I was ! The story is different from any other dance - movie I 've seen lately , with a deeper meaning than just " winning " . It 's touching and well written and well directed . Raya is such a strong character , I love the fact that she never doubts herself , she 's so mature and focused and AWARE of her TALENT ( and what talent Rutina Wesley has , my jaw dropped in the final dance scene ) . The way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is , honestly , inspiring . Also , the fact that she 's not the typical super - hot chick ( see Jessica Alba , Briana Evigan , Jenna Dewan , Zoe Seldana ... ) makes her really appealing and real . Seriously , why is this movie rated so low ? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it 's a good work . Really good actually . I even cried at the end of the movie . And the dancing routines are just sick .
1 I must give How She Move a near - perfect rating because the content is truly great . As a previous reviewer commented , I have no idea how this film has found itself in IMDBs bottom 100 list ! That 's absolutely ridiculous ! Other films -- particular those that share the dance theme -- can't hold a candle to this one in terms of its combination of top - notch , believable acting , and amazing dance routines.<br /><br />From start to finish the underlying story ( this is not just about winning a competition ) is very easy to delve into , and surprisingly realistic . None of the main characters in this are 2-dimensional by any means and , by the end of the film , it 's very easy to feel emotionally invested in them . ( And , even if you 're not the crying type , you might get a little weepy - eyed before the credits roll . ) < br /><br />I definitely recommend this film to dance - lovers and , even more so , to those who can appreciate a poignant and well - acted storyline . How She Move is n't perfect of course ( what film is ? ) , but it 's definitely a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a half - baked plot and/or characters who lack substance . The actors and settings in this film make for a very realistic ride that is equally enthralling thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers !
1 I noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and I too did n't have high hopes for it . I figured it was another " You Got Served " type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting . I was at the theater and deciding between this and Meet the Spartans and picked this . To my surprise the acting was n't bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good . The fact that it has a lower rating than You Got Served is absolutely ridiculous . Instead of listening to the garbage posted on here I recommend going to see a matinée showing of this movie so you do n't spend too much . I think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it . When it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones . Go see the movie and judge for yourself . Hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on DVD and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released.<br /><br />edit The movie is now moving closer to its correct rating . Over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9 , a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1 .
1 Well , if you are open - minded enough to have liked Barber Shop , then you will like this Canadian film.<br /><br />If your mind is as closed - minded as Fort Knox , then you will give it the current score that it has : 2.5.<br /><br />This is a film for anybody prepared to watch films from outside of their own racial grounds . It is engaging , it is true to life , on two or three occasions you lose the connections between the scenes , but many times , especially towards the end , you find yourself having a tear or two in your eyes and this simply because it so often mirrors what life can be like.<br /><br />I like it and recommend it to anyone open minded beyond the traditional American film .
1 I watch them all.<br /><br />It 's not better than the amazing ones ( _ Strictly Ballroom _ , _ Shall we dance ? _ ( Japanese version ) , but it 's completely respectable and pleasingly different in parts.<br /><br />I am an English teacher and I find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting . For example : the " name should scream do n't watch . ' How she move . ' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar ? " < br /><br />There is nothing inherently incorrect about Caribbean English grammar . It 's just not Canadian standard English grammar . Comments about the dialogue seem off to me . I put on the subtitles because I 'm a Canadian standard English speaker , so I just AUTOMATICALLY assumed that I would have trouble understanding all of it . It was n't all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies I have seen were so American.<br /><br />I loved that this movie was set in Toronto and , in fact , wish it was even more clearly set there . I loved that the heroine was so atypically cast . I enjoyed the stepping routines . I liked the driven Mum character . I felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance movies.<br /><br />In summary , if you tend to like dance movies , then this is a decent one . If you have superiority issues about the grammar of the English standard you grew up speaking , your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie .
1 This film is shockingly underrated on IMDb . Like so many films , this is n't Shawshank . But it 's a reasonably good , if predictable , dance competition / personal growth film . If you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 Mile for a female step dancer , than I think you 'll like it.<br /><br />Judging from the IMDb ratings , my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250 , and was " vote bombed " with many 1s , as happens to so many films that are n't about the mob , do n't have special effects , or include non - white or non - straight characters.<br /><br />It 's an American film , but it 's not a US film . Set mostly in Toronto the cues are subtle , and some audiences may think it 's set entirely in the US just because the final competition is in the border city of Detroit.<br /><br />I liked the music . I liked the dance ( but not convinced it 's worth $ 50,000 ... but what do I know ) . The characters were easy on the eyes.<br /><br />I do agree the title sucks . I do n't remember anyone in the film saying those words , and it should have an " s " . ( No , it 's not a foreign language).<br /><br />There 's not a lot to hate about this film ( and let 's be honest , a vote of 1 means you hated it ) so I can only assume that it 's an expression of hate for the kind of people in it , and that 's sad .
1 Beforehand Notification : I 'm sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here , but when I saw the preview for this movie , I was thinking " Finally ! " I have yet to see one movie about popular African - influenced dance ( be it popular hip hop moves , breaking , or stepping ) where the main character was a Black woman . I 've seen an excessive amount of movies where a non - Black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it ( Breakin , Breakin 2 , Save the Last Dance , Step Up ) , but the Black women in the film are almost nonexistent . That always bothered me considering so much of hip hop , African - influenced dance , and breaking was with Blacks and Latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it was n't always men who performed it , so I felt this movie has been a long time coming . However , the race does not make the film , so I also wanted it to carry a believable plot ; the dancing be entertaining ; and interesting to watch.<br /><br />Pros : I really enjoyed this film bringing Jamaican culture . I ca n't recall ever seeing a popular , mainstream film where all the main characters were Jamaican ; had believable accents ; and were n't stereotypical with the beanies . The steppers , family , friends , and even the " thugs " were all really intelligent , realistic people who were trying to love , live , and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive . Even when the audience was made aware that the main character 's sister chose an alternate lifestyle , it still did n't make the plot stereotypical . I was satisfied with the way it was portrayed . I LOVED the stepping ; the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers ; the trials that the main character 's parents were going through ; and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with Crabs in a Barrel . I respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time , and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world . They were all just as excellent as the fellas . I do n't see that in too many movies nowadays , at least not those that would be considered Black films.<br /><br />Cons : I 'm not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this , but I question whether they 've been to real step shows . Whenever the steppers got ready to perform , some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers ' hand / feet beats . At a real step show , there is zero need for music , other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups . And then when hip hop songs were played , sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers ' hands and feet . It was awkward . I was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus " Stomp the Yard " ( another great stepping movie ) because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys ( in " Stomp the Yard , " Meagan Good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the ( Deltas ? ) let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately ) . Even when there were very small scenes , the ladies tore it up , especially in the auto shop , and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music . I know soundtracks have to be sold , but the movie folks could 've played the music in other parts of the film.<br /><br />I'm not a Keyshia Cole fan , so every time I saw her , all I kept thinking was " Is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks ? " She looked uncomfortable on screen to me . I thought they should 've used a host like Free or Rocsi instead . Deray Davis was funny as usual though . Also , I groaned when I found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto , like stepping could n't possibly happen anywhere else . Hollywood , as usual . However , only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers , which mainstream movies tend to do.<br /><br />I would 've given this movie five stars , but the music playing killed it for me . I definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs .
1 Saw this movie twice at community screenings and really loved it . I work in the Jane Finch community and feel the film really captured some of the essence and flavour of the community - grit , determination , exuberance , creativity , in your faceness with a dose of desperation . The writing , dialogue and acting is solid and I really found myself drawn into the story of the young woman Raya as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process . Great dance sequences and it is not only the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence as well . All the characters are multi dimensional - none wholly good or bad and the women characters are admirably strong . This is a film that has a strong beating heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth , hip hop and communities like Jane Finch .
1 This is a more interesting than usual porn movie , because it is a fantasy adventure . The production values are high and the acting is(believe it or not ) pretty good , especially Jenna Jameson . It`s also in widescreen which helps , it gives a feeling of a real motion picture and NOT a porn movie . But , of course it is a porn and a really good one with nice costumes , fine atmosphere and scenery . And by the way , the sex IS hot.<br /><br />Watch out for this one ...
1 this is really films outside ( not in a motel room ) . With real costumes ( not only strings and swimsuits ) . You have to see this movie . it 's the only porn movie I know that is worth watching between the sex scenes.<br /><br />Bon Cinema < br /><br />Laurent
1 Before watching this movie I thought this movie will be great as Flashpoint because before watching this movie Flashpoint was the last Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong movie I previously watched . As far as sexual scenes are concerned I was disappointed , I thought sexual scenes of Dreamquest will be great as Flashpoint sexual scenes but I was disappointed . Except Asia Carrera 's sexual scene , any sexual scene in this movie does n't make me feel great ( you know what I mean ) . The great Jenna Jameson does n't do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of . Felecia and Stephanie Swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned.<br /><br />Although its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor , this movie is very good . If typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies . Story , acting , direction , sets , makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great . The actors of this movie done really good acting , they all done a great job . Dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies .
1 If you 've ever wondered why they do n't make porn with a plot , watch Dream Quest . On the one hand , you have to give the Armstrong credit both for making the effort to capitalize on this idea and for using such a strong adult cast to put some name power behind it . On the other hand , it also quickly becomes apparent why most porns never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialog connecting sex scenes together . These people simply can not act ( and the story is , unfortunately , lame to a ridiculous degree).<br /><br />Still , I gave it a 7 because it was a nice try and there did n't seem to be much of an effort to cut corners . Also , I 'd like to see more attempts like this one . Maybe someday I will see the perfect combination of porn and plot .
1 Very nice action with an interwoven story which actually does n't suck . Interesting enough to merit watching instead of skipping past to get to the good parts . Having Jenna Jameson and Asia Carrere helps liven it up , too . Jenna in that sweater and those glasses is just astounding ! Worth picking up just to see her !
1 This one is quite a nice surprise . Cute little story of the heroine 's quest , very surprising metamorphosis of the four - eye prissy soon - to - be - spinster type into a raunchy DD - cup sex queen . < br /><br />Visually a sight for sore eyes , not only for two quite stunning actresses but also for ( most of ) the costumes and make - up of the actors . An unnecessary bit of cheapness came in some ridiculous castle imitation.<br /><br />Back to the positives : The movie is spiced with some unusually explicit camera - shots which you would not expect in a soft core . Loved that scene with the icicles , absolute classics potential . A slight minus only for ( very ) few odd scenes where bad acting by minor casts shortly suspended the suspension of disbelief . < br /><br />9/10 including an extra credit for the serious drooling effect .
1 Oh yeah ! Jenna Jameson did it again ! Yeah Baby ! This movie rocks . It was one of the 1st movies i saw of her . And i have to say i feel in love with her , she was great in this move.<br /><br />Her performance was outstanding and what i liked the most was the scenery and the wardrobe it was amazing you can tell that they put a lot into the movie the girls cloth were amazing.<br /><br />I hope this comment helps and u can buy the movie , the storyline is awesome is very unique and i 'm sure u are going to like it . Jenna amazed us once more and no wonder the movie won so many awards . Her make - up and wardrobe is very very sexy and the girls on girls scene is amazing . specially the one where she looks like an angel . It 's a must see and i hope u share my interests
1 Dreamquest is by far , the best porn movie I 've ever viewed . This is a must see ! ! ! And if you 're skeptical about your little ones watching it , just skip over the naughty scenes . Of course , this shortens the movie to a length of about 15 minutes . But even then it 's enjoyable . This movie is quite excellent and beats out almost any movie ... even Shawshank Redemption .
1 Dream Quest was a surprisingly good movie . There were some noticeable goofs , but that can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time . I did not feel any urge to fast forward during the movie and I found it pretty entertaining . It gets kind of silly at times , but overall I recommend it . They probably used up all the glitter in the nearby stores , and some of the costume designs were pretty good .
1 First things first ! This is n't an action movie although there is a lot of action in it ! I think you can compare it to American sports movies ! Where a team of very bad players succeed in the unthinkable , winning a game or tournament beyond expectation ! In this case it is n't about football or baseball , but Taekwondo ! In the beginning these street thugs seem to be good for nothing ! But soon we will find out that they do n't want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life ! It is nice to see them struggle and training ! I was surprised how funny this movie was ! From start till the end you will laugh your pants off ! The young korean actors are very convincing ! Go see this wonderful feel good movie !
1 Sure , the plot is n't Oldboy . It seems the only " great " movies these days are amazingly shocking or high - budget / hyped in some way.<br /><br />Spin Kick is a drama / comedy about a group of people who decide to pour their hearts into tae kwon do . Regardless of what you expect from this film , you 're guaranteed to feel moved by the work , pain , and expectations that the characters force themselves to experience . Though comedic at times , many moments and characters are rendered beautifully : there 's the old guard character who takes things too seriously , the hoodlum turned good - guy who just wants a second chance at life , the meek team - substitute who would die happy if he just won once in his life , and many other well - rounded characters with their own problems-- but most importantly , their own their hopes and dreams . While the plot and the goals of the movie are simple , these aspects of the movie merely highlight the development of the characters as they overcome their personal and inter - personal struggles . < br /><br />In short , this film will leave you feeling fresh , determined , and satisfied .
1 The movie never claims to be something spectacular like many films do . The films props itself as a fun and entertaining time . And that 's exactly what it was . It is the Korean version of a male Bring It On.<br /><br />From the get go you can feel for the rest of the film and how it will end but the enjoyment is not in the surprise twists nor is it the way the film is a carbon copy of another . Instead , the enjoyment is held in the journey of how the 2 remaining " thugs " came to be men in their own right . Therefore , the film is fun and entertaining.<br /><br />The camera work , specially the dolly moves were very well executed . The script , being a tad weak , was overly enjoyable in the fact that the characters were not 2 dimensional but they were full of life and desire . This film will not win any Oscars , nor any DVD blockbuster sales , but a fun watch and a fun experience .
1 A good Korean film about not just Taekwondo but what its takes to be good , like a thugs way of fighting can not beat a taekwondo guy in his sport because there are rules , just as there are to life and school and this film has undertones of this notion.<br /><br />The martial arts in the film is n't that good but it is passable and enjoyable . Friends who go on to achieve something they once would mock become stronger through the mind and heart . This film is n't meant to be taken too seriously as it does have slapstick , but it also carries a message.<br /><br />A good film again from Korea .
1 You know the story - a group of plucky no - hopers enter a competition they seemingly have no chance of winning - it 's a tale that has been done to death by Hollywood ( Bring It On , The Karate Kid , Escape to Victory , Best of the Best etc ) . Now Korea gives it a go with a Taekwondo team struggling for glory  and guess what  the result is predictable but ultimately satisfying.<br /><br />The fact that this movie does n't fall flat on its face is down to the talented young cast who really make you care about the characters , and this in turn keeps you watching to the end.<br /><br />Fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed  Taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of moves and acrobatics seen in most Kung Fu films ; the action is limited to ( albeit impressive ) kicking and the occasional punch . This does n't matter though , since it is the interaction of the characters and their fight to make something of themselves which makes this movie a success .
1 This animation TV series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works . Yes , this is biology but they will never tell it is.<br /><br />I truly think this is the best part of this stream of " educational cartoons " . I do remember you can find little books and a plastic body in several parts : skin , skeleton , and of course : organs.<br /><br / > In the same stream , you 'll find : " Il était une fois l'homme " which relate the human History from the big bang to the 20th century . There is : " Il était une fois l'espace " as well ( about the space and its exploration ) but that one is more a fiction than a description of the reality since it takes place in the future .
1 This is a cartoon series where most of the action takes place in the human body where the actors are vitamins , viruses , blood cells etc . I will not try to explain it in more details , you will simply have to see it for yourself : You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I remember watching this as a kid in the 80s ( with Swedish voices ) . I have talked with a few people who were also children in the 80s and they loved it also ! I must admit that the education - part of the episodes did n't get through to me at a conscious level but the whole idea of educating children while they have fun is wonderful . I have recently seen a few episodes ; there is a humour and heart in it that is hard to find in other children programs nowadays.<br /><br />5/5
1 We bought the DVD set of " Es war einmal das Leben " ( German ) / " Once Upon a Time ... Life " ( English ) for our bilingual kids because everyone loved the " Es war einmal der Mensch " ( German ) / " Once Upon a Time ... Man " ( English ) series ( us parents had seen it as kids ) and it has exceeded even high expectations ! The series is very well made , does not show its age , and our kids at various ages really like to watch it . At the same time , they learn things us parents did n't know until way , way later . The series covers everything to do with the human body from organs , all senses , blood , infection , antibodies , and much more in animated 20 - 25 min episodes . Topics some people may find " sensible " , such as digestion and reproduction are covered in a tasteful , discreet and child - friendly manner ( the reproduction episode starts coverage mainly where the baby starts growing ) , while still ( as typical ) informative and fun.<br /><br />Children are usually fascinated with how their bodies work and through the episodes gain an understanding of this in the context of their environment . The format of the episodes switches between the outside world ( a family with 2 children ) and the inside of the body . For example , in the episode covering infections , the boy cuts himself accidentally and the wound gets infected and the episode covers how the body reacts to this . Similarly , the episodes on the senses , e.g. hearing , seeing , link what happens inside the body to the context of the outside world and the episode on respiration and circulation of oxygen in the blood covers the complete lifecycle including ( briefly ) where the oxygen comes from ( plants).<br /><br />This is one of the best ever children 's programs - I would say it 's a must see for every family with kids !
1 This TV - series was one of the ones I loved when I was a kid . Even though I see it now through the pink - shaded glasses of nostalgia , I can still tell it was a quality show , very educational but still funny . I have not seen the original French version , only the Swedish . I have no idea how good the dubbing was , it was too long ago to remember.<br /><br />The premise of the show was to show you how the body works . I swear , school still has n't taught me half of what I know from this show . It also tied in other things , like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and do n't exercise , with nice examples within the body . Who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you ? :D The cartoon looked nice , very kids friendly of course , but done with care . Cells , viruses , electric signals in the brain , antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures , looking pretty much how you 'd expect what they should look like in the animated body.<br /><br />This , and the series about history(especially the environmentally scary finale ) were key parts of my childhood . I 'm so happy I found them here .
1 This was one of my favorite series when I was a kid . The Swedish broadcasting company decided to broadcast it once again a couple of summers ago when I had just finished my first semester of medical school . I was surprised to see the depth in which the organs was explained . Sure , some things are simplified but most of it was correct ( even though it was made 22 years ago ! ) and quite understandable . I would suggest that all soon - to - be medical student should watch it . It is a very good way to learn some of the basic medical words for example . Now I 'm in my 7th semester and I think I 'll watch the series once again as soon as I 've bought the DVD - box :-)
1 My name is Domino Harvery . { EDIT * dizzying * CHOP } My -- my -- my name is Domino Harvey . { CUT , CHOP } My name is Domino Harvey . { EDIT . CUT . Playback}<br /><br />Never have I seen a director take so much flack for his style before . By now it is evident that most people do not appreciate Tony Scott 's choppy , flashy , dizzying editing technique . If I have to choose between loving it and hating it , I 'd say I love it . It was borderline distracting at times , but the end result was pretty good and it 's nice to see a director with a creative edge to his style and some originality ( even if it borrows heavily from MTV videos).<br /><br />This stylistic edge manifests itself as Keira Knightley plays the role of cocky badass bounty hunter Domino Harvey and even her dialogue seems strangely choppy . Otherwise she plays her poorly because I pretty much hated her character and did not sympathize one bit with her , no matter how much she suffered . We follow Domino through her life as she joins up with fellow bounty hunters Mickey Rourke , Rizwan Abbasi and Edgar Ramirez . The crew become tangled up in the FBI and suddenly has a reality show contract under Christopher Walken 's TV production company ( what is Christopher Walken doing in every film , by the way ? ) . I guess that is a clever film technique , because now Tony Scott is free to use as much flashy MTV / Reality Show editing footage as he likes . It becomes a pastiche of MTV culture at this point.<br /><br />It followes then that the story is told at an amazingly rapid - fire pace , with lots of raunchy strong language and gun violence . There are some funny jokes ; it 's all very modern and surreal at the same time . It 's a mess , but it 's a rather enjoyable mess . It is ultimately flawed in so many ways ( the actors try too hard to make their characters " cool " , for one ) but it works . I give it a weak 7/10 which may seem generous when compared to the general consensus of movie - goers who graded this film  but I feel it had some good ideas and executed them well.<br /><br />7 out of 10
1 " Domino " has been widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and " sickening " photography . It 's detractors cite its superficiality and criticize its deployment of " style over substance " I could n't disagree more . I believe that " Domino " represents the absolute height of Tony Scott 's film - making career . < br /><br />After having created the dominant Hollywood action movie style throughout the late eighties and early nineties Tony Scott has moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of cinema . As early as " Crimson Tide " Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters- the claustrophobia and drama inherent in the conflict on board a nuclear submarine was embodied in the excellent use of long lenses combined with dutched - angle framing . This was then carried through to " Enemy Of The State " and " Spy Game " which visually represented the worlds of surveillance and espionage respectively . < br /><br / > " Man On Fire " was an extreme departure , a move into an expressionist more painterly aesthetic . Here Scott used an antiquated hand cranked camera and flash frames to express his character 's explosive rage . Although not entirely successful it introduced the techniques which were to find their full expression in " Domino" < br /><br />Couched in the framing device of an FBI interrogation " Domino " presents the life of the infamous bounty hunter via her narrated disjointed fragments of memory . She grasps at memories as we all do- in fragments , flashes and brief snatches . As Domino relays her story verbally Scott relays it visually illustrating not only the events which she describes but also the point of view which guides them . She does have " traces of mescaline " in her system but her individual vision is anyway Unusual -that of an woman who eschewed the life of luxury for bounty hunting . < br /><br />It is when Domino begins to relate the events which lead to her captivity that Scott really lets rip . Together with Cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry - Gregson Williams Scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary Americana . Gradually we begin to realize that unusual though she may be Domino is no more disjointed than the " 90210 " culture she has rejected . As she wades through this cultural melange Scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence which it destroys through the underprivileged children which the narrative introduces . Ultimately Scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have from this surreal trip . < br /><br />To criticize this movie for being overly stylized is akin to criticizing a Picasso or a Pollock for not representing that which is recognizably human . Like any great painting the meaning in " Domino " is in the surface and the surface is everything . < br /><br />I am not in any way associated with Scott Free but have always been and will continue to be a huge admirer of Tony Scott 's work
1 If you find yourself in need of an escape , something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world , Domino will satisfy that need . This is entertainment , after all ! The plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those movies ( like Usual Suspects ) where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out . I wondered about Domino Harvey herself , how her life became of interest to Hollywood . As for the acting , lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers . And any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well . Not once did I think of Kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate costume . And granted , Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rourke well and often , but here , despite the violence , he shows signs of being capable of caring for other people .
1 If you go to this movie expecting something it is n't , you will be disappointed , as with any movie . This movie contains what Hemmingway described as the " iceberg effect " . On the surface , its simply a cache of random movie clips smashed together to make a movie . If this would be written in a book , it would be a short story , because the action in the movie is very fast paced , and unless you actually try to catch it , the reasoning behind the plot ( along with some subtle foreshadowing ) can very well pass you by . Definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate . Experimental Cinematography barely describes this movie . The camera - work and post production add much to the overall flavour of the film , making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others ( something to be desired in American movies as of late ) . Although , at some parts it may get a little raunchy , gruesome and too heavy for some audiences , the movie never becomes completely unrealistic . The only aspect of the movie that I would write off as " needs improvement " is the soundtrack selection . No movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack , and although the soundtrack is quite fitting , the opening is a little too long , and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate ( heavy , grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this film a real trip ) . The flooding of imagery and dynamic ... color palettes adds another " artistic " aspect to it , also combined with the events that happen throughout the film , this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand . However , that also makes it much more of a desirable film to watch , and not one you 'll quickly get bored of . 8.5/10
1 I rented domino on a whim , not even knowing it was inspired by a true story , and even though it 's the least likely and true biopic you 'll probably see . i found it to be rather awesome.<br /><br />With Richard Kelly writing he crams together a mass of plots and narratives into 2 hours of pure entertainment . And once you 've seen it more than once you get it and appreciate it . < br /><br />Domino is a model turned bounty hunter who leaves the perfect Hollywood life to pursue a not so subtle or perfect career . It has an edgy acid trip style provided by director Tony Scott . And with fast paced music and editing , it provides the visual flare to keep your attention , with slick performances and unexpected comedy , the movie is well made and enjoyable and should have reached a wider audience . < br /><br />I suggest it to anyone who wants to think and be entertained at the same time for 2 hours .
1 I 'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum , and many of the reviews . I think Tony Scott made a good movie here . Yes , it is highly stylized , flashy and over the top , but it is very entertaining . I 'm glad at least Ebert and Roeper agrees with me :) < br /><br />This movie may not be for anyone , but if you like over - the - top , dark humor , cool action and dialog , you should see it . < br /><br />I've previously seen Scott 's Man on Fire , Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State - all good movies , but I like this one more . It 's like a roller - coaster ride , with great soundtrack selections , visual styles and in a time when all movies seem to be pg13 , it is nice to see that someone is n't afraid of showing nudity , gory violence , and have explicit dialog.<br /><br />It does n't hurt that Keira is super - hot , and even shows nipples in this one , either ...
1 I doubt much of this film is based on a true story . At the beginning it says based on a true story , sort of . I bet the only truth to it was there was an ex - model turned bounty hunter possibly named Domino.<br /><br />Anyways , it begins with Domino talking to Lucy Liu , who works for the FBI . Domino is being interrogated about what she knows about a theft of 10 million dollars . Through flashbacks , we see Domino as a child , then as a model , and how she became interested in being a bounty hunter . She basically tells 2 other bounty hunters off , Ed and Choco . They let her join the group . She 's tough , can use any kind of weapon , and will use her good looks if needed.<br /><br />They get involved with a scam that Clarmont , a bailsman , has going . Along the way , the group starts a reality TV show , and that 's where Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green become involved . They are sort of like hosts and must have been really desperate to appear in this.<br /><br />I thought the story was entertaining and it had some laughs . The editing did n't bother me . There 's also a lot of violence , mainly using guns , and blood . It could have been a little shorter.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT : Good enough to watch .
1 As soon as I knew Keira Knighteley being in this flick , I said " I have to watch this movie " . She 's the undisputed main character , Domino , a bounty hunter . Her " job " , as the " no action " scenes would teach us , reflects her rebel , violent attitude to life . I have to admit that it 's the very first time that I watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters ' hands . So , this stomped me a bit . Anyway , for all the John Woo 's fans , there are helicopters falling down , explosions , gunfire as if it would rain , and a lovely Keira that shoots with two machine guns , one per hand . The cast is absolutely brilliant . Going beyond Keira , which in this movie is a real tomboy , pretty much different from the lovely action figure we 're used to see , Mickey Rourke is back , with his usual slap - throwing face and his potent body . Christopher Walken makes his job pretty well , as a reality show producer.<br /><br />Let 's go to the contents : this movie has a journalistic shape . The talk show scene is " disgustingly " real . Anyone that watched that load of . . . you - know - what , can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations . As well as the producer , when Domino 's mom says that the reality that should show Domino 's life is " trash ; no offense " , he answers " I do n't take it like an offense " . This movie portrays a difficult life . Domino , coming from a world that did n't want her , Ed ( Mickey Rourke ) , a bounty hunter " not so bounty " , Choco ( the third guy of the band ) , which family is ( using Ed 's words ) , " the correctional institutes he 's been " , and Alf , the driver / bomber coming from Afghanistan during the Russian occupation . This bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born " without the shirt " ; unlucky , violent , and with nothing to lose , excepts their ( as they would consider ) miserable lives . The intro of the movie says that it is " inspired by true story . . . more or less " , so I could n't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true . Anyway , going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons ( which could have been " added " to make the film easier to see , and be classified as an action movie ) , the characters ' story is too realistic to be " edulcorated " . < br /><br />The interaction between the characters is various , well studied , and definitely not boring . What has n't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist ( Lucy Liu , sober as never in her acting career ) . It represents only the reason by which Domino starts telling her story ( and that 's a story ) . Probably , the only " con " , in a movie with a lot of " pros " . < br /><br />All in all : This is n't " SWAT " . The characters are crafted ; they have an identity , a shape . They have a name and a surname ( not just " Gamble " and " Street " ) . It 's the case to say , it 's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet .
1 Domino is a great movie . It 's about a young woman names Domino Harvey ( Kiera Knightley ) who becomes a bounty - hunter because of her boredom with her lifestyle . She joins with two fellow hunters ( Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez ) and the adventures begin . The script is good . Very down - to - earth and realistic with the tone of the film . The only problem I had with this movie is that it concentrates on the different things that they do , instead of the character of Domino.<br /><br />Even with that , Kiera Knightley gives a fierce performance . She shows the right amount of anger and dedication in this performance . Mickey Rourke follows up his Oscar - Worthy performance in ' Sin City ' with another tough - guy performance . Edgar Ramirez really does n't do anything except speak Spanish every once in a while and stare at Kiera . Delroy Lindoi gives a good supporting performance . Mo'Nique was herself , although she did surprise me on one particular scene . Lucy Liu has great chemistry with Kiera Knightley in her scenes with her.<br /><br />The best thing about the movie though , is the direction . Tony Scott 's fast - paced style really brings the movie to life . The cinematography is some of the best , I 've ever seen . It takes a regular movie and puts on acid . All the blacks are blacker , the whites are brighter , and it has a sort of green glow to it . The action scenes are exhilarating.<br /><br />OVERALL : If you liked Sin City & Man on Fire , you 'll like Domino .
1 Kiera Nightly moved straight from the P&P set to this action movie ... she could hardly have chosen to remake her image more dramatically . A great success in Love Actually and as Lizie in Jane Austen 's classic , she is , once again , " having a go " . Just as her bikini clad warrier woman in King Arthur was more skin than muscle , it is difficult to imagine this delicate frame standing up to a bounty hunters life ... but then this is exactly what Domino Harvey ( the real one ) did , and I ( being one of Nightly 's biggest fans ) believe she carries if off.<br /><br />Stuff .... <br /><br / > * 90210 ( for the non American world ) is the post code of Beverly hills in LA , where all the film stars live . * Domino Harvey father 's mostfamous film was Manchurian Candidate ( which appears in the film ) . * Domino Harvey died of a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in June 2005 , after having been arrested for drug dealing . She had just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be inlcuded in the film . * Kiera Knightly alludes to Domino Harvey 's sexuality in her interview with Lucy Liu.<br /><br />If you find this film a bit far fetched , then check out Domino Harvey , as the facts are more amazing than the fiction .
1 When I rented Domino I was expected it to be very dumb . I hate films that have really flashy editing and cinematography and Domino also just got very bad reviews . The only reason I watched it is because I like have liked Keira Knightley , Mickey Rourke , Christopher Walken , and Tony Scott on other occasions . I also just enjoy based on fact adventure stories . Yes the editing and cinematography were frantic , the story was weak , and the acting was mediocre , but I still loved this film for some bizarre reason . Domino was very , very entertaining and often very funny . It was horribly underrated when it was released I think because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like Scotts last film Man on Fire and instead just got wonderful entertainment . I actually understand why everybody hated Domino so much , even though I loved it and recommend it .
1 Ah , Domino is actually a breath of fresh air , something new to the cinema world . I enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot , the varied characters , and the intense camera effects . I 've seen some complain about the camera work and , in fact , according to the creators themselves , the flashy and wild shots were all the culmination of mistakes made through time . All of what you see was the desired effect . Perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before , although that 's what sets it apart . In a deeper aspect , what you are seeing is just how Domino sees things through her eyes , think about it.<br /><br />When it comes to the story , I do n't see anything quite bad about it . Despite it 's " messy " nature , according to some , it is in fact just a rapid form of storytelling . The plot really is n't all that hard to follow , if you actually focus on what 's going on . Maybe it 's just me because I see movies from many different aspects such as the acting , the plot , etc . I 'm no " interpreter " or anything who picks movies apart , it just comes to me . With that said , I believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed , despite it 's future as a cult - classic , blockbuster , or whatever.<br /><br />And the characters , well there 's no doubting how varied the cast is . I believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine jobs portraying their characters effectively , that 's what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen . The characters are all very unique and a plus is that you get to witness a small piece of each one of their lives , setting them apart even further . Basically , I personally loved the cast and characters.<br /><br />All those who bash and burn this film perhaps just do n't see it as I do , or it just does n't appeal to them . No matter , this is a great film in it 's own right , no , it 's a great film period .
1 I read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie . I originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by Tony Scott and I have become very interested in his work after Man On Fire had such a profound impact on me . Before I start my review , let me first say this ... it 's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner , yet the writers and Scott chose a different approach.<br /><br />Plot:<br /><br />Simply stated , it 's not boring . Most Hollywood movies give ' tried and true ' plots that they know will connect with people , often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit . This plot was one of the more interesting ones I had seen in a while . Just for reference , I recently watched ' The Weather Man ' and ' Lord of War ' and while I will say that these movies are excellent , and I enjoyed them both tremendously , both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told . They do n't take any chances whatsoever , and they are extremely predictable after you 've watched a fair amount of American films . Domino 's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking , " oh man , they 're screwed now " . And I feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films . It has a lot of depth to it , in my opinion , and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it . Overall , this is what kept me so interested in the movie.<br /><br />Characters:<br /><br />I felt that the characters were accurate . Knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman , who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was . It was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that.<br /><br />Choco was also very believable , his use of Spanish in inappropriate situations , his reactions to Domino 's lack of affection , as well as his jealousy issues within the team ... they all rang true to me , which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic.<br /><br />Rourke 's character was the least interesting to me , but it still rang true to me . He seemed like an ordinary guy , trying to make ends meet . I hope that 's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that 's what I got out of it . He did a very good job of showing Ed in an Average Joe kind of way that has made his mistakes , yet is still trying to live.<br /><br />Claremont / Ladies : I believe that they provided much needed ' heart ' to the story . They were n't just people who are out getting money to buy a Bentley , these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal . You could empathize with them because , to them , this child 's illness was a problem with no other solution . These characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help.<br /><br />The mobsters : They made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can . And I really liked that part . They also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting.<br /><br />Christopher Walken/90210 guys:<br /><br />They provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie . From Walken 's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being has - beens . Their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable.<br /><br />Cinematography .... yes .... the cinematography . This is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans . But in my opinion I thought it was genius , the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion . I considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement , just like anything else . I both applaud and congratulate Scott , the editor , the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie . Not only did they go far and above with its presentation , they went that much further . The use of colors , both extremely light and extremely dark provided the ' look ' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob , bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life is n't as peachy or ' clean ' as everyone else . If you notice , in times of less stress or conflict , there were very few camera tricks if any at all . This shows that Scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and were n't just doing it for the heck of it . I realize that most people who watched this movie were n't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but I think it was great that Scott took this approach . Hollywood films have grown predictable and bland . Most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns . And I 'm glad that Scott tried to make something different.<br /><br />Granted , this movie is n't for everyone , but to say it 's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point . I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I 'm glad that I spent the money for it . I would recommend this to all , but I 'm sure it will only hit a chord with few . I must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the ' sphere of MTV ' wo n't appreciate this movie , but I think many people will . We should all try to enjoy it for the fact that Scott and co. took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique . And with that in mind , I think he succeeded tremendously .
1 This is the most recent addition to a new wave of educational documentaries like " The Corporation " and " Fahrenheit 9/11 . " Its commentary is clear and unwavering as is the breathtaking cinematic style of this well crafted feature . The film manages to impose a powerful sense of how unsteady our world is as we rush toward an environmentally unsustainable future at lightning speed - while showing us the terrifying beauty in our pursuit of progress . < br /><br />Truly a remarkable accomplishment which must be seen by all who care about the world we leave to our children . Bravo!<br /><br />NB - this is also the only film ( of 8) at Varsity theaters ( Toronto ) boasting a stick - on tag which reads ... " To arrange group viewings please contact .... " ... a further testament to the popularity and importance of this gem.<br /><br />My bet ... an academy award nomination for best documentary.<br /><br />OB101
1 I have been an admirer of Edward Burtynsky 's work for years , and it was such a pleasure to be able to see the man at work , thanks to Jennifer Baichwal 's documentary . The severe beauty of the ship - breaking yard in Bangladesh , the stone quarry in Vermont , the enormous assembly plant in China , the beleaguered old neighbourhoods in Shanghai that are just waiting to be torn down : these landscapes are captured so well by the photographer and the filmmaker.<br /><br />At times I thought of old TV documentaries on abandoned coal mines and plastic - mold factories ; the sort of stuff I grew up watching . Burtynsky 's work has the great value of pointing out how the industrial activity has only shifted to Asia , it has not stopped . The strangest scene for me was the computer scrap - yard somewhere in China -- the waste had a threatening air about it , while the workers were very jovial .
1 This is a documentary that came out of the splendid work of a Canadian landscape photographer whose interest has long been in the ravages left on earth by the excavations or buildings of man . It begins with a vast factory complex crammed with people making a great variety of little things , parts of high - tech equipment presumably ; it is n't really made very clear . The emphasis is on how big the place is and how many people are there and how they 're herded around outside in little yellow jackets . The film also shows the photographer working on a tall structure to do a still of the array of these people outside the factory , and talking with his crew as he does so . This is a world of relentless industrialization . It 's a relief at least to know these soulless images are n't going to be presented without a human voice , as is the case in Nikolaus Geyrhalter 's gleefully cold documentary about the food industry , ' Our Daily Bread . ' ' Manufactured Landscapes ' contains images of people scavenging e - waste and a town ( many towns , really ) being wiped out by the biggest dam ever , with a single plangent trademark shot of a little girl in the rubble of her own neighborhood eating out of a bowl using a pair of chopsticks almost bigger than she is . Some of these scenes , the ones with miserably underpaid workers slaving in dangerous and toxic places , might have been shot memorably by the premier engagé photographer Sebastião Salgado . But this photographer is n't as interested in seeing people up close . His orientation places him somewhere in between Salgado and the cold , neutral modern landscape photographs of Lewis Baltz.<br /><br />All this happens in China , of course , though there is earlier footage in black and white of the photographer working around a large shipbuilding site in Bangladesh . It is backed up by music in a New Age industrial style that is alternately soothing and oppressive . There are a good many stills of the photographer 's work -- or were some of them made by the film crew ? It is n't made clear.<br /><br />Edward Burtynsky is the name of the photographer . We see people wandering through exhibitions of his beautiful work-- big dramatic prints of carefully composed view camera color images with a handsome glow . The irony is that Burtynsky makes such unique and glorious pictures of places that are essentially blighted , and to the ordinary eye are dispiriting and boring . He admits himself that he takes no political stand . When we are able to compare his images with those caught by the roaming eye of the film 's cinematographer Peter Mettler , Burtynsky 's work almost amounts to a kind of glorification , and hence falsification . But he is showing us places that , if we look closely , reveal their full dark story of ravage and neglect no matter how finely crafted the photographs of them may be.<br /><br />Logically , but not entirely fortunately , it is Burtynsky whose voice - overs narrate most of the film as it ranges over various sites . Burtynsky 's " epiphanies " may have inspired his decades of fine work , but they amount to nothing but truisms about how we 're changing the planet irreparably ; are dependent on oil , which will run out ; that China has come into the game of massive industrialization late , and so may burn out early with the depletion of fossil fuel . The interest of ' Manufactured Landscapes ' would be much greater if there were perceptive new ideas to accompany it . The reasons for watching it are two : to see glimpses of Burtynsky 's work and the raw materials , the spaces he visits and chronicles so beautifully ; and to observe scenes from the vast , awesome , daunting , and rather horrifying industrialization of modern China.<br /><br />Because of the limitations of the narration , the idea of the title ' Manufactured Landscapes ' feels insufficiently developed . It even seems a misnomer . New landscapes they are , but they are the byproduct of manufacturing rather than " manufactured . " ' Landscapes of Waste ' or ' Wasted Landscapes ' might be better titles . There is much room left by this documentary for more intellectually searching work on film about this intriguing subject ; and those who want to know more about Edward Burtynsky might do better to peruse his books or exhibitions .
1 Mesmerizing , breathtaking and horrifying , this hauntingly beautiful film is the " Apocalypse Now " without fiction . Slow in pace , quiet in mood , it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of Earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind -- the nature is plagued and we are the disease . Greed , the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress , has turned us into something like cancer , on its way to consume the host and die with it ... <br /><br />Manufactured Landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience - at least I 'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again .
1 I had heard this film was a study of a landscape photographer 's art by presenting the beauty in man 's deconstructing the natural landscape . It certainly showed the laborious activities to find locations , setup shots , and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios worldwide . Put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show.<br /><br />This film oozes by you supplanting the shock of ghastly images with gentle waves of a wonderful industrial soundtrack that guides you like on slow moving river . Each sequence stands on its own , but in combination you get deeper and deeper into the feeling of overwhelming inevitability . There are few words , this allowing the grandeur in what is shown to preach in its own way . An awful , massive factory filled with human automata who live in hopelessly lifeless dormitories . Individuals dying early while rummaging for recyclable scraps in mountains of our E - waste . The birthing of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant graveyards . The construction of the Three Gorges Dam , the largest industrial project in human history and likely for all time . The time lapse as a city dies and is simultaneously reborn into a replica of modernity that purposefully destroys all relics of the culture that was.<br /><br />The most terrifying image for me was a dam engineer explaining that the most important function of the dam was flood control . The shot shifts to the orchard behind the spokesperson where you witness the level of the last flood by the toxic water having eaten the bark from the trees , demonstrating that nothing but the most hideous vermin could be living in the waters.<br /><br />The obvious not being stated is far more powerful than your normal preachy Save the Earth documentaries . The artist Edward Burtynsky explains the method wonderfully . ' By not saying what you should see   many people today sit in an uncomfortable spot where you do n't necessarily want to give up what we have but we realize what we 're doing is creating problems that run deep . It is not a simple right or wrong . It needs a whole new way of thinking ' . The subtlety of this descends into an either / or proposition , but the film images scream that the decision has very much been made in favor of the dark side.<br /><br />Though never stated directly in any way , as the waves of what you witness wash away from your awareness and you contemplate , there is only one conclusion possible   we are doomed . The progress of mankind that is inexorable from our natures leaves behind carnage that this artist finds terrifying beauty in . What he is actually capturing are the tracks of we the lemmings rushing unconsciously toward our own demise . Unlike most films with environmental themes , this one ends with no call to arms . It argues basically what 's the point , but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally .
1 This is the most confronting documentary I have ever seen . It was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea . Based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes centred around the modern industrial growth of China , Edward Burtynsky brings to life confronting issues that we so easily chose to ignore.<br /><br />Taking no political sides , this movie is a neutral moving picture of realities that our western societies chooses not to educate us about - the by - products of economical growth , the externalities paid by citizens of the lesser - developed communities , the source of our comforts and the wastes of our consumer lifestyles.<br /><br />Amazing , heart - breaking , impossible to ignore . This is a challenging journey but one worth taking - please stop staying ignorant and at least see these photographs of truth without feeling any pressure to take a standing to these issues . 10/10 definitely !
1 Edward Burtynsky is a Canadian photographer who makes art out of the least " artful " objects imaginable . Everyday items such as crates , boxes , metal containers , etc . - items which most of us perceive as utilitarian at best and dismiss as being utterly without aesthetic merit - are instead converted into glorious objects d'art by Burtynsky 's camera . He achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometric patterns that are apparently ever present in the industrialized world - for those perceptive enough to spot them , that is . Even heaps of compacted trash can become objects of beauty when seen through Burtynsky 's lens ( but did n't we already know that from " Wall - E " ? ) . He is particularly interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where Man has already made incursions into nature - which may explain why at times even the people in his pictures ( i.e. the workers in those places ) , with their uniform clothing and robotic movements , become part of the industrial landscape.<br /><br />"Manufactured Landscapes , " a documentary about Burtynsky 's work , has much of the feel of a " Koyaanisqatsi " about it as it dazzles us with its richly variegated kaleidoscope of images and patterns . Indeed , director Jennifer Baichwal and cinematographer Peter Mettler capture the essence of the original photos in purely cinematic terms , as their own camera records Burtynsky and his assistant running photo shoots at a factory in China , a dockyard in Bangladesh , and the construction site at the massive Three Rivers Gorge Dam project in China . With their fluid camera - work , the filmmakers match point - for - point the beauty of Burtynsky 's images . In fact , the movie opens with a stunning eight - minute - long tracking shot of a Chinese factory in which hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil away in perfectly symmetrical and color - coordinated rows.<br /><br />The movie does less well when Burtynsky gets around to articulating the " themes " of his work , which , quite frankly , come out sounding confused , contradictory and decidedly half - baked at best . But it is as a purely aesthetic experience , highlighting image and form , that " Manufactured Landscapes " resonates most . In the case of Burtynsky , perhaps , a picture really IS worth a thousand words .
1 I had nowhere to go . I was on a flight to Vancouver . I would probably have missed this film if I had n't chosen Air Canada . Watched on a small screen in the back of the seat in front , I found this captivating and mesmerising . I did drift in a couple of places and had to skip back but I had to watch to it 's end . Now I 'm looking forward to the DVD release in Europe though whether I 'll be quite as transfixed when I can walk out the door , is yet to be discovered!<br /><br />The photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and ' fills out ' the story the photographs tell.<br /><br />Recommended ( if you have time on your hands ) .
1 Reviewed at the World Premiere screening Sept. 9 , 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival ( TIFF).<br /><br />This had an interesting premise but seemed to go on too long with too many shots of piles of eWaste ( recycled computers , keyboards , cables etc . shipped over to China by the ton and then sorted and remade into new products to sell back ) and other desolation.<br /><br />The filmmakers tried to get more people interviews to boost the human element but were frequently prevented from doing so due to Chinese censorship . Still , what was there was interesting . The bits of a Shanghai high end real estate agent preening and strutting around showing off her luxurious mansion and gardens , intercut with the scenes of others living in medieval conditions were especially striking . The opening tracking shot of a 480 m factory floor was quite something as well . Scenes of the activity at the Three Gorges Dam project were also a complement to the Jia Khang - je films at TIFF ( the feature Still Life / Sanxia Haoren & the documentary Dong ) which were also built around that subject.<br /><br />Director Jennifer Baichwal , Producer Nick de Pencier , Cinematographer Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all there on stage for a Q&A after the world premiere . Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced from the audience and was thanked as the most key person that assisted in the on the ground access in China itself .
1 In addition to being an extremely fun movie , may I add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful . This kind , fun loving woman had a great deal of money . Unfortunately , she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money . This woman was lonely since the death of her husband . He had proposed to her in a theater that was going to be torn down . To prevent that , she bought it . Her daughters were afraid she was throwing away " their " money and decided to take action . The character actors in this film were a great plus also . I would give almost anything to have a copy of this film in my video library , but as of yet , it 's never been released . Sad .
1 Absolutely wonderful drama and Ros is top notch ... I highly recommend this movie . Her performance , in my opinion , was Academy Award material ! The only real sad fact here is that Universal has n't seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format , whether it be tape or DVD . They are ignoring a VERY good movie . But Universal has little regard for its library on DVD , which is sad . If you get the chance to see this somewhere ( not sure why it is rarely even run on cable ) , see it ! I wo n't go into the story because I think most people would rather have an opinion on the film , and too many " reviewers " spend hours writing about the story , which is available anywhere.<br /><br />a 10 !
1 Rosalind Russell executes a power - house performance as Rosie Lord , a very wealthy woman with greedy heirs . With an Auntie Mame - type character , this actress can never go wrong . Her very - real terror at being in an insane assylum is a wonderful piece of acting . Everyone should watch this .
1 As with most Rosalind Russell movies , this one is very entertaining -- it 's fun all the way through . It 's definitely one of the last of this genre of film -- just good wholesome entertainment . Give it a try - I do n't think you will be disappointed .
1 A serious comedy . Ross Hunter - produced movie version of the French play " Les Joies de la famille " ( later Americanized as " A Very Rich Woman " ) is plush , well cast , occasionally funny ... and unfortunately timeless . A wealthy California widow , who appears to be frittering away her money , is railroaded by her two grown , greedy daughters , both of whom are afraid Mama Rosie is carelessly spending their inheritance . The whole issue of a vital -- but aged -- woman sent to a rest home against her will , and later having to prove herself sane in a court hearing , is touchy material for a comedy ( and to his credit , director David Lowell Rich does n't overload the picture with crass gags or obvious sentiment ) . Some of the humor is a little broad and does n't work , yet Rosalind Russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never hits a false note . Sandra Dee is also good as Rosalind 's granddaughter , and James Farentino is very charming as a young lawyer . The movie has so much to say about the importance of our elderly , and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time , that the seriousness of " Rosie ! " 's theme almost gets lost in the rush to a happy ending . The picture leaves you smiling -- and at the same time wondering how many older ladies there are who were never quite so lucky . * * * from * * * *
1 God Bless 80 's slasher films . This is a fun , fun movie . This is what slasher films are all about . Now I 'm not saying horror movies , just slasher films . It goes like this : A high school nerd is picked on by all these stupid jocks and cheerleaders , and then one of their pranks goes horribly wrong . Disfigured and back for revenge , sporting a Joker / Jester mask ( pretty creepy looking , might i add ) , Marty begins to kill off those teens one by one many years later , after he manages to make them believe that their old abandoned high school is having a reunion . That is basically the plot ? What 's wrong with that ? That 's the beauty of 80 's slasher films , most of them i would say . A lot of things could be so ridiculous , but they keep drawing you more in an ' in as they go by . Especially this film.<br /><br />It features some outrageous killings , and some are quite creative as well . ( poisoning of a beer can , acid bath , i ca n't remember a javelin ever being used before in any other slasher film either)It really is a fun , fun movie . That 's all it is . Nevermind the fact that the characters are complete idiots , never mind their stupidity , and never mind the outrageous , random things that occur in this film . Such as lights being able to be controlled by the killer ( when he 's not even switching any buttons , you 'll see ) and toilets being able to cough up blood , baths being able to have acid come out of them , just use that as part of your entertainment ! Because that s what really makes it entertaining.<br /><br />Movies like this represent 80 's slashers . Never again could movies like this get made , know why ? It is n't the 80 's anymore . That is why you should just cherish them for what they are , good fun ! I highly recommend this film if you 're a hardcore fan of Slahsers such as Friday the 13th.<br /><br />One last note this movie also had a kick ass villain as well , Marty Rantzen . A disfigured , nerd , who kills all his old foes in a creepy Jester mask . A good villain makes a good slasher . Simon Scuddamore , who played Marty apparently committed suicide shortly after Slaughter High was released . That alone adds something creepy to the film , and sticks with it and it even makes you feel more sorry for the Marty character , i guess . All in all , great 80 's slashers fun ! It 's a shame it will never be the same again ...
1 " Slaughter High " is , perhaps , the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s . It is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout . That being said , it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula : A group of young men and women get killed one by one gruesomely until the final showdown.<br /><br />The reason why " Slaughter High " stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more over - the - top . Marty , the killer , has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates . They electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girl 's locker room shower , jabbed at his crotch with a javelin , and , to top it off , rigged his science lab experiment so it could disfigure him.<br /><br />So , the victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get . When they reunite years later -- at a high school reunion put on by Marty himself -- you realize they have n't matured all that much . They 're a bunch of sociopaths.<br /><br />It is mind - boggling why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion , which , by the way , is held at a school that has since fell into disrepair . And who would think it 's a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers -- as well as Marty 's -- on display ? There are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film . The ending makes little or no sense . And the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how April Fool 's Day works : The movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noon.<br /><br />In all , the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre , despite all of its flaws . It is hard to understand why it has n't yet found its way to DVD , when so many other run - of - the - mill slasher flicks are graced with special editions .
1 YES , the plot is hardly plausible and very thin . YES , the acting does range from average to laughable . YES , it has been done so many times before . However what we are dealing with is a film that does not shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is . There are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie . In addition you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory killing . I urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be ; a scary , funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none .
1 I have lost count of how many reviews I 've written on Slaughter High . I 've read a lot of bad ones and I will say right now this is a fantastic movie . Simon Scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide , and even though this was his only film , he is what made the movie so great . At first I did not know anything about Simon until I read a review about his suicide . Then I found out due to the current webpage at www . IMDb.com he was born in 1957 , in Dayton , Ohio . Simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man , but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses . He did a good acting job , who can disagree ? I always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie . Must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least . I first saw this movie when I was 12 in the sixth grade . I agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered , and that high schools do NOT have bath tubs ! I think Caroline Munro who was 36 at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent , and unfortunately for Simon 's death he made no future films . The reason(s ) for his suicide are a mystery , and hopefully will be discovered in the near future . Doing the math on his webpage it tells you he was 29 years old when he made Slaughter High . He looked like a teenager . I give this film two thumbs up , the best horror film made . Probably because of their horrible acting the others did n't make fame in the movie business . -Jacob Young
1 Slaughter High is about a boy named Marty . He was harassed , and picked on in high school . A group of kids played several pranks on him , and these pranks were REALLY bad . The last prank ended tragically.<br /><br />cue to 5 years later . The gang of kids meet up again for a reunion . One of them set it up at the old high school . The school is now abandoned , and they have to break in . For some reason , the Janitor is still there , but he tells them to go ahead and have fun because they give him a beer.<br /><br />They start partying , and looking at their old lockers , and they see something of Marty 's . One girl feels sorry for Marty but another guy calms her down.<br /><br />Once the kills begin , it is great . Every kills is creative and gory . We see a figure in a jester mask , hunting them one by one throughout the school . It appears Marty is back to exact revenge . After the first person is killed , they find out they are locked in the school . They begin looking for a way out.<br /><br />Now , there are a number of illogical things in this movie . First of all , I do n't know anyone who has a 5 year reunion . Second of all , after the first kid dies , a girl gets blood all over her . They all run away in a panic , yet she runs to the bathroom , and finds a bathtub . Hrr friend has just been killed , and she decides to take a bath ! ? More importantly , why is there a bathtub in a school bathroom . Anyways , the bathtub does n't seem to really work .... and she dies a horrible death this is an 80s movie . it is a horror slasher . WHO CARES if it has some illogical parts . I for one do n't . This movie has really great deaths . The ending .... there is a twist . Having recently seen Haute Tension , I can compare the two . The only way they are similar is that there is a twist , which kind of left me disappointed ..... THEN right after the twist , comes a great , if not the best kill , in the movie.<br /><br />After the last kill , the killer looks at the screen and also does something crazy , and it was the perfect way to end the movie . It has me going " wow ... "
1 Wow , praise IMDb and Google , for I have been trying to remember the name of this f'ing awesome movie for over 15 years now . Slaughter High , man ! Hells yeah!<br /><br />I'm not going to bore you with a plot summary , and actors , and yadda yadda yadda , 'cause you all know what 's up . That 's why you 're here anyway . What I will do , however , is explain the fond memory I have of this quintessential 80 's D - Movie slasher joint.<br /><br />In 1987 , when I was around the age of 7 , my father used to rent all these horror movies . Would he care that his kids were watching them with him ? No . So , at that young age i saw Slaughter High . What I saw in that movie stuck with me big time . I have n't seen it since , but I remember to this day most of the ridiculous kills in the movie . For example , the post - sex scene ( why is there a metal bed in a school ? ) gets electrocuted . Or , the guy being drowned in a cess pool . Come on ! My personal favorite , though ... the exploding stomach from the tainted beer . Amazing ! How can you honestly hate on a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school , like , 10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it ? Then his stomach explodes ? What ! ? And that great line : Let 's take my car ... it always starts . Classic crap all the way . < br /><br />I mean , I look back now , almost 20 years later , and laugh at it . But when I was 7 , I was scared sh!tless . That jester hat ( or was it a mask ? ) that the killer rocks throughout freaked me the f*ck out!<br /><br />All in all , yes , a crappy movie . But for nostalgia purposes and for humor factor this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me . Either stay up every night real late and hope to catch this on same Late Late Late Movie show , or hunt down a VHS copy and dust off your VCR .
1 Slaughter High starts like any other day at Doddsville County High School where little minx Carol Manning ( Caroline Munro ) has tricked resident nerd Marty Rantzen ( Simon Scuddamore ) into the girls locker rooms where she tells him to get undressed in the shower , while doing so Carol 's gang of friends come in & give the now naked Marty a big surprise as they film him as they stick his head down the girls toilet in an April fool 's day joke . The school 's sports coach ( Marc Smith ) saves Marty & punishes the gang who rather harshly blame Marty , they decide to play another trick on him only this time things get out of hand & Marty is caught in an explosion & has nitric acid splashed over his face . Years later & the whole gang are invited to a class reunion at the now closed down school , they all arrive to discover they are the only ones there . They all venture inside where they quickly learn they are n't the only ones there as Marty is back & has revenge on his mind ... <br /><br />Originally shot under the title April Fool 's Day which they changed probably because of another slasher film named April Fool 's Day ( 1986 ) made the same year this American English co - production is unusual in that it has three credited writers & directors , George Dugdale , Mark Ezra & Peter Litten ( after never seeing a film with three credited director 's I 've now seen two in a week the other being the Jean - Claude Van Damme flick Kickboxer ( 1989 ) ) & I have to say I really rather liked Slaughter High even though it seems to have a pretty bad reputation . One of the things I like about the script is that it is a pure unashamed slasher flick , it does n't try to be anything else & it just accepts the genres rules , short comings & trappings & plays up to them . Basically it delivers what it promises , a homicidal killer , blood , boobs & babes . I thought the character 's were alright , the story was OK even though it 's just an excuse to get a load of teens inside an isolated location so some killer can bump them off one at a time & I actually liked the twist ending as well which is also something for which Slaughter High gets a lot of flak for . The first half starts off a little slow but the second half moves along at a rate of knots as there is one gory killing after another . Some of the situations & character reactions make little sense but the same can be said of just about any film ever made so who 's complaining?<br /><br />Despite three credited director 's Slaughter High turned out pretty good , I liked the look of the film a lot . The isolated rundown school made for a really atmospheric location & looked good , the makers throw in a good thunderstorm as well & there 's some nice photography especially at the end where there are numerous impressive uninterrupted long lasting stedicam tracking shots which follow Carol through various corridors of the rundown school . While not particularly stylish it certainly looks nice enough & is professionally made . There is some good gore here including burnt bodies , people melted with acid , impalings , stomach explosions , axes in faces & death by lawnmower as well as someone who gets drowned in fecal matter down a drain ! The special effects are also better than one would expect & I was both impressed & pleased with the higher than expected body count.<br /><br />Technically the film is better than I had expected & beats most low budget horror crap that gets released today , I would have thought it was relatively low budget itself though . Supposedly set in America this was very obviously shot in England . Harry Manfredini composes another score which sounds exactly like all of his other musical scores & is basically the same as the theme from Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) & it 's sequels . Anyone living here in the UK will probably recognise Billy Hartman who played Frank as a regular in Emmerdale Farm ( one of our nations top rated soap operas ) in which he plays Terry Woods ! While most horror fans will recognise the sexy Caroline Munro in a rare staring role . Legendary exploitation producer Dick Randall did the deed on Slaughter High & actually appears in the film as a porno movie producer ... talk about typecasting ! You can also see a poster for the misunderstood brilliance that was Pieces ( 1982 ) which he also produced behind him in his office.<br /><br />Slaughter High is a slasher film that I liked a lot , did you see that ? I did n't say it was great I actually said I liked it on a personal level & I 'm sure the predictable plot & lack of story will probably put many off so I ca n't recommend it but I can say I liked it , make of that what you want . Make sure you you watch the uncut version if you ever decide you want to check it out . If your not a fan of the slasher flick genre then Slaughter High wo n't change your mind but if your looking for a simple & effective slasher then you could do a lot worse than this .
1 This movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre , which is my favorite genre of them all , so when I saw it was Free on Demand , I had to watch it ! It stars Caroline Munro , from both Dr. Phibes films ( she was his wife that died ! ) , Dracula A.D. 1972 , The Golden Voyage of Sinbad , Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter , The Spy Who Loved Me , Maniac , and Faceless.<br /><br />Brought to you by the people behind Do n't Open Til Christmas and Pieces , Heres my thoughts on this ... <br /><br />It opens on April Fools Day , where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd- promising him sex in the shower , and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet ( all while he s naked ! ) . The coach puts a stop to it , but both parties swear revenge . But , the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive.<br /><br />Cut to the future , and its th High School reunion , or so they think ( bwahahha ? ) . The only ones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid , and its April Fools Day ( or really , the day before April Fools , but the fun starts at midnight ) , yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall . Then they finally break into the school and it starts storming.<br /><br />Inside they find food / drink and a little shrine for each of them , each of their lockers and belongings , along with Marty 's ( the nerds ) locker and yearbook . They also find the old black janitor / caretaker who spends his time saying " Oooh yesser ! Yesser ! I do n't want no trouble , sir ! " and then is killed instantly . Pretty pointless character , but he s still my favorite.<br /><br />The movie takes a page out of Alien 's book , in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see ! That s when everyone realizes that they 're there to die , and they start freaking out , except for Shirley , who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this . Of course , it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off ( very cool , mind you ) The rest of the night goes as usual , sex , drugs , and Marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask .. What s their plan ? " All we have to do is stay awake and wait till noon . Marty wo nt kill us during mid - day ! " . Seriously , that s what he said . Apparently you can only kill at nighttime . But will they survive through the night ? Who will live and who will die ? And why are all the bodies disappearing ? Rent , buy , or steal this great movie to find out ! The movie is actually very good , filled with clichés ( car wo nt start , DAMMIT ! ) and just plain slasher fun . Not to mention they all have names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan . I recommend it to all of you ! And , not to mention , it has a Spin Off ! 1989 's Cutting Class is a spin - off from this slasher gem , and that movie starts the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell.<br /><br />Favorite scene : 2 people having sex , the guy wants to finish but the girl does n't . " Talk dirty to me , Frank ! ! " she screams " Uh ... tits ! " " DIRTIER ! " " Uh ... tits . F*ck . tits . Boobs . F*ck . " . It seems to work for her and at her climax , the killer electrocutes them both !
1 it 's movies like these that make you wish that you never picked on the nerd growing up in school . If you liked this movie , then I would suggest you watch Valentine . I just found out today that the guy who played Marty(Simon ) killed himself a little after the movie was released which is a shame since he did a good job . I wonder if it 's because of the part he played in the movie . It starts out when Carol tricks him into going into the girls restroom to act like they were about to do it . When he was changing in the showers , Carols popular friends snuck into the bathroom and got everything ready , camera , electric shock , pole . When Marty open the curtain butt naked he realized that he was tricked . He tries to cover the shower up but the kids open it , grab Marty and starts being mean to him while the camera is rolling . They picked him up , dunked his head in the toliet while it was being flushed , and they electricuted him(slightly ) . When the kids are in detention , given by the coach , 2 of the boys give Marty a joint that will make him throw up . Skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to get the teacher to excuse him . While Marty is puking in the bathroom Skip sneaks into the Science Lab and mixes some stuff that looks like cocaine but not sure what it was . The lab blows up disfiguring him badly . 5 years later the kids who tormented him that day got invitations for a 5 year school reunion at the old school which was burn that day it exploded . One by one the people get killed off . I do n't understand how the girl who drowned really drowned . she could have gotten back up after Marty left . She almost got out the first time .
1 I have seen Slaughter High several times over the years , and always found it was an enjoyable slasher flick with an odd sense of humor , but I never knew that it was filmed in the UK , and I never knew that the actor that plays Marty Rantzen ( Simon Scuddamore ) committed suicide after the film was released . I guess I did notice while watching it last night that the actors phrasing seems rather odd for Americans , and a few of them are n't very good at hiding their English accents.<br /><br />All that aside though , this is the tale of the class nerd , Marty , who is the butt of jokes from his classmates , and on one particular day , April Fools Day , he 's lured into the girl 's locker room by one Caroline Munro ( yes , playing a teenager ) and humiliated big time on film . Of course , the coach catches the gang at work & they 're all given a vigorous workout to punish them , but not before a couple of the guys slip Marty a joint , which he tries to smoke in the chemistry lab , but it 's full of something that makes him sick & when he runs to the restroom , one of his classmates slips in and puts a chemical that reacts with something Marty is mixing , which results in a fire and the spill of a bottle of nitric acid , which leaves poor Marty burned & horribly scarred.<br /><br />Ten years later , this same gang is headed for their class reunion at good old Doddsville High , which seems oddly boarded up and inaccessible , but thanks to ingenuity they manage to get in and find the place seemingly derelict ... except there 's a room where a banquet and liquor is laid out and so of course , they eat , drink , and be merry . For soon , they will die , of course.<br /><br />The gang is stalked one - by - one by a figure in a jester 's mask , but could it be Marty ? They do n't know , they figure he 's either in a loony bin or working for IBM , they 're not sure which . But whoever it is , he 's making quick work of them . Particularly nasty is the girl that takes a bath to wash blood off her from one of her classmates whose innards popped all over her when he drank poisoned beer . She is victim to an acid bath which I believe may have been one of the parts originally cut in the tape version , because it seemed extra nasty when I watched it this time . I could be wrong but I believe that was n't on the tape.<br /><br />At any rate , there 's somewhat of a twist ending , and that also contains footage not on the tape , I believe . There 's also a bit of frontal nudity early on that was also excised , but apart from that I did n't really notice if there were other bits on this uncut version , probably so but it 's been a while since I 've last seen it.<br /><br />At any rate , if you 're a fan of 80 's slasher flicks then snap up the new release DVD , because it 's a fun little slasher with a good atmosphere & feel to it . 7 out of 10 .
1 My 10/10 rating is merely for the fun factor and assumes that you decided that you liked " Slaughter High " even before watching it . Yes , it 's the typical revenge - several - years - after - a - dirty - prank story , but how can you not like some of the stuff that they pull here ? ! I could n't have predicted that bathtub scene in a million years.<br /><br />OK , so maybe we could be cynical and say that this movie offers nothing new . Well , it does n't pretend to . It 's the sort of flick that the characters in " Scream " probably watched , and it contributed to their rules about how to survive a horror movie . After all , who does n't like to watch people suffer for doing these things ? Obviously , it 's got sort of a reactionary undertone , as people get punished for doing what the ' 60s championed . But still , you got ta love this stuff ! So , with apologies to Don McLean , this jester did n't sing for the king and queen !
1 Okay , sorry , but I loved this movie . I just love the whole 80 's genre of these kind of movies , because you do n't see many like this one anymore ! I want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip - off , or a cheesy imitation , what is it imitating ? I 've never seen another movie like this one , well , not horror anyway.<br /><br />Basically its about the popular group in school , who like to make everyones lives living hell , so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named Marty . It turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks.<br /><br />So , its like 10 years later , and the group of friends who hurt Marty start getting High School reunion letters . But ... they are the only ones receiving them ! So they return back to the old school , and one by one get knocked off by ....... Yeah you probably know what happens!<br /><br />The only part that disappointed me was the very end . It could have been left off , or thought out better.<br /><br />I think you should give it a try , and try not to be to critical!<br /><br />~*~CupidGrl~*~
1 I have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months . I was actually surprised at how good it was.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named Marty . They constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves Marty horribly burned.<br /><br />A few years later , the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party . Though , not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.<br /><br />Later through the film , the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible . I can certainly tell you that they are gory as well.<br /><br />At the end of the film , you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened . But , Marty is in the hospital with severe burns . Although the murders did n't happen , the burns and the pranks apparently did happen.<br /><br />The acting is terrible but that is fine.<br /><br />I love the story . I really sympathize with Marty . It 's like Tamara ( 2005 ) . The bullies get what 's coming to them in the end and you end up feeling satisfied for the victim getting their sweet revenge.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend anyone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashers.<br /><br />I give this movie 8 stars out of 10 . Good cheesy slasher !
1 A bunch of popular high school students play a cruel joke on nerdy Marty ( a sympathetic performance by Simon Scuddamore ) which leaves him hideously disfigured . Five years later the gang returns to the now crumbling and abandoned high school for a reunion . Of course , an angry and vindictive Marty shows up dressed in a jester 's costume to exact a grisly revenge on his tormentors . Writers / directors Mark Ezra , Peter Litten and George Dugdale trot out all the endearingly corny clichés which make these 80 's slice'n'dice body count flicks so much cheesy fun : fake jump scares , prowling Steadican shots , a fierce storm , an insanely groovy hard rock soundtrack , a nice smattering of gratuitous female nudity , a totally ridiculous " what the hell ? " supernatural climax , tacky make - up f / x , and one of those lovably lame " it was all just a terrible dream " fake - out non - endings . Moreover , the elaborate murder set pieces deliver the gruesome goods : Gory highlights include a man 's stomach exploding after he drinks poisoned beer , a lady taking an acid bath , a guy being crushed under a huge tractor , and two people getting electrocuted while in the middle of having wild passionate sex . Thirtyish British cult horror siren Caroline Munro is hilariously miscast as an American teenager in the first third of the flick . The cast all give solid performances , with especially stand - out work from Carmine Iannaccone as smartaleck ringleader Skip Pollack , Billy Hartman as faded macho meathead Frank , and Donna Yeager as foul - mouthed slut Stella . Co - producer Dick Randall has an amusing cameo as Munro 's sleazy agent Manny . Harry Manfredini 's moody , rattling music shamelessly recycles cues from his " Friday the 13th " scores . Alan Pudney 's slick cinematography does the trick . Good , trashy fun .
1 " Slaughter High " is a totally ridiculous slasher flick about a high school nerd Marty , who gets pick on all the time by some pranksters . The prank goes wrong and he ends up getting savagely burned . Five years later his tormentors all attend a reunion - just the ten of them of course , and low and behold Marty murders them one after another . British actress Caroline Munro("Maniac")leads the cast as the heroine(who dies anyway!).The acting is completely awful , there 's also no suspense at all . Plenty of grotesque death scenes to satisfy the gore - freaks : a guy 's stomach explodes , another female victim literally gets an acid bath , a couple having sex in bed get electrocuted , a guy is crushed by a tractor , one girl is drowned , and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye . The killer wears a decent and rather creepy jester 's mask and the setting(a beautiful old English castle)is really nice . However the dream finale is utterly pathetic . All in all it 's true that " Slaughter High " is a piece of garbage , but I enjoyed it . Only for fans of truly bad slasher flicks .
1 Poor geeky Marty ( Simon Scuddamore ) gets horribly burned due to a cruel April Fool 's day stunt gone very wrong . Flash forward a decade and those involved ( including Caroline Monroe , known to horror fans for her turns in Maniac , Faceless & the Last Horror Film ) in the prank are psyched for the upcoming 10 year high school reunion not aware that a court jester - masked killer is hiding out in the ( now closed down ) school and out for revenge.<br /><br />Chaulk this one up to being a guilty pleasure , I knew it 's a bad film . It has all the characteristics of one . Yet there 's just something about it that makes me feel compelled to watch it from time to time ( preferably with beer in hand ) . I 'm even willing to overlook the absolutely horrid ending ( which , I do have to say , I hate ) I guess I like it because it has a fun atmosphere about it and some pretty cool kills.<br /><br />Eye Candy ( for the men ) : Josephine Scandi & Donna Yeager both get topless < br /><br />Eye Candy ( for the ladies ) : a gratuitous cock shot of Simon Scuddamore at the start of the film < br /><br />My Grade : B- < br /><br />Lionsgate DVD Extras : Optional trivia track ; trailer for this film ; and trailers for My Bloody Valentine ( 1981 ) , Monster Squad , Dirty Dancing
1 This movie is such cheesy goodness.<br /><br />A bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school . They start getting killed off , they know they are being stalked , so what do they do ? One girl decides to take a bath , another decides to cheat on her husband ( who is also there ) with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed ( in an old abandoned school ? ) and go at it.<br /><br />And it comes through with the gore and the T&A.<br /><br />And it 's also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view . Where the usual 80 's slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves , or how adults view young people , or as Hollywood views the rest of the country this has a unique perspective . This is a Brit film made to be an American slasher . It 's hilarious to see how often the British actors who are trying to speak " American " unintentionally slip back in to their UK accents.<br /><br />If you like cheesy 80 's slashers ( like Pieces ) then you will like this one .
1 I first rented this film many years ago , and was completely enthralled by it . Just recently , feeling a strange need to revisit some of the way - too - few films that I 've immensely enjoyed in my lifetime , I decided to give " Erendira " another look . And I 'm glad I did , as I soon discovered that even the passage of time has not in the least dulled the shine of this film.<br /><br />The story is about a teenaged girl ( Erendira , played remarkably by Claudia O'hana - in some respects she resembles Winona Ryder ! ) who accidentally burns down her grandmother 's mansion after which the grandmother , played downright hypnotically by Irene Papas , forces the girl into a life of prostitution on the road to repay the damages . < br /><br />The viewing is at once fascinating and compelling - though , inspite of the basic premise , which deals with prostitution , is tastefully void of gratuitous steamy sexual content . The story revolves more around the interactions between the girl and her grandmother , and the various other colorful characters with whom they come into contact on their sojourn - which , by the way , is in the rough and tumble part of rural Mexico.<br /><br />The film is very atmospheric , arrestingly enigmatic with a decided dreamlike quality . It sometimes borders on the bizarre , but not to the point of , say , a David Lynch film . It 's also worth mentioning that the film is very allegorical in nature , read the comments from previous viewers below ... <br /><br />Often in the background you hear the sounds of a lone accordion , quiet and melancholy , adding just the right musical accents to highlight the Mexican setting . The cinematography of the rural places , many of which are in the desert , is quite superb.<br /><br />The film moves at a nice pace , neither too fast nor too slow , and after every scene I felt I had to rewind the tape and play it over again , just because it makes you want to do that . For me anyway , it really is that compelling.<br /><br />Hopefully you will see the film in its Spanish language version , with subtitles . I studied Spanish in high school as well as in college , and I was happy to be able to understand much of the dialogue . Por ejemplo : " El mundo no es tan grande como pensaba . " ( " The world 's not as big as I thought " - i.e. , It 's a small world.)<br /><br />This film somehow reminds me of stumbling upon a dusty old bottle of vintage wine , which , upon drinking , is immensely satisfying , however , you are left with some sadness upon realizing that there are n't more bottles just like this one .
1 Unfortunately , this movie never made it to DVD . I saw it when it was first released to the theaters in 1983 , and then again when the VHS was released in 1992 . When I recently saw a VHS copy at a flea market , I immediately bought it . I was not disappointed . First , the obvious : Claudia Ohana is beautiful and a joy to behold . But then , the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values and decide what is really important to you . The movie is about a lot of things . It is about how the World Bank and large corporations exploit and enslave developing countries with their capitalist schemes to force them into a debt that they can never repay . It is about how our economic system exploits us by forcing us into debt with credit cards , mortgage , and car payment . It is about trying to save an innocence that maybe we have never really had and maybe we can not really save . It is about good and evil and about how hard it is sometimes to tell one from the other . It raises a lot of questions but does not give answers . I think sometimes this is good . For this reason , this is a film really worth saving and seeing .
1 Read Eric 's review again . He perfectly described my own feeling for this film so more eloquently than I ever could . I 'm only writing here to further encourage you to look for and see it.<br /><br />I saw it many years ago on TV , the IFC I think . It is such a unique film I hesitate to make comparisons . It was filmed in northern Mexico , somewhere in the relentless badlands of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi . This is n't the Sedona - like Durango , Mexico ( of the John Wayne films ) but a truly stark and wild place . I have to find the novel now to check on the original location of the story . Like the location , this movie is strange and wild and wonderful and weird and absolutely not for everyone . It is the kind of production that almost motivates me to study film.<br /><br />I had n't actually forgotten this movie , it is indelible . Yet , over the years , I had forgotten of its existence . I know nobody who has seen it , had never read of it , nor seen any reference to it . Erendira is such an unusual name , I 'd even forgotten the title . Well , I 'll be looking to buy a copy now.<br /><br />**I have since the above posting become a huge fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and so regret not having read him before.<br /><br />Relative to MsMyth 's comment below ; the movie was filmed in Mexico but the author is Colombian and was not commenting on Mexico or Mexican history in any way , although Marquez now lives in Mexico for " political " reasons . This story is universal . < br /><br />I am still trying desperately to find a copy of this film for my library . Liked the movie ? You have to read the story and then everything else Garcia Marquz wrote . And , by the way , the original location in the story was Colombia .
1 Although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism , it is in fact nothing of the sort . It is a political and cultural allegory of Mexico 's post - Columbian odyssey , as even a passing glance at Mexico 's history will attest . < br /><br />In contrast to " Like Water for Chocolate , " " Erendira " expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding it takes a little work . ( A good starting point is to see the grandmother character as Spain : proud , aloof , sorrowful and , above all else , weighed - down - with - history.)<br /><br />The ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because the " outcome " of history ( i.e. the present ) is always obscure , since we are too close to it for honest evaluation . Refusal to neatly tie up loose ends is the only real choice available to the director , given the ambitions of the film.<br /><br />"Erendira " is gorgeous . A big - screen experience would be ideal , if you can catch it at a local art house or university screening . But if not , VHS is better than never seeing it at all .
1 " Erendira " is a film from Mexico that is rarely talked about . The film only exists in a low quality VHS format . It 's a shame this film has n't been given a DVD release . " Erendira " is stunning and gorgeous with its magic - realist images . " Erendira " is based on a short story from the novel " 100 Years of Solitude " . Erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burns down her grandma 's house . Her evil grandma , played by Irene Papas , forces her into prostitution to pay for the damages . The whole town gets a piece of Erendira , so to speak . Although the subject matter sounds harsh , the film does n't exploit sexuality . It 's done in a mature artistic manner . The film also has some amazing costumes . Some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most , are the origami birds that morph into real birds , and a golden orange with a diamond in the center . Erendira is an amazing film , that even manages to throw in humor . This is definitely a film that deserves a special DVD release . As they 'd say in espanol , " Es muy muy bien ! ! ! Excellente !
1 This is a gorgeous movie visually . The images of the Mexican desert , the old mansion , the characters in their picturesque costumes ... all amount to a real work of art.<br /><br />The story seems a bit loose , but that 's because it 's not meant to be realistic . It is taken from a book called One Hundred Years of Solitude , and it is supposed to be an evocation of the isolated , otherworldly atmosphere of Latin America " so far from God , and so close to the United States " . The tremendous debt that Erendira owes to her grandmother is symbolic of Latin America 's international debt burden , although there many layers of meaning.<br /><br />If you can appreciate a slow - moving , richly - textured movie , this one is for you .
1 Young Erendira and her tyrranical Grandmother provide for a great fantasy from the new world . This interpretation of Gabriel Garcia Marquez'"La incréible y triste historia da la cándida Eréndira , ... " may not rub Marquez purists the right way eventhough The story stays intact and still carries the full force of the work . The strength of this film is in its acting especially Papas as the Grandmother . Marquez fans and Marquez novices alike will enjoy this movie for its real gritty brand of witt .
1 Rawhide was a wonderful TV western series . Focusing on a band of trail drovers lead by the trail boss Gil Favor . Most episodes - especially from the first 3 seasons were really character studies of Favor and his men . Guest stars came and went but unlike Wagon Train they seldom dominated the episodes they appeared in . Rawhide was a true , gritty western and Gil Favor stood out as a memorable character never to be forgotten . Thanks to Eric Fleming 's performance the show became a massive hit . Of course he was ably supported by a wonderful cast of good actors - Clint Eastwood , Sheb Wooley , Paul Brinegar , Steve Raines , James Murdoch , Rocky Shahan , Robert Cabal . All of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history . Rawhide captured the flavour of that time of the west that no other series has for me , as yet anyhow , managed to do so . Later seasons tended to split the leads and give them individual story lines . For me some of the time this did n't work - the cattle drive and the regulars provided the best stories . However there were still some classic stories and Rawhide remained top drawer affair . The black and white photography added to a bleak , realistic feel that other western series seldom managed to capture . Rustlers , Indians , Commancheroes , beautiful damsels in distress , serial killers , they all showed up to give our heroes problems . The end came for the series quietly when the final season was axed less than half way through . The reason - Eric Fleming had departed and Rawhide was now a head without a body - the gritty realism was gone , Gil Favor commanded respect and exuded authority - he was never infallible and this made him all the more interesting . We shall not see his like again . Watch an episode whenever you can , they seldom disappoint .
1 It ran 8 seasons , but it 's first , in early 1959 , and it 's last , in the autumn of 1965 , were shorter than seasons 2 - 7 . CBS chief William Paley canceled Rawhide 's production after watching the 1st show of season 8 , in September , 1965 , because he disliked the series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor , who had departed after season 7 . The last new episode aired in November , 1965 . The lone 1966 CBS broadcast , on January 4 , 1966 , was a rerun . < br /><br />I have often wondered why Rawhide did n't switch to color filming for it 's last season ? Most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965 . CBS was broadcasting in color that autumn , for many of their sitcoms , but westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide remained in black and white . Gunsmoke was the last western ( and last prime time network series to switch to color ) on September 17 , 1966 , for the episode Snap Decision .
1 Currently on METOO 's new schedule at 4 pm on weekdays , right after " Maverick " and right before " Wild , Wild West " ( followed by " Star Trek").<br /><br />Don't know if I ever actually saw an episode of it when it was originally on , but I 'm really captivated by it . Offbeat , unusual , surreal stories set in a mythical West . Kind of the " Naked City " of Westerns.<br /><br />And the guest stars are there : Dan Duryea , Lyle Bettger , Brian Donlevy , MacDonald Carey , Rick Jason ( as a treacherous Mexican ) , a young Dick Van Patten , Jack Lord , Noah Berry , Jr. ( as a colorful Mexican ) , Martha Hyer , Marguerite Chapman , even Ann Robinson ( " War of the Worlds " ) , Gloria Talbott ( " I Married a Monster from Outer Space")<br /><br />It ran for EIGHT SEASONS , over 200 episodes , from January , 1959 , to December , 1965.<br /><br />Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as trail boss Gil Favor , the most stolid man that 's ever lived , with the code of honor of a Samurai , and just the right balance between toughness and open - handedness . I would vote for him for President any day . ( P.S. He had a very interesting biography : http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/ ) < br /><br />And a young Clint Eastwood is quite striking as his impulsive right hand , " Rowdy " Yates . Also , veteran Western actor and country music figure ( the immortal " One - eyed , One - horned , Flying Purple People Eater " ) Sheb Wooley is there as seasoned scout Pete Nolan . And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantankerous character of a cook you could ask for as " Wishbone".<br /><br />And then there 's that great theme song , performed by the immortal Frankie Laine . ( Between that and the " Maverick " theme , I 've got Western theme songs running through my head all day.)<br /><br />I look forward to every episode ; I 'm collecting the whole set . A good time ( not to mention a moo - ving experience ) is always guaranteed , as one waits to see if the boys will get their difficulties straightened out before the commercial.<br /><br />"Rollin ' , rollin ' , rollin ' . . . "
1 In the Hollywood west those trail hands were a rough bunch who when they came to town , partied pretty hardy . After all trail driving was a lonely business back in the day before railroads got to all parts of the USA . < br /><br />The drovers who worked for trail boss Gil Favor as played by Eric Fleming were no different . But Fleming was a man of all business , he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it . < br /><br />With the long run of Rawhide and the fact that the regulars stayed with it for the most part , we got to know all the drovers at some point . A some point story lines were focused around all of them , though the bulk were with Fleming and Clint Eastwood 's character Rowdy Yates , the number 2 guy with the herd.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood 's western image was molded by Rawhide , it 's a shame that these are not shown more often . Probably because they were done in black and white . Had this been an NBC show , this would have been done in color like Bonanza and be running as often as those shows are . We 'd get to see a lot more of a man who became a move legend.<br /><br />Ironically enough it was Eric Fleming who left the show before it closed to do films . He did a few them and was hoping the show would give him a bankable movie name . Sadly he was killed on a movie location doing an action film , drowned in a river . Had he lived he might have become a name like Eastwood's.<br /><br />Clint took over as trail boss in the last season and then the show completed its run . And he of course became the icon he is today and not just in the western genre.<br /><br />Rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys in it . No frills in this one , these were working cowboys just doing a job and battling the elements and whatever situations they were thrown into every year.<br /><br />They really do n't make television series like these any more . What a pity .
1 This film was made in 1943 when i think Judy was at her peak ( looks wise ) . In her previous film For Me and My Gal people often say that she looks emaciated . Well in this film she looks perfect . She is beautiful and shows that she has a flair for comedy.<br /><br />I think this film is hilarious , especially at the beginning when she is trying to arrange an audition with John Thornway . One of the funniest scene 's in my opinion is Judy 's rendition of Lady Macbeth and when John is looking for her at the party to give her a spanking ( Lol).<br /><br />One criticism i do have is that there is a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love . I mean one minute he despises her and the next they are going out on a date then the next time they meet after that date they are in love.<br /><br />Another point i did n't like was on opening night . If i were Lily i would be furious with John but she isn't ... it just does n't make sense.<br /><br />But all in all i would have to give this film a 10 because it is just wonderful and almost perfect .
1 Presenting Lily Mars may have provided Judy Garland with one of the easier roles she had while at MGM because Lily Mars is definitely a character she could identify with . A young girl with talent enough for ten , she knows she has what it takes to make it in the theater no matter how much producer Van Heflin from her home town discourages her.<br /><br />I really liked Judy in this one as the girl determined to make it in the theater . Because it is Judy Garland with the talent of Judy Garland you in the audience know she has the right stuff even if it takes Van Heflin nearly the whole movie to be convinced.<br /><br />Both Judy and Heflin hail from the same small town , Heflin 's dad was the town doctor who delivered her and Heflin while he may have moved away and become a big producer on Broadway , their respective moms , Fay Bainter and Spring Byington have kept in touch . That 's her entrée , but Heflin 's constantly barraged with stagestruck kids , but never anyone quite like Lily Mars.<br /><br />No real big song hits came out of Presenting Lily Mars for Garland , though she sings all her numbers . The best in the film is a revival of that gaslight era chestnut , Every Little Movement Has A Meaning All Its Own . Judy sings it with Connie Gilchrist playing the cleaning lady in a Broadway theater where Heflin 's show is being produced . Gilchrist was a star back in the days of the FloraDora Girls and she and Judy deliver the song in grand style with Connie . It 's the best scene in the film as Gilchrist encourages Judy to keep at it . Composer Karl Hoschna had died a long time ago , but lyricist Otto Harbach was still alive and I 'm betting he liked what he heard.<br /><br />European musical star Marta Eggerth is in Presenting Lily Mars as the show 's star who 's at first bemused , then angry and finally , understanding of Garland and Heflin . She did a couple of films with MGM and then went back to Europe for more work on the continent . I 'm betting MGM did n't quite know what to do with her and her thick Hungarian accent , though Louis B. Mayer never met a soprano he did n't like.<br /><br />Van Heflin does well as the patient producer who puts up with a lot from Garland and Eggerth . Heflin was just coming off his Oscar for Johnny Eager the previous year and he and Garland would n't appear to be an ideal screen team , but they 're not bad together.<br /><br />Presenting Lily Mars is a fine showcase for the talents of Judy Garland . And she did n't have to share the screen in another backstage film with Mickey Rooney .
1 almost every review of this movie I 'd seen was pretty bad . It 's not pretty bad , it 's actually pretty good , though not great . The Judy Garland character could have gotten annoying , but she did n't allow it to . Somewhere along the line , i 've become a fan of brooding , overbearing , overacting Van Heflin , at least in the early 40 's . Judy 's singing is great , but the film missed a great chance by not showing more of their relationship . I gave it a 7 .
1 < br /><br />Presenting Lily Mars is one of a genre of film that sadly seems to have disappeared with the studio system . Ok now that you know my bias , here are some reasons I think this movie does stand out.<br /><br />1 . Although the basic plot - Lily Mars ( Judy Garland ) goes to New York , becomes a star , and wins the heart of her director ( Van Heflin ) is a pretty stock Hollywood story of the period , the writers do vary the theme her a bit more than usual . Although Lily gets her big break when the star quits , she is n't successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show.<br /><br />2 . Judy Garland ( enough said!)<br /><br />3 . The supporting cast includes some really great performances . Spring Byington as Lily 's mother is truely wonderful , as is Fay Bainter ( the mother of the director - John Thornway ( Van Heflin ) ) . The standout supporting performance though goes to character actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie , a one time actress turned theater custodian.<br /><br />Worth a watch for sure . One of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams .
1 Presenting Lily Mars is a real pleasant little film which showcases the comedy skills of actress Judy Garland , along with her standard singing moments . The plot consists of Lily Mars tagging along after producer John Thornway for her big break . I think the comedy is light and nothing too heavy here . I really recommend this film for everyone . Judy is breathtaking in this role !
1 Presenting Lily Mars ( MGM , 1943 ) is a cute film , but in my opinion it could have been better . Judy Garland is great as always , but some scenes in the film seem out of place and the romance between her and Van Heflin develops all too quickly.<br /><br />I mean , one minute he 's ready to beat her butt , but the next minute he falls in love with her . I believe that this production , the film editing , and the script ( even though the photography was great , the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice as well ) could have been a little better . It feels as though the production was too rushed . < br /><br />The supporting cast was good as well , especially little Janet Chapman as the second youngest daughter daughter Rosie . She at the age of 11 , looks really cute and it 's a shame that she did n't develop into a teenage comic actress . She 's much better in this film than in her previous films as Warner Brothers in the late 1930 's ( except for Broadway Musketeers 1938 , she 's really good in that ) , when they tried to make her into a Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason hybrid . Overall , this film could better , but in the end , Judy gave it her all .
1 In this 1943 film , Judy Garland is deemed not to be ready for the big - time yet by the man who loves her - Van Heflin . This film was certainly a big change for Mr. Heflin , especially after his supporting Oscar win the year before in " Johnny Eager." < br /><br />Wasn't Spring Byington too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children , with four of them appearing to look like her grandchildren?<br /><br />The singing and dancing are just marvelously staged but the way that the blossoming romance between Heflin and Garland was depicted left a lot to be desired . It was a Gigi - like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a charmer .
1 Lily Mars , a smalltown girl living in Indiana , dreams of making it big on Broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit . Lily tries everything she can to get Thornway to notice her , but he just gets annoyed with her antics . When Thornway goes back to New York to stage his show , Lily follows ( unknown to John of course ) and Thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show , only as a favor to her family , however Thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms , which makes the show 's leading lady , Isabel Rekay , jealous . When Isabel gets fed up with the John - Lily romance causing friction with the show , she leaves , and John decides to make Lily the star . Isabel returns later , and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play , which also may jeopardize the romance . Very charming film , and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comedic touches into her role ( her reading of Lady MacBeth , while supposed to be humorous , never threatened her singing career ) I enjoyed Heflin 's character ( Thornway ) more when he was annoyed with Lily rather than be the romantic . The film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes were n't assembled that well together , but a very enjoyable film . Rating , 7 .
1 Once again the two bickering professors must join together to save the lost world . The five members of the first expedition return ( see The Lost World , 1992 , for a list of actors ) . A man seeking oil brings a drilling crew to the plateau . Instead of striking oil they tap an underground volcano which threatens all life in the Lost World . The oil crew clash with the native people and the scientific expedition . Although the situation looks hopeless .... ( I 'm not going to tell you the ending ) .
1 Return To the Lost World was filmed back - to - back with the 1992 version of The Lost World.<br /><br />In this sequel , the same five people , lead by Challenger return to the plateau where a group has started drilling for oil which is threatening to destroy the land . Gomez has something to do with this . They manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau is saved , much to the delight of the natives.<br /><br />Like in The Lost World , what few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a T - Rex and Ankylosaurus.<br /><br />John Ryhs - Davies and David Warner reprise their roles as Challenger and Summerlee and three of the other actors are also back.<br /><br />Despite reading several bad reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs , I enjoyed Return to the Lost World.<br /><br />Rating : 3 stars out of 5 .
1 With a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $ 60 million the people at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job.<br /><br />They have combined state - of - the - art digital animation , the perfectly cast voice talents of Ray Romano , John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary ( among many others ) to create a highly entertaining , family film with a strong message about cooperation , friendship and caring for your fellow herd members . And how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd.<br /><br />While watching this film I got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space -- maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders!<br /><br />David Newman -- yet another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers -- provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and , at times , is positively toe tapping.<br /><br />The overall look of the film is incredible ; an intensely coloured , strangely believable fantasyland of snow , geysers , mud , rocks and ice . The individual characters were delightfully believable too , with the facial expressions of Ray Romano 's Manfred ' being a particular treat.<br /><br />The entire sequence with the DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the expression ` Dumb as a DoDo comes from.'<br /><br />This is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized -- but real nonetheless.<br /><br />It would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home .
1 I 'd have to say this is one of the best animated films I 've ever seen . I liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing , just a few weeks ago . I can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office . Apparently , a lot of people liked this movie.<br /><br />A gorgeous color palette ( man , this looks good ) and a lot of good adult ( but clean ) humor make this a big winner . The opening 3 - 4-minute scene with " Scat , " is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him . " Sid " the sloth ( voiced by John Leguizano ) , however , provides the main humor in the movie . He usually has something funny to say throughout the movie.<br /><br />Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth , the big character of the film , literally , while Denis Leary is the ferocious bad - guy - turned - good sabertooth tiger < br /><br />This is n't just humor and pretty colors but a nice , sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters . This is n't interrupted with a lot of songs , either : one only brief one and there is nothing offensive , language - wise.<br /><br />If more animated movies were this good , I 'd own more .
1 This is obviously aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek , but is different in its less cartoony feel ( despite the deliberately cartoony characteristics of the lead creatures ) . The story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end ( its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeves ) but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different " animals . " You know the outcome , but you ca n't help being drawn in.<br /><br / > The characters themselves are far more than their voices ( the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices ) , unlike most Disney movies . They are well rounded and completely believable , strangely . The group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable . You will find yourself rooting for them far sooner than you would like to think.<br /><br / > The animation is brilliant , as you would expect , and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie . You will fall in love with the characters , especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempts to bury its nuts . I came out wanting the obligatory merchandise , especially the sloth toy , only to be disappointed the next day when I could n't find anything vaguely related.<br /><br />Which , strangely , makes the movie all the more pure.<br /><br / > Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek .
1 I first saw Ice Age in the Subiaco Cinemas when it came out , back in ' 02 . I was only 13 at the time , but even then I liked it . It had some sort of warmth.<br /><br />We've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it , it never gets boring . This is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3D animations made at the time - The characters have no particular ' home ' which they leave . They are nomads , and that 's really refreshing and uplifting to watch.<br /><br />Also , each individual character on the surface , appear to be just putting up with each other , but they 're really all good friends . As well , all of the characters have their own charms ( even the bad guys ) . Sid the sloth is charming in his annoying , over - affectionate and naive sort of way . Manny is adorable in his depressed , reclusive character , and so on and so forth.<br /><br />Another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation . All the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay , giving the film an artistic edge.<br /><br />Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie , is that gender means very little . There are hardly any female characters , but you do n't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film . Due to this , there 's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age.<br /><br />All in all , Ice Age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out .
1 Just saw ICE AGE , a very funny and especially nice looking film . The story is simple but effective , the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design.<br /><br />More inspired by traditional animated movies than reality , the designs give you a really , really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour . Sometimes the touches of reality shine through ( especially the water was impressive ) , but nonetheless , it 's a fantasy - world based on reality . Including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering.<br /><br />Pixar films shine with technical brilliance , this one shines with effective uses of technical know - how.<br /><br />Enough technical babble , the film 's entertaining , family - friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny .
1 I saw the movie with two grown children . Although it was not as clever as Shrek , I thought it was rather good . In a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break , there was not a sound so I know the children all liked it . There parents also seemed engaged . The death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments . Hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids . As such , it was successful although I liked it too . Personally I liked the Scrat ! !
1 I watched ' Ice Age'in the movie theater and I liked the movie . Spite of the fact that ' Ice Age'has many flaws and scientific errors , like humans , sabers , dinosaurs and mammoths living at the same period , and even the location of where the story passes(looks North America , but has some characteristics from Iceland for example ) we can have fun even so.(unless you are very severe ! ) < br /><br />The planet is entering an ICE AGE , and many animals are immigrating to the south where is warmer . Sid is a stupid Sloth that is left behind by his own family , that ca n't stand him any longer . Walking in his way , he meets Manfred , or how he calls '' Manny '' a moody mammoth who does not care about extinction or immigration and is going to the north . Worried that he can easily be captured , Sid decides to follow Manfred , and in the middle of their journey , they found a human mother with her baby . The mother dies but Manfred and Sid decides to take him and return the baby for the humans . Diego , one of the sabers , decides to follow and help them to go to a shortcut to the human 's camp . What Manfred and Sid does not know , is that Diego is from a saber clan who hates humans and wants to kill the baby , and also pretend to betray they both to make they become saber 's food . What will happen , will depend of Diego 's behavior and conscience ... <br /><br />aka " A Era do Gelo " - Brazil
1 I thought that Ice Age was an excellent movie ! As a woman of 30 , with no children , I still seem to really enjoy these humorous , witty animated movies . Sid is the best character I have seen in some time , better than Bartok in Anastasia ( although he was really humorous , and I did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten ) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar . I have seen the movie at least 15 times ( I own it obviously ) and I quote the movie at work ( on many occasions ... yes , still ) . My favourite scene is the part where Sid says " Oh , oh , oh , I love this game ! " and Sid and Manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the " tigers" ... "Pack of wolves , pack of bears , pack of fleas , pack of whiskers , pack of noses , pack a derm ? , pack of lies , pack of troubles , pack a wallop , pack of birds , pack of flying fish ... " or however that part goes ! That is THE funniest part about the whole movie , although I also really enjoyed the humour behind " putting sloths on the map " and many other parts as well . The only animated movie that can remotely compare to Ice Age is " Brother Bear " .
1 Finally I got to see the infamous " Ice Age " . Apart from maybe not being as dead funny as I 'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word I can say about it . Sure , it 's not as glamorous as a Disney production(besides , it is Fox 's 1st attempt at a full length CG movie ) but it 's got immense heart and on some occasions(like the look in Manfred 's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past ) I found myself on the verge of tears . But when they reunited the baby with its father I just could n't hold them in anymore . A movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and cliché and manages to bring more than the best out of it ; the end result being one of the most touching animated creations I have ever seen . Great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you(and great voice talents as well ) and many funny memorable scenes , especially from Scrat 's behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go . Plus the Dodo scene , which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002.<br /><br />I honestly do n't get it , but for some reason it really looks like CG animation will be taking the upper hand in the future . But if it just means that there will be more movies like this one ( and who can forget Pixar 's creations ) then I do n't really mind , at least for now . 9/10
1 " Ice Age " is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by Blue Sky Studios and released in 2002 as the company 's first . We are introduced to the main characters : a squirrel named Scrat ( voiced by Chris Wedge , AND PLEASE NOTE : the sound of Scrat 's screams is the sound of Tom 's screams from the " Tom and Jerry " cartoons ) , a woolly mammoth named Manny ( voiced by Ray Romano of " Everybody Loves Raymond " ) , a sloth named Sid ( voiced by John Leguizamo of " Titan A. E. " ) , and a saber toothed tiger named Diego ( voiced by Denis Leary of Pixar 's " A Bug 's Life").<br /><br />The movie opens with Scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that , he caused an avalanche . We then see a herd going south for the coming Ice Age ( except for Manny , who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him ) . Sid comes out of his cave yawning , and saw that his family abandoned him . He then pays toll with some aardvarks . Unfortunately , he gets pursued by Sylvia ( voiced by Kirsten Johnston of " 3rd Rock from the Sun " ) , a female orange sloth , who wants Sid to go migrating with her . Sid eventually teams up with Manny , and they became friends.<br /><br />Meanwhile , nearby a human tribe , Soto ( voiced by Goran Visnjic ) , an evil saber toothed tiger , wants revenge against the tribe 's leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son , Roshan , away from him . In the morning , he , Diego , and Soto 's henchmen , Lenny ( voiced by Alan Tudyk ) , Oscar ( voiced by Diedrich Bader ) , and Zeke ( voiced by Jack Black ) attacked the tribe , but the leader 's wife escaped with Roshan and gave him to Manny and Sid to look after . Eventually , Diego joins them , and went on a journey to return Roshan back to his tribe , who are also looking for him as well . Relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out , okay ? Besides Manny , Sid , Diego , Scrat , Sylvia , and Roshan , the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that Roshan 's tribe are using , and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named Jennifer ( voiced by Jane Krakowski ) , and a skinny female yellow sloth named Rachel ( voiced by Lorri Bagley ) , to whom Sid shows them Roshan as they relax in a tar pit . Incidentally , the two rhinos , Carl ( voiced by Cedric The Entertainer of PDI 's " Madagascar " ) , and Frank ( voiced by Stephen Root of Pixar 's " Finding Nemo " ) , who go after Sid for ruining their meal and confront Manny on a cliff , are simple minor characters . Same went for the dodos , who are using melons as their food supply.<br /><br />The gags in this movie are very funny . For instance , Manny talks through his trunk saying , " I'M NOT GOING ! " When Jennifer and Rachel are out of the tar pit , Sid asks Jennifer " What do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens ? " Jennifer then responds to him , " What do you say if you go jump into the TAR PIT ! ? " Rachel also then kicks Sid in the waist . Sylvia sees Diego holding Sid by the neck with his teeth , then she asks Sid if he 's holding his breath , tells Diego to eat him , and promptly walks off.<br /><br />Since " Ice Age " is not only a success , but it has 2 sequels : the first one was " Ice Age : The Meltdown " , which was released in 2006 , and the other was " Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs " , which is going to be releasing next year . I can hardly die waiting to see what " Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs " will be like .
1 This movie had no parts that were hilarious , mostly just average funny units , but it did not have any parts that were really bad either . The worst part was the voice of Sid . His slothy slur was just too much for me . By about 5 minutes in I was sick of hearing him talk . Aside from the annoying sloth voice the movie was good . There were numerous side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better . This is a good movie for kids . It has enough in it to keep adults content and enough in it to entertain kids . This one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them .
1 Ice Age is not only Animation of the Year ( in my eyes ) it 's also the best animated feature I 've ever seen!<br /><br />The teaser excited me last year and I 've spent many happy hours on the website . Scrat is cool ! And so are the rest of the Sub Zero Heroes.<br /><br />The animation is superb . Your heart really goes out to the characters in this film . They have good lines of dialogue and are well developed . It 's hard to say which one really steals the picture.<br /><br />I experienced their journey with laughter , tears and amazement . Nothing was forced or over done . The emotion was genuine , especially in the dramatic second half . The last film to affect me this deeply was Anastasia in 1997 , also a Fox Production . And before that it was The Land Before Time 1988 . All possess real charm and seek to entertain all the audience , not just the cynics . 10/10 < br /><br / >
1 I would n't go so far as to not recommend this movie , since the only problems I have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems . That does n't make it bad , just not something I 'd go far.<br /><br />It is a little saccharine , so I might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for - kids movie like this.<br /><br />However , all of that goes out the window when that squirrel ( the one in all the trailers ) comes on - screen . His time is limited , but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys ' hey , could you stick in a little more squirrel ? ' every time it 's getting intolerably dull . That does n't save the movie , but you can leave saying ' at least there was one aspect where I could n't stop laughing.'<br /><br />And of course , visually it wo n't disappoint , but that 's almost a given with Pixar flicks . Of all of their stuff , I 'd put this at the bottom ... but that is n't in itself bad .
1 While I loved this movie , the trailers that circulated the internet the year before it hit theaters set my expectations a bit high.<br /><br />I own the DVD , so do n't get me wrong , I am not saying do n't watch it or even buy it ! It 's just that I still think the first scene was the best , and nothing throughout the entire movie ever topped it .
1 ( spoilers??)<br /><br />I was n't sure what to think of the movie . Not too much of a kids film . Definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying . But I was surprised that I was a bit entertained by it.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had . ( even less without the credits ) And the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature . But alas , they torture him . Right until the end of the movie . Those two gripes docked the movie 2 stars . But I do recommend the movie . Even for a sequel.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Quality : 9/10 Entertainment : 7/10 Replayable:7/10
1 The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood , Jr. is n't a particularly good documentary . Aesthetically , it 's lackluster and cheap looking , the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in - cohesive , but this adds to it 's charm . I say this because it 's a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and , as such , there 's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits . There are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of Wood , and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary . Overall , it 's worth a watch for the Wood fan and those of cinema in general , but do n't expect brilliance here . Expect a documentary made after Wood 's own heart .
1 Any story comprises a premise , characters and conflict . Characters plotting their own play promises triumph , and a militant character readily lends oneself to this . Ardh Satya 's premise is summarized by the poem of the same name scripted by Dilip Chitre . The line goes - " ek palde mein napunsaktha , doosre palde mein paurush , aur teek tarazu ke kaante par , ardh satya ? " . A rough translation - " The delicate balance of right & wrong ( commonly seen on the busts of blind justice in the courts ) has powerlessness on one plate and prowess on another . Is the needle on the center a half - truth ? " < br /><br />The poem is recited midway in the film by Smita Patil to Om Puri at a resturant . It makes a deep impact on the protagonist & lays the foundation for much of the later events that follow . At the end of the film , Om Puri ends up in exactly the same situation described so aptly in the poem.<br /><br />The film tries mighty hard to do a one - up on the poem . However , Chitre 's words are too powerful , and at best , the film matches up to the poem in every aspect.<br /><br / >
1 Govind Nihalani 's directorial venture of Vijay Tendulkar 's novel is brilliant . Om Puri plays an inspector Velankar who is forced to protect underworld don rama shetty , played brilliantly by sadahiv amrapurkar . This is Govind Nihlan 's Most talked about movie . This is a very good and a classic film . Smita Patil plays the female lead opposite Om Puri . Naseeruddin Shah is brilliant in a cameo role . Although Sadashiv Amrapurkar has only 4 scenes in the movie he dominates the movie . This was Sadashiv Amrapurkars acting debut . Om Puri won a national award for this film for the best actor . Filmfare award winner for Best Film , Story , Supporting Actor(Sadashiv Amrapurkar ) .
1 An absolute classic ! ! The direction is flawless , the acting is just superb . Words fall short for this great work . The most definitive movie on Mumbai Police . This movie has stood the test of times.<br /><br />Om Puri gives a stellar performance , Smita Patil no less . All the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment . This movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society.<br /><br />This is the story of a cop ( Om Puri ) who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer . The first attempt in Bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about Mumbai cops . Kudos to Nihalani ! ! < br /><br />After this movie a slew of Bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal - politician - police nexus . Thus this movie was truly a trend setter . This trend dominated the Hindi movie scene for more than a decade . < br /><br />This movie was a moderate box office hit . < br /><br />A must - see for discerning movie fans .
1 " Ardh Satya " is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema . Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani , this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success . Even today , Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India.<br /><br />The film tells the Real - life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s . Unlike any Police of other cities in India , Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether . Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.<br /><br />Amongst various Police officers & colleagues , the film describes the story of Anand Velankar , a young hot - blooded Cop coming from a poor family . His father is a harsh Police Constable . Anand himself suffers from his father 's ideologies & incidences of his father 's Atrocities on his mother . Anand 's approach towards immediate action against crime , is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction . The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand 's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors . This leads to frustrations , as he can not achieve the desired Job - satisfaction . Resulting from the frustrations , his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars , also turning him to an alcoholic.<br /><br />The Spirit within him is still alive , as he constantly fights the system . He is aware of the system of the Metro , where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end . His compromise towards unethical practice is negative . Finally he gets suspended.<br /><br />The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core . One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty 's house to arrest him , followed by short conversation which is fantastic . At many scenes , the film has Hair - raising moments.<br /><br />The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch . Alcoholism , Corruption , Political Influence , Courage , Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today . Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.<br /><br />Finally , the films belongs to the One man show , Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly .
1 After ' Aakrosh ' , this was the second film for Govind Nihalani as a director . Till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in India . This movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence . It was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released . This movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood like'COOLIE ' , ' BETAAB','HERO ' in 1983.<br /><br />SmithaPatel , in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him . She was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs . At one time , she even gave up her love when the hero 's ruthlessness touched the roof top.<br /><br />There was another character in this movie , which was played by Om Puri contemporary , Naseeruddin Shah . He played as an inspector - turned - alcoholic character . The role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero 's ending.<br /><br />In his debut film , Sadashiv Amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare . The cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent . The anger which left half handedly continued in Govind Nihalani 's other film " Drohkaal " . Even after two decades , this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew . Each one played their part par excellence .
1 Directed by Govind Nihalani , this is definite cop film of Indian cinema . May be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force & politics with no holds barred & how it effects on a young cop . A man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father . Agreed that we grew up watching lot of good cop / bad cop Hindi films but this is different . Today 's generation , which grown up watching dark & realistic films like- ' Satya ' , ' Company ' may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making . The film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people did n't pay much attention to such kind of cinema & yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class & mass audience when it released . For Om Puri its first breakthrough in mainstream Hindi cinema & he delivered a class performance as Inspector Velankar . Its more than cop character , he internalized a lot which is something original in acting . Watch his scenes with his father whom he hates & Smita whom he loves . Smita Patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level . My God what a natural expressions she carried ! ! ! Shafi Inamdar was truly a discovery for me & he 's a brilliant character actor if given a chance & here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even Om . The movie is also a debut of a promising villain on Indian screen- Sadashiv Amrapurkar as ' Rama Shetty ' . It 's another story that he did n't get such a meaty role & almost forgotten today as one of the loud villain of Dharmendra 's B grade action films . Watch the scene where Om 1st time becomes a rebel for his father ( played by Amrish Puri ) & next both are sharing wine together . How inner truth started revealing for both the character with confronting feelings of love & hate for each other . Two faces of Indian Police Force- Masculinity & Impotency and in between lies- half truth ( ardh satya )  Kudos to Nihalani 's touch . The film won 2 National Awards as Best Hindi Feature Film & Best Actor- Om Puri & 3 Filmfare Awards in Best Film , Best Director & Best Supporting Actor Categories . < br /><br />Recommended to all who are interested in nostalgia of serious Hindi films.<br /><br />Ratings- 8/10
1 The performance by Om Puri , Smita Patil , and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely , along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by Govind Nihlani . The dialogues by Vijay Tendulkar is also great . < br /><br />I have not seen another movie like this . It is one whole , each piece so nicely fit in the plot . You can not not be impressed by this movie . < br /><br />Amrish Puri comes off as the bossy husband and ' baap ' of Om Puri . Om Puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system . Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain . The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Rama Shetty 's at Sadhashiv 's place is absoulely stunning . Smita Patil does not play a main role , but her part is also not distracting from the main plot . < br /><br />And to add to this all Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings . Saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble . He is also the ' guru ' of Om Puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble.<br /><br />The movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody . Om Puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in Ardh Satya . < br /><br />A treat to all avid fans of Indian cinema .
1 I 've spent years looking for a copy of this film(16mm , dvd , vhs ) , so I could show it to my kids . The movie is funny , and Spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business . They had to be that good to play that demented . I like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages.<br /><br />The movie is about a turn of the century firehouse , with a crew of misfits that are firemen and the department band ( when not fighting the fires ) . There 's the usual running gags , plus the mayhem of Spike Jones and his Orchestra . Also , comedy relief provided by comedian Buddy Hackett and straight - man Hugh O'Brien .
1 I have to start saying it has been a long time since I have seen it , but have seen it 5 or more times ; a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical / comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence . Kay Kyser 's mysteries would be a good example.<br /><br />Having Spike Jones unleashed is the best part of the show , as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action , doing a fine job of support . Hugh O'Brien plays the face , Buddy Hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to Lou Costello and thus , Abbott and Costello replacing the leads . Do n't know if that was true.<br /><br />all in all , a pleasant movie , but important to have that much Spike Jones and his band on film for history . Wish that it was released , as I have n't seen or heard of it now in two decades . Hope it is not lost
1 Dominion tank police is an exercise in contradictive film making . The storyline across the 4 parts blends mindless action , slap - stick humor , touching humanity and thought provoking philosophical questions . It 's hard to believe that there was only one director , as the style changes from episode to episode . A must - see movie for anyone who likes anime .
1 I stumbled across this ( Act - I ) by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago . This was'nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned . It amazed me . It intimidated me . It shocked me . I eventually forgot about and almost a decade later , I happened to think about it again . Then went and bought both acts . They were even better than I had experienced at first.<br /><br />My only complaint is that while the Tank Police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime , warranting tanks and heavy artillery , it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals . That is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time . If that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda , it certainly has not been shown as such.<br /><br />I do n't think the original Japanese version could have been any where as good as the Americanized version of this . But regarding the story , there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused .
1 The anime that got me hooked on anime ... <br /><br />Set in the year 2010 ( hey , that 's not too far away now ! ) the Earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence . Seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists , the government of the fictional New Port City form the Tank Police to deal with the problem - cops with tanks ! Oh the insanity!<br /><br />The " heroes " of this series include the new recruit Leona Ozaki , a red haired Japanese woman ( yeah I know , they never match their distinctly Japanese names with a Japanese appearance ) who has just been drafted into the Tank Police and is quickly partnered with blond , blue eyed nice guy Al . Leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of Tank Police Commander Charles Britain ( also known as " Brenten " ) , a big guy who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses , a big revolver and a bad temper . Britain did n't like having Leona join the Tank Police in the first place and her wrecking his Tiger Special ( a giant green monster tank ) does n't exactly endear her to him , nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini - tank that she nicknames Bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare " where the boys are more your size " as he puts it . There 's also Specs , the bifocal genius , Bible quoting / God fearing Chaplain , purple MO - hawked Mohican , and the pot bellied Chief , who 's right on the edge thanks to the Mayor always yelling at him about the Tank Police antics . Seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them , they 're not very well liked by the people.<br /><br />The " villains " are a cyborg named Buaku who 's got a mysterious past that 's connected with a project known as " Green Peace " , his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks Anna & Uni Puma . In the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who have n't been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd they 're hired to steal a painting that is of a naked Buaku . The story , however , was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic ( " Manga " ) book that 's very hard to find.<br /><br />All sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred . This is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it , you 'd better go get Quentin Tarantino . Uneven in places but still a lot of fun.<br /><br />Followed by " New Dominion : Tank Police " .
1 Dominion Tank Police is without a shell of a doubt , one of the most amazing shows ever produced , but not just in the field of animation . While the first part ( Acts 1 and 2 ) mostly consists of action and fun , the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part . The subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant . You must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second Part ( Acts-3 and 4 ) . I do have some complaints though . In the first part , the Tank Bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all . One might also question the plausibility of Bonaparte jumping on the wing of Helicopter Gunship even though it was cool . Buaku rules .
1 One of the first OVA 's ( " original video animation " ) I ever bought , this still has to be one of my favourite anime titles . A cyberpunk sci - fi action comedy set against an unlikely ( for a comedy , that is ) background of near - future pollution in a dystopian society.<br /><br />The " heroes " of Dominion are the Tank Police , formed with a " if we ca n't beat crime , we 'll get bigger guns " philosophy , and who are , like the name suggests , patrolling the city in tanks instead of patrol cars , and who are actually far more dangerous than any criminals they are trying to catch . Most , if not all , of these cops are borderline ( ? ) psychopaths and neurotics , giving new meaning to the phrase " loose cannons".<br /><br />Equally colourful and amusing are their adversaries , terrorist Buaku and his hench(wo)men , the Twin Cat Sisters , whose existence always seems to involve giving the Tank Police a hard time.<br /><br />The animation is not state of the art , but it 's very nice otherwise ; the colourful palette and cartoonish look of the characters and mecha fit nicely with the comedic atmosphere of Dominion.<br /><br />The English dubbing is , again , lots of fun . The soundtrack of the English version is also very good . I wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album of that ... <br /><br />Anyway , Dominion Tank Police is great . It 's Japanese cyberpunk SF with lots of comedy , filled with completely over - the - top characters and situations , making sure that it never takes itself seriously . Highly recommended .
1 Robert Standish 's novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a Ceylonese tea plantation ... So the events of the Ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to William Dieterle 's film ... <br /><br />The story is about a rich powerful planter ( Peter Finch ) , who brings a charming and tender beauty ( Elizabeth Taylor ) , into the jungle as his bride ... The plantation , of course , is endangered by some kind of wild life ... For this reason Taylor  elegant as never in dazzling costumes  finds herself in a strange atmosphere ... The echo determination of a ghost , the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father , a highly dangerous disease , and the fury of wild animals ... <br /><br />In her confusion , boredom and annoyance Elizabeth Taylor looks to a friendly face , a pretentious foreman ( Dana Andrews ) , who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love ... <br /><br />With echoes of " Jane Eyre , " the mysterious Yorkshire mansion with a brooding master , and " Rebecca , " the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife , " Elephant Walk " is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow , exotic dances with rage excessively colorful , stampeding big bull elephants , amazing mansion set on fire , all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent ... <br /><br />The movie gave Liz a change of scenery , and allowed her more creative energy and self - respect than most of her other willful debutante - rebels   The wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will , and so Taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for
