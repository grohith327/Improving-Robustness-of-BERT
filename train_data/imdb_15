0 Start of with the good bit : several times Swayze talks Zulu to his friends or that language is heard among the tribes . That 's a great plus , as normally USA & UK movie audiences think all people on this planet speak English ( just in case you 're one of them : no they don't).<br /><br />But the acting is ' tenenkrommend ' as we say in The Netherlands ( it makes your toes curl -and not in a good way ) . I like Swayze but in this he 's awful . The muscles in his jaws make overtime and he 's frowning the whole movie -some one must have told him it looks butch . No Patrick : it looks silly and is compensation for lack of character . Alison Doody ( Elizabeth ) has opted for a style of acting that does not meet the style of her co - workers . Her acting is só relaxed that this movie could have been set in the current days . And it 's not . Your frock was a clue , Alison.<br /><br />The best acting came from the people from the African Continent and Sided Onyulo as Umbopa I liked best . Clear , warm and in character , his performance is a joy to watch . < br /><br />General : it is mwah - entertaining on a rainy day . Pity . Could have been better . Sack the director .
0 This is the worst imaginable crap . The novel by H. Rider Haggard is very entertaining and dramatic . The makers of this worthless movie do n't follow it closely . Well , old novels are n't sacred and making free versions of them is fine with me if one has ideas of one 's own . If all one can do is changing things and replace them with uninteresting and watered - down clichés one should stick to the original . If they had done that this film would have been at least twice as good even with worse actors and if filmed inside a studio with huts made of cardboard . BUt there 's no imagination at all only tiredness . This should be bought or watched only by collectors of Victorian novels made into movies.<br /><br />Just a hint , and not a spoiler I think , to make those of you who have read the novel understand what has taken place and what you may expect if you decide to watch this on TV or - God forbid - waste money on buying this . Gagool an old baddie witch in the book and some precursor to Gollum has been turned into a nice gal !
0 I picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of " Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom " . Unfortunately I was in for a virtual yawn . Not like any yawn i have had before though . This yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie . The cover described amazing special effects . There were none . The movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed . It does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence . Good if you want to teach your kids that . I do n't . Keep away from this one . If you are looking for family entertainment then you might find something that is more inspiring elsewhere .
0 Swayze does n't make a very convincing Alan Quatermain . Compared to Stewart Granger ; which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 " Scaramouche " , the 1952 " Prisoner of Zenda " and the 1950 " King Solomon 's Mines " ; Patrick Swayze fails utterly . Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in " League of Extraordinary Gentlemen " was very good in an otherwise big flop . Also Alison Doody lacks the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading lady , and last but not least the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it very hard for anyone to fill his ( shoes ) ! ! ! For someone who was disappointed by Richard Chamberlain 's 1985 version , I now highly recommend it if you ca n't get your hand on the granger version .
0 I give 3 stars only for the beautiful pictures of Africa . The rest was ... well pretty boring . For about 50min we have the outline of the plot ... In War of the worlds , the introductory part lasted , oh , about 10min ? Then was real action ! This is something like:"Let 's take a walk in the savanna and gasp at the beautiful sunsets ! " . And maybe deliver a message , like " Do n't kill elephants ! " . Very ecological . I would have expected this out of a " new " Steven Segal movie , not from this ... The leading actress makes me think about artificial sun - tan , dyed hair and too much foundation ! And I did n't see one scene where her hair is messed up , or she sweats , or her clothes are dusty . She just does n't look like a 19 century woman ! And in the bar , where they seek up our hero , Swayze makes a comment about the commander that he looks like Dracula . Hmmm , Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896 , and it became famous in the next years . Livingstone and other explorers went to central Africa from 1840 to 1880 . So unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900 .. Houston , we have a problem . :) Swayze makes a nice impression .. as a nutshell - hard on the outside , but soft and cuddly on the inside . Not that I would cuddle with a nut , but you get the point . He really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his face on several occasions . The movie stank . Way too long and increasingly boring . do n't watch it ! Do n't buy it ! It 's a waste of your money !
0 Well ! What can one say ? Firstly , this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours , for the complexity ( or lack of such ) of the plot . The actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available . Swayzee is really NOT a Quatermain character at all . After seeing Sean Connery 's interpretation of the great man in " The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen " , Swayzee really does not make the grade . This chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength , stature , subtlety , or humour needed for the part , and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor , who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast . Some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography . For example . When the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert , their tracks are visible down to the oasis , just waiting for them to walk in them . Climbing out of the mine leads to an exit ( on the next shot ) nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through , et cetera . I was waiting for Doug McClure to appear at any moment . In some ways I wish he had . < br /><br />The leader of the Russians pursuing Quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything . < br /><br />Swayzee does quite well as the sad father , returned to London , who is unable to obtain the custody of his son . Swayzee should stick to that sort of thing . He is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart , experience of life , and sense of fair play.<br /><br />4 out of 10 . Barely
0 I missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie but do n't think watching it from the beginning would 've made any difference . I found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with the acting . I remember Patrick Swayze and some of the other actors ( Roy Marsden , for instance ) in outstanding roles but they all disappointed here due to a very weak script . " Kind Solomon 's Mines" ... the very short part of the movie inside the " mines " was about as exciting as watching paint dry and I doubt that even a pre - school kid would 've been spell - bound by watching the fight of the " warriors " . The entire movie was reminiscent of a cheaply produced American TV series . Give me Indiana Jones any day !
0 Oh dear . Some of the best talent in British TV made this serial , and so I can only assume that they were working under incredible time pressure , and had to settle for first takes of many scenes.<br /><br />There ARE some frightening scenes in this Highland mystery ( mostly when the " monster " attacks and we see it from his point of view ) , but I 'm afraid that I found most of the story unintentionally funny ! Such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course : Oh look , there 's a hand ... oh , and there 's another hand over there ... hmm this is a bit puzzling ... < br /><br />For many years fans of British cult TV shows campaigned to have this serial released on VHS or DVD , but the BBC always said no . Now I think I understand why !
0 This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Parks and returned the world eye again to what little of the " Wild Western Canada " is left . When Archie began to write his stories for the papers ; the thought of the day was to tame the wilderness and convert / absorb the First Nation Peoples.<br /><br />The film puts forward and asks the question ; why would a well - educated , obviously talented Englishman become an Indian?<br /><br / > Archie , as an English boy dreams about becoming something but grasping the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless - no mater what it is . Sounds like a famous puppet story does n't it.<br /><br / > In my opinion , I saw Archie become my living image of the " Cigar store Indian " a very wooden character and not real at all - very well done acting on the part of Mr. Brosnan . He also portrayed the wild Indian in the dance scene for the tourist . The fullness and or reality of it were n't realized till he met and married his wife , Annie.<br /><br / > Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would bring him to the forefront of the Englishman 's world stage , not as himself but Grey Owl -an Canadian Native of the wilderness frontier.<br /><br / > This is the closest Archie get to becoming the noble savage prototype.<br /><br / > Mr. Brosnan 's interpretation as well as the directors is both well done . I have watched documentaries on Grey Owl and I think this is a good big screen movie to add to my collection.<br /><br />Spoiler - I thought the final scenes with Archie going to meet the Grand Council of Chiefs was a great a great moment in the film.<br /><br / > Very beautiful Canadian lake scenery and real " Grey Owl " locations.<br /><br / >
0 James Bond in the wilderness ? Well , that 's the way it looks : Pierce Brosnan is after all best known as Bond in " Tommorrow Never Dies " ( 1997 ) and " Golden Eye " ( 1995 ) - both shot prior to this release . Frankly , the film 's two leads are both badly miscast , with Brosnan turning in the marginally more convincing performance , and with Annie Galipeau ( as Pony , Grey Owl 's love interest ) having to battle with carelessly - written dialogue.<br /><br />The two aunts , on the other hand are perfect . But the film is not about aunts . It is about the wilds of the Canadian wilderness . And while the photography may be pretty , there is no grit to the harsh reality of living in the wilds . Annie Galipeau , as Pony , just fails to be convincing , unfortunately , because I really wanted to believe in her . She was a relatively inexperienced twenty - year - old on this film , and it could have worked , but Richard Attenborough was maybe just not tough enough on her . He makes her look vulnerable , which of course she is .. but in the wrong sort of way.<br /><br />But one thing for sure , she appears picture - perfect throughout . But mascara and eyebrow thickener in the wilderness ? It just does n't fit , especially as she only ever seems to walk forest trials with Bond ( sorry , Grey Owl ) , and use photo - ops for kissing close - ups.<br /><br />I've lived with forest people in the Pacific North West , and they simply do n't look this pretty and stay so sweet while fighting for survival . Which brings me to another point : the film fails to evoke the period in which it is set : the 1930s . I put the blame here largely on a lack - lustre script that is keen on preaching at the expense of dramatic arc , plot points and those small details that can evoke period through action.<br /><br />William Nicholson wrote the screenplay , and his latest offering , " Elizabeth , the Golden Age " opened three days ago , so I do hope there is an improvement.<br /><br />Yes , I 've read the comments others have posted , but I 'm not convinced . A lot of potential , but mishandled and even maybe ill - conceived . If it had had a religious film , it would have been panned , but because it preaches environmentalism , the film remains somewhat above criticism , since it is " politically correct . " Sorry , for all that , I do n't buy it . Amen .
0 Images are great and reflect well the landscapes of Canada . The story was , on the other side , quite boring ; To my eyes it was a love story in the woods just like Titanic was a love story on a boat . I did not feel that Grey Owl was great environmentalist . I usually like Lord Attenborough but this one was ... bad .
0 It 's a good movie if you plan to watch lots of landscapes and animals , like an animal documentary . And making Pierce Brosnan an indian make you wonder ' Does all those people do n't recognize if someone is n't indian at plain sight ? '
0 ! ! ! ! ! POSSIBLE SPOILER ! ! ! ! ! < br /><br />You`d think a story involving Archie Grey Owl - An Englishman posing as a red indian - would have a massive amount of humour involved . In fact I`d say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy . However Richard Attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making GREY OWL a serious drama . Worse , he`s made an extremely dire film too . Pierce Brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between Grey Owl and Pony ( Played by the equally wooden Annie Gaupeau ) lacks any type of on screen chemistry . But to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray Archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he`s a native American . The producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of Archie being an Englishman - That`s why I wrote " Possible spoiler " it`s not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is English , but it`s obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there`s absolutely no surprise involved.<br /><br />Yes I do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn`t actually a new concept . Theodore Roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told . And it should also be remembered that with the exception of SOYLENT GREEN ( And possibly THE TWO TOWERS if you want to class it as having a green message ) that there hasn`t actually been a great ecological film . In fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes GREY OWL , a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor
0 While flipping through the channels on a late Saturday night , my friends and I stumbled across this film . First of all , Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as a Native American ? Seriously ? ! His accent was breaking through so much , although his character was apparently Scottish . Next , I was stunned to find that this film was made after he had already played James Bond / Agent 007 at least twice . This movie plays up the stereotypes , with the inspiring professor figure . The girl who played Pony should be paid to keep her mouth shut . And , this film won an award ? I can not believe it . Brosnan is an attractive man , but we seriously wanted to gauge our eyes out after watching this for just 10 seconds . We switched from " Kicking and Screaming " to this , and we wanted to switch back . We watched the 1995 children 's classic " The Indian in the Cupboard " earlier in the night , which also discussed the Iroquois . The following line represents our desire to run away : " Take me outside , earth grasper . " From " Grey Owl " : " If you do n't like it , you do n't have to watch . "
0 may contain spoilers ! ! ! ! so i watched this movie last night on LMN ( Lifetime Movie Network ) which is NOT known for showing quality movies . THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL ! i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing , as it was terrible . could this movie contain any more stereotypes ? ( harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor , catholic family with priest sons , big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic family 's house , mexican whores , " bad " guy who is really a softie at heart , incredibly bad country accents ) GAG ! ! ! ! i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it , i decided to stay awake until 4 am to watch it . anyway , the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amick 's beauty . i suppose pollack 's and nemec 's acting is okay , but they have a horrid script to work with . unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents ( the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang ) i think that the accents were there ( in supporting characters like mary margaret 's date and john ) and were unnecessary . they were also very very bad . i am so very tired of hollywood " southern " accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from . and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive , i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town : the beautiful capitol building , the UT tower lit up for a winning football game , etc . none of these things were there . also , it takes about 5 - 6 hours to drive to mexico from austin . at one point in the movie , michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark ( during the summer and early fall it does n't get dark in austin until 9 pm or so ) , spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican ( is there any other kind ? ) whores , and then return to austin by dawn . while this is theoretically possible it is NOT very likely . and if anyone has started school in the hill country ( usually the third week of august , but may have been in september in 1960 ) they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they DO NOT wear their letter jackets ! ! ! ! ! in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90 + degrees . only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school . all in all , a very bad made for tv movie experience .
0 Although this film was made before Dogme emerged as the predominant method of filmmaking , and before digital triumphed over -- strike that . You get the point . This 1991 masterpiece clearly anticipated those developments . Corin Nemec is just outstanding as the ne'er do well author and narrator . The pace is slow , but elegantly so , because the cinematography is so beautiful . Record it the next time its on T.V. , because I guarantee you 'll never see a better nostalgia rip - off made - for- T.V. movie . Direct - to - video never felt so good !
0 The British claymation series putting " witty " conversations taped from " average " people in the mouths of " cute " fanciful creatures at least had the advantage for non - British viewers of seeming droll and the kind of rarefied cultured humor you could n't get on U.S. television . Someone made the mistake of PUTTING it on U.S. television.<br /><br />Sort of like the sadly miscast American version of the sublime Brit - com COUPLING which died in a month on NBC when the same basic scripts did n't " translate " from British English to American English , what seemed droll and cultured ( and just a BIT dull ) in England , comes across in CREATURE COMFORTS , the American Version , as simply boredom with puppets . There 's no through plot - line , no characters and after one and a half episodes watched ( of the three ultimately aired ) , no reason to suffer through more.<br /><br />The only positive thing to be said about the new summer series and the mercifully brief run it had is that the claymation is at least professionally done and coming as a set - up for the single worst show on the CBS schedule , The New Adventures of Old Christine ( or " how to be a HORRIBLE mother - or person - in one interminable , unfunny lesson " ) , kids who wanted to stay up past their bedtime happily ran to bed rather than sit through this show , and the adults could wait to tune in until 9 pm when " Two and A Half Men " ( guilty pleasure ) and " How I Met Your Mother " ( actual quality writing ) come on .
0 One question : Why ? First off , the premise is not funny or engaging at all . They use taped interviews , and take the audio to animate ite with animals speaking the parts . First off , the interviews are n't funny or entertaining to begin with , and even if they were , I am sure they would be a lot more entertaining being viewed as they are originally , without being turned into cartoons . How does that add any hilarity to it ? I turned on CBS 's Monday night sitcom line - up , ( which has become a regular way for me to relax after stressful Monday workdays ) and found this on . Of course , the sitcom line - up would be reruns anyway , being summer , but seeing those episodes over again would have been more entertaining . I tried to give " CC " a chance . I really did . When it started , I figured , well , maybe it will be funny . Nope . And then it kept going . It was a long half hour.<br /><br />And I can almost see if there was a purpose , if the interviews were shown in their entirety , and had points to them . But no , it was just one - line clips , cut and pasted together really quick . It was like a horrible dreadful version of Cartoon Network 's " Robot Chicken . " I was n't a fan of CBS ' now - cancelled sitcom " The Class . " WHile that was on , it was one half - hour of the line - up I would struggle through . But if it came down to me deciding a whole season of that or three more episodes of " Creatures" .... let 's just say I 'd take the " Class . " Considering it 's been a couple hours since it aired , and I come on here to see I am the first to comment ... I guess that 's a good sign that nobody watched it , and that it wo n't last much longer . Cartoon roadkill .
0 I 'm not sure what HK movies the other reviewers have been watching , but Enter the Eagles is nowhere near the top of the heap in HK action . Michael " Fitz " Wong should be glad he can get acting jobs in HK , because he could n't act his way out of a wet paper bag in English . Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter ( even better with the leg fighting than her dad ) , but her acting skills are also sub - par . In fact , all the English dialog ( 90 % of the movie -- even more than in Gen - Y Cops ) is so bad that I switched to Mandarin audio just to spare myself the misery of the bad dialog delivery and the redundancy of the English subs . Sure , there are some decent gunfights ( but nothing we have n't already seen before ) and good cinematography , but the cheesy visual effects really spoil the action.<br /><br />That said , it 's worth the price of admission to watch Shannon and Benny " The Jet " Urquidez go at it . Spectacular , and almost worth watching the rest of the movie for.<br /><br />Finally , you might notice some scenes that seem " familiar " to you , notably a shootout at an outdoor market ( think Matrix ) and Fitz diving out of a helicopter wearing black fatigues ( think MI:2 ) . Guess someone thought at least a few things in this flick were worth ripping off .
0 The movie has a good start portraying an interesting and strong Shannon Lee and introduces two very simpathetic side characters through the first half . But later something happens and all the sudden Shannon turns into this straight faced , second hand bad girl and the movie gets lost in it 's own context . The second half lacks any kind of charisma and is full of clichés , bad acting , a horrible plot and even worse stunt coordination . Not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the chechen mafia gang.<br /><br />"Game of Death 2 " was bad and clownified Bruce , but his daughter tops it making an even bigger embarrassment of herself than the double who played Bruce Lee back then . I truly believe that she can do much better than this and I hope she participates in a better production next time.<br /><br />If you are a real hard core action fan and do n't care about quality go ahead and see this movie . I was personally looking forward to it but just got terribly disappointed .
0 Wow . Watching this film today , you ca n't help but be appalled by the writing of this film . Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young play a couple who , in modern times , might be featured on " The Jerry Springer Show "-- as they have a sick and abusive relationship ... and inexplicably , the writers appear to be endorsing it ! < br /><br />The film begins with a hungry and homeless Loretta being shown the ropes by the poor but very resourceful Spencer Tracy . He shows her how by conniving you can do very well with little money and takes her home to his shack to stay . It 's never clear whether or not they marry -- and considering it 's a Pre - Code film , you can assume they are n't even though they are cohabiting . Their relationship is very strange ... and rather sick . While you can see that Tracy cares about her by his actions , he is verbally abusive and a total jerk --- and Young comes running back for more like some sort of dog . He calls her " skinny " or " ugly " and these are , in a sick way , his way of using endearments ! Later , when he starts fooling around with another woman ( Glenda Farrell ) , she tells her friend that if that 's what he wants , it 's okay with her ! ! ! It sure smacks of a sado - masochistic relationship and you ca n't help but feel a bit horrified . Sure , he does n't hit her but the relationship is very abusive . To show how sick it is , when Young gets pregnant , she tells him " ... it 's your baby and it 's mine , but you do n't need to worry , I 'll take all the blame for it " ! ! Yikes ! Does n't this all seem a bit like looking through a peephole into a sick and dysfunctional home ? ! Later , in a case of art imitating life , Tracy proves what sort of man he is and disappears . After all , he ca n't be burdened with a baby -- even if it 's his . But , he changes his mind and decides to return home . Wow ... that 's bit of him ! And , when he returns , he 's nasty and acts like IF he stays , he is n't obligated to care for the kid ! ! And , she tells him he 's " a free man ... free as a bird " ! Wow , I was almost in tears at this tender moment ... NOT ! Soon , this crazy pair are married ... and , naturally , Young is depressed because he seems to be staying as long as it suits him -- not because of any love or sense of responsibility . So how can you salvage anything with this sort of sick characters ? What would you do ? Well , as for the writers , they have Tracy soon commit a robbery to help pay for the brat ! The romantic aspects of the film are underwhelming to say the least ! During the robbery , Tracy behaves like a chump -- doing almost nothing to take precautions not to get caught -- like he was secretly hoping to get sent to prison . And , to show what sort of nice guy he is , the guy he tries to rob is one of his best friends.<br /><br />While there 's more to the film , the bottom line is that Tracy is a jerk and Young is an idiot in the film . Despite both being very good actors , there 's absolutely no way they could make anything of this crap the writers produced . Nice music , nice sets , good acting ... and a script that is 100 % poo . How the film is currently rated 7.4 is beyond me and I wonder how anyone can ignore the pure awfulness of the characters . A horrible misfire that somehow did n't destroy the careers of those involved.<br /><br />Oh , and if you wonder if Loretta EVER gets a backbone in this film or plays a person who is the least bit strong , the answer is NO ! By the end , she 's learned nothing and has n't changed one whit for the better.<br /><br />They sure do n't make films like they used to ... and in this case ... thank God !
0 The original Lensman series of novels is a classic of the genre . It 's pure adventure SF with some substance ( here and there ) and I 've always wondered why Hollywood has n't filmed it verbatim because it 's just the kind of thing they love : massive explosions , super - weapons , uber - heroics , hero gets the girl , aliens ( great CGI potential ) , good versus evil in the purest form , etc etc . Instead ( and bear in mind I 'm a Japan - o - phile and anime lover ) we get this horrendous kiddies movie that rips the guts out of the story , mixes in Star - Wars ( ironic as the latter ripped off the books occasionally ) pastiches and dumbs the whole thing down to ' Thundercats ' level . To see Kimball Kinnison , the epitome of the Galactic Patrol officer and second stage Lensman portrayed as a small boy is pitiful ( etc ) . I just ca n't understand why the makers did this because they obviously had the rights to the story and could have made far more money ( FAR ! ) by telling straight . It makes no sense .
0 I rented the dubbed - English version of Lensman , hoping that since it came from well - known novels it would have some substance . While there were hints of substance in the movie , it mostly did n't rise above the level of kiddie cartoon . Maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book , or it lost a lot in the dubbed version . Or maybe even the source novels were lightweight . But for whatever reason , there was n't much there.<br /><br />I noticed lots of details that were derivative , sloppy , poorly dramatized , or otherwise deficient . Some examples : The opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 " star gate " scene and the Star Wars image of hyperspace . The robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized " R2-D2".<br /><br />It starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of Star Wars , but mercifully ( since the humor does n't work ) gives up on comedy and plays it serious . In that sense , it 's superior to the Star Wars franchise , which started with a clever sense of humor , and eventually deteriorated to Jar - Jar 's annoying silliness.<br /><br />The agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm . The harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field , dumping silage onto unharvested crops , rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto already - harvested rows or into a truck . Corn ( maize ) was pouring out the grain chute , but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field.<br /><br />When it was time for Kim 's father had to face his fate , there was n't any dramatic weight to the scene . That could have been partly the fault of the English - language voice actor , but the drawings did n't show much weight either . Kim 's reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing.<br /><br />Similarly , when a character named Henderson was killed , Chris showed very little reaction , even though they were apparently supposed to have been close . ( Henderson 's death is no spoiler ; his name is n't revealed until his death scene . ) She seems to promptly forget him . Someone 's expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does . I think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case ; there 's at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of Chris.<br /><br />On several occasions , villains fail to accomplish their orders . A villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths . I ca n't say whether that 's lifted from Star Wars , or if that comes from an earlier source -- possibly the Lensman books.<br /><br />There 's a scene where a space ship crash - lands . As it plunges toward the ground , parts are break off the ship . But so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands.<br /><br />While in most cases Chris seems like a competent , tough space hero , there 's a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress . Someone tough enough to get over Henderson 's death so quickly should at least be able to shout , " help , it 's got me and I ca n't reach my gun ! " instead of just shrieking.<br /><br />The character with the most personality ( almost too much at times ) is D.J. Bill . He sounded like Wolfman Jack , the D.J. in American Graffiti . I wonder if he 's as well - voiced in the original language.<br /><br />Two planets in the movie exploded . The explosions were unimpressive , and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to Star Wars . To its credit , however , the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the Death Star 's primary weapon . The dialog had a good , interesting explanation for the cause . Many other explosions in the movie did look good , just not the planetary explosions.<br /><br />Some of the sound effects are very cheesy , as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game . Some of the images look like primitive video games , and some influence from Tron is visible too . On the other hand , the sound effects are often pretty decent , although that emphasizes the cheesy - sounding parts . The art is good too , particularly when it stays away from the often cheesy - looking computer graphics.<br /><br />Finally , there 's the story . If a movie tells a good story , it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings . But the plot here was pretty lightweight . A naïve boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship , and acquires a great power he does n't understand . He and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful , unredeemably evil enemy . He makes friends , learns about his special power , and grows into a young man . If he is persistent and virtuous enough , he might even defeat the evil enemy . Details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline , but there 's very little more than that in this movie.<br /><br />In the end , it 's just a kiddie cartoon . But then , since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children , maybe it does n't need to be anything more than that .
0 [ I saw this movie once late on a public tv station , so I do n't know if it 's on video or not.]<br /><br />This is one of the " Baby Burlesks " ( sic ) that Shirley Temple did in the early 1930s . It is hard to believe that anyone would let their daughter be in this racy little film which today might just be considered this side of " kiddie porn".<br /><br />Shirley Temple stars in a cast which probably has an average age of 5 . They are all in diapers , and are in a saloon which serves milk instead of alcohol . The " cash " is in the form of lollipops.<br /><br />Shirley playing a " femme fatale " sashays up to the bar and talks to soldiers who make suggestive comments about her ( ! ) . But Shirley does n't need really their lollipops / cash because her purse is full of ones from other " men".<br /><br />Meanwhile a little black boy does a suggestive dance on a nearby table ( ! ) .<br /><br />What a strange film . . . infants using racy dialogue playing adult roles in a saloon . Who thought up this stuff any way ?
0 This is a horrible little film -- and unfortunately , the company that made this short made several others . The short is essentially a one - joke idea that was n't funny to begin with and may also offend you . It certainly made me uncomfortable watching very young children ( most appeared about 2 years - old ) cavorting about and pretending to be adults -- in this case , a dancehall girl and bar room patrons . It 's the sort of humor that you might be forced to laugh at from your own kids if they pretended to be adults , but I ca n't see anyone WANTING to see this -- especially when a very young Shirley Temple is dressed in a rather slinky outfit and acts like a vamp ! ! And then , other kids act like adults in some rather adult situations . At the time , I am sure they were not trying to appeal to pedophiles , but when looking at it today , that is what immediately comes to mind ! Because of this , this boring film ALSO creeped me out and I hope to never see it again ! ! Pretty strange and pretty awful .
0 I do n't know why this conduct was ever tolerated in the movie business ! This movie ( short ) is gross ( to say the least ) ! It is a bunch of 5 - 7 year old children wearing diapers with big bobby pins , acting like adults ( and too much so ! ) . However , it is interesting because it is a good example of how " the good old days " may not have been so good after all ! ( Thank GOD we have laws against this kind of material now!)<br /><br />{This is one short from the " Shirley Temple Festival " }

0 Strange ... I like all this movie crew and dark humor movies ; but did n't like this one at all ! It 's awful , horrible and surely not funny at all . Pity can not do a whole movie plot , disgust either . And it was really boring . Long empty moments fills the movie ; it could have been removed . It should have been in another shorter format , surely . Maybe i expected too much from the crew - like saving the movie lol - . It 's also filled with overused clichés of characters and situations ... I do n't get it why people liked it ... " Poetry " , " hope " ; nope ' mam , did n't see anything like that ! ^^ All in all , it 's empty and crude , pitiful and hopeless . Oh darn this one ........
0 I had high expectations for this indie having perused the many thumbs up reviews . Then .... <br /><br />Here 's my additional ' two cents ' to the already posted , excellent ' lost in translation ' review . Premise : Morgan is ' stuck ' in a dusty small town where he meets lovely Scarlet who is working in the local supermarket . Can Morgan help elevate the lovely Scarlet from her trailer trash life?<br /><br />Realistic dialog ? NOT . How about that shopping in Target . First , Freeman looks at the Target interior as if he 's walked into Harrods . Then , he 's bowled over at a T - shirt rack confirming he has NEVER been in any store visited by lovely Scarlet . Morgan is detached from any and all aspects of Scarlet 's reality and is portrayed as gleeful in his ignorance of everyone and everything in Scarlet 's life.<br /><br />One reviewer enjoyed the Scarlet and ex - hubby fight scene where her survival , a car in this instance , requires she physically attack her ex hubbie . Does Freeman run to her defense .... naw ... he 's cowering in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real , sorry lot in life . < br /><br />Freeman 's character believes a car wash and new very revealing , tight fitting blouse is the key to Scarlet 's job interview . Another sign that Freeman is CLUELESS . Freeman 's endless ' stage talk ' where all aspects of Scarlet 's reality are reduced to one or another stage related Freeman experience was irritating . < br /><br />Freeman is right to emphasize that Scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces vis a vis : uneducated , no white collar skills or experience , VERY POOR , no family support and a lifetime of low self esteem . Scarlet learns such life lessons from Freeman as : some people pay $ 100 for a T - shirt and a revealing blouse may open doors in lieu of her lack of education and white collar job skills . In the end Freeman offers Scarlet little more than strange diversion with a ' star',not even paying for gas for Scarlet 's dead of night return to her unchanged life in a town the name of which Freeman cares not to know .
0 After I watched this movie , I came to IMDb and read some of the reviews , which compared it to Lost In Translation LITE . When I read that I immediately could see the reviewers point.<br /><br />This movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme . Interestingly , the format of the movie is nearly identical , but the PACING is incredibly different . " 10 Items " rushes the viewer through the 1-day time line of the movie , whereas the better - planned " Lost In ... " seems to stretch out over a few long days.<br /><br />I'm sure some people will see this because it has Morgan Freeman , and will be disappointed . It seems his better roles now - a - days are supporting roles in big blockbusters , rather than leading roles in sub-$10mil limited release movies and indie films .
0 I love Morgan Freeman . Paz Vega is an attractive , appealing and talented actress . I 'm sure that this would have been a good movie had anything happened in it . Nothing does . It 's short ( less than 90 minutes ) . It was 75 minutes too long . After an hour of frustration , I scanned through the remaining 20-odd minutes . Excruciating.<br /><br />Freeman plays an actor - who has n't worked in a while - researching a part that he might play , as a checkout clerk in a supermarket . He visits the supermarket where she works . Nothing happens . She decides to give him a ride home and they go to an Arby 's , a Target , a car wash . Nothing happens . They converse about their lives . Nothing happens . Ever.<br /><br />I do n't get it . But I also do n't get the Bill Murray flicks " Lost In Translation " and " Broken Flowers " . If you like those movies , maybe you 'll like this . Lots of people find movies like this whimsical , charming , or - for reasons that escape me - find the dialog fascinating . A common device in movies of this ilk is to have a LONG take of stillness / silence after an actor delivers a line that 's supposed to be meaningful . We know it 's meaningful because it 's followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen . Sorry , I must be a philistine . I do n't get it . To me , these kinds of movies are n't funny , or charming , or thought - provoking . They 're just boring . Why ? Because there 's no comedy . No drama . No tension . No laughs . No suspense . No action . Nothing to watch . In short , none of the things I go to the movies for . I can be bored for free . I see oddball / quirky characters in real life . I go to Target , and fast - food restaurants , and car - washes . These elements do not a movie make , even if stars are doing this stuff . I pay to be entertained.<br /><br />If you 're crazy about Morgan Freeman and just like to hear him ramble on about nothing , have fun . If you wanna drool over Paz Vega , you can look and listen to her . But nothing happens , I promise . A total snoozefest .
0 While watching this movie , I came up with a script for a movie , called " The Making of 10 Items or Less":<br /><br />Producer : I 've got good news and bad news . The good news is , we can get Morgan Freeman!<br /><br />Writer : That 's great ! But what 's the bad news?<br /><br />Producer : We can only afford to hire him for one day . I guess we 'll have to get someone else.<br /><br />Writer : So we hire him for one day . A movie is an hour and a half long . A work day is eight hours long . I fail to see a problem.<br /><br />Producer : But ... he 'll have to spend time getting into character.<br /><br />Writer : So we have him play a character who is essentially himself.<br /><br />Producer : But he 'll still need to understand his motivation and all that . You 're not saying we have him play a big - name actor that 's doing a low - budget movie , are you?<br /><br />Writer : Why not?<br /><br />Producer : That 's ridiculous ! But fine , at least we 'll have Morgan Freeman in our movie . And I guess we have to set the movie in Los Angeles too.<br /><br />Writer : Of course.<br /><br />Producer : This script is a load of crap . We 'd better make money on this . Just in case , have Morgan Freeman 's character plug Wal - Mart or Target or one of those stores , so at least someone will want to sell the DVDs.<br /><br />Writer : Sure thing!<br /><br />Producer : Wait a second ... what 's this about a tiny bodega with a " ten items or less " express lane?<br /><br />Writer : Oh , I guess that is pretty weird . But we ca n't change the title now!<br /><br />I doubt my script actually bears much resemblance to reality , but then neither did " 10 Items or Less " . This is a case of good acting , but bad writing , and I hate to see it happen . When watching an independent movie , you expect it to try to convey some sort of message . I think they might have been trying for the tired old " do n't let anything hold you back " message that has been done to death in much better films . In any case , with " 10 Items or Less " , the only message I got was " Look ! Look at Morgan Freeman ! "
0 This movie was great the first time I saw it , when it was called " Lost in Translation . " But somehow Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman , Scarlett Johansson turned into a cranky Latino woman played by Paz Vega , and Tokyo , Japan turned into Carson , California . Instead of meaningful conversations and silence we enjoyed in Translation , we get meaningless blabbering in 10 Items that verges on annoying . Instead of characters that were pensive and introspective as in Translation , we get characters that spew pointless advice on topics they have no clue about . How can a character that wears hundred dollar T - shirts and has never been inside a Target department store expect to give advice to a working - class woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant ? Do n't think that stops him . If he is n't giving her clothing advice , he 's telling her what she should eat . The most annoying part of the movie for me was how supposedly they were in a hurry to make an appointment , and yet the characters keep finding time to run another errand , be it washing the car , stopping at Arby 's , or just laying around to list off their 10 Items or Less lists of things they love and hate . I kept wanting to yell at them saying , " Did n't you say you had somewhere to be ? What the heck are doing ? A minute ago you were practically late , now you 're eating roast beef and pondering your lives ! " Until I saw this movie , I never truly understood how something could " insist upon itself , " but I think this movie does exactly that , and undeservedly so . The dialogue makes the characters cheesy and unsympathetic  with the exception that I felt sorry for both of the actors for having signed onto this project .
0 A still famous but decadent actor ( Morgan Freeman ) has not filmed for four years . When he is invited to participate in a new project , he asks the clumsy cousin of the director to drop him in a poor Latin neighborhood in Carlson to research the work of the manager of a small supermarket . He sees the gorgeous Spanish cashier Scarlet ( Paz Vega ) and he becomes attracted with her ability . His driver never returns to catch him and Scarlet gives a ride to the actor . But first she has a job interview for the position of secretary in a construction company and the actor helps her to be prepared ; then they spend the afternoon together having a pleasant time.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega . However , the pointless " 10 Items or Less " is absolutely disappointing . This low - budget movie does not seem to have a storyline , and is supported by the chemistry and improvisations of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega and actually nothing happens along 82 minutes . The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous , with the character of Morgan Freeman returning to his silver spoon world and telling the simple worker that they would never see each other again . Was he afraid to have a love affair with her and destroy his perfect world with his family ? Or was a clash of classes , and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not be adequate to a simple worker from the lower classes ? My vote is four.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Um Astro em Minha Vida " ( " A Star in My Life " )
0 Not really spoilers in my opinion , but I wanted to cover myself , nevertheless . As the executive producer , Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 Items Or Less , a movie with an intentional indie - feel , and just be absorbed in the mentor / be - all - that - you - can - be theme . He plays a alternate universe , semi - washed up version of the real Morgan Freeman , who is chauffeured in an old Econovan by a kid all the way into Carson , CA from Brentwood to research his next movie role . Why Carson , is a mystery to So . Cal residents . He could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the San Fernando Valley and found the same elements . Paz Vega is pretty to watch , a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz , playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for Moragn Freeman 's research . His character is only known as " Him " to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people-"Psst , that 's ' him , ' etc . Unfortunately , I was too distracted that Him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in Brentwood , carried no cash or debit card , or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him . If one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like Him does , then I got ta see cash and a Blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which Him definitely has . Nothing really happens in this movie . I do n't believe that either of the main character 's were substantially changed by their encounter with each other . It flirts with the idea of adultery , but then that thought fizzles . This to me was similar to Steve Martin 's Shopgirl , without the sexual affair . It was self - indulgent for Freeman and unconvincing to the audience .
0 I did not expect a lot from this movie , after the terrible " Life is a Miracle " . It turns out that this movie is ten times worse than " Life ... " . I have impression that director / writer is just joking with the audience : " let me see how much emptiness can you ( audience ) sustain " . Dialogues are empty , ... scenario is minimalistic . In few moments , photography is really nice . Few sarcastic lines are semi - funny , but it is hard to genuinely laugh during this " comedy " . I 've laughed to myself for being able to watch the movie until the end . If you can lift yourself above this director 's fiasco , ... you will find good acting of few legends ( Miki Manojlovic , Aleksandar Bercek ) , and very good performance of Emir 's son Stribor Kusturica.<br /><br />In short : too bad for such a great director ! Emir Kusturica is still young and should be making top - rated movies . Instead , he chooses to do this low - budget just - for - my - private theater movie , with arrogant attitude toward the world trends and negligence toward his old fans .
0 First of all , this plot is way overdone - girl wants to make it , everyone loves her , snobby girl intervenes , all looks lost , girl pulls through , everyone loves her again etc . Throw in the fitting in thing , an attractive male crushing on the heroine , plus single - parent troubles and it 's so predictable that you can practically recite along with it.<br /><br />Second of all , I really hate how they keep on dissing classical music . They send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close - minded - in fact , I do n't recall the quote exactly , but I remember at one point in the movie , Holly says , " Why do they have to be so uptight ... so classical ? " It 's really insulting how label classical music in this way.<br /><br />Third , I 've went over it dozens of times , but the only reason that I can think of for making this movie is to promote Britney Spears . there just is n't any point at all.<br /><br />And oh yeah , while the actress who portrayed Holly ( I 'm not sure whether that was really her singing or not ) had a reasonably good voice , it was n't as amazing as they were making it out to be - especially when she was belting . She was oversupporting the whole time.<br /><br />1/10 stars .
0 This is no doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen . This makes your run of the mill TV movie look like Reservoir Dogs . Based on a book by the one and only Britney Spears and her mother this is trash with nothing bar a reasonable performance from Virginia Madsen ( I hope you got paid well ) to save it . The story of a red neck country gill who wins a scholarship in a prestigious music school is little but a vehicle to pedal Ms Spears pants music to the consumer and to generally agree that low brow must be the way . There is nothing good going on here with all the beats as predictable as night following day . Never ever again .
0 hello boys and girls ... this is n't your regular movie review , because this is going to be the cold . hard . truth . are you serious ? this movie sucked so many balls i could n't keep them out of my mouth ! they might as well have sprayed me in the eye with monkey semen . you 'd need one seriously large douche to pump out all the vaginal fluid from this movie.<br /><br />the plot was very lacking . the actors were terrible . i rewound the dance number several times and had to pause it even more because i was choking on my own spit . do boys , everyone!<br /><br />peace R&H besties4lyf
0 EXTREMITIES < br /><br />Aspect ratio : 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format : Mono < br /><br />A woman turns the tables on a would - be rapist when he mounts an assault in her home , and is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police , in which case he could be released and attack her again.<br /><br />Exploitation fans who might be expecting another rough ' n ' ready rape fantasy in the style of DAY OF THE WOMAN ( 1978 ) will almost certainly be disappointed by EXTREMITIES . True , Farrah Fawcett 's character is subjected to two uncomfortably prolonged assaults before gaining the upper hand on her attacker ( a suitably slimy James Russo ) , but scriptwriter William Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young take these unpleasant scenes only so far before unveiling the dilemma which informs the moral core of this production . Would their final solution hold up in a court of law ? Maybe ... <br /><br />Based on a stage play which reportedly left its actors battered and bruised after every performance , the film makes no attempt to open up the narrative and relies instead on a confined setting for the main action . Acing and technical credits are fine , though Fawcett 's overly subdued performance wo n't play effectively to viewers who might be relying on her to provide an outlet for their outraged indignation .
0 This movie is terrible . The suspense is spent waiting for a point . There is n't much of one.<br /><br />Aside from a few great lines ( " I found a tooth in my apartment " ) , and the main characters dedication to killing himself , it 's a collection of supposedly eerie sounds.<br /><br / >
0 This is possibly the most boring movie in history . I was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor / director Roman Polanski . I think I would rather see the Three Amigos than ever watch this movie again . It promptly went from the DVD player straight into the garbage . My apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie however you probably liked New Coke as well . I am at a loss to see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie , it is slow , dull and has no real plot . You wait for 105 minutes for the movie to get started . I understand this was made in 1976 however this was an era of bad television all around . Thank god disco and Three 's Company are gone along with stop sign glasses and the Bay City Rollers . Oh well just my thoughts .
0 This movie was worth five punches on my " hurter card " . I saw this while stationed in Virginia in the mid ' 70 's . I saw it alone so I was not distracted while I watched it . It sucked . It was the most ridiculous , total waste of celluloid I 've ever seen.<br /><br />I know that others who have reviewed this movie have thought that it was awesome . I offer you this : if it was so awesome what was it 's box office take ? End of discussion .
0 It 's unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera - work and busy ( but scratchy ) background score that accompanies this 1933 release . Although sound came into general use in 1928 , there are no more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman , unhappily married , who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods.<br /><br />The most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town , proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife 's lover . In a frenzy of jealousy , he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment , losing his nerve . It 's probably the most tension - filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow - moving and obviously contrived story.<br /><br />HEDY LAMARR is given the sort of close - up treatment lavished on Marlene Dietrich by her discoverer , but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to Hollywood . Her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love ( ARIBERT MOG ) , the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim.<br /><br />The swimming scene is very brief , discreetly photographed , and not worth all the heat it apparently generated . The love - making scene , later on , is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film -- artfully so . More is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism -- and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece.<br /><br />Not so . It 's disappointing , primitively crude in its sound portions ( including the laborious symphonic music in the background ) and certainly Miss Lamarr is fortunate that Louis B. Mayer saw the film and on the basis of it , gave her a career in Hollywood . He must have seen something in her work that I didn't.<br /><br />It 's apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work . The jarring " workers " scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed . It fails to end the film on the proper note .
0 This movie really shows its age . The print I saw was terrible due to age , but it is possible that there are better prints out there . However , this was not the major problem with the movie . The problem was that although the film was made in 1933 , it was essentially a silent film with only the barest of dialog scattered ( only a few sentences ) in the film in the most amateur fashion . Sometimes the characters ' backs were turned or they were talking with their hands over their faces -- all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and " cleaverly " ( ? ) hide the fact that the film was dubbed . Well , its true that this Czech film would need to be dubbed into many languages but to do it this way was really stupid and obvious . It just looked cheap.<br /><br />Overall , the film looked low budget and silly . It 's really a shame though , because there was a grain of a good story -- a young woman who marries an older man who is either gay and/or has no interest in women . But in the 21st century , few people would really be willing to sit through this archaic mess . EVEN with a few glimpses of the naked ( and somewhat chunky ) Hedy Lamarr , it is n't worth all the fuss that accompanied the film when it debuted . Even by 1933 standards , this film was a poorly made dud . About the only interesting thing about the film is to see how different Lamarr looked in 1933 compared with the glamorous image Hollywood created when she came to America -- she looks like 2 completely different people.<br /><br />It 's such an incomplete looking and technically inferior film , I do n't see how it has gotten such rave reviews . For technical problems alone , the movie ca n't rate a 10 or anything near it .
0 Final Score : 0 ( out of 10)<br /><br />***Possible scene specific spoilers ( but who the hell cares)***<br /><br />Yes , that 's right : zero . And I rarely give 1 's . Even for the lamest of movies I look for things like music , cinematography , imagination , it 's humor , even a good pace to be as objective about the score as possible . Looking at it within it 's own genera or subgenera . But there is absolutely nothing redeeming here . I ca n't remember another time a movie actually sent me pacing up and down the room when it was over . The only reason I made it to the end was because I could n't seem to change the channel - I sat there simply aghast , watching to see what insultingly stupid bit it would come up with next . It was like watching a snake digest a rat . < br /><br />But let 's have some fun and pull this baby apart , shall we . First of all , There is nothing technical about " Whipped " that works . The visuals are all sitcom style . The cut scenes all just pictures of the street traffic going by at night over and over . The music and score , not only does n't contribute anything to the movie - it 's obnoxious . Not to mention it does n't have anything to contribute to anyway . The acting is as cardboard as it comes , all around and that goes for Amanda Peet ( clearly the " star " that got this train wreck green - lighted ) too . These guys , supposedly good friends , have no more chemistry or sense of purpose then if director Peter M. Cohen had rounded them up at a bus station minutes before shooting.<br /><br />On the creative side , there is n't an original bone in it 's body . It has no imagination . It shows us nothing we have n't seen a thousand times before . The whole premise , or " twist " , of this movie is based on male - bashing and the " idea " that an empowered women can play men " just as they get played " . Anybody , that thinks this is somehow a twist or is in any way original has obviously never turned on a TV before . Twisted , shallow women are common . Male - bashing is the norm . It 's not stealing from anything specifically , it 's worse : it 's stealing from clichés . I ca n't imagine a women making a movie that depicted other women based so much on stereotypes and with this sense of contempt . Makes me want to go rent " In the Company of Men " - or better yet , " There 's Something About Mary " . This movie wants to be a " edgier " version of " There 's Something About Mary " so bad you can see the sweat . < br /><br />The movie has no insights into women , men , dating , sex , or really anything . Cohen is simply content to regurgitate myths he has been indoctrinated with from other sexist movies . On the other end , the movie does n't work as a satire either , because even though it is ripe with exaggerations one could view as " satirical " it does n't have that grounding in reality that satires need . It does n't even know what it 's satirizing . Then there 's the dialogue , which is little more then the characters screaming obscenities at each other . Example : Character 1 : " F**k you " Character 2 : " Oh yeah , well f**k you " ( repeat)<br /><br />And the bottom line , the thing that could excuse all the other discretions : There are a lot of movies without plots , without good acting , with morally repulsive characters and obscenity laced dialogue that have been funny and thus , been good . " Whipped " ai n't funny . Not for a second . It has no comic skills or timing . The situations are all completely phony , not based in any shred of truth , especially enough to wring laughs out of us . The characters all broadly drawn so they will SEEM relatable to the lowest of the lowest common denominator . Just look at " the marquee scene " , " cult classic " hair gel scene . One of our bumbling anti - heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees Mena ( Peet ) 's vibrator . For some reason light shines down on it as if he 's found the holy grail . Why Cohen thinks men react this way to vibrators I do not know . While he rubs it on himself , he drops it in the toilet and then attempts to fish it out with his bare hands when , oh my , Mena walks in on him . Oh , my sides . < br /><br />But strangely enough , people actually like this movie . Of course , people also like " Friends " and reality dating shows so I should n't be surprised . All of this has a common thread however . " Whipped " is big evidence to me that there is just a huge pocket of people in America that will laugh at any joke just because it is about sex . They will like any show or movie ( or think they like it ) just because it is about dating or relationships . It 's lack of any quality has no baring on these people . Just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs , they are also indoctrinated to blindly lap up anything dating / relationship related to sell them cheap , empty , effortless TV , movies and any number of products . < br /><br />The only consilation will be that when I die , because I saw this movie , I 've got a credit to get 80 minutes of my life back . < br /><br / >
0 It just seems bizarre that someone read this script , and thought , " This is funny ! I mean , it 's so hilarious it just has to be made ! " Who was this person ? Is he or she the person really responsible for this ? Are they the one 's who owe me for my time , more so than the director / writer?<br /><br />This film stinks in most every way possible . There 's no one shred of good dialogue , and not one likable character . And the story ... <br /><br />I prefer the 2nd worst movie ever , Hulk Hogan 's " No Hold 's Barred " to this by quite a considerable degree . It seems almost Shakespearen in comparison.<br /><br />The ending is padded out with several minutes of outtakes , and it 's still under 80 minutes . The outtakes include cast members laughing at the ' hilarious ' mistakes they 've made , and things that went wrong on the set of this ' comedy . ' Glad to see someone laughing in someway , with some connection to this ' film.'<br /><br />Nothing in this film is funny . Nothing . It just goes on , and on . It 's truly that lame . I love films that are so bad they 're good . This is so bad it's ... something , but I do n't know what , and hopefully will never find out.<br /><br />Amanda Peet does n't suck outright , and is in fact the only half good thing about this wannabe film . But , that really means little.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs .
0 I 'll be blunt and to the point . This film is not good at all . The film buff part of me hated the acting , script , story , direction and almost all of the editing . Amanda Peet has proven that she can act , as she was a high point of ' The Whole Nine Yards ' . So she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot pole . However , the infantile part of me found this film to be very funny . If you can forget about how underpar the production quality is , and if you find smut jokes funny , then you should be all right . And for those of you who ca n't get off your pedestal , that s your choice . My inner child hasen't died , and I laughed a fair bit . Even then , only a 3 out of ten , because as a movie , it really does stink .
0 A poorly written script with no likeable characters . As for it being a comedy , I forgot to laugh . It 's about 2 conceited friends who scam to get women in too bed with them ( no sex scenes ) and another friend(who is semi - discustingly weird)who sometimes also scams but mainly is considered as being the guy who masterbates . The 3 friends separately meet and fall for the same woman ( Amanda Peet ) . Somehow this is done without really any romance . The 3 guys stop being friends as they separately dated her . She scammed them out of their friendship because they scammed women . -- A bad movie
0 Four best friends young male chauvinist pigs ( with the emphasis on pigs ) meet weekly at a NYC diner to recount their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy . Peet is the common denominator who dates the three bachelors in the group which leads to conflict and the inevitable " whipping " . Although the film 's premise has potential and there are some funny moments to be had , overall the flick does n't work especially in the end where the girls are made to appear no better than the guys which runs contrary to the crux of the story . One of those one - man band flix with a dozen producers , " Whipped " is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young males who think " The Man Show " is Emmy material .
0 Every Sunday , a trio of buds get together at a NYC diner to boast about their sexual conquests of the night before . Sometimes they 're joined by a newlywed ex - comrade and hoochie hunter who hangs on them like a puling barnacle . They 're unabashed horn dogs / corn dogs and Mia , who witnesses them on the prowl , decides that they need to be taught a lesson , dammit . Ergo , she 'll date and dump - why not ? All three of them ! < br /><br />Gasp . What a wild idea . What a radical , naughty gal . Women now have the right to date and sleep around as much as they want to . As much as men do , even ! < br /><br />There is one solitary laughable element in " Whipped " - namely the fact that not once , during the amigo 's detailed discussions of their bodily functions and the tantric talents of the bed partners they trash , do the other customers in the diner turn around and say , " Dude , we 're trying to EAT here . " Indeed , a heh - heh gag has an older lady eagerly weigh in on the useful sexual properties of certain beverages . A big fat Kermit the Frog " Sheesh " to that.<br /><br />It 's truly unfortunate that a buddy movie with a great setting , a smart , cute heroine and three possible pairings had to have such a cop - out ending.<br /><br />P.S. - 30 " whip - oosh " sound effects to the screenwriter for use of the phrase " You go , girl " . It was tired in 2000 , and it 's tired now.<br /><br />Save your time and watch some " Sex and the City " reruns ...
0 Personally , while I 'm able to appreciate really good movies , I also have a strange ability to somewhat enjoy even the most crappiest of crap . You know , those times when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible cookie - cutter action movie to kill time . This is the only movie that I can remember actually shutting off in the middle , and I have absolutely NO intention of going back to finish it . The plot was so contrived and predictable , I was calling out what the next scene would be easily ( and I 'm usually not very good at this ) . The actors were horrible , I 've seen better acting in middle school plays . Even the scene cuts were bad , the flow was all wrong.<br /><br />This movie is like a parody that forgot the funny .
0 First and foremost , Zorie Barber ( Zeke ) , might be one of the worst actors I have ever seen . As a character that 's supposed to be a hip , Village writer into the martial arts and proud of being mysterious , why is he so hyper , over - dramatic , and plain horrible ? Did he know anything about his character before they started filming ? Did the director ? Do n't the martial arts teach discipline ? Aside from that , this film misses the target with its lame jokes and seen - it - already gross - out humor . Hand in toilet ? < i > Trainspotting</i>. Masturbation ? Hmm . < i > Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i > , < i > American Pie</i > , the list goes on .. .Bad dialogue : In one sequence , Eric says " it 's none of my business < i > but</i > . ... " and 30 seconds later Mia says " why is this any of your business ? " Bad editing : At least five minutes worth of film are wasted on NYC traffic shots . < hr > It 's also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tight - knit group of friends in any world . I ca n't comment on what makes everyone laugh , but if you enjoy low - brow , basic bathroom humor and insults , by all means , enjoy . If you want something a little smarter but on the same lines , see < i > Boomerang</i>. If you want a solid what - goes - around romantic comedy , go for < i > The Tao Of Steve</i>. But anyone who thinks < i > Whipped</i > is witty and an accurate portrayal dating , well , I can not agree at all .
0 I like movies about morally corrupt characters , but this was too much . The acting was n't great , but that was n't the real problem . The issue was the sinking feeling I got in the pit of my stomach about 20 minutes into the film . These characters were hollow . They had almost no depth , and what little they did have was devoted to the cruelty they displayed to each other in the guise of friendship . Exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating , but you have to give those characters actual personalities or they are just cardboard cutouts . These characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly .
0 I just watched this movie last night , and I HAD to put a warning out for anybody else considering to see this film . In a word - do n't . I seriously feel like this is something that a screenwriting student would have written in a Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy phase , i.e. every other word was a curse word . I do n't have a problem with profuse cursing , as in " Good Will Hunting " , provided it helps to delve more into the characters . In this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an occassional * gasp * or laughter from the audience . The three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype , the wall street jerk , the coffee house jerk , and the " I'm - Not - Gay - Just - In - Touch - With - My - Feminine - Side " slightly - less - of - a - jerk . You just do n't give a damn about any of them ! They are all shallow , unredemable losers who you WANT to see lose . For those who dare , this film does have a couple funny moments , the very beginning , and the very end . The toilet / vibrator scene is funny in a sick kinda " Uh , yeah " way . Really though , I would only recommend this film to my worst of enemies .
0 Hands down the worst movie I have ever seen . I thought nothing would ever dethrone Last Action Hero , but this does easily . The movie is about 3 single guys who meet on Sundays to discuss their sexual escapades from the weekend . A fourth guy - who is married and - that used to be a part of the group shows up and talks about what he and his wife do . Nothing works in this movie . The jokes are not funny but they are repeated throughout the movie . The big kicker at the end of the movie is laughable . Avoid at all costs .
0 " Whipped " is one of the most awful films of all time . It is a mean , hateful piece of garbage that had me forcing myself to stay in the theater more than any other movie of 2000 , besides maybe " The Grinch . " It is not , as people have called it , an insightful portrait of modern relationships . That would be a little film called " High Fidelity . " Whereas that movie was honest and sympathetic , " Whipped " is hostile , cynical , misanthropic cinematic poison . Avoid this like so many plagues , unless you want to see how truly bad a " comedy " can get .
0 For months preceding the release of this movie you saw it advertised in all sorts of print media , so I patiently waited for its video release to see what all the hype was about . After it was over I had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the VCR for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie . It essentially fails because it is a character based movie about unredeemable characters . With the possible exception of Amanda Peet ( whose only redeemable quality is that she is Amanda Peet ) you can not stand any of them . The film relies on its dialogue which is sophomoric , moronic , and crude . The only slightly amusing character is Eric , whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on . The final twist , designed to make you laugh at the three main characters , only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards Peet . All in all , only rent if you are desperate or possess a dark sense of humor .
0 This film is not funny . It is not entertaining . It does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence , nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation . Added to that it 's about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory . It 's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like . This movie is boring , obnoxiously mind - numbing , and at times offensive and disgusting . At most , it contains one or two moments that make you laugh . Also , it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time .
0 This movie lacked ... everything : story , acting , surprise , ingenuity and a soul . Fifteen minutes in , I was staring at the screen saying , " How could all of these guys get together and consider themselves friends ( even without the girl ) ? " Another fifteen minutes in , I was praying for as much Amanda Peet as possible . When a bad movie quietly rears it 's ugly head , eye candy is a nice consolation . But there was n't much of that ! Cheated on all fronts !
0 " Whipped " is 82 minutes long . This review is 82 words long . Three unlikable New York Lotharios , ruthless " scammers , " end up wooing the same woman , played by Amanda Peet , with disastrous results . That applies to the story and the film . Too sophomoric to be misogynistic , flaccid and ridiculous , " Whipped " mixes the philosophies of shock jock Tom Lykis with Penthouse letter fantasies . Though technically proficient it 's dated , grating , poorly written , mean , and obvious . People do n't act like this . People do n't talk like this . Really .
0 I was looking forward to seeing Amanda Peet in another good role after recently renting " The Whole Nine Yards "-- easily worth the rental , by the way -- but this was n't it.<br /><br />I remembered that the trailer for " Whipped " was somewhat funny and the plot about three oversexed New Yorker twenty somethings all falling for and getting manipulated by the charming Ms. Peet was worth a shot . So , I convinced two friends one afternoon to come see this movie with me . This review is my penance.<br /><br />In the first act we have the three lead studs , recounting their conquests in a diner . What should have been funny , or at least telling , comes out rather pathetic . Was there any redeeming quality about the three men and their encounters that we were supposed to get out of this?<br /><br />[And while I do n't mind movies that are cheerfully vulgar , I kept wondering why no one in the diner turned around when the studs talk loudly about sexual and scatalogical details . They do this every week at the same diner ? You would think someone would complain . Oh , wait , I forgot : two other diners do notice in one scene . But this is just a setup for a punchline . Everyone else in the diner is deaf.]<br /><br />The second act has the three studs all falling for Mia and then developing brain rot , failing to ask each other or her about what 's really happening between the four of them . And I kept asking myself , as the studs keep acting like they have been , what redeeming qualities does she see in them to stick with them longer than one date ? Does she start out with brain rot ? I kept hoping for Eric 's character , the married buddy , to become something more than simply the annoying punching bag in this act . His role is clearly to dispense advice on being married . But why do they even bother to talk to him when they wo n't talk to each other ? And his advice ? Sheeesh!<br /><br />The third act resolves what plot there is but by this time I was looking at my watch . My friends told me they were still waiting for something genuinely funny to happen and I had to agree . The Scene That Explains All was adequate and managed to explain all of the questions and mysterious dialogue bits throughout the movie but we were just checking them off a list . ( " Oh , okay , that 's why Brad had that happen and Jonathan says this and ... ")<br /><br />What laughs we made were from the stupidity of the plot than at anything amusing . Even the outtakes during the credits were n't very funny . Ultimately I was left with nothing except a desire to warn people away from this movie.<br /><br />Rating : 3
0 Bad acting . Bad writing . This was a poorly written film . It 's too bad because it had some potential . It 's not even close to American Pie or Something about Mary as previous comments might have you believe . Rent it at dollar night from you local video store if you 're kind of bored .
0 This movie will be a hit with those that enjoy sophomoronic , mindless , explicit bragging about sexual exploits and F ... in almost every sentence . Like a good plot ? Like comedy ? Like romance or other human values ? Stay away from Whipped . It was so bad I left after about half an hour . I saw two kids slip in that looked to be about 10 -- very harmful -- this deserves an X.
0 I see quite a few positive reviews on this board , trying to revive this film from its lackluster status and starting a cult following . I see the usual ranting--"I guess this movie is just not for the easily offended , " " This movie is not Shakespeare , " etc . Guess what ? Neither was " Road Trip " ! And I laughed my a * * off during that movie ! There 's a way to make a crude , tasteless comedy and deliver laughs ; and there 's a way to ... just make it crude and tasteless . " Whipped " tries to be " Swingers " without the wit or intelligence . It seems to have been written through the puerile eyes of a 14-year - old boy . For God 's sake , the characters in this movie are supposed to be white - collar , upright citizens -- and they talk like some of the idiots I knew in freshman year of high school ! The dialogue is laced -- more like drowned -- with four - letter words . You would think that people of their status would have SOME degree of intelligence -- and a more extensive vocabulary . Just watch a Whit Stillman film and you 'll see the difference . Not to mention the fact that the dialogue sounds totally unrealistic and downright cartoonish . If you know any successful , white - collar businessmen who speak like the characters in this movie -- please let me know and introduce me to them . Their annoying sexual banter is equivalent to that of standard locker room chat among teens just arriving at puberty . There is absolutely NO insight into relationships , sex or ... anything ! ! ! It 's just a poor excuse to showcase an array of extremely -- and do n't take the word " extremely " for granted , because I mean it with all my heart -- crude gags . These are gags with no substance . Gags that are meant more for groans than laughs . The scene at the end between Amanda Peet and her girlfriends was totally un - called for and totally unconvincing . There are some movies that involve interaction among females that were written by ( straight ) men and play out wonderfully . This scene involves a barrage of sexual metaphors and gestures . It involves the kind of dialogue you can never imagine leaving a woman 's mouth . It was one of those noticeably - written - by - a - guy scenes . I was n't believing it for a second . < br /><br />"Whipped " is purely a sick male fantasy that 's as flat as it is annoying . I got ( very ) few laughs out of this utterly forgettable comedy , and those were probably a result of desperation . When you 're not laughing for a long period of time , you desperately look for humor in the most trivial things . So I would n't mark that down as a positive .
0 BEGIN SPOILER : Fitfully funny and memorable for Mr. Chong 's literal roach - smoking scene : Chong coolly mashes a stray kitchen cockroach into his pipe 's bowl , lights up , coughs and hacks violently for a seeming eternity , then with perfect aplomb and not skipping a beat , re - loads the bowl properly , re - lights , re - tokes . END SPOILER . Alas , I began to lose faith less than half - way through the proceedings . It occurred to me that the lackadaisical duo are way obnoxious and less than relatable . I have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of contemporary stoners , Harold and Kumar . I simply prefer brighter company . Yet , the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bros or those viewers who are so feeble - minded as to be outwitted by a stoner when they-- the former are sober . Notable guest appearance by Paul Reubens spouting obscenities in pre - Pee - wee form .
0 One of those el cheapo action adventures of the early 1980s that used to fill video rental stores solely to be taken out by adolescent boys in the hope of a cheap thrill.<br /><br />Woeful down market attempt to cash in on the Death Wish phenomenon by substituting a moderately attractive woman for the visually challenging Bronson . Acting is terrible , sets are cheap , the baddies are , well , bad . Identification with any of the characters is unlikely.<br /><br />Only redeeming feature is modest amount of gratuitous female nudity , a smattering of which is full frontal . Other than that , you can leave it ...
0 An apparent vanity project for Karin Mani ( who ? ) , as a hottie Charles Bronson going around wiping up the ' scum ' that mugged her parents , or grandparents or something , and impressing young hunks with her karate skills . In a pivotal scene she intervenes to stop a rape and a moron cop throws HER in jail , so after a couple cool shower scenes and some abortive prison - dyke seduction she has to take the law into her own hands blah blah blah . I guess there were a lot of movies like this ? The script is dumber than usual if you can believe that . Mani comes off as exactly the kind of showbiz type that would co - produce her own Death Wish starring role , and I find that type sporadically endearing , but the movie is an ungainly apparatus . Competent actors would be wasted on the scumbag roles here , and would actively undermine the fantastic mincing - incompetent DA and a judge that has got to be the producer 's uncle .
0 Please humour me if you will , for a minute while I read you the back of the ALLEY CAT VHS box . It says that:<br /><br />In this part of the city every street is a dead end- on every corner something to buy- in every alley another way to die- To survive you 're got to be the best- just like the Alley Cat . Alley Cat- this lady owns the night . On the streets where even the predators become victims she knows how to survive- Cross her and you 've run out of luck . Alley Cat- This animal is aroused.<br /><br />Now is n't that one of the most pathetic blurbs you 've ever heard in your life ? Whoever wrote that must be insane if they thought such a awful description could tempt us into viewing the video . Yet unfortunately , whichever faceless individual was responsible for that tragic use of English was doing their job only too well .. the movie contained within the little plastic case IS as bad as it sounds , and then some.<br /><br />Karin Mani plays the title role , and the script basically tells her during every given scene to either a ) Pout like a goldfish b ) Kick male butt or c ) Show off her feminine ' attributes ' . No complaints about the latter , but in terms of the other two .. let 's just say she is n't much of an actress , and is even less convincing as a martial arts expert . But even Meryl Streep with Cynthia Rothrock 's body ( what a scary thought ) would fail to save this movie . The unfolding of the plot is boring beyond belief , as we get one ineptly directed fight sequence after enough , pausing only for hysterical courtroom shenanigans and the occasional gag - inducing love scene with the interestingly named Robert Torti . The camera - work also follows a similar path of shame , with far too many unneeded close - ups and continuity errors abound.<br /><br />The part that I think really sums this scum - bucket of a movie up is where our heroine is sexually assaulted , and finds herself testifying in front of a corrupt judge while her rich - kid rapist leers at her from the box . Not only does he get off scot - free despite the overwhelming evidence against him , but she herself is then jailed for daring to protest about the verdict in front of his Honour . Behind bars , she then has a group shower , a lesbian crush , a couple of cat - fights and a nice , sweaty game of volleyball before being released on bail to continue her battle . This ten - minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the movie , and the screenplay grinds to a halt to encompass it . I can only imagine the producers wanted to add a bit more T&A to the mix , and came up with this needless sub - plot as a means to achieving that end.<br /><br />Which kinds of begs the question , is this an exploitation film , or a serious drama ? Neither , is my response to that .. it is n't sleazy or camp enough to appeal to fans of Troma - style cinema , and it certainly does n't make the grade as an exploration of one woman 's fight against the system .. purely because it is so appallingly made . So who on earth would want to see it ? Lunatics , I guess .. or IMDb reviewers who stay up till 3 pm and watch any old rubbish on the box while trying to get to sleep . Sadly on this occasional I failed , and the horrors will stay with me for quite some time . Do n't make the same mistake I did . Have a hot milk , or something .. 1/10
0 Mary Pickford becomes the chieftain of a Scottish clan after the death of her father , and then has a romance . As fellow commenter Snow Leopard said , the film is rather episodic to begin . Some of it is amusing , such as Pickford whipping her clansmen to church , while some of it is just there . All in all , the story is weak , especially the recycled , contrived romance plot - line and its climax . The transfer is so dark it 's difficult to appreciate the scenery , but even accounting for that , this does n't appear to be director Maurice Tourneur 's best work . Pickford and Tourneur collaborated once more in the somewhat more accessible ' The Poor Little Rich Girl , ' typecasting Pickford as a child character .
0 A routine mystery / thriller concerning a killer that lurks in the swamps . During the early days of television , this one was shown so often , when Dad would say " What 's on TV tonight ? " and we 'd tell him " Strangler of the Swamp " he 'd pack us off to the movies . We went to the movies a lot in those days !
0 Without question one of the most embarrassing productions of the 1970s , GAOTS seems to really , REALLY want to be something important . The tragic truth is that it 's so entirely valueless on every level that one ca n't help but laugh . Reaching in desperation for the earthy elements of Ingmar Bergman 's films , it follows a city couple 's day in the wilderness ... they walk along a shady path , allthewhile pontificating like a U.C. Berkeley coffee clatch . Almost every line of tarradiddle dialog delivered here is uproariously bad("I feel that life itself is made up of as many tiny compartments as this pomegranate .... but is it as beautiful ? " ) After what seems like an eternity of absolutely nothing happening(well ... OK ... we are treated to some nudity and a tepid soft sex scene ) , there is finally a VERY anticlimactic confrontation involving a pair ' Nam vets who are making the nature scene and performing some pretty harsh folk ballads with an acoustic guitar . < br /><br />Nothing at all eventful or interesting happens IN THIS ENTIRE FILM . I thought the Larry Buchanan picture " Strawberries Need Rain " was a weak example of a Bergman homage . " Golden Apples " is every bit as bad , but the ceaseless random verbiage it presents makes it memorably awful . 1/10
0 I used to review videos for Joe Bob Briggs ' legendary " We Are The Weird " newsletter . I saw a lot of stinkers , but this by far was the worst , and the years have not been kind - it remains the most indecent crime against cinema I have ever witnessed . Do n't get me wrong - CAGED TERROR is nominally more technically competent than , say , MONSTER - A - GO - GO or THE GUY FROM HARLEM or something of that ilk . What solidifies its claim as Worst Movie Of All Time for me is its unique blend of bare proficiency with crippling pretension . Is it a Vietnam commentary ? An ecological protest ? An incitement to race riot ? A study of man 's inhumanity to man ? A novel exercise in padding nature footage out to ( nearly ) feature length ? In short : a hep young urban professional ( possibly the most loathesome screen character ever ) somehow seduces a nubile Asian - American associate into camping in the woods with him . After brow - beating her with quasi - philosophical clap for the better part of an hour , they run across two wandering veterans , the unforgettable Jarvis ( a righteous brother ) and the Troubadour ( guitar - toting Manson Family reject ) . Hey , a plot twist ! Tension ! Action ! Suspense ! Well , no , just a climactic getting - locked - in - a - makeshift - wire - chicken - coop - and - lightly - belittled scene . The victim in question stares listlessly at the captors and mutters , " No ... no ... please ... do n't ... " Meanwhile , Jarvis addresses the Troubadour as " Trouby " once every two minutes , bringing to mind nothing so much as the alien star of Juan Picquer 's POD PEOPLE . That 's about all that happens in CAGED TERROR , and such a synopsis perhaps makes it seem almost tolerable . But trust me , I 've seen thousands of movies in my life , and this one has remained , for the past eight years since I first saw it , the absolute worst . ( I pop it in the old VCR once every two years or so just to reassure myself , and reassure myself I certainly do . ) I think the element which makes CAGED TERROR so particularly hateful is this : very little happens , and although what little does happen happens quite poorly and quite slowly , what truly makes it compulsively unwatchable is the suffocating sense that the filmmakers REALLY , REALLY WANT to shove some kind of message down your throat . But because CAGED TERROR is so incompetent and ineffectual , what was intended as a civics lesson becomes a crash course in intense viewing discomfort . This film is 75 minutes long and feels like three and a half hours . It 's terrible , truly truly terrible . Folks , trust me , I saw GHOSTS THAT STILL WALK and this one is worse . Go see it ! You 'll thank me . And curse me . Just for the record , my favorite line : ( In CAGED TERROR but perhaps EVER ) " Yeah , well , you probably think the Song of Solomon was an allegory for Christ 's love for the church ... ! " ( NOTE : Must be delivered in a tone of concerted condecension . )
0 This film turned up on local TV here in South Africa recently and I thought that I 'd warn even those who enjoy watching B grade bad movies ( which I do)that this is not even amusing . The plot concerns a couple visiting a house in the country . Some strangers appear and .... The problem is that most of the film , obviously shot in the early seventies , consists of extreme wide shots of people walking , in real time and awfully slowly , from A to B. This makes the film tedious in the extreme and the expected blood and gore payoff just never happens . I am really curious - how many people have actually watched this from beginning to end ?
0 When I was in school I made a film about a couple roaming around in the trees and talking , and I realized halfway through editing that this was not just a failing aesthetic strategy but a cliché of Canadian cinema : sodden lyricism married to vacant , metaphor - burdened stabs at social commentary . But whatever my own film 's failings I feel much better after seeing this ... this ... thing . For one thing , mine ran 20 minutes , not 85 , and had more content at that : every pointless bit of business here is fawned over for four , five , six relentless minutes . The male lead is just incredible , a brow - beating , loudmouthed creep given to outbursts of drama - class improv in between philosophical insights culled from the U of T pub , and he is given lots and lots of space to make us hate him . Admittedly if he were n't such an a**hole then the third act would make even less sense , as a couple snarky dudes show up to provide distant and thoroughly unhelpful echoes of ' exploitation ' values ; but it does n't make it any easier to watch the caged creep whimper " please " in closeup until the magazine runs out . I take back what I said about AUTUMN BORN , which at least had the courage of its own misbegotten lechery : this cinematic crater is and will remain the very worst Canadian movie of all time . At least , I really really hope so .
0 I saw this movie a couple years back . I could'nt sleep and there was nothing on . So I peeped it . What really gets me is it makes no sense and that s why its disturbing . Richard gets tied up in chicken wire and Jarvis starts making out with Richard 's girl while she 's unconscious . Then Jarvis 's buddy Troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar . By the next morning it shows Richard 's girl talking to Jarvis and Trouby and then she walks back to Richard and looks at him while he 's still tied up . Then they play some happy music and the movie is finished . I mean what happened ? Did they brake up ? And what was she saying to those 2 guys(Trouby and Jarvis ) ? Its to puzzling and to poor to . I ca n't stand movies that are disturbing and do n't make sense . This was the worst film i 've ever seen since the 90 's version of Lord of the Flies .
0 Basing a television series on a popular author 's works is no guarantee of success . Yorkshire Television learnt this the hard way when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books credited to Dick Francis , three of which were broadcast under the collective title ' The Racing Game ' . Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley , a former jockey turned private eye following an accident in which he lost his right hand , only to have it replaced by an artificial one . Gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma ( and looked like one of the bad guys ) while Mick Ford ( who played the irritating Chico Barnes ) made me think of a horse 's arse whenever he was on screen . For six weeks , this less - than dynamic duo charged about the countryside , foiling nefarious plots to fix races , usually by the same methods - blackmail , kidnapping riders or doping horses . Yorkshire Television threw money at the show , but to no avail . Violent , sexist , far - fetched and repetitious , it was quickly carted off to the knackers yard .
0 The one reason I remember this is that it was shown the week after Nigel Kneale`s brilliant QUATERMASS serial was broadcast . The trailers made heavy emphasis that the main character had a mutilated arm which had me hoping he`d be like Victor Caroon from THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT stalking the streets of London .<br /><br />No such luck because THE RACING GAME is just a rather drab thriller with the gimmick of having a hero with a physical disability trying to get to the bottom of investigations of corrupt horse racing . I suppose if you`re a fan of Dick Francis you might enjoy it but setting it in the context of the late 70s when THE SWEENEY had just finished and THE PROFESSIONALS was still being produced , there`s something lacking about THE RACING GAME . One trailer featured a car over taking another on a motor way , if it`d been a trailer for THE SWEENEY you`d see Jack Regan over taking a car and beating a confession out of the slags who`d done a blag while THE PROFESSIONALS would have over taken a car and blown away the terrorists inside . I think that sums up what`s wrong with this series
0 ' The Fox and the Child ' is the new film by French director Luc Jacquet , who brought us the Oscar - winning documentary ' March of the Penguins . ' It focuses around a young girl ( wonderfully played by Bertille Noël - Bruneau ) and her blooming friendship with a fox.<br /><br />There are some truly mesmerizing moments here ; badgers mucking about , a lynx chasing the fox through a snow - littered forest ; one scene in particular when the fox is being tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times . However , there 's simply not quite enough of them.<br /><br />Beautifully shot ; the cinematography is dazzling . The bubbly kind of look of the film is wonderful . It 's undeniably a very lush production.<br /><br />The English version is narrated by Kate Winslet , but what little dialogue there already is has been very poorly dubbed . The score is also far too fluffy , or at least it is for my liking ; and the screenplay , while subtle , seemingly jumps from one scenario to another , ultimately leaving me almost baffled.<br /><br />While there 's a nice moral at the heart of the film , and the rather quiet performance from Noël - Bruneau is quite lovely , the real star is the fox . Those captivating moments focusing solely around our furry little friend are tremendous .

0 This film has little to recommend it , though that little being the breathtaking scenery , cinematography and direction of wildlife , it is difficult to bring up its weak points in the company of such rave reviews . It is precisely these things , however , that make the lack of a satisfactory plot and its execution so disappointing . < br /><br />I watched this with my children and none of us was too impressed by the end . Yes , the pictures were great , the broad landscapes across the forest and mountains magnificent , but what was going on in the foreground ? The rather dull narration of the stupidity of an insipid girl who learns all too slowly a very basic lesson about befriending wildlife - and gets off quite easily given the track record of that sort of thing . It is certainly not a new story , in fact there is nothing remotely novel about the way it is told , and we have all seen this before , and , indeed , much more eloquently by Antoine de Saint - Exupéry.<br /><br />The only thing really to be gleaned from this film is a sense of how to work with these wonderful lenses and forest lighting ; the rest is a waste of time .
0 At the beginning of the movie , the beautiful photography and the scenes of the fox were amazing . However , the story was so very slow and boring . And then the little girl begins to domesticate the fox , which leads to tragic events . We live in the forest , and frequently see foxes . One thing anyone should know is that you leave wild animals to be wild , and enjoy them from afar . This movie sets a terrible example to the children who will be watching it , in trying to make a wild creature into a pet . I do not know what the point of the story was supposed to be . Even after the terrible events with the main fox , the little girl was still wanting to play with the kits . Does she never learn her lesson ? And there are other scenes featuring predator animals to the fox , which only adds to the trauma inflicted on children watching this movie . What a disappointment this movie was . And what a horrible story it tells . The final narrated dialog was so stupid , by which time my wife and I were screaming at the TV ! I absolutely hated this movie , and would never recommend it to anyone !
0 I went to see this movie with the most positive expectations . I had seen Jacquet 's previous movie ( march of the penguins ) and had heard a very positive review of this one on the radio . However , I was severely disappointed . Most of all , this movie is terribly boring . Literally NOTHING happens . I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend , and we both ended up laughing because I could only stammer things like " well then the winter comes , and then spring , and then there 's an eagle , and a river , and one time it is dark , and the girl goes into a cave , and another time the fox has babies " and so on . After about half an hour I began sighing , yawning , rolling my eyes , cursing the reviewer at the radio station , and hoping that it would be over soon . But the movie went on and on . When it finally ended I had sunken so deep into my chair that I must have looked somewhat similar to Stephen Hawking . The most annoying parts of the movie are ( a ) The girl , who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with . She wears the same clothes throughout the entire movie ( one year ) , and shows exactly two facial expressions : Joy and Seriousness . She is cute , no question about that . However , a movie about the beauty of nature like this one would have done better without her all - too - human presence . I found myself constantly hoping that she might get eaten by a bear , drown in the river , or something similarly terrible . ( b ) The commentary by the girl 's adult voice , which tells us nothing but negligible , obvious , boring , redundant things . ( c ) The music , which is desperately lacking subtlety . When the girl is happily jumping around , the music jumps around , too . When the fox is threatened by an eagle , the music becomes threatening , too . It reminded me of the very early days of film - making , and was just too predictable to enjoy . Admittedly , many of the children who saw the movie with me did obviously like it , at least they got somehow involved . Thus , my warning concerns adults only : If you are over ten years old , avoid this movie . You can get a better ( and cheaper ) sleep in most other places .
0 What an unusual movie.<br /><br />Absolutely no concessions are made to " Hollywood special effects " or entertainment . There is no background music , not special effects or enhanced sound.<br /><br />Facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the Spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfire.<br /><br />I sort of viewed these movies ( parts 1 and 2 ) as an educational experience , not really something to go and get entertained by . Its quite long and in places dull.<br /><br />But I suspect that given the lack of any plot development , I do n't think its very educational either.<br /><br />Its also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue - it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening , since for some reason the director did n't see fit to inform the audience why Che 's band was moving around the way they did - as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot at.<br /><br />I would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character , but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end . The stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare .
0 STAR RATING : * * * * * Saturday Night * * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning < br /><br />This second instalment of the Che films moves the story forward to the late 60s , where the man has now moved his resistance fighters into the hills of South America , surviving without enough food and water and with tensions mounting between the group . Everything comes to a head when he crosses the border into Bolivia and the government forces step up their campaign to bring him down.<br /><br />Without the flitting between time and places of the last film , Soderbergh 's second instalment focuses solely on the action in the hills , and manages to be an even duller experience . And more pretentiously , the score has been drowned out , giving the second instalment more of an unwelcome air of artsieness that proves just as alienating . There 's just an unshakeable air of boredom to the film that never lets up . You ca n't fault Soderbergh 's ambition or Del Toro 's drive in the lead role , it 's just a shame that somewhere in the production things managed to take such a disappointing turn . * *
0 Same old same old about Che . It completely ignored the really interesting facts of Che 's true character . Sodeberg redid the same boring narrative of Che . The silly seductive tale of an Argentinean rich - boy who was so shocked by poverty he became a Robin Hood fighting alongside the poor , until eventually he was murdered by the CIA . Yeah , yeah , heard it all before , BORING AND UNTRUE!. The reality of Che Guevara is very different and far more explosive ! The facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah streak , who openly wanted to impose Maoist tyranny on the world . He was so fanatical that at the hottest moment in the Cold War , he even begged the Soviet Union to nuke New York , Washington or Los Angeles and bring about the end of the world . CHe urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against US cities . For the rest of his life , he declared that if his finger had been on the button , he would have pushed it . When Khrushchev backed down and literally saved the world , Che was furious at the " betrayal " . If Che 's recommendations had been followed , you would not be reading this review now . How a homicidal maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting film . Incredible that no filmmaker has been daring enough to show the real side of Che and his posthumous media transformation . THAT WOULD MAKE AN Oscar WINNING FILM ! I thought making independent film meant taking REAL RISKS and being GROUNDBRAKING ! They only stick to " safe counterculture themes " , to wit , " Che cool " , " Wall Street bad " , " Republican= Nazi " , " Bush ex Hitler " , " NRA is worse than KGB " , " Christians are fanatics and stupid " , etc ... ad nauseum . Oooh , how daring , how mind blowing . Tres anti - mainstream and edgy . I wish they would have some real cojones and tackle the Independent Film Oligarchy ! That would be truly daring !
0 The second half of Steven Soderbergh 's revolutionary bio on Che Guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to Bolivia . In order to maintain his saintly visage of Che Soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in Cuba and the folly of his Congo adventure ( " This is the history of a failure " he writes in the preface of his Congo Journal ) to concentrate fully on Che 's attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in Bolivia . It would turn out to be a disaster and Guevara 's final act.<br /><br />What plagued the first chapter follows suit here as Soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative Guevara once again being played like James Dean in East of Eden by Bernicio Del Toro . The problem is Guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness Bolivian Jungle . Unlike Werner Herzog in the magnificent , Aguirre , the Wrath of God Soderbergh fails to utilize the jungle 's metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas . He seems more concerned with keeping Che 's nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders . There is one Herzogian moment where Che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall Soderbergh 's mise en scene remains flat , sloppy and uninteresting . < br /><br />In both of his films Soderbergh shows he is clearly a Che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow . He spends too much time building his monument to Che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga , especially Fidel Castro . Making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire . One would think he was steeped in enough Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping style .
0 Now that Che(2008 ) has finished its relatively short Australian cinema run ( extremely limited release:1 screen in Sydney , after 6wks ) , I can guiltlessly join both hosts of " At The Movies " in taking Steven Soderbergh to task.<br /><br />It 's usually satisfying to watch a film director change his style / subject , but Soderbergh 's most recent stinker , The Girlfriend Experience(2009 ) , was also missing a story , so narrative ( and editing ? ) seem to suddenly be Soderbergh 's main challenge . Strange , after 20-odd years in the business . He was probably never much good at narrative , just hid it well inside " edgy " projects.<br /><br />None of this excuses him this present , almost diabolical failure . As David Stratton warns , " two parts of Che do n't ( even ) make a whole " . < br /><br />Epic biopic in name only , Che(2008 ) barely qualifies as a feature film ! It certainly has no legs , inasmuch as except for its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution forced upon it by history , Soderbergh 's 4.5hrs - long dirge just goes nowhere.<br /><br />Even Margaret Pomeranz , the more forgiving of Australia 's At The Movies duo , noted about Soderbergh 's repetitious waste of ( HD digital storage ) : " you 're in the woods ... you're in the woods ... you're in the woods ... " . I too am surprised Soderbergh did n't give us another 2.5hrs of THAT somewhere between his existing two Parts , because he still left out massive chunks of Che 's " revolutionary " life ! < br /><br />For a biopic of an important but infamous historical figure , Soderbergh unaccountably alienates , if not deliberately insults , his audiences by < br /><br />1 . never providing most of Che 's story ; < br /><br />2 . imposing unreasonable film lengths with mere dullard repetition ; < br /><br />3 . ignoring both true hindsight and a narrative of events ; < br /><br />4 . barely developing an idea , or a character ; < br /><br />5 . remaining claustrophobically episodic ; < br /><br />6 . ignoring proper context for scenes --- whatever we do get is mired in disruptive timeshifts ; < br /><br />7 . linguistically dislocating all audiences ( even Spanish - speakers will be confused by the incongruous expositions in English ) ; and < br /><br />8 . pointlessly whitewashing his main subject into one dimension . Why , at THIS late stage ? The T - shirt franchise has been a success ! < br /><br />Our sense of claustrophobia is surely due to Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen basing their screenplay solely on Guevara 's memoirs . So , like a poor student who has read only ONE of his allotted texts for his assignment , Soderbergh 's product is exceedingly limited in perspective.<br /><br />The audience is held captive within the same constrained knowledge , scenery and circumstances of the " revolutionaries " , but that does n't elicit our sympathy . Instead , it dawns on us that " Ah , Soderbergh 's trying to hobble his audiences the same as the Latino peasants were at the time " . But these are the SAME illiterate Latino peasants who sold out the good doctor to his enemies . Why does Soderbergh feel the need to equate us with them , and keep us equally mentally captive ? Such audience straitjacketing must have a purpose.<br /><br />Part2 is more chronological than Part1 , but it 's literally mind - numbing with its repetitive bush - bashing , misery of outlook , and lack of variety or character arcs . DelToro 's Che has no opportunity to grow as a person while he struggles to educate his own ill - disciplined troops . The only letup is the humour as Che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant " revolutionaries " , some of whom violently lack self - control around local peasants or food . We certainly get no insight into what caused the conditions , nor any strategic analyses of their guerrilla insurgency , such as it was.<br /><br />Part2 's excruciating countdown remains fearfully episodic : again , nothing is telegraphed or contextualized . Thus even the scenes with Fidel Castro ( Demián Bichir ) are unexpected and disconcerting . Any selected events are portrayed minimally and Latino - centrically , with Part1 's interviews replaced by time - shifting meetings between the corrupt Bolivian president ( Joaquim de Almeida ) and US Government officials promising CIA intervention(!).<br /><br />The rest of Part2 's " woods " and day - for - night blue filter just exasperate the audience until they 're eyeing the exits.<br /><br />Perhaps DelToro felt too keenly the frustration of many non - American Latinos about never getting a truthful , unspun history of Che 's exploits within their own countries . When foreign governments still wo n't deliver a free press to their people -- for whatever reason -- then one can see how a popular American indie producer might set out to entice the not - so - well - read ( " I may not be able to read or write , but I 'm NOT illiterate!"--cf . The Inspector General(1949 ) ) out to their own local cinemas . The film 's obvious neglects and gross over - simplifications hint very strongly that it 's aiming only at the comprehensions of the less - informed WHO STILL SPEAK LITTLE English . If they did , they 'd have read tomes on the subject already , and critiqued the relevant social issues amongst themselves -- learning the lessons of history as they should.<br /><br />Such insights are precisely what societies still need -- and not just the remaining illiterate Latinos of Central and South America -- yet it 's what Che(2008 ) gleefully fails to deliver . Soderbergh buries his lead because he 's weak on narrative . I am gobsmacked why Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderbergh for this project if he knew this . It 's been 44yrs , hindsight about Guevara was sorely wanted : it 's what I went to see this film for , but the director diabolically robs us of that.<br /><br />David Stratton , writing in The Australian ( 03-Oct-2009 ) observed that while Part1 was " uneven " , Part2 actually " goes rapidly downhill " from there , " charting Che 's final campaign in Bolivia in excruciating detail " , which " ... feels almost unbearably slow and turgid".<br /><br />Che : The Guerilla aka Part2 is certainly no travelogue for Bolivia , painting it a picture of misery and atavism . The entire second half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humour , and the dramatic -- yet tragic -- capture and execution of the film 's subject.<br /><br />The rest of this interminable cinema verite is just confusing , irritating misery -- shockingly , for a Soderbergh film , to be avoided at all costs . It is bound to break the hearts of all who know even just a smattering about the subject.(2/10 )
0 It is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been uncovered and laid unequivocally at the doorstep of Marxism , from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag archipelago to the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer Rouge , one still finds admirers of Communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor . It just shows the moral depravity of Hollywood.<br /><br />In this particular film a psychotic murderer is glorified . Needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included . That both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable propagandistic film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of worship .
0 i think that 's this is awful produced and directed movie . Benicio Del Toro should n't work in production of movies , he should put accent on his acting and that 's it . Steven Soderbergh missed the whole point of the idea about revolution , about it 's ideals , and most important about life of Che Guevara and so on . Camera is awful , like someone with 2 day working experience is shooting with it , music is ... i do n't know .. is there some music in the movie ? ? ? ? i will not recommended this piece of sh .. to no one . It 's just wasting about 4 hours in front of the TV or whatever .... I ca n't figure out how can someone rate this movie more than 3 stars . DISASTER .... DISASTER .... DISASTER .... DISASTER Do n't watch please . Save yourself from this misery of " movie "
0 What I found so curious about this film -- I saw the full 4 hour roadshow version , is how oddly dispassionate it is . For a film about 2 very charismatic men -- Castro and Che , engaged in a gargantuan political struggle , it 's almost totally devoid of emotional fire . The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir ( who is at best a second level actor , with a slightly high pitched voice ) have no drama or depth and basically come down to Castro telling Che : go here , go there , do this and that , with no explanation as to what effect or use this action will result in . Odder still is there is an actor in the cast who has the requisite power to play Castro -- Joaquim de Almeida , but he 's shunted aside in a minor part in the second half . Without the tension or passion that you would expect to fire these men and their followers , the film becomes a dullish epic - length film about hairy , bearded men running through various jungles shouting and shooting to no particular purpose or end . Several of the reviews I 've read showered praise on the work of director Steven Soderbergh while ignoring the actors almost completely . ( One in fact spent more time talking about Soderbergh 's new digital film camera than the plot or actors or the fact that it 's entirely in Spanish with English subtitles.)This is an odd , odd thing to do since a ) Soderbergh was only a hired gun on the film and b ) it 's no more than a competent job of work , with an unremarked upon nod to Oliver Stone 's JFK in the black and white cut up camera - work when Che visits New York . If you can imagine Reds directed by Andrew McLaglen instead of Warren Beatty , you 'd get an idea of the dull competency of this movie .
0 The first part , Che in Cuba , is about that portion of his life . It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded ( remember that Che was a physician ) . It ends as Castro wins the revolution ; Che never gets to Havana . The second part , Che in Bolivia , is about guess what . It contains too many indistinguishable battles and Che ministering to too many indistinguishable wounded.<br /><br />When I realized this was supposed to be an " epic " ( I never knew * anything * but the title before it started ) , I naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all , David Lean 's Lawrence of Arabia . More of that later.<br /><br />Not to be a racist , but aside from what I 've already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters who are , well , indistinguishable -- unknown Hispanic actors who look alike , especially considering they all wear " Che " beards and all wear Che fatigues . This results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than Che , Benicio del Toro ( even Fidel has a very minor role ) . While del Toro 's terrific , think of " Lawrence " with Peter O'Toole as the only discernible character : no Alec Guinness , no Omar Sharif , no Anthony Quinn , etc . You get the idea.<br /><br />Because the other characters are interchangeable , this results in a loss of reference . When top aides of Che are killed , you feel no remorse since you do n't know who they are . Even when Che is killed ( I do n't think that 's a spoiler ) , there 's no empathy from the audience -- he 's just killed.<br /><br />He 's too one - dimensional to relate to as a human being . Aside from being a revolutionary and second only to Jesus in moral rectitude , the only thing we learn about Che is that he 's married with five children ( he tells another character that near the end ) . What was his motivation ? A complete enigma.<br /><br />Maybe Soderbergh is purposely aping Lean . Like Soderbergh 's Che , Lean never lets us know anything about Lawrence , the mystery man of Arabia . But at least Lawrence had a friend ( Sharif ) and associates ( Guinness , Quinn ) . He was as courageous as he was insecure -- i.e. , had human qualities . Che is like a machine , about as warm as The Terminator.<br /><br />Earlier this year there was another war epic , Mongol . Che makes Mongol look like It 's a Wonderful Life .
0 ( 48 out of 278 people found this comment useful , and counting ... )<br /><br />People are such suckers for image and looks - as much as for the intellectually hollow " idealism " that lurks behind Communism . Che 's charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by Leftist propaganda ( such as this movie ) about him.<br /><br />I do n't know what 's worse : being captured by one of Che 's murder - squads or having to sit through 4 hours of this typically Soderberghian garbage . The question is n't why this pet - project was made but what took them so long . By " them " I 'm referring , of course , to Left - wing Hollywood and its " secret " love of Marxist tyrants ( Lenin , Castro ... take your pick ) . I am fascinated that it took decades for one of Tinseltown 's least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project . Where was Oliver Stone all these years ? Robert Redford ? Tim Robbins ? Warren Beatty ? Alan Pakula ? George Clooney ? Barbra Streisand even ? It 's a mystery . All these overrated " artists " have often indulging themselves in similar , politically one - sided projects , yet somehow Che Guevara , who is arguably the most popular and well - known Communist , has n't been a film topic of theirs yet.<br /><br />"Guerrilla " has all the hallmarks of an American truth - bending story of an epic scale ; there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar Hollywood big - budget political fairy - tale bios such as " Malcolm X " or " Gandhi " , i.e. almost none . The movie stars Del Toro as the famous Argentinian revolutionary . Nevertheless , however controversial and criminal this man 's actions may have been , one thing nobody could take away from him : he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family - which is why Del Toro fits the bill only visually . Del Toro may be an interesting , charismatic actor and he may resemble Guevara physically , but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever , hence he makes Guevara come off as too primitive . Casting such mediocrities as Bratt , Philips and Franka Incompetente only underlines the director 's lack of sound judgment.<br /><br />The movie is to the most part extremely slow ( no surprise there ) , and visually uninteresting . Even a director as brilliant as Kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3-hour mark , so it 's quite telling that this Soderbergh , who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career , would think that His Oceanic Grandness was up to the task . If you think the film 's length indicates that a bulk of Che 's life has been shown here - then think again . Soderbergh focuses on Che 's last phase , and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense , full of Guevara 's alleged idealism . ( Psychopaths do n't have ideals . ) I do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of Che 's earlier life . Did he actually consider it too uninteresting ? A massacre of 600 people holds no interest for the viewer , huh ? Amazing . Some much better directors than this over - praised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a 4-hour movie.<br /><br />Soderbergh , in a sense , becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative , dark side - which is more than 90 % - of Guevara . By spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy , consciously ignoring the ugly truth ( God forbid he should taint the holy image of Che ) , Soderbergh proves himself not a humanist - a fake image which most Hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold - but the opposite : that he cares only about ideas , never about the people on whom these ideas are tested ( like on guinea pigs ) . Soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind ; such people often have a latent contempt for the " proleteriat " ( what a stupid term ) they 're supposedly siding with.<br /><br />Half of all students around the world wear Che 's image on their red and orange shirts , but without ever knowing why . He has become an iconic figure for clueless , uninformed , very often young people , who think that by having this man 's face on their chest that somehow makes them appear " edgy " , intellectual , hip or interesting . In reality , wearing a Che shirt only underlines one 's overall shallowness and total disinterest in self - education . ( Would n't YOU want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his / her face to the world ? ) Wearing Che 's by - now cliché image has become as common as having a Bart Simpson coffee cup . All those " Che - wearers " probably know more about Marge 's blue hair than they 'll ever read up on about Fidel Castro 's dead ally.<br /><br />After everything that 'd been done in the name of Marx , one would think that these mongrel " ideals " would be finally laid to rest . It seems mankind will never learn . Stalin , Mao , Kim Il , Pol Pot , Castro , Milosevic , Ceausescu , the Iron Curtain , a hundred million dead , more than a billion ruined physically and/or mentally through this system ... so none of that matters , huh ? < br /><br />The fact that Del Toro won a Cannes Award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how Cannes and other European festivals work - and vote . Hint : Sean Penn headed a jury not long ago.<br /><br />For my music - related rants , go to : http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/
0 This " documentary " is a proof of talent being used for mean purposes . The fact that it is financed by the venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in the purpose of searching for the truth of what really happened those horrible days of April 2002 in Venezuela , something even we venezuelans do n't know for sure.<br /><br />There are ways of lying , and the directors of this stuff lie both by omission and by knowledge . < br /><br />The venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by foreign audiences , and they take advantage of that . For instance * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * they show pro - Chávez demonstrators shooting at an empty street ( what the hell they did that for ? ) in a way of saying they did n't kill anyone , but did n't bother showing the images we all saw here , of opposition demonstrators ( and a journalist ) falling dead or injured at the other side of that " empty " street . They ca n't explain why the chopper of the political police was the only one authorised to fly over Caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers that were all over the roofs of the buildings nearby the presidential palace , something that would exhibit how inefficient would be the security measures to guard the President . A few days after the " coup " , the chief of the military guard in charge was asked at the National Assembly ( our Congress ) why did n't they act against the snipers and he said " 'cause they were n't there to act against the president " , is n't that a confession?<br /><br />There is so much more , the fact that the highest rank military announced that Chávez had resigned and 2 days later he said he had lied because " that 's politics " and nowadays is the Minister of Internal Affairs of Chávez ' administration.<br /><br />It would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this " documentary " , made with the intention of selling the world an image of the good old Hugo Chávez who rules for the poor and the bad rich opposition that wants him out at all costs , when the truth is that 60 - 70 % of people rejects his government , and that percentage includes the poor.<br /><br />I hope those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version that is being made by a group of venezuelan people showing no less than 30 lies.<br /><br />Nazi propaganda has returned !
0 In this movie , Chávez supporters ( either venezuelan and not - venezuelan ) just lie about a dramatic situation in our country . < br /><br />They did not say that the conflict started because of Chávez announcement firing a lot of PDVSA best workers just for political issues.<br /><br />They did not say anything about more than 96 TV interruptions transmitted by Chávez during only 3 days in " CADENA NACIONAL " ( a kind of confiscation o private TV signals ) . Each one with about 20 minutes of duration.<br /><br />They did not tell us anything about The quiting announcement made by General en Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero , Inspector General of the army forces , who is a traditional supporter of Chávez . Even now , in despite of his announcement , he is the Ministro de Interior y Justicia . After Chávez return he occuped the Charge of Ministro del Defensa ( equals to Defense Secretary in US).<br /><br />They did not say anything about Chávez orders about shooting against a pacifical people concentration who was claiming for elections.<br /><br />They did not say anything about the people in this concentration that were killed by Chávez Supporters ( either civilians and Military official forces).<br /><br />They present some facts in a wrong order , in order to lie.<br /><br />They did not say anything about venezuelan civilian society that s are even now claiming for an elections in order to solve the crisis and Chávez actions in order to avoid the elections.<br /><br />That 's why i tell you .... This movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie .
0 Recently , I saw the documentary " The revolution will not be televised " , also know as " Chávez : inside the coup " . At first I thought it showed a genuine inside view of events during the Venezuela coup of April 2002 . What bothered me though was the fact that the tone of the narration and the accompanying music were suggestive , and that at no point any criticism was expressed about Hugo Chávez . This is peculiar because if a documentary is giving an non - biased account of what happened , there should have been some of that too . After all , Chávez certainly is not a saint . Fortunately , since the documentary is several years old , a lot of additional information is available on the internet nowadays , and it was not difficult to find for instance " Urgent Investigation about Chavez - the coup by the 5 European TV Corporations who financed the film which presents blatant falsehoods about Venezuela . " It lists the many errors and intended or unintended falsifications in the documentary . ( Just use the title as a search string in Google , you will find it ) . Another interesting document was the video registration of a presentation of the findings of the many errors in this documentary , " X - ray of a lie " . To me it seems to be a good counterweight to " Chávez : inside the coup " It 's available at video.google . I strongly advice you after watching " Chávez : inside the coup " to look at " X - ray of a lie " and then form your opinion . My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian were ( knowingly or not ) part in Chávez - propaganda .
0 Remember a film you seemed to enjoy in the past that does n't quite meet those same feelings as an adult ? That occurred to me when I went back to school .. the National Lampoon 's Class Reunion . The film has a perfect opportunity for laughs , but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth , a man who appears to be a vampire , and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over his head . You have the class president who believes he 's the best thing since sliced bread(but as we see in the film , he 's a coward and joke ) , a couple of pot smokers who do n't even know they are at their own class reunion , and a man named Gary for whom know one even knew existed(and no one can seem to remember his name .. this is the one running joke I enjoyed ) . There is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places , a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog , and the cook(you know her from " goonies " and " Throw Mama From The Train")who loves to place food on people 's plates with her hands ! The film is essentially about a nutcase who is(or at least attempting to)taking revenge on his classmates for a gag they pulled on him(they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister ! ) . The film follows the characters as they search for the killer canvasing darkened , trashed hallways of the old high school . They were told of the killer by his psychologist who seems a bit odd himself . The film has a few good gags that work(pretty much early on ) , but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute . The film 's true problem is that it really does n't know where to go . The film is pretty much a one - joke premise for it has unassured direction .. if it really has any direction at all . The cast is enthusiastic enough , but the material they are to make funny just does n't have the quality to hold any interest . It 's a curio for fans of early 80 's comedy relics that are forgotten(this one rightfully so ) .
0 If it was n't for the performances of Barry Diamond and Art Evans as the clueless stoners , I would have no reason to recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />The plot centers around a 10 year high school reunion , which takes place in a supposed abandon high school(looks more like a prop from a 1950s low budget horror flick ) , and the deranged student the class pulled a very traumatizing prank on . This student desires to kill off the entire class for revenge.<br /><br />John Hughes falls in love with his characters too much , as only one student is killed as well as the lunch lady(Goonies ' Anne Ramsey ) . We 're led to believe that the horny coupled gets killed , but never see a blasted thing ! This is a horrible movie that continued National Lampoon 's downward spiral throughout the 80s and 90s .
0 Anyone who thinks this film has not been appreciated for its comic genius must have been smoking with the two stoners in the film . This film is NOT under - rated ... it is a bad movie . < br /><br />There should be no comparisons between this film and The Naked Gun or Airplane since the latter two films are well written and funny . Class Reunion is neither of those things . The sad thing is it had such potential ( good cast , good story lines ) but the good jokes are few and far between . The scenes that were supposed to be funny came off more annoying than amusing . The stoner guys , the vampire , the blind girl ... NOT FUNNY . The only funny character were Delores ( the one who sold her soul to the devil).<br /><br />National Lampoon has made some really good films ( Animal House , Vacation ) but this is n't one of them . I certainly expected more from John Hughes .
0 Stereotypical send up of slasher flicks falls far short as supposed entertainment . Gerrit Graham , Michael Lerner , Zane Busby , and in fact the entire cast are totally wasted . Lame jokes abound , and every punch line is well telegraphed . The dumb one liners come at a fast pace , and almost every one falls flat as a squashed grape . The musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that sets in and lingers for the entire movie . Another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school . Avoid this and seek out one of " Lampoon 's " truly funny films like " National Lampoon 's Golddiggers " - MERK
0 The biggest National Lampoon hit remains " Animal House " , and rightly so . It was funny , raucous and good - natured.<br /><br />The exact opposite of every other National Lampoon film . Including " Class Reunion".<br /><br />PLEASE do not be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst ( " Flounder " ) from " Animal House " . Or by the fact that John Hughes wrote this jumbled mess . This reunion is about as hilarious as root canal and twice as painful.<br /><br />One star , and that 's being generous . Then again , I always thought most of my old classmates were demons , vampires and serial killers , too .
0 NATIONAL LAMPOON 'S CLASS REUNION was a flop when it was released . It did n't stay long in theaters in my big city . Why ? Because it 's BAD!!!!!<br /><br />Not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way . The entire cast of actors were mostly unknowns then and have remained unknowns after this turkey.<br /><br />The idea is actually great ( a parody of slasher flicks ) but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect . < br /><br />Just avoid this " comedy " . Your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing misfire .
0 This movie is about as underrated as Police Acadmey Mission to Moscow . This movie is never funny . It 's maybe the worst comedy spoof ever made . Very boring , and dumb beyond belief . For those people that think this movie is underrated god help you . I give this movie * out of * * * * < br /><br / >
0 This movie is rated a classic on sentiment not on any quality of movie - making . It moves from the unlikely to the unbelievable , from the unrealistic to the ludicrous.<br /><br />The unbelievable plot revolves around an attempt by two British soldiers and a Hindu gofer to rescue a third soldier who has been captured by insurgent Indians . In the later scene we see a full regiment with drum and bagpipes marching into an ambush . In the British army , a sergeant does not order up a rescue attempt , and if you get past that , he does not attempt it with only one other soldier and an Indian servant when there is a full regiment on hand . The Indian insurgents are so incredibly inept it is laughable ... there are hundreds of them but they ca n't hold their prisoner or kill the two rescuers , of course not . At one point we see the British soldiers throwing blocks of stone down from the battlements at the insurgents , who are scattered around the mountainside in ambush ... one would have to have an eggplant for a brain to think this would do any damage . After Cary Grant as the rescued prisoner is shot , he lies on the floor looking around at the water boy ... hardly the actions of someone who has been shot in the back . The water boy bravely blows a bugle ( which comes from nowhere ) to sound the alarm ... this he does by standing up high on a wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad guys , and we shed a tear as he keeps trying to sound more notes as he is repeatedly shot and the bugle call breaks up into feeble squawks ... instead of blowing the bugle while hiding behind cover as anybody with half a brain would do . This scene has deservedly been parodied in comedy sketches . If they wanted to make a Buster Keaton comedy , they should have hired Keaton and done it better .
0 Not one of the better pokemon movies.<br /><br />Two legendary pokemon come into the story . You do get to see how strong Celebi can be , though he turns evil first.<br /><br />Suicune also makes an appearance , he did n't seem that powerful.<br /><br />The Marauder did n't have many strong pokemon at all , except for that taranitar ? Some fight scenes with his pokemon may have made it better.<br /><br />Ash and Pikachu meet the much younger Professor Oak , though they do n't realise it . Misty I was thinking had it at the end but she did n't get close . I saw this in the credits.<br /><br />Don't expect much here , the worst of the series so far .
0 The movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of Pokemon Celebi . But the plot was out of course and did n't have as an interest as the other movies . It was a waste of money and time . The same corny humor and cliche bad guys . The movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make Pokemon famous . The movie should better not associated with animes such as Dragonballz , Digimon , or Yu - Gi - Oh . The drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime . It is a shame even to talk about this movie . I bet Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on Pokemon . Digimon is more of an anime and does n't fall anywhere close to Pokemon . It 's second movie is coming out late 2002 .
0 Wow . This movie bored the pants off me when I saw it . Bland , pointless and unmoving.<br /><br />Apparently , Ash and co. can travel through time with the help of " The Spirit of the Forest " ( ' Princess Mononoke ' much ? ? ) There , they meet a dorky kid named Sam , and the " plot " begins.<br /><br />So Tom ( Ash ) and Huck ( Sam ) get high with nature , become hippies and try to free Celebi ( the " Spirit " ) from some weirdo hunter guy . I do n't even know what else went on . It all went by in a blur . Ash 's friends were hardly in it , and all the fight scenes were boring.<br /><br />After saving the day , Ash and his infamous friends , must return to their time , while watching Sam float away with Celebi ( that scene was just creepy . O - O ; ) Then , after returning to their time , Ash learns that his new friend is actually his rival 's grandpa . And I think that 's it . Pretty retarded is n't it ? If you love your children , you wo n't expose them to this . ( 1 out of 10 . )
0 Many of the lead characters in Hideo Gosha 's 1969 film " Hitokiri " ( manslayer ; aka " Tenchu " -- heaven 's punishment ) were actual historical figures ( in " western " name - order format ) : Ryoma Sakamoto , Hampeita Takechi , Shimbei Tanaka , Izo Okada , _ _ _ _ Anenokoji . The name " Hitokiri , " a historical term , refers to a group of four super - swordsmen who carried out numerous assassinations of key figures in the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate in the mid-1800s under the orders of Takechi , the leader of the " Loyalist " ( i.e. ultra - nationalist , pro - Emperor ) faction of the Tosa clan . What was this struggle about ? Sad to say , you wo n't find out in this film . " Brilliant History Lesson " indeed!<br /><br />No , Gosha is much more interested in showing you the usual bloody slicing and dicing and ( at absurd length ) the inner torment of the not - very - bright killer Izo Okada than in revealing actual history . Sakamoto , for example , was someone of historical significance , considered to be the father of the Imperial Japanese Navy . The closest Gosha comes to providing a history lesson is the scene in which Sakamoto , whom Takechi considers a traitor to the Loyalist cause , comes to Takechi 's mansion to try to sway him ideologically . He begins by talking about the international political situation , with foreign warships in Japan 's ports and a Japan that is too weak militarily to defend against them . Want to know more ? Sorry . Gosha cuts off this potentially fascinating lecture in mid sentence ( ! ) . So much for informing his audience about a turning point in Japanese history.<br /><br />The film left me in utter confusion about the aims of the two sides in this struggle . For the two and a half centuries that the Shogunate held central power in Japan , it was an institution dedicated to preventing social change , to preserving the feudal relations of society . It was fearful of outside contamination , both ideological and technological . In keeping with this spirit , it outlawed firearms , those instruments of " leveling " in Europe and the Americas , with which a peasant could have stood up to a samurai . Throughout this period , the Emperor was nothing more than a spiritual figurehead.<br /><br />But , in the towns , which stood in neutral zones between the feudal fiefdoms , a new class of merchants , landlords and craftsmen was developing -- the class known in Europe by its French name , the bourgeoisie . Inevitably , as this new class gained strength , it chafed against the many confines of feudal society . As in Europe , the king ( Emperor ) became the central figure in the bourgeoisie 's struggle for power against the feudal aristocracy . But a political leadership does not always fully understand the interests of the class it serves . When the outside world arrived with a bang in 1853 , in the form of U.S. Admiral Perry 's " Black Ships , " the ruling elite of Japan was thrown into a crisis . Their military was no match for these foreigners . Also , they had heard about the havoc the British and French imperialists were wreaking in China . What should Japan do to save itself from the fate of its weak neighbor ? Surprisingly , some elements within the usually isolationist Shogunate were inclined to open trade with the foreigners in order to obtain some of their advanced technology . This is the point of view represented ( just barely ) in the film by Sakamoto . On the other hand , the Emperor - loyal ultra - nationalists , represented by Takechi , believed they could keep out the foreigners by force , if only they could prevent the other faction from " selling out the country . " ( Sound familiar ? ) Thus , the assassination of key Shogunate figures is in order -- and away we go.<br /><br />Takechi 's motivations were , for me , the film 's biggest puzzle . Gosha suggests that he is fighting mainly for his personal advancement rather than for the Loyalist cause . Can we take this to represent the tenor of the Loyalists as a whole ? ( Do you care?)<br /><br />Several reviewers have compared this film favorably with " Goyokin , " which Gosha made in the same year . But , where " Goyokin " is a crackling , suspenseful , adventure yarn , with a hero worthy of sympathy , " Hitokiri " is plodding , nowhere near as compelling and lacks such a hero . Sakamoto could have been this film 's hero but we are not allowed to know him -- nor what he stands for -- well enough for him to achieve that status.<br /><br />In view of his wonderful scores for five previous Kurosawa films , Masaru Sato 's score here was very disappointing , sounding like something rejected from a " Bonanza " episode.<br /><br />Barry Freed
0 To heighten the drama of this sudsy maternity ward story , it 's set in a special ward for " difficult cases . " The main story is Loretta Young 's ; she 's on leave from a long prison stretch for murder . Will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life , or heed her husband 's plea for the opposite ? Melodrama and sentiment are dominant , and they 're not the honest sort , to say the least . For example , just to keep things moving , this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward , and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babies.<br /><br />There are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a Warners film , mostly from Glenda Farrell , who swigs gin from her hot - water bottle while she waits to have twins that , to her chagrin , she finds there 's now a law against selling . An example of her repartee : " Be careful . " Farrell : " It 's too late to be careful . " Aline MacMahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse , but do n't expect her to be given a dramatic moment.<br /><br />The main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone to mush . Even given the obvious limitations , this film should have been better than it is .
0 After watching many of the " Next Action Star " reality TV eps TiVo taped this gawd - awful tripe for me . For some bizarre reason - and I only have myself to blame - I watched the whole thing , hoping that there would be * something * unique in the entire movie . After so much hype about Joel Silver 's " Midas Touch " with action flicks , he might want to make sure he bones up on his alchemy.<br /><br />First , the only redeeming value of the entire film was Billy Zane , and even he could n't lift the slipshod writing out of the crapper . Having said that , Zane 's performance falters about 2/ 3rds of the way through , as he does n't even seem to know what else to do other than look smug . < br /><br />Can't blame him here , though . The writing , quite frankly , sucked . Let 's take ideas from " Rat Race , " " Enemy of the State , " " Terminator , " " Midnight Run " and any bad gambling film you can think of and simply rehash it . And who 's brilliant idea was it to have TWO bridge chase sequences in a ROW?<br /><br />Sean Carrigan , the " man of the hour " of " The Next Action Star " shows all of the strengths and weaknesses the casting directors mention during the entire run of the series . A one - note johnny , Sean plays the dumb good looking jock very well , but struggles with shouldering the weight of the film . Quite frankly , we never quite seem to care about whether he lives or dies by about mid - way through , as Carrigan fails to provide a reason for the audience to even like him . His dumb - but - lucky routine gets old as there really is n't anything about the character to root for.<br /><br />But Carrigan is a dream compared to the wooden , rigid Corinne Van Ryck de Groot . Did Howard Fine really tell her to pretend to be a Terminator for the first half of the film ? I do n't think so . I kept expecting her to quote Arnie . Her character " performance " can be compared only to the dramatic depths of " Freddy Got Fingered , " though not nearly as well - developed . The camera loves her in dark , shadowy limousines , but in the harsh light of day her demeanor sucks all energy off the screen . Jeanne Bauer showed more natural life in her five minute bit part than Corinne showed at any part of her screen time.<br /><br />Ultimately , Sean has the rugged good looks to provide a good lead in an ensemble cast , but should n't have been left to do this one solo . It was simply too big of a task for him . " Next Action Star " colleague Jared Elliot may or may not have had better luck with some more dynamic characterization , but it 's hard to tell given Jeff Welch 's lame script . Someone should take Welch 's iMac away from him before he hurts himself or anyone else . And finally , Van Ryck de Groot simply was outclassed and way out of her reach , even for complete shlock like this . < br /><br />Joel Silver should be ashamed .
0 HAH ! So this is the movie that the " Next Action Stars " were getting into . Well I 'm glad that I did n't participate and did n't win ... <br /><br />Isn't it funny how one can just look at the first 10 seconds ( ! ) and make up ones mind about a movie ? I mean , come on ! Just look at those titles ! ? I watched this movie(or part of this " teleplay " since it was produced for TV and we could n't bear to watch the whole thing ) one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical hodge - podge of average guys that once in a while watch series like Las Vegas just for the girls in the show . so the bar was n't really high , the most watched movie in my group was Girl Next Door ( and it was n't because of the great script ;D . But this movie 's total lack of originality , acting , scripting , and just about everything else that makes a movie good made it pretty easy to switch channel to Las Vegas ( or was it CSI ? do n't remember ... ) without any complaints by the rest of the group . And that is rare ( ! ) For heavens sake ! Do n't by this movie ! If it 's on TV , then yes , watch it . And contemplate on it . My conclusion ? well , since Joel Silver has indeed produced some of the best action - films out there ( Die Hard , Matrix 1 , to name some ) I can only say that producers do n't give the film it 's quality , they provide money for the directors . And to sell this movie just because it 's a Joel Silver movie is just a desperate attempt to conceal the obvious flaws of the crew who really made it .
0 It is unbelievable that a script as cliché and completely absurd could make any screen even the small one . The dialogue in this movie makes Catwoman seem like a high culture classic . Billy Zane plays the bad ass harmonica playing , Elvis impersonating , gunslinging , martial arts master who gambles on the life of a down - an - out former football player turned gambling addict played by the winner of NBC 's craptastic show " Next Action Star . " His performance is as cold as ice and not in a cool way . The " film " takes place in Vegas , and since people play poker there the writers felt it was a perfect setting for a movie about a guy trying to survive 24 hours against an omnipresent , wealthy gambler who has offered his target $ 2.4 million if he can make it through the day . And so the hunt ensues . A hunt reeking with unimpressive explosions , construction yard settings , shoddy cinematography , and one - liners containing the word " bet " or " gamble . " The female winner is also tossed in the mix , but for what reason I have no idea . Oh but do n't worry " NAS " fans the losers make their memorable cameos as well . The surprise ending will knock your socks off if you love predictability or plagiarism . Joel Silver should reevaluate his decision to sell out even more . I wish he could give me those two hours of my life back .
0 This was the worst movie I have ever seen Billy Zane in . I understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers , who did pretty good for newbies , but over all , the movie was not believable.<br /><br />With all of the gunfire , you would think the police would have intervened . Even the coin being a bug on Sean was stupid . The way Sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug , was not realistic.<br /><br />Looks like this movie was slapped together fast . Poor job . Get a better writer.<br /><br />The count down to the end was not in sync with anything . It took longer to fight . And what a coincidence that each time Billy was going to blast Sean , he 'd be out of bullets . Once , I can believe , but not twice . < br /><br />Actually , Billy 's character was goofy . It was so stupid when Sean punches him out at the end . It was like a comedy . Bad ! Bad ! Bad !
0 Maybe television will be as brutal one day . Maybe Big Brother ` was only the first step in the direction Stephen Richard Bachmann ` King described the end point of . But enough about that . If I spend too much words talking about the serious background topic of this movie I do exactly what the producers hoped by choosing this material . It 's the same with The 6th Day ` . No matter , how primitive the film is , it provokes a discussion about its topic , which serves the producers as publicity . Let 's NOT be taken in by that . The social criticism that is suggested by that plot summary is only an alibi to make it possible to produce a speculative , violent movie , more for video sale than for cinema . < br /><br />I did n't read the book . I do n't dare criticising Stephen King without having read him , but when I saw the film I thought they could n't make such a terrible film out of a good book : In a typical 1980s set with 1980s music and some minor actors Arnold Schwarzenegger finds himself as a policeman running away from killers within a cruel TV show . The audience is cheering.<br /><br />Together with Predator ` , this is definitely Schwarzenegger 's most stupid movie . 2 stars out of 10 .
0 I am probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King 's book , the one this movie was based on . After reading this excellent work , I could not wait to see the movie version of it . After viewing the movie , I was TOTALLY disappointed . The only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters . In the book , Schwarzenegger 's character is put on a game show . The main object is to survive . But he 's not in an arena . He 's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show 's ( I guess you 'd call them ) villians , who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters . This premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax . The movie was absolute garbage . There was no cinematic quality to it . I totally respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor , but he messed up with this one .
0 : : : SPOILER ALERT:::<br /><br />Soooo , Arnie 's really a good guy , but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobeying of orders , he 's sent to jail ( or rather some sort of work camp ) . He escapes , but after a short while he 's caught once again . This time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he 's supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes , and eventually die . But we all know Arnie , and we all know that he 's tougher than even the toughest of tough guys.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie , being an Arnie - fan and all . However , " The Running Man " contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me . E.g. The reconstruction of Arnie 's fight inside the helicopter , where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident , complete with 5 - 10 different camera angles . This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members , one of which _ inside _ the eye of one of the crew members Arnie beats.<br /><br />There are other flaws also , and the plot , which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative , works for a while , then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drowns.<br /><br />The acting ca n't really be said to be anything better than sub par , with Arnie in the leading role , doing an average Arnie performance . The rest of the cast get by without being especially good or bad.<br /><br />The special effects are OK , without being impressive.<br /><br />RATING : 3/10
0 I read the running man from Kings books as Bachman and I felt for the main character John and his family . This movie could have been SO much more . The trouble ? It was set during the big action movie craze . I watched the movie and was in pain during the whole thing . I felt nothing for the character and less for his cause . Yes it had funny scenes ( or laughable ) though I think that it did not save the movie in my eyes . If you read the book you can feel the climax and the fire in the heart of John as he gets his final revenge.<br /><br />I give this movie a low number . It may not have been this low if I had not read the book .
0 I am a big fan of Stephen King . I loved The Running Man . So obviously I was very excited that someone had made a film of it . And when a local network showed the film , I was in heaven . I was all ready for a night of fun!<br /><br />The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone had cast Arnold Schwarzenegger . I could simply not believe that a man who got famous for films filled with runnin ' an ' shootin ' could play a more cunning part , as was described in the book . I still was convinced that this would be a good film , however . Who knows , maybe Arnold had some hidden talents?<br /><br />Well , he did n't . I soon found out that the only reason he was even cast was because someone had re - written the entire story to MAKE it about fightin ' an ' shootin ' . Yup , it was a standard Arnold - film : hero is done wrong , hero solves problems by flexing his mighty muscles and scaring everyone away and hero gets the girl.<br /><br />I was stunned . This is NOT what the book said at all . I know that books ca n't be put on screen literally , but this did n't even have ties to the book . Stephen King should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film and he should have forbidden using the title The Running Man for this shameless waste of film . I do n't say it often , but this film was BAD . If I were n't at home watching , I 'd have tossed rotten tomatoes at the screen . Once again : bad.<br /><br />(Note that I used ' someone ' a lot . I did this because I 'm sure a lot of people are ashamed to have worked on this and I do n't want to embarrass them even further by naming them here )
0 argh ! this film hurts my head . and not in a good way.<br /><br />maybe it 's just my growing hatred for the action genre , but even as a kid when i would swallow tripe like Navy Seals , i still regarded this film with dislike . now i utterly despise it.<br /><br />take one fairly good fast - paced story . keep the title and throw the rest away . instead use some half - assesd future gladiators storyline that s so full of plot holes the whole things in danger of collapsing ( why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena , what about the cameras ? why have clearly marked footage of what really happened at bakersfeild in an unguarded room?)<br /><br />the whole film screams eighties , from the truley awful score to the goofy shiny costumes . ugh.<br /><br />don't watch this film . i know some people liked it , but some people get off on being peed on and i do n't understand them either .
0 This was a waste of 75 minutes of my life . The acting was atrocious and the plot was ridiculous . It revolves around an evil lesbian who gets rich married men to have sex with her , and then blackmails them for money . One of the victims is a candidate for DA , which is causing problems in his relationship with his wife . Another is a plastic surgeon , also married , and the evil lesbian happens to seduce this guys wife too ! Meanwhile , the evil lesbian 's girlfriend does n't really like her sleeping around . It ends in a happy ending where all is forgiven . The women get naked a lot too , mostly in situations that stretch reality . bad bad bad .
0 this became a cult movie in chinese college students , though i havnt watched it until it is broadcasted in channel4 , UK.<br /><br />full of arty giddy pretentions , the plot is mediocre and unreal ; the ' spirit ' it wants to convey is how independent artists ' resist the commercisliation of music industry ' and maintain their ' purity of an artistic soul ' and would nt ' sell themselves for dirty money ' . that is really giddy and superficial ; the diologue are mainly pathetic . acting is poor . sceenplay is full of art pretention . it is a fantasy movie for kids and that;s all < br /><br / >
0 I have to admit that by moments I had to laugh at how bad that movie was ... But the laughs were too few and since this whole thing was in no way a parody , it felt more like an insult to the viewer 's intelligence . The worst acting I have ever seen from any of these people ...
0 Imagine , its , say 12 - 1am - your at home , your bored , your not tired . This scenario occurred about , say 4 or so years back .. I turned on the TV and flicked over a few channels and found that this film was on . OH MY WORD this is the worst film I have ever seen ! A runaway car that ca nt be stopped ( cos the brakes have been cut or something ) in caning it down the freeway - what s gon na happen ? ! This film was so bad its actually funny - I think the stunts cost about $ 2 to make , there was one instance where a baby / small child is being winched from the car by a helicopter - in an attempt to excite the viewer - a conveniently placed bridge is nearing ahead ... THIS IS THE BEST BAD BIT OF A FILM EVER - it shows the child narrowly missing the bridge but it looks so bad - you can almost see the make of the dummy that they used - total low budget classic ! Ca nt remember the end of the film , though but I bet it was GREAT < br /><br />I doubt they will ever show this film again so I 'm glad I got to see this piece of trash !
0 This 1997 film - blanc classic tale of smoldering passion has achieved its well - deserved legendary status as one of the screen 's greatest sagas of a doomed and hopeless love . The pervasive , ongoing and progressive magnetism between Judge Reinhold and what's - her - name is sure to set many a viewer 's heart a - flutter with memories of one 's own first crush . The brilliant screenplay dangles this embryonic affair - to - be in front of the enraptured audience , sitting transfixed as the abstract , almost - expressionist cinematography deep - focuses on the just - under - the - surface desires that ebb and flow between the principals . You can cut the sexual tension with a dull tire iron . < br /><br />A tiny drop of perspiration on the end of a nose catches the bright sunshine , and leaves no doubt as to its significance . Scenes like this abound and bear watching again and again . As with " Jane Eyre " and " Rebecca " ( to which this masterpiece is so often compared ) , the closeups of the actors ' faces as they experience the slow dawning of the great love - that - is - not - to - be will haunt you forever . < br /><br />The now - classic RC soundtrack score , with its creative and unique use of solo synthesizer , emphasizes the emotion that drips throughout like a leaky crankcase.<br /><br />If I had any criticisms at all by mentioning what I consider a minor flaw ( and dared to risk the wrath of the millions of fans who hold this classic so dear to their hearts ) , I would say that the hallmark of " Runaway Car " - its sense of mounting sexual tension - is briefly broken by the highway scene , which now after repeated viewings seems just a bit overlong ( and probably even unnecessary ? ) to the eternal , bittersweet tale of Love Interrupted.<br /><br />Dare I advance what I perceive as the tiniest of flaws in this critically - acclaimed triumph of modern cinema ? ' Citizen Kane ' had its ' Rosebud ' . . . ' Runaway Car ' should have its catchword as well . Perhaps the film could have opened with an extreme closeup of Judge Reinhold saying something such as " A car is an extension of its owner ! " , and the rest of the storyline could then be dedicated to parsing every syllable , subtlety and nuance of that phrase . Had that plot line been done , this film could have topped " Titanic " at the Golden Globes that year , I 'm convinced.<br /><br />My one regret ? That I did n't read the novel first .
0 this film has it all ; the deft camera work , reminiscent of martin scorcese , or oliver stone , the tight acting of ' heat ' , the explosive action of a jerry bruckheimer movie , the witty dialogue of a tarantino script and the epic feel of say , ' the godfather'<br /><br />the judge reinhold character displays a fiery temperememt , yet also shows real emotional depth and intensity . his performance reminds me of robert de niro 's portrayal of jake la motta in raging bull.<br /><br />the action scenes are truly breathtaking , not since bullit has a movie depicted such high octane , yet stylish car scenes . The special effects push the boundries of technology and filmmaking to their limits . Independance day set the standard that this movie clearly has matched , and greatly surpassed.<br /><br />overall , great acting from its a list cast ( like an oscars night party invitation list ! ) , classy locations , gripping action , and a tight script .
0 This movie is so bad it hurts . The car doing 30 mph when it 's supposed to go 100 ... the shift lever that 's stuck ( in Park ! ) , the nurse that drives for almost 2 hours with the cell phone on the shoulder ... can't any of the 2 morons take this damn phone ? There 's nothing credible in this crap . I would be ashamed to be seen in a movie like this !
0 There is no story ! The plot is hopeless ! A filmed based on a car with a stuck accelerator , no brakes , and a stuck automatic transmission gear lever can not be good ! I would have stopped that car within one minute whether I was in it or in the police car constantly following it . I feel sorry for the actors that had to put up with such a poor script . The few scenes that some similarity to action was heavily over - dramatized , and as far from reality you can get . In addition , there were a lot of blunders , for instance the hood of the runaway car , which was popped doing 100 mph . At first it just folded over the windshield , like it would in reality , but then , afterwards , it blew off . The car was later in the movie observed with the hood on .... <br /><br />This film was nothing but annoying , stay away from it !
0 How this piece of garbage was put to film is beyond me . The only actor who is at all known to me is Judge Reinhold , an accomplished actor whose presence is merely a justification for putting it into production.<br /><br />I do n't even think it is worth a nomination for a rotten tomato award , this film really does make B movies a cinematic enjoyment . A car travelling along the freeway with police in tow , and no one knows how to stop the car , yeah , right.<br /><br />The script must have been written on the back of a cigarette carton . Most made for TV movies are awful but this redefines the word . Check out the acting skills of the bridge operator , pure Oscar material .
0 Quite one of the worst films I have ever seen . Terrible acting , laughable ' action ' ( it 's clear that the cars are travelling slowly ) , atrocious script , hideously unsatisfying ending and incompetent direction make a hash of a movie . We know Judge Reinhold is a fine actor , but he should be ashamed of this detritus . There is no great tension within the car and , when the characters stumble upon moments of hope , they laugh like inane banshees for some reason , even ' high five - ing ' when they see the bridge lowered!<br /><br />Also , the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car strains credibility . Apparently based on true events , though ? If that 's the case , truth is evidently stranger than fiction ! Unfortunate then , that it was portrayed in such an inept manner .
0 Watching this movie made me think constantly ; why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes ? There are a million options to slow down the car ! In the movie Speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car was n't able to stop ... <br /><br />There are n't many good things to say about this film ; all the usual narrative cliche 's make their appearance , the actors are very bad , the story is as leak as a sieve etc . That makes this movie a waste of time and money.<br /><br / >
0 Comment this movie is impossible . Is terrible , very improbable , bad interpretation e direction . Not look ! ! ! ! !
0 Weak plot , unlikely car malfunction , and helpless fumbling characters . At first I thought this movie was made during the seventies , since the picture quality , as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old Kojac episode . When I checked and found that it was really made as late as -97 I was astonished . This is by far one of the worst and least ( thriller ) movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />If you read this , be advised , if you see it you waste time when you could have done something more exciting , like watching paint dry .
0 To call this anything at all would be an insult to everything else . Some expletives might describe it , but still too positively . Normally one ignores this kind of rubbish , but it was so stupid that one can but despair . Would have though that even Americans and commercial TV - stations would have given this piece of s**t a miss . But as the Germans say : Gegen die Dummheit kaempfen die Goetter selbst Vergebens !
0 I 've had to change my view on the worst film in the world having just seen this one . THIS IS IT!<br /><br />Make no mistake this film is awful.<br /><br />Here 's a list of reasons:<br /><br />Hopeless storyline ( despite being based on a true story ) . Dreadful acting ( what was Judge Reinhold thinking ) Unbelieveably bad stunts . Childish dialogue . Non - existent continuity . Lack of atmosphere.<br /><br />Get the picture?<br /><br / >
0 For the knowledgeable Beatles fan , the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws , inaccuracies , combined events , omitted events , wildly exaggerated events , omitted people , timeline errors , mis - attribute quotes , incorrect clothing , out of place songs , and ( shame shame ) incorrect instruments and other boners I just ca nt think of right now . The flaws come fast and furious so you 'll have to be on your toes.<br /><br />I did n't give this a " 1 " primarily due the fact that it is filmed in Liverpool and the actors ( the band Rain ) give it their all ( the Lennon character is credible and does a good job ) . Also , the song " Cry for a Shadow " is heard at one point and THAT counts for SOMETHING.<br /><br />So , , , watch it for fun , but please do n't take it as historically accurate .
0 The movie uses a cutting edge title for a lame story . Kill Kill , would have been nice . The movie incorporates taboo scenes to make the viewer move back in their chairs . The scenes are unnecessary and choppy . The movie is something a novice screen writer could have conjured . Just a waste of movie props and network money . I have to write 10 lines of text to critique this film when it is not worth 10 lines of my time , but I have to push on to let the people know to avoid the nonsense . If people are counting on you to choose a good movie for movie night , pick something else . If you have a soul do n't damage it by subjecting yourself to this filth .
0 ... was so that I could , in good conscience , tell everyone how horrible this movie is . I barely made it through twenty minutes before I started thinking to myself,"Wow , this is pretty bad . " . And , to be honest , I would 've given this movie 1 star if it was n't for Esai Morales ( though he had very little screen time ) . He 's the movie 's only well - acted role , which is a shame because I really like Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought I did.<br /><br />While watching this I started thinking back to his part in " Shawshank Redemption " and realized it was n't as good as I thought it was . Problem : his jail - house / tough guy act seems like it 's just that , an act ; his dialogue sounded like he was doing a very poor impression . Has he ever met someone who speaks like his character was SUPPOSED to ? I doubt it , but maybe he should have.<br /><br />And , to make matters worse , they 've managed to inject a little jail - house philosophy and make it seem nothing short of contrived , especially when you consider that the rhetoric was being spouted by a " rasta " who 's accent was so strong that it seemed unnatural.<br /><br />I would n't normally slam a movie like this , but when I saw the movie it had a fairly favorable review . I felt like I was cheated and lied to , and I thought I should try to save someone the misery of having to watch this movie.<br /><br />I say BOOOOOOOO .
0 I saw this movie at Sundance 2005 and was stunned at how bad it was , although based on the catalog description I was excited to see it . Supposedly a " mockumentary " of two high school students making a documentary of high school life , it featured bad acting , bad directing , completely lack of engaging characters as written , and all - around is a total bust . I love good movies about high school , and this is not one of them . The characters are one - dimensional and self - consciously " cool " although they are supposed to be outcasts . You get the overall impression of a bunch of people sitting around making an on - purposely - bad movie to show their friends , yet somehow it got into Sundance . Mystifying .
0 The only saving grace of this movie is that it serves as the 0 end of the movie rating scale . Now if I see a movie that really stinks I say this movie was a real Pecker . I believe this movie is a perfect example of Christina Ricci 's one dimensional acting . Horrible
0 Whoever gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more movies.<br /><br />A loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family . The movie is filled with idiots and includes live " teabagging " . That should sum it all up for you.<br /><br />Do not waste your time . You may want to watch the entire movie in the hopes that it gets better as it goes on - it does n't !
0 This film can not even be said to be bad for it is sadly , just painfully mediocre . Lacking any real wit or imagination , a thin plot is stretched to the absolute limit and the ` jokes ' ( which are predictable and threadbare ) are spun out to such inordinate length that boredom and yawns quickly overtake the viewer . Another notch to mark the sad decline of John Waters and a reminder that what ` shocked ' or amused us 30 years ago does n't work quite the same way now . We 've seen it all before , and it no longer breaks any taboos because they have long since evaporated . A major miss .
0 This may very well be the worst movie I 'll see if I live to be 100 . I think a group of first - graders could have come up with better plot lines as a class project than this . I 'm dumber for having watched it , and God have mercy on the souls who were paid to produce this film.<br /><br />And after I finally turned it off , I actually had the urge to vomit.<br /><br />No one had a clue about photography when made this . No one had a clue about acting . No one had a clue about just about anything.<br /><br />I ca n't believe F / X shows this crap on occasion . The only time I had seen it was on one of the Starz ! channels - not even the main one . And it was on at about 3 a.m. at that .
0 This was one of the worst movies i have ever seen . The plot is awful , and the acting is worse . The jokes that are attempted absolutley suck . Do n't bother to waste your time on a dumb movie such as this . And if for some reason that you do want to see this movie , do n't watch it with your parents .
0 The movie is basically a boring string of appalling clichés which do not offer a real cross - cultural insight . The Middle Eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way : there obviously are mud brick villages , dirt tracks in the middle of the desert , women clad in black robes and belly dancers . I wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture . The personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible . < br /><br />The original idea might have been interesting , but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight , you should skip this movie .
0 I was China in this film . I choose the screen name Sheeba Alahani because I was modeling at the time in Italy and they could n't pronounce my real name correctly , so I choose Sheeba and then added Alahani since it was similar to Alohalani.<br /><br />I had never acted before ( and it shows ) , but it was so much fun to film . They gave me " acting lessons " each morning ( which obviously were not useful ) . They dubbed my voice ( thank goodness).<br /><br />David and Peter were a blast on the set , full of good humor and jokes . This film was never meant to be taken seriously , it was a tax write off according to inside information . < br /><br />I give it a 1 because I have a sense of humor , but a 10 for the fun I had " acting " in it .
0 When I decided to watch THE BARBARIANS , starring those twin bodybuilders , Peter and David Paul , I thought it could n't be that bad because the film was directed by Ruggero Deodato , who has a reputation for creating sleazy movies but well made sleazy movies . Well , THE BARBARIANS is remarkably trashy action / adventure movie that wants to be another CONAN THE BARBARIAN , and fails at every level . The look of the film is all wrong . Some scenes were well shot but the tone and the schintzy , tacky " disco " look of the clothes and hair people are adorned with just does n't make any sense whatsoever , even for a low budget flick like this one.<br /><br />Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairdo and costume . He 's supposed to be menacing but he comes across as a buffoon . And it 's funny to see Eva LaRue Callahan , one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN , appear in her first movie , walking around in skimpy fur bikini . I 'm sure she wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth ! The so - called Barbarian twins are okay as the muscle bound heroes but it 's almost impossible to construct a proper critique of their acting because their roles are , like everything else in this mess , really ill - conceived . The only way the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a loincloth that covers his ass , while the other twin 's loincloth barely covers his muscular butt . I 'm not kidding ! Do n't ask me who 's who though.<br /><br />Deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this film . And his desperation is reflected perfectly in this trashy flick . It 's just bad .
0 Cannon pulled off a real visual beauty of a medieval epic that appears fascinating ( except for the dragon prop ) . Now just how did the long - gone studio known for Chuck Norris movies ever come up with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place ? Case in point : the amateurish acting and horrible plot is a sign that reviving the medieval legend is no cure for some lousy execution . They actually went on and made another cheap exploitationer featuring hundreds of lusty bimbos , just to make this look even better . For the two " Barbarian Brothers " , they sure know how to make weird noises than becoming brave warriors so strong and bold enough to save their native land . This is the single greatest waste of potential I 've seen from an " expensive " low - budget movie , and worse enough to let an axe strike through the gorgeous print without mercy . All of this followed an advertising campaign that sold T - shirts based on THE BARBARIANS ! The movie alone makes a great souvenir !
0 This movie really deserves the MST3 K treatment . A pseudo - ancient fantasy hack - n - slash tale featuring twin barbarian brothers with a collective IQ of hot water , character names that seem to have been derived from a Mad Libs book , and such classic lines as " Hold her down and uncover her belly ! " , The Barbarians crosses over into the " so bad , it 's good " territory .
0 This film was very well advertised . I am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months . While I was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be , my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it . Then I went and saw it , I was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until I remembered that I had paid for this movie . I made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i would nt feel bad and destroy the good mood I was in , plus I wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie ! I always go into a movie with an open mind , not trying to go into them with too many expectations , but this movie was not that funny . Now it was nt the worst movie I 've ever seen , but it is definitely worth waiting for HBO . If you have nt seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it , but for true comedy fans I d say pass . Maybe even check out The Kings of Comedy again . Something told me to go see Meet the Parents instead ! ! !
0 The Ladies Man is a funny movie . There 's not much thought behind it , but what do you expect from an SNL movie ? It 's actually better than most SNL movies ( i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury ) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny . Chris Parnell was also funny in his short scene ( one of the funnier ones in the movie ) . Other than that , the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support Meadows . I 've definitely seen funnier movies , but I 've seen dumber ones too . Again , it 's not exactly a deep movie , but it 's good for a few laughs . It was funnier as a skit though . But still , if you 're looking for a pretty funny movie , I 'd recommend this one . Just do n't think about it too much , or you 'll hate it.<br /><br />Rating : 6/10
0 I honestly do n't understand how tripe like this gets made . The worst junior - high talent show skit you 've ever seen is more entertaining than this film . Will Ferrell 's wrestling fetish provides the only ( briefly ) humorous moments . Utterly horrible .
0 While Leon is cute on SNL , he 's only on for a minute . Like most SNL skits - to - movies , this one ca n't fill 90 minutes . It has some cute moments ( the ones you 've seen in the trailer ) but the actors are largely wasted . Tim Meadows does his best but the plot just does n't have many high points . Will Farrell has a bit part . Farrell may be the funniest man alive ... but not in this movie . What a shame .
0 Lorne Michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business producing movies.<br /><br />You'd think that after such dismal flicks " Superstar " , " Night at the Roxbury " , and " Coneheads " , he 'd start to get the notion that maybe he does n't know what he 's doing when it comes to movies ( and many would argue that he does n't know what he 's doing when it comes to television , as well ) . Trying to make feature films out of skits that wore out their welcome the third time the were done on SNL makes no sense.<br /><br />I personally like Tim Meadows , and think that he would be great in the right movie . It 's a shame to see a talented guy wasted in a film that features unfunny after unfunny situation , and caps it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene . Any laughs here will be because the movie is so bad , not because it 's funny.<br /><br />Oh well , at least we can be thankful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never have films done about them . It 's just too bad that this one made it to the big screen .
0 I could name plenty of funny movies . There are comedies that set out to be funny , and are . Some movies , like a Gymkata for example , try to be serious but end up funny . The Ladies Man is a film that is desperately trying to be funny , but could not be less funny if it was about a guy who got a lot of chicks in the middle of the wreckage of a nuclear holocaust . It 's anti - funny.<br /><br />I do n't think I laughed harder than a chuckle at anything in this movie . It 's simply unfunny . It 's boring , stupid , inane , annoying , mind - bogglingly bad , but not funny . I do n't particularly care for Tim Meadows , or this character from SNL , but I expected better than this.<br /><br />The movie is completely lacking logic or common sense . It 's like the script writer had a bag over his head while he was typing and he could n't see which keys he was hitting . They tell the " origin " of the Ladies Man , but fail to include a motivation for his bizarre fascination with acting like it 's still the seventies . The movie tries to get humor out of a man who appears to pleasuring himself to porn , shortly after he tried to hang himself . This is comedy ? I like to consider myself having a pretty keen sense of humor ( Spending a lot of time writing comedy as I do ) , but maybe I 'm just not quite bright enough for this film.<br /><br />Lee Evans , so funny as Tucker in There 's Something About Mary , is outrageously bad here . I was pleading with him in my head to shut up.<br /><br />By the end I was pounding on my chair , muttering under my breath , and had the film gone on any longer , would probably have attempted suicide . This film might not be as bad as Battlefield Earth , but it 's the first movie I 've seen that 's come close.<br /><br / >
0 I rented this movie for a few laughs . I had never seen the SNL skit , but with hits like Tommy Boy , and Waynes World , it could n't have been that bad , could it ? The answer : it was . This movie hardly was a means of relaxing after a hard day at work . I just kept waiting for a plotline and a funny part , but there was n't any . The highlight was tiffany amber thieson , and that s just about it .
0 First of all , I 'd like to say that I love the " Ladies ' Man " sketch on SNL . I always laugh out loud at Tim Meadows ' portrayal of Leon Phelps . However , there is a difference between an 8-minute sketch and a feature - length movie . Watching Leon doing his show and making obscene comments to his listeners and coming up with all sorts of segments for his show , like " The Ladies Man Presents ... " which is reminiscent of " Alfred Hitchcock Presents ... " is absolutely hilarious . There 's a great episode where Cameron Diaz role - plays Monica Lewinski , and Leon plays Bill and they call it " The Oral Office . " See , that 's funny ! ! ! < br /><br />In the movie , we do n't see Leon on the show too often . In fact , he gets kicked out of almost every radio station in the country . And the plot revolves around his quest for true love , involving a mystery letter that got dropped off at his houseboat , signed by " Sweet Thing . " Karyn Parsons , who is famous for playing Hillary on " Fresh Prince of Bel Air , " works with him on the show and has a secret crush on Leon . The movie just piles on one boring subplot after another . And the gags are boring as well . The first time we see Leon mention the word " wang " it 's pretty funny . When he uses it over and over again , supposedly trying to get a laugh , the joke has run dry . Most of the jokes he uses in the film are jokes we heard before , and done better , on the SNL sketch and played out tediously for a whole hour and twenty - five minutes . They even try to insert a musical number by Will Ferrell and his gang of Ladies ' Man haters , who all want to destroy him because their wives had an affair with him , to bring some life into this witless comedy . Ferrell has some funny moments , and tries to make the best out of an otherwise unfunny role . Ferrell just has that unique comic talent , and he 's funny at almost anything he does . Even Julianne Moore gets a cameo . Watching her , you ca n't but wonder " What the hell is an Oscar - winning actress doing in this movie ? ? ! ! ! ! " Her name was n't mentioned in the opening credits -- probably by her consent . And of course a movie of this theme has to include the Master of Love himself , Billy Dee Williams . Billy Dee is charismatic as always , but even he ca n't breathe enough life into this film . I also have to add that the soundtrack is full of soft R & B hits , which impairs the film even more , giving it a horribly downbeat tone -- as if the script is n't boring enough . I mean , this is " supposed " to be a comedy . The soundtrack would 've been appropriate for something like " Love Jones . " < br /><br />"The Ladies Man " only has sporadic laughs . There are exceptions in which SNL can produce a great movie out of a short sketch . Watch both of the " Wayne 's World " movies , and you 'll see how it 's done . But this movie , just like adapting Mary Catherine Gallagher 's character to screen in " Superstar , " shows the flip side . Some sketches are meant to be remembered on SNL , and not on the silver screen.<br /><br />My score : 3 ( out of 10 )
0 I think I laughed twice . The line where the main character says something about being from the streets . And then I forget the other time I laughed . It was probably in the beginning.<br /><br />This has to be one of the thinnest movies ever . Does n't Hollywood realize that this kind of humor is degrading and sad , really . You can only insult yourself so many times.<br /><br />2/10
0 I rented this tape a couple of years ago , and boy did it suck . From the commercials , I was lead to believe that this was a movie about a guy who had no no luck with women , and that was where the comedy would lie . Boy was I wrong . The jokes were vulgar , and they were just not funny . Do n't bother . 1/10
0 was this tim meadows first acting role in a movie ? the character , leon , is funny enough but shortly after that the sexual jokes and humor are too dumb to listen to anymore . some movies can get away with the sexual jokes , and base their audiences to know that right when the advertising comes on . some movies that do this are american pie and scary movie . scary movie was stupid , and american pie would nt have done well without the sexual jokes . the only role , besides leon , that had some humor that followed was will ferrell . the character really was dumb and that was all , the dumb humor was all that had me watching . the movie was ok , and nothing else . i do nt really understand why the snl people that are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show . the skits last about 5 minutes , and if they can make a movie off a 5 minute skit , then what is the world coming to ? molly shannon had superstar , cheri o'terri had scary movie , but she was nt a leading role , and will had elf . but that was good , but he did some dumb movie , but i ca nt remember , and mike myers with wayne 's world . how come the mad tv crew do nt ever get movie deals ? seen only one guy break through , but only in like 2 movies and a tv show with andy dick . but that guy relies on comedy for his life to continue , funny or not . this movie is not good , but had some positive humor . what a waste of film and people 's money . ( D D- )
0 I disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the British . The film effectively blames the people of NI as being the cause of their own troubles . It suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with Britain 's partition of Ireland and domination of its history i.e. NI was created by Britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of Ireland.<br /><br />The characters are portrayed as hapless fools , even though I despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause - maintaining their artificial privileges over the Catholic community . It is a known fact that British Intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war , no doubt to keep the Catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism.<br /><br />Nineties ' values about ' machismo ' , masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s Belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique Irish ' psyche ' which leads to violence . The stupid song from the woman in the club - old Ireland of green fields .. blah .. blah .. - is given a symbolic stature , i.e. poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause . Tedious , ahistorical , cheap and nasty trash . O'Sullivan has made a personal statement on a conflict which requires serious political analysis .
0 being a NI supporter , it 's hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists . characters who are hard to root for , typical heavy - handed anti - violence messages , and a predictable ' poetic justice ' ending makes this an awkward watch ...
0 I 'm a big fan of Westerns but this one .... whew , what a stinker ! I think what turned me off almost right off the bat was the inane dialog . I think I could have written better dialog than this when I was in eighth grade . And the poor actors ! Given this terrible dialog , none of them came across looking anything but ridiculous . Really , I 'm not kidding . Some of this is little better than what you 'd get in an Ed Wood film . < br /><br />The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden . He was probably THE " big " star in this movie which if you called it a B - Western , you 'd be lavishing praise upon it . This is what should be called a B - minus Western perhaps . Pity Sterling Hayden , who appeared at other times along with Joan Crawford , Bette Davis , Frank Sinatra , and other major talents . For him to appear in a vehicle this poor must have been something he tried to downplay for the rest of his life.<br /><br />One annoying thing about this movie is all the men look like they have n't shaved in a week and their faces are all greasy . I know in the old West guys were n't always well groomed but to a man this is a movie that makes you want to just go ' EWWWW ! ' Really , this is a crummy Western . Denver Pyle also had to live this one down , especially after appearances in so many great Westerns . Bad , bad movie .
0 What a shame that a really competent director like Andre de Toth who specialized in slippery , shifting alliances did n't get hold of this concept first . He could have helped bring out the real potential , especially with the interesting character played by William Bishop . As the movie stands , it 's pretty much of a mess ( as asserted by reviewer Chipe ) . The main problems are with the direction , cheap budget , and poor script . The strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept-- characters pulled in different directions by conflicting forces . What was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole , instead of the sprawling , awkward mess that it is , ( try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can ) . Also , a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shots , and gotten the locations out of the all - too - obvious LA outskirts . The real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast-- Hayden , Taylor ( before his teeth were capped ) , Dehner , Reeves , along with James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their untimely deaths . Few films illustrate the importance of an auteur - with - vision more than this lowly obscure Western , which , in the right hands , could have been so much more .
0 Really bad shot on video " film " made by not one , not two , but three amateur video makers.<br /><br />If you 're going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood , gore and nudity . There is some blood provided by latex cut off arm props bought at a Halloween store . There are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex . The lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talking.<br /><br />There seems to be no editing effects- fades , wipes etc . Once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenes.<br /><br />Terrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up the majority of the end credits . The werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the " actors " face . They did n't even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks , arms or wrists.<br /><br />I guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movie . No reason at all to buy , rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video .
0 It 's like this ... you put in the DVD and the most professional - looking thing you see over the next ninety minutes is the logo of the distribution company . And at this point , you know you 've just been jerked around.<br /><br />People are generally trusting enough to assume that if something has been put on DVD , it 's going to be of a certain level -- at least financially if not creatively . But sadly this is n't the case . Distribution companies are perfectly happy to throw together DVDs of amateur movies and ship them right out into the stores to await the unsuspecting buyer who is drawn in by the well - designed DVD cover . The weight behind this particular project is most likely independent horror movie pioneer Kevin J Lindenmuth , whose name may be known amongst genre fans since he 's responsible for various other low - budget werewolf movies -- " Rage of the Werewolf " , " Werewolf Tales " and so on.<br /><br />"Blood of the Werewolf " is made up of three short independent werewolf stories with no real connection other than the fact that they deal with hereditary shapeshifters . The first segment , " Blood Reunion " , pretty much sets the tone for the whole thing ... a man returns to his home town to look up a girl who had a crush on , only to find that her domineering grandmother refuses to let her have relationships with men , and for reasons which are somehow related to a dark family secret . This instalment is poorly directed , poorly directed , and basically nothing superior to what you could throw together yourself with a few friends and a home video camera.<br /><br />The second story , " Old Blood " , is probably the strongest out of the three and is directed by Lindenmuth himself . It tells the story of a lesbian couple , one of whom is a shapeshifter and the other wishes to be given this power . Her wish is granted , but she does n't become the creature that she envisioned . This short movie shows that Lindemuth has more talent and experience than the other filmmakers who worked on this project , but still not enough to raise it above the level of an amateur movie.<br /><br />And finally we have " Manbeast " , in which some army guy runs through the woods while being chased by two other fellas . They wish to kill him as he has been bitten by the beast and is believed to be dangerous , but all might not be as it seems . This one has an interesting concept , but it 's stretched out to be far too long , and if you do n't guess what the " twist " is in the first ten minutes then you probably ai n't too bright . This pretty much sums up the problem with this whole DVD ... a few good ideas just are n't enough to justify spending money on something like this . After all , would you pay for a picture you could have painted yourself ?
0 What 's with the murky video in the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie ? It 's like someone put muddy water on the camera lens.<br /><br />The violence and nudity might turn some people off but , that , along with the mostly bad acting is what makes a good cult movie I suppose.<br /><br />My favorite line is delivered by Tarquin the Vampire , " Alas , your breed is dumb . " Okay , no one should ever say " alas " in a movie line unless they 're English and living in the 18th century.<br /><br />The acting by the Van Helsing character and bad girl " Rally " is n't bad . I also liked Master Little played by Ron Little . Wicked martial arts ! Do n't take it too seriously and you 'll enjoy it .
0 This was a " cute " movie at first , then then got too sappy and featured mediocre songs , at best.<br /><br />There is too much King James English spoken with is not only annoying in today 's world but not always easy to interpret . Can you imagine young people of today trying to listen to this film ? Forget it.<br /><br />Bing Crosby has some good lines in here and is likable as " Hank Martin . " Rhonda Fleming ( " Alisande La Carteloise " ) was , too , in addition to her good looks and beautiful , long red hair . < br /><br />It 's a nice movie with a feel - good ending , and I ca n't knock that . Maybe this is worthy of a rental , for historical sake or if you 're a big Crosby fan but , overall , it 's not that much .
0 Although I have enjoyed Bing Crosby in other movies , I find this movie to be particularly grating . Maybe because I 'm from a different era and a different country , but I found Crosby 's continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first , trite after a while and then finally annoying . Do n't get me wrong - I 'm not anti - American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave , oh so smart American visitor to show them the way . It 's a " fish out of water " story , but unlike most movies of this sort , this time it 's the " fish " who has the upper hand . To be fair to both myself and the movie , I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time.<br /><br />(I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor 's Waltz - and that , too , produced the same reaction in me . And to my surprise even my wife - who for what 's it 's worth is American - found the " in your face " attitude of American Crosby to be irritating . One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt , as she put it . ) < br /><br />As for the premise of the movie , it 's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good . The scenery and the music is also good , as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks horrid ( picture Moe of The Three Stooges).<br /><br />All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because he is in virtually every shot it 's pretty hard to sit through this movie .
0 Giving credit where it 's due , only the technicolor , costumes and sets deserve any honorable mention.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly the lowest point in BING CROSBY 's long career at Paramount . The script is about as clumsy as you could possibly imagine and neither the casual Bing nor William Bendix nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do a thing about repairing it . < br /><br />Bendix looks extremely foolish in a page boy wig . And poor Rhonda Fleming has a stock costume heroine role requiring her to look adoringly at Bing and little else except for warbling a couple of uninspired ballads in a voice probably dubbed for the occasion.<br /><br />Just plain awful ! Mark Twain 's wit is not evident in any of the screenplay . Only die - hard Crosby fans can possibly appreciate this mess of a film given uninspired direction . Even the extras look as though they do n't know what they 're supposed to be doing.<br /><br />Summing up : Dull as dishwater . Not recommended , even for children .
0 I liked Batman : Dead End . A dark edgy film - noir setting for Batman was perfect . Batman : Dead End is good . This is not.<br /><br />First of all let me start off with the acting . None of it is really that good . The best would probably be Clark Bartram as Batman . But that is n't saying much . He is good at first glance , and then you realize he is what he is , a body - builder who happens to be a tolerable actor . But mainly the problem is that Batman does n't belong in the daylight , he looks like a freak running around in a Bat suit . Instead of a horribly scarred man trying to make up for past mistakes . The daylight also reveals an irritating dorky scowl on Bartram 's face which never leaves and unoticeable in Batman : Dead End , probably because of the darkness of short which is so desired in this trailer . Bartram seems to think that scowling and stubbornly shaking his head is acting , it 's not , it 's quite the opposite . It 's called posing , something real actors avoid like the plague.<br /><br />Something I never understood why Collora casted body - builders as the leads . It makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can manage it , instead of a bodybuilder who can kinda manage it but HEY HE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE THE COMIC ! Of course , they might have done better if Collora 's dialouge did n't leave much to be desired.<br /><br />The entire trailer ( yes , trailer . There will not be a full - length film ) is more centered around Superman then Batman . But everything on the Superman side is corny , cloying and amateur . Michael O'Hearn ( Superman ) is one of the worst actors I 've ever seen . He stands around , smiles , says his lines . That 's about it . Although I 'm not surprised since he is just a bodybuilder they hired and possibly received a few acting lessons . Once again I say to Collora , cast ACTORS . Not bodybuilders . Actors will be so much more compelling that we will forgive the fact they do n't look exactly like the comic book.<br /><br />The costume is what you would expect Superman to wear . As for the Batman suit . Well , I guess it only looks good in the dark . I say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you would buy from a Halloween gift shop.<br /><br />Superman flies in this movie . But that is n't a good thing . These shots look especially amateur . This and a lot of the entire " film " looks like it was shot in their backyard with a VHS camera.<br /><br />The best shots are a shot of Superman catching a car in his hands . And the final shot of Two - Face and Batman at the very end . For those of you who have seen the trailer . You know what I 'm talking about . Now if only he could have stretched that shot through the entire trailer.<br /><br />Finally I ask . Why if you 're trying to show your ability as a director , would you make a trailer as a short film ? This proves nothing when it comes to being an actual director handling story . My only piece of advice for Collora here is , there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and being able to work in marketing.<br /><br />Batman : Dead End did n't feel amateur . I ca n't figure out where this went wrong .
0 So on the Chills Network on cable they are having " Vampire Month " , I 'm such a dork , but I love vampires . So after a few duds that they showed I was pretty disappointed , but then I noticed Sleepwalkers was written by Stephen King . So I decided to go ahead and check it out , well much to my surprise , this movie was really bad . Most Stephen King films are entertaining and some are very scary . While Sleepwalkers was bad , it was a beautiful kind of bad . I had a good time laughing at this movie and just taking it for what it was . I 've never read Sleepwalkers , from what I understand this is the only real vampire story by King , so I ca n't really compare book to film . I do n't know if it was just my TV , but Sleepwalkers looked like it was made for TV . The special effects were corny and the story was a bit far fetched , even if it is fantasy , it had a lot of problems . < br /><br />Charles Brady and his mother Mary are vampires who feed off the life force of virgin women . They are considerably more resilient than humans and have powers of both telekinesis and illusion . Their one weakness is cats , who are not only able to see through their illusions but whose claws are capable of inflicting severe to fatal wounds upon them . They also maintain an incestuous relationship . Charles and Mary have taken up residence in a small Indiana town . Charles attends the local high school , and there he meets Tanya Robertson in his creative writing class . Tanya does not suspect the real reason why Charles wants her so much ; to take her life force for his mother , who is starving . At first , it seems that Charles has fallen in love with Tanya . On their first date , however , a picnic at the nearby cemetery , Charles attempts to drain the life force from Tanya while kissing her . As it happens , Deputy Sheriff Andy Simpson who had earlier tried to pull Charles over for speeding , drives by the cemetery and notices Charles ' car . When Tanya runs to him for help , Charles tracks Andy down and kills him . When Charles then turns to resume his life force - depleting make out session with Tanya , the deputy 's cat , Clovis , rises to the occasion and nearly kills Charles by scratching him in the face and chest . Mortally wounded by Clovis , Charles staggers back home to Mary . Mary then seeks vengeance on Tanya 's family.<br /><br />So to sum this movie up basically you should expect the cheese to overflow . The scene where Charles attacks Tanya for the first time is very cliché and you almost vote for Charles to win just because Tanya is one of the dumbest female leads in horror movies . Then you got ta love the scene where Mary has a gun and shoots it at a cop car and somehow the whole thing explodes , God bless Hollywood explosions and exaggerations . I 'm taking the movie for what it is , it 's just so deliciously bad that it turns into a dark comedy for me that I could just enjoy making fun of . I 'm not sure if this is what Stephen King wanted to see for his story , but he does have his typical cameo in the film . So my suggestion if you watch this movie , just take it for what it is and do n't over think it , it 's mindless entertainment with corny effects , bad casting , a silly story and enough cats to make the crazy cat lady from The Simpson 's say " Wow , that 's a lot of cats".<br /><br />4/10
0 .... And after seeing this pile of crap you wo n't be surprised that it was n't published < br /><br / > ! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! < br /><br />This is a terrible movie by any standards but when I point out that it 's one of the worst movies that has the name Stephen King in the credits you can start to imagine how bad it is . The movie starts of with two characters staring open mouthed at a scene of horror : < br /><br / > " My god . What happened here ? " < br /><br / > " I do n't know but they sure hate cats " * < br /><br />The camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are strung up dead and mutilated . Boy this guy is right , someone does hate cats and with a deduction like that he should be a policeman . Oh wait a minute , he is a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop making an oh so obvious observation you just know you 're going to be watching a bad movie < br /><br />The reason SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that it 's very illogical and confused . We eventually find out the monsters of the title need the blood of virgins to survive . Would they not be better looking for a virgin in the mid west bible belt rather than an American coastal town ? Having said that at least we know of the monsters motives - That 's the only thing we learn . We never learn how they 're able to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from THE TERMINATOR . Monster mother walks around killing several cops with her bare hands or blowing them up via a police issue hand gun ( ! ) but if her monster breed is immune from police fire power then why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible ? The demise of the creatures is equally ill thought out as there killed by a mass attack of household cats . If they can be killed by cats then why did the monsters not kill all the cats that were lying around the garden ? There was a whole horde of moggies sitting around but the monsters never thought about killing them . I guess that 's so the production team can come up with an ending . It was that they started the movie my complaint lies < br /><br />We're treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like John Landis , Clive Barker and even Stephen King make cameos . I think the reason for this is because whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script they instantly decided that no matter what , they were n't going to appear in a movie this bad so Stephen King had to phone up his horror buddies in order to fill out the cast . That 's how bad SLEEPWALKERS is < br /><br / > * Unbelievable as it seems that was n't the worst line in the movie . The worst line is - " That cat saved my life "
0 OK , I taped this off TV and missed the very start . The film was about 10 or so seconds into the titles ( I assume ) so if anything happened before that I missed it.<br /><br />Lots of people say Mark Hammill is in this , I did n't see him . I did recognise Clive Barker , John Landis and obviously Stephen King doing some really awful acting as the graveyard attendant.<br /><br />Alice Krige looks lovely apart from the scenes where she has the cat face or is in full alien make - up.<br /><br />Even with the opening titles it 's never really explained very well exactly what Sleepwalkers are or where they come from . From the title sequence I assume they are catlike bipeds who live by extracting life - force from humans . I assume they live a long time and these particular 2 are possibly the last of their kind.<br /><br />Add to this a very large dose of incest ( Yes ! I thought it was a bit suspect too ) , shapeshifting , killer cats and invisibility and you have Sleepwalkers.<br /><br />It 's a very bad story that has no real explanations behind the main 2 characters and far too many cameo 's to try and distract from the simple fact that not enough is explained to the viewer.<br /><br />Avoid .
0 There are no spoilers here ... Because there is no plot to spoil . Madchen Amick is living proof a face can make a living acting-- no talent required . The only bright spot are a few really good one - liners delivered very nicely by Alice Krige , but then again , she IS Alice Krige . Her soft dreamy voice gives the only hint at just how seductively dangerous these odd creatures can be . She is believably creepy in this otherwise unbelievable plot . How they got her to agree to this project remains a mystery . The screenplay writers must have been medicated when they submitted this script . It has major continuity problems , superficial stereotypical characters , horror formula writing , and simply falls short of making any sense what - so - ever . The creatures , while they have neat skills like going " dim " , the question of where they come from and what they are is never so much explored . < br /><br />Don't waste any time on this one .
0 A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town , cats and death soon follow them . That about sums it up.<br /><br />I'll admit that I am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie . But in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film , and believe me there is plenty of that to go around , it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />The characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on . Fear , greed , pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people . Although it can be argued that that seeming failing , in actuality , serves the telling of the story . The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King ) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work , makeup and quite suitable music . The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady , the otherworldly mother.<br /><br />King manages to take a simple story of outsider , or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case ) , trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan .
0 Written by Stephen King , but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film . A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret . They are Sleepwalkers , feline type creatures that feed on young virgins . This little story has its share of gore and special effects ; plus hints of incest.<br /><br />Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother . Others appearing are Madchen Amick , Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett . Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker . Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery .
0 this movie was so gay like its a mom and son cat that have sex , they also get scared of little kitty cats . they get set on fire by them . the mom cat alien thing kills a guy by stabbing him in the back with an ear of corn ? they are bullet proof . invisible . and what not . the star of the movie , Clovis , is the cops cat , Clovis leads the cops to find the mom alien , and after the mom kills the cops , Clovis kills the mom by eating her head then she catches on fire . this movie sucks . it was way way more funny than it was scary , it was n't even scaryt at all . the girl hits the alien on the head with a camera , it knoks him out . she then goes and hugs her . the then grabs her and begins to rape her . once again , Clovis comes to the rescue
0 It Could Have Been A Marvelous Story Based On The Ancient Races Of Cat People , but it wasn't.<br /><br />This work could have been just that ; marvelous and replete with mythological references which kept my fascination fueled . The lead characters ( Charles Brady played by Brian Krause ; and his mother Mary , played by Alice Krige ) were shallowly done , had no depth of personality and were hardly likable or drawing . Not even Mädchen Amick ( who played Tanya Robertson ) 's character fit into that description . < br /><br />However , as I 've said many times before , when you adapt a Stephen King novel for TV , you simply must take into account the fact that his books are n't written for TV , and his screenplay talent sadly lacks the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist . < br /><br />This is another botched attempt to take the magick of Stephen King writing , whether that is of his novels or an original screenplay . To simply cut and paste his work onto the small screen . His novels get completely bastardized in the process and all you end up creating is a nice movie ; nothing less but certainly nothing more . His screenplays are hit and miss . Unfortunately , this screenplay translation was a miss . < br /><br />Sorry , Sorry , Sorry movie.<br /><br />This movie gets a 1.0/10 from ... <br /><br />the Fiend : .
0 I have nothing against a fast - paced fright - flick , but this Stephen King - derived nonsense is too freshly - scrubbed , too bright and modern . The plot , about a new teenage boy in a small town who is a " Sleepwalker "-- sort of a cross between a vampire and a werewolf -- and who feeds on the blood of female virgins , begs for a more mysterious , ambiguous treatment . This thriller is given an inappropriately colorful look and feel , with hardly any atmosphere . The kids are predictably pretty and energetic , but the big plus is Alice Kridge as the boy 's mother ; Kridge , from " Ghost Story " , never broke out of the filler - female mold , and it 's a huge loss that she has n't been used more . Her performance is creepy and intense , and gives hint that " Sleepwalkers " might 've been a much better film with a different focus and tighter direction . It 's too over - the - top and commercially - driven , with an uneven tone that swings wildly from thriller to comedy to drama . Stephen King pops up in a cameo , as do real - life directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 If you 're the kind of movie - goer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense ... then look elsewhere , kids , cause Sleepwalkers really sucks . Usually I 'm more eloquent than that , but ... wow ... this was bad . I especially love it when Charles offers Tanya a ride home , she declines , and then he is seen WALKING HOME . Where 's his car ? ? Anyway , just do n't see it , folks . I really want to be more specific , but words escape me . Cats jumping on people . A guy getting stabbed by corn . Cheesey lines up the proverbial " wazoo " . Just do n't see it . Wait , I take that back ! See it for writer Stephen King 's cameo as the guy who owns the graveyard . He 's actually pretty good . Even with guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman , King gives the best performance of the film . But , other than that ... wow ... BAD .
0 This film has its share of negative comments and I have to agree with those who consider it one of the worst movies ever made . True , most of the films based on the works of King are pretty bad , but this one goes beyond bad into the realm of horrible . There is not one scary moment in it unless you consider stupidity scary . It is typical King garbage -- myths twisted around that made no sense in the first place , mixed with obvious and belabored so - called " scares " that are about as shocking as PeeWee 's Playhouse ( which , at least , is entertaining ) . It is full of ridiculous moments , not the least of which is Alice Krige 's character . When she goes on a rampage and starts quipping like the villain in an old Batman TV show , it is so absurd as to be sickening . All the people who had cameos in this ( including John Landis)are lucky they still have careers . But the most absurd part has to be the cat costumes towards the end , which look like cheap rubber outfits someone bought at K - mart . The best part of the movie is the appearance of some real cats who actually out - act the people in the movie .
0 Based on the average short story by horror writer Stephen King about so called ' Sleepwalkers ' ancient and immortal cat - like creatures that suck the life out of virgins in order that this energy may sustain them They have supernatural abilities- they can make themselves ' dim ' which means they become invisible and can create subliminal mirages to fool people . They have been fleeing humans for century 's we are told and have one by one been picked off till there are only two left . The film starts when a beautiful mother and her son arrive in a sleepy town , they are the last of the sleepwalkers and they are on the prowl for virgins to feed on . The mother sends her son out to enrol at the local high school so he can find a virgin , he does ( Madchen Amick ) and proceeds to try to get her alone so he can suck her dry . It is not made clear why the mother can not seek out virgins herself- it would make things easier one would imagine as teenage boys are much more apt to follow a older beautiful woman to a secluded area than a teen girl follow a teen boy . However his plans are thwarted as the girl fights back , jabbing a pencil in to his ear . The police are called and the hunt is on!. The son is sick from his injuries and so the mother goes on the rampage killing cops left and right in her hunt for the girl who hurt her son and spouting some painfully unfunny one liners amidst the gore . Finally the girl kills the mother- end of movie . This movie is rubbish!. The acting is variable , from the average Brian Krause to the excellent Alice Krige . The special effects are average , and showcase some early computer effects which is mildly interesting as it shows how far such things have progressed in such a short time . The direction is muddled and the film falls in to camp in places . The director seems unsure whether we are supposed to fear the sleepwalkers or sympathise with them and when in doubt allows the film to become hysterical . Stephen King makes a mildly amusing cameo as an annoying gardener as does Mark Hamill , as a puzzled cop . Alice Krige seems to shoulder the film , her character is given depth and she gives an indication of what the film could have been with a better screenplay and better direction .
0 Ok , I first saw this movie like at 9:00 on Cinemax a few weeks ago and thought it would be award winning , boy was I 180d on that . This movie bit the big one . I mean , the mother of the monsters shows her true form only at the end of the movie . I 'm going " That 's it ? Why does n't she show it briefly a little bit more earlier in the movie . " The plot being the mother and son feast on the blood of young women . Would n't it be better if they just went on , you know , a killing spree killing like a couple of young women each , then having the sheriff or a cop find out about and get into the old find a way to kill the monsters , save the young woman / women , and have 1 or 2 more people killed in the process ? I think it would be a hell of a lot better that way . It also sucks because the son is the main character and he gets killed first . Why not get rid of the mother first ? Plus , how does she have that strength at the end of the movie when she starts killing people ? She said it herself she was too weak . What the heck was wrong with Stephen this time ? I can never , ever dis the acting on any movie by any actor , after all , they try their best . If it were n't for good acting , I 'd have given this movie a 1/10 . 3/10 .
0 Oh dear me ! Rarely has a " horror " film bored me , or made me laugh , as much as this one . After a spirited start with an intriguing premise , it descends into not much more than a slasher flick , with some supernatural and sexual asides . The usually excellent Alice Krige is wasted in this one , and the plot twists are ludicrous . Do n't bother unless you 're really desperate . Rating : 3/10 .
0 " Sleepwalkers " is the first film which Stephen King has written a script for . Given this , and the excellent Santo & Johnny song that they used as the theme of the movie , you would be expecting a odd , and ultimately fulfilling viewing experience . Unfortunately , that 's not what you 'd be getting . The thing is , they could have probably made it a good movie . The beginning is intriguing what with it 's small town spooky atmosphere . But something strange happens about 20 minutes into the film . The film turns funny for no apparent reason ! From that moment on the whole atmosphere of " Sleepwalkers " is ruined . For those of you who have seen it , who can ever forget good old Johnny screaming out " COP KABOB ! ! " after jabbing the pencil into that one cop 's ear ? ! ? But do n't get me wrong , the humor has no redeemiing quality . I just rented it again to see if mabye I was wrong the first time around , given how original the plot sounded , but I was right . Man , what a waste . I ca n't believe they got the rights to that Santo & Johnny song . I gave this a 2 .
0 This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen without a doubt . The only thing interesting in this film is the cameo appearances from some great genre directors and King himself . The film has a great premise , but falls apart about 15 minutes into the story . I did like Madchen Amick in this film and think she could have a very good career in film .
0 My wife and I both agree that this is one of the worst movies ever made . Certainly in the top ten of those I 've watched all the way through . At least " Plan 9 " was enjoyable.<br /><br />I DID really enjoy " Christine " , " The Dead Zone " , " Firestarter " , " Carrie " , and some of his other films . I did n't care much for " Cujo " ( only because the sound was so bad on versions I 've seen and I often could n't tell what people were saying ) , or " Pet Sematary ( Pet Cemetery)".<br /><br />But this mess was a total mistake in every way possible . The " creatures " themselves seemed designed by a 9-year - old . ( No offense to 9-year - olds.)<br /><br />Even the " one - liners " made us groan and were n't remotely amusing .
0 1st watched 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10(Dir - Mick Garris ) : Campy vampire - like Stephen King movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3/4 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for King fans . It 's the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers(a shape - shifting feline - like , flesh eating , life needing , near extinct breed of humanoid ) who move from town to town searching for virgins to feed on to keep themselves alive . They come across as pretty normal upper - class folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home , day and night . Cats are deadly to them , so they set traps in their yard to try and keep the population down . We get to see them break a couple of their necks when they attack(which is also a first in my movie - going experience ) --- hopefully no real cats were harmed in the making of the film . The boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush on until he turns into a " sleepwalker " and then he just wants her body . There is so much campy uniqueness to this movie that it might have been better if it was an all - out satirical comedy on suburban life , but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minutes until you wish he 'd just get over it and bring out the gore . Eventually that happens and the movie winds down to it 's typical Stephen King downbeat ending . The movie is interesting because King 's humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection , but as a worthwhile movie experience it really does n't cut it .
0 This is another one of those movies that could have been great . The basic premise is good - immortal cat people who kill to live , etc . - sort of a variation on the vampire concept.<br /><br />The thing that makes it all fall apart is the total recklessness of the main characters . Even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive - look how long it took to catch the Unibomber , and that was because a family member figured it out.<br /><br />By contrast , the kid ( and to a lesser extent , the mom ) behave as though they 're untouchable . The kid kills without a thought for not leaving evidence or a trail or a living witness . How these people managed to stay alive and undiscovered for a month is unbelievable , let alone decades or centuries.<br /><br />It 's really a shame - this could have been so much more if it had been written plausibly , i.e. , giving the main characters the level of common sense they would have needed to get by for so long.<br /><br />Other than that , not a bad showing . I loved the bit at the end where every cat in town converges on the house - every time I put out food on the porch and see our cats suddenly rush in from wherever they were before , I think of that scene .
0 one may ask why ? the characters snarl , yell , and chew the scenery without any perceptible reason except someone wanted to make a movie in barcelona . billie baldwin , is that the right one ? , is forgettable in the cop / estranged - husband / loving - father - of - cute - little - blond - girl role . the story seems to have been cut and pasted from the scenes thrown away from adventure films in the last three years . ellen pompeo 's lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to suck the energy out of every scene she is in . her true acting range is displayed when she takes her blouse off as the movies careens from one limp chase scene to another . unfortunately , the directing rarely goes bad enough to be camp or a parody . it is all just cliché , familiar in every respect . the director cast his own daughter as the precocious brat probably because no respectable agent would have permitted a client to ruin a career by being in such a lame , contrived and uninteresting movie . the only heist here is the theft of the investor 's money and the viewer 's time .
0 Baldwin has really stooped low to make such movies . The script , the music , just about everything in this movie is a waste of time.<br /><br />The sound FX do not sound real , they stick out way too much ( technical gadgets etc . ) If they are trying to make a movie about things like this , at least try to get real with it and drop those extra bleeps and beeps , because those gadgets do n't really make loud sounds like that . Natural sounds like footsteps and such are non - existent , which gives it a void - like atmosphere.<br /><br />Directing seems to be OK for such a low budget film ( I sure hope it was a low budget production ) , although it does seem fairly amateurish at times.<br /><br />Most characters seem empty and false , they simply have n't casted this movie very well . I 'd imagine it would 've been a better idea to make Baldwin speak some Spanish than to make Spanish actors speak English , when we all know that theirs is the language which is more vibrant and alive , that is why the actors performance can suffer greatly if an odd language is used . I mean , could finally someone realise how stupid it sounds to make international actors speak English with a bad accent ? It 's should 've a long ago buried corpse in movie production . The production team ever heard of subtitles ? This movie again manages to depict European police as lazy and corrupt , the societies as vulnerable and helpless . I mean if the plot again goes like " The Interpol ca n't do jack , so let 's call one American to bring down this international syndicate " or whatever.<br /><br />Sony Pictures treads on the same path as Columbia before it , just producing movies for the hell of it . I 'd imagine them to have some self respect also . Are buyers supposed to buy every dirty title just because Sony puts out something good a few times a year ? ! Maybe they should 've used the same team as who were making Di Que Si - Say I Do . It 's spoken in Spanish and Paz Vega and Santi Millan do a decent job keeping the movie afloat . Looks and sounds much better ! Come on Sony , wake up , produce less , sell more .
0 OK - the helicopter shots are fantastic , and the director made good use of some of Barcelona 's top sights . Otherwise ... production value was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week . Ellen Pompeo was charming and fun to watch , Abel Folk had the most depth and was very effective , and William Baldwin was ... well , William Baldwin . He got to put his martial art training to good use and be a running - jumping - earnest action figure . The rest of the cast was wooden at best , but mostly paper . So - if you 're nostalgic about Spain - it 's a picture postcard with an action twist , and a healthy dose of El Greco . If not , skip it .
0 Although in many ways I agree with the other reviewers comments . I find that the plot and idea are very good . Many of the supporting actors were very good . The fatal problem with this film is Ellen Pompeo . I am sure , I have never seen a less talented " actor " How this person has ever been in a film or on television , I can not imagine . In my opinion she would be better as a greater at a Wal - Mart . To see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles , does beg the question ...... " Who does she know " ? I would very much like to see this film re - made with some talent . I do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it .
0 This is one of the worst movies ever made . Trite . Predictable . Flat.<br /><br />The only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting Barcelona . I imagine they would use films like this in Guantanamo or some other hidden CIA / NSA prison to torture suspects.<br /><br />Often bad movies have some redeeming features , this has nothing . If I was in it or worked on it , I would change my name . Truly a turd . Hard to write more than this , but I feel the world 's film watchers needed a head 's up on this . On the other hand it will make a great gift for people you ca n't stand.<br /><br />You could send it to politicians you dislike , in laws , ex - wives , Teachers you hated , former employees , Dick Cheney , W. , and a host of others .
0 This film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past . Let the future viewer be forewarned that " Art Heist " does n't add anything to the genre . Director Bryan Goeres has no clue what to do with the film.<br /><br />William Baldwin keeps reappearing in films , and frankly , one wonders if he has a great agent , or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks , complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies . The only good movie in which he has appeared , is " The Squid and the Whale " , in which he only speaks two , or three lines . Ellen Pompeo , his leading lady , does n't fare much better ; there is no chemistry between Ms. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin.<br /><br />A movie to be seen at the viewer 's own risk .
0 First , I realize that a " 1 " rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst . This movie gets that from me because , as one reviewer points out , it 's not bad in a self - aware , over - the - top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value . It simply misses its mark on every count . * * Contains possible spoilers * * The dialog is completely disingenuous . The continuity is so deliberate it 's painful . Daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love , and with his final word the flamenco dancers start . The mock - shock of what 's her name ( see ? I do n't even remember her character 's name , let alone the name of the forgettable actress ) when her husband ( the Baldwin ) first tells her that her friend is the bad guy . The car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things . Vegetable carts gone flying . Cars crashing into each other . Motorcycles going down the stairs . People nearly being hit , but remarkably , no one is . Oh , that 's right ... except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times , is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds , and an approaching car apparently did n't notice him there . Hmmm . < br /><br />It 's becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made . There is so much pressure in the film industry to make money , you 'd think that someone in Hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing . Now there 's a novel idea . < br /><br />My suggestion : do n't see this film . Do n't rent the DVD . Do n't watch it on cable . There are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied .
0 This movie makes several mistakes . a few American actors in Spain , and the Spanish actors speaking English . the ' spaniards ' English is OK , but the way the acting is performed it makes it all quite annoying . the dialog through the whole script is very weak ; it may have been a Spanish script but translated incorrectly , who knows and who cares . i can only assume that these are famous Spanish actors forced into the English language , they may be good , but not in this flop . you will figure out the movie within the first 5 minutes , that s how pathetic it is . then the rest is just bad . lots of waste of time , lots of UN - necessary plots . Oh did i mention one of the Baldwins ' is in this .
0 This effort was like a glitzy TV movie ... I do n't recall this ever being released in theaters ... If so , it must 've died a quick death . Watching the DVD , in the comfort of our bedroom , it was obvious this film was meant for not much more ... Ed Lauter an art critic with a greed streak ? What a fun turn that must 've been ... I have n't seen Ed since " The Longest Yard" ... Everyone else pretty much acted by the numbers , led by Baldwin , except for Pompeo ... She had zero charisma and seemed to be sleepwalking thru most of the picture ... Pompeo 's daughter had one dimension ... she played every scene like a lovable little puppy ... slowest line delivery of any 3 year old I 've seen yet ... <br /><br />The chase scenes gave my wife and I headaches ... too much quick - cutting and angle - bashing ... If you 're going to shoot a chase scene in Barcelona , you might want a few WIDE shots to exploit the beauty of your backdrop , right ? The whole story was pretty implausible and far - fetched , but hey , we liked it better than " The Life Aquatic ... "
0 If you have n't seen this yet , I say just move on , take a walk in the park , do n't waste your time . Neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money . * Spoilers*- I ca n't decide which was worse : The movie itself or Baldwin 's hairstyle ? Ellen Pompeo 's acting talent is very questionable I hope she can improve it over time . The storyline is just unbelievable . Loose cannon American cop fighting criminals in Europe on his own ? ? Infamous Slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks ? ? ? An emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang ? ? ? Spanish police executive dumber than a sack of hammers ? ? ? Give me a break . There 's only one good thing about this movie , though : At least , the production costs must be lower than " Ocean 's 12 " 's which was as meaningless and over the top as this one .
0 Do n't get me wrong , Dan Jansen was a great speed skater . If there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the Olympics it was Dan.<br /><br />But how can it be possible that Bill Corcoran has made such a bad movie about the incredible Dan Jansen story , because the real Dan Jansen story is truly incredible ! Especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a sportsman everything is wrong , the way Matt Keeslar and the other actors skate , their technique , the dimensions of the speedskating oval , it is all wrong!<br /><br />Shame on you , Bill Corcoran , Dan Jansen deserves better , a lot better!<br /><br />1 out of 10
0 On the back burner for years ( so it was reported ) this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly - and went straight downhill from there . Mary Richards ( Mary Tyler Moore ) and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern ( Valerie Harper ) meet in New York after a long estrangement and catch up on each other 's lives . What a novel concept ! But , sad to relate , nothing worth talking about ( let alone making a movie about ) has happened to either of them in the intervening years . So , instead , the script contents itself with throwing out one hoary old plot device after another ( most having to do with older women in the workplace ) , while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner . The supporting cast is instantly forgettable , the humor is nonexistent , and the chemistry which Moore and Harper once had together is gone . Moore allegedly stalled this project for years , waiting for " just the right script " before committing herself . If this was the one she considered " right " , what on earth were the ones she turned down like ? It 's not the age of the characters that does this in ( for time inevitably marches on ) , but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work . At one time this was intended as a pilot but , all to obviously , it failed to generate any interest among potential sponsors . Or for that matter , among potential audiences . Quickly and mercifully forgotten , the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic .
0 This film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth , but ultimately this effort is too vain and too strongly focussed on the leads . There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all her screen time but she takes too much of the limelight away from the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Another problem is the overburdening of the script with cliches . The daughter who secretly drops out of college , an older woman finding it difficult to get a good job ( and first ends up with fairly demeaning work ) , the sleazy network executive with his executive toys who goes for glitz over substance , the journalist who sticks up for her beliefs , etc . There is nothing really wrong with any of these , i.e. they are all firmly rooted in reality , but in combination they are just too much and leave us with too much deja - vu and too few surprises .
0 Why did the histories of Mary and Rhoda have to be so dour ? Divorced women with indifferent daughters . And why very little reference to the original show and characters ? The daughter characters were silly and uninteresting . Why ca n't there ever be daughters who like their mother 's on TV ? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis , and Rhoda would return to NYC , but why could n't Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars ? It just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters . It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together of course , but it could have been better , much better . Well , there has been a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion , a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion , hopefully Mary will do better next time if she revisits her old Mary Richards stomping grounds again .
0 Dietrich Bonhoeffer 's writings have had a profound influence on my life as a Christian , and I eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life . Words can hardly express my disappointment . This movie was disjointed ... it gave no background about his life , no historical context , and nothing about his great writings ( except a brief , passing reference to " The Cost of Discipleship " by a colleague at the beginning of the movie . ) Instead , we see him enjoying jazz ( apparently in the States ) and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to Germany . Apparently to show his human side . OK , I 'm ready for the dramatic part . The part where he stands up for his faith . Instead of emphasizing that , we get a very badly acted romance with a 17-year - old schoolgirl . Whether or not that actually took place , it should not have been a major portion of the movie . Now ... still waiting for the dramatic part , or some narration explaining what his writings were all about ... or SOMETHING to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man . drum - roll ..... waiting ..... .... waiting ..... ZIP . Nada . This is the kind of movie that gives " Christian Films " a bad name . All they had to do was set up a structure for the movie to follow , with some background ... even some voice - overs , or flashbacks to him preaching from his works ... some narrative about who he was and where he had been . But no ... this is what we got . Hardly fitting for a hero of the Faith .
0 I never understood why some people dislike Bollywood films : they 've got charismatic actors , great dance numbers , and heightened emotion -- what 's not to like ? What I did n't realize was that I had only seen the upper - crust of Bollywood . Then I watched " Garam Masala " . I could tell from the first scene that this was not a movie I was going to like ( the film opens with a montage of the two leads driving around a city and apparently happening serendipitously on a series of photo setups populated with gyrating models ) , but I kept hoping things would improve . Sadly , they did n't . The main problem is that the two protagonists , Mac & Sam , are completely unsympathetic . They spend the entire movie lying to women -- and lying brutally- -in order to get them into bed , and the audience is supposed to find this funny , and be charmed . The boys are unscrupulous and inept , and not in a lovable way . Mac even goes so far as to have one of the women drugged in order to keep her from discovering his cheating . The script is extremely poor , with repetitive scenes , setups that never lead to anything , and illogical actions and statements by the characters . In fact , the characters are never really developed at all . The males are boorish , greedy jerks , and the women merely interchangeably beautiful . If you go by this movie , you would think that " air hostesses " are pretty easy to pass from man to man . In reality , betrayal is not so humorous . < br /><br />The only bright spots I found in the movie were one dance number that had brilliant sets , and a few slapsticky moments involving the French - farce , door - slamming aspects of the story . But Bollywood dancing is better enjoyed in movies choreographed by Farah Khan , and for slapstick you might as well just go straight to the silent comedies of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd , who seem to have influenced writer / director Priyadarshan not a little . Priyadarshan also takes false credit for inventing the story : the basic premise of the plot is stolen from the 1960 play " Boeing Boeing . " The original author of that work , Marc Camoletti , is credited nowhere . At least Priyadarshan changed the title for this remake , rather than brazenly using the original without giving credit , as he did in his 1985 version of this same tale . ( According to IMDb 's credits list . )
0 Watched on Hulu ( far too many commercials ! ) so it broke the pacing but even still , it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties . Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis . If I were Indian , I 'd protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews . They cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them I usually enjoy Indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment , especially for a modern Indian film . The story does n't take place in India ( the uncle keeps referring to when Mac will return to India ) but I ca n't find out where it is supposed to be happening .
0 Priyadarshan 's HERA PHERI was a nice situational comedy This film however actually lacks a story but is quite funny but illogical < br /><br />In fact they is no proper story yet it somehow manages a nice flow though it is n't anything great < br /><br />The first half has 2 funny scenes like the one where Akshay and John invite Neha for a lunch and another when Paresh enters < br /><br />The first half gets boring slowly but the second half is funnier though they is no script < br /><br />The jokes are funny though one does wonder how they never hear each person 's voices from inside the rooms?<br /><br />The climax confusion is treated like a stage play but it 's quite funny But the film ends abruptly < br /><br />Direction is okay Music is good < br /><br />Akshay Kumar excels in his part which is now become his second skin , but this is his film completely and he overshadows everyone else < br /><br />John stumbles throughout and fails in comedy Paresh Rawal is hilarious Rajpal is okay The girls are loud at times and awkward too Nargis , Daisy and Neetu(only Neetu is seen now ) are good in parts but shriek too often Manoj Joshi is okay
0 i have to say that this was the worst film of priyadarshan(releasing alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture ) , it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences . I think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and David dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their audiences . So it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction . Give us more of herapheri 's and malamal weekly 's rather than giving duds like garam masala !
0 Do not waste your time with this movie . This is a total thrash in terms of acting , directing , sound editing , soundtrack ... There was such a waste of performance by some of the very good actors . The movie does not do justice to Paresh Rawal who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in Bollywood . Akshay Kumar who is also an emerging star did quite a poor job . John Abraham , what is wrong with him ? Is that what you call acting ? I mean he should thank God that he has a pretty face otherwise he 'd be winning Razzie awards in India if there were any such awards in Bollywood . Asrani a great talent , but overdoes his bit as before.<br /><br />Screenplay which was not to mention a rip - off from the 1965 's Boeing Boeing was quite badly framed . First of all , people in Bollywood just ca n't make something original . On top of that they do n't even know how to copy well . The jokes in the movie were so overdone , it was getting painful to sit through them . Priyadarshan may be a star in the south , but he 's just not fit to make a decent Hindi movie . The sound editing is amazingly crappy . I can go on and on this matter , but the bottom - line is that Bollywood should be shameful of making such a film.<br /><br />The worst part is that some people seemed to love this movie . What is wrong with you guys ? This is the reason why Bollywood is where it is . Did you know that Bollywood makes more movies than Hollywood every year , however , most of the movies are unheard of abroad , because of movies like this one . I am an Indian and I am utterly shameful of Bollywood for producing this piece of thrash . Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were just terrific . They are world class films which are timeless ... among the best of this decade . Garam Masala , however , is perhaps one of the worst of this century . Period.<br /><br />I give it a 1 out of 10 .
0 It begins on a nice note only to falter quickly and let down expectations.<br /><br />Mac ( Akshay Kumar ) and Sam 's ( John Abraham ) characters are not properly built before Mac 's boss decides to hitch him with three air hostess . Rest of the drama is about how Mac , Sam and Uncle Mambo ( Paresh Rawal ) deal with situations which at times seem forced.<br /><br />About the cast , Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor , I thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook . Akshay Kumar is tolerable , John Abraham is very bad keeps stumbling over furniture & Rajpal Yadav is the only saving grace in the movie . < br /><br />The second half of the movie is funny at times , but in all a DUD ( songs are boring ) and a major let down if you are hoping for some wholesome entertainment and comedy .
0 Probably the worst Bollywood film I 've seen.<br /><br />No plot line . Very little character developments.<br /><br />Full of silly and pointless humor . The whole film was chaotic and direction - less . There was no proper ending to the story . The airport was filmed in a shopping mall . < br /><br />Same story chewed over and over again until you want to say " please , just move on with it ! ! " Even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographed.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around ... but then most of the Bollywood movies have that anyways these days.<br /><br />Btw I 'm not from an Indian background < br /><br />2/10
0 The first half hour of the movie had a steady pace and introduced the characters . however all of a sudden everything was happening too quick , a lame reason for Akshey Kumar to date 3 girls , very loud over acting by both Akshey and John Abraham . Neha Dupia was the highlight of the movie , Paresh Rawal did well but not as good as his performance in Hera Pheri . overall this movie was the biggest disappointment the film does no justice to its trailer . save your money and do n't watch this movie , watch Hera Pheri and Hungama again!<br /><br />summarising it : a cheap stage show performance and appearance to the film no story or substance , the plot was extraordinarily non - sense good music by Preetam the man who bought us Dhoom ! keep it up ! movie shot all in one room , new comers ( female cast ) were okay as it was their first film but established actors like Akshey and John totally disappointed an established director like Priyadarshan gives his worst movie ever !
0 I watched the Malayalam movie " Boeing Boeing " made in 1985 ( which in turn is probably inspired by an English movie of same name ) long back . The basic story of garam masala is the same - but it is told in a pathetic way , the classy jokes replaced by routine ones which are found in normal Hindi movies ( probably the director did this to suit the taste of Hindi audience ) ... < br /><br />I have n't seen the English original . But had really enjoyed the Malayalam film ( made by Priyadarshan himself)which was a side splitting comedy , back then . Of course the acting by Mohanlal , Mukesh and Sukumari ( who did the cook 's role ) was so natural and spontaneous.<br /><br />Probably , I am too smitten by the Malayalam film that I can not tolerate even the smaller flaws in its Hindi remake . But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have overacted . Paresh Rawal has done a decent job - but does n't reach anywhere near Sukumari.<br /><br />But all in all its OK , if one compares it to other recent Hindi comedy movies .
0 Contrary to its title , this film offers no spice and thus audience is subjected to a tasteless dish . All Humor appears forced , theatrical , mechanical , staged , reminiscent of those Pakistani plays available on video , including even the mannerisms . Everybody is screaming , shouting and doing odd things for no reason . The premise looks interesting as it is a straight lift from Hollywood 's ' Boeing Boeing " . John Abraham who is so natural in almost all his films is a complete misfit here . If we keep morality factor aside , even then the bizarre events looks trite . Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal , two experienced stalwarts try hard to lift the film by being natural but in vain . At least , the characters of three girls should be made contrasting in order to bring some interesting elements but sadly here too all of them appears those brainless , buxomed bimbettes ( 3Bs ) who talk , behave and even scream in quite similar fashion . The major hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at his same home pretending that they will never get to know about each other ? Just to do some Sex , what else ? The same could be done in hundreds of other ways . Therefore so much dramabaazi for no reason is not something audience will digest easily . But surely , great flesh show and tempting promos always gives such films a great initial . Now for those who call it a situational comedy , I call it a pathetic taste . Sense of humor of such cinema going audience is surely gone corrupted and demented to the extent that they are connecting to a sadistic , weird and maddening type of humor , where it is not the characters that they laugh at but rather at themselves and at their own frustrations that look how senseless we have become that in order to laugh we have to bear with such things ?
0 Well , maybe I 'm just having a bad run with Hindi movies lately . I asked the video store guy for Apharan ( Prakash Jha ) but being a new release , was n't available yet . So I had to settle for this one . It turned out to be the stupidest Hindi movie I 've seen ( and I 've seen quite a few ) . No wonder BOllywood is the laughing stock of the whole world ! If IMDb had negative ratings , I would give Garam Masala a -10.<br /><br />I remember seeing a TV show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in Mumbai . All the usual celebs and their sideys showed up . For some strange reason , people expect good stuff from Piyadarashan . I did not like Hulchul , Hungama , or his other films . Hulchul , probably dubbed from Tamil or Telugu , came across as very loud , in - your - face fare that again did n't make much sense except in a Bollywood flick . This latest piece of utter CXXP proved that this guy has NO BRAINS . Who made him a director , even a Bollywood director at that ? ? ? < br /><br />Anyhow , to the film now . What starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a non - sensical woman - hunt . Two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment ( is n't it similar to No Entry where the 2 dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office ? Jezuz Christ , now they 're copying their own stories ! ) Well anyways , there 's some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multi - lateral love ( aka multi - tasking + multi - timing ) . What happened in the end , I 've no idea . I switched off mid - way . What ridiculous junk . I ca n't believe they even released it . And how sadistic to wallow in their own filth ! For which audience did they make it - the poor illiterate Indian masses ( 700 Mil at last count ) or the well - heeled NRI desis staying in Phoren ? Either ways it does n't matter . Neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such god - awful stuff.<br /><br />Its a short review because there 's nothing to write about but the usual bag of F - grade garbage . Bollywood should change its name to Follywood . And yes , this review is much better than the movie itself .
0 The Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combo has been golden before with the likes of HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA so I went into the movie ( at an Indian multiplex ) with high hopes , especially after the slick promos . Unfortunately , like HULCHUL before it , this movie was a huge disappointment.<br /><br />Like others have commented , the premise of the movie , which was already stale to begin with , just gets stretched on and on without any development or additional layering . After a while , you just want the movie to end so you can go home ( if I had been watching this at home , it would have been much easier to cut my losses ) . Akshay Kumar 's performance is average at best and John Abraham should not try doing comedy again . The comedy aspects of the movie overall were pretty week . I only remember giggling like twice the entire movie . Definitely no sidesplitting belly laughs that consumed me in HERA PHERI or even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA . Paresh Rawal had a few of his expected classic moments , but overall , because his role and character was n't given much room to grow , he did n't make much of an impact in this film.<br /><br />Neha Dhupia , who makes only an appearance in the movie , was fun to look at while she was on screen . And some of the songs are fun . Especially the opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY , respectively . Otherwise , you 're better off just passing on this movie .
0 The movie was a huge disappointment . Especially since it was directed by Priyadarshan , it was sad to see such dismal standards . Poor screenplay(almost non existent ) and song sequences with bad songs every minute and at the most odd times killed whatever humor the movie could offer . some of the scenes were funny , but it amounted to probably only 5 mins of the whole duration . The editing was pathetic . Dismal ! overall the movie disappointed as the lack of story was only too evident . In fact only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the interval.<br /><br />One would n't miss anything at all if you do n't watch the movie . Not worth spending valuable ticket money on this movie . wait till it appears on TV ...
0 Watching That Lady In Ermine I was wondering what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for Marlene Dietrich to do . Someone over at 20th Century Fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another . Darryl F. Zanuck should have known better.<br /><br />Betty plays a 19th century Italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of Hungarian Hussars captained by Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. Her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree , sees no small resemblance in Doug now and another invader some 300 years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed.<br /><br />Besides that the current Betty has just been married to Cesar Romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment , before things have been consummated . That 's going to give anyone a bad attitude , I guarantee.<br /><br />Fresh , wholesome all American Betty is NOT the actress to do seductive and mysterious . Marlene Dietrich might have put this over , but with Betty it falls flatter than yesterday 's presidential candidate . She and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all , though Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can watch in anything.<br /><br />Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this film and This Is The Moment got an Oscar nomination for Best Song . That Lady In Ermine 's one chance for Oscar glory fell to Buttons And Bows.<br /><br />Ernest Lubitsch died midway during the film and Otto Preminger finished That Lady In Ermine . I ca n't believe Lubitsch had Grable in mind for the lead here . Neither will you if you see That Lady In Ermine .
0 This miserable film is a remake of a 1927 film . They should have let it remain that way.<br /><br />What a colossal bomb ! Douglas Fairbanks displays absolutely no charisma here . Cesar Romero is subjected to a role as a real jerk and Bette Grable sings with a chorus- What I 'll Do to that Hungarian!<br /><br />The ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome that saved the day by killing a conqueror . ( Fairbanks ) Now , let 's fast forward to 300 years later , where Grable , just married to the Count Romero , faces a similar situation , when on her wedding night , there is an invasion by Hungarian soldiers.<br /><br />Romero acts cowardly and flees before the army arrives . He disguises himself as a gypsy and is made to remain at the castle when his violin playing pleases Fairbanks . The ending is worse than the entire wretched film when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news - an enraged Romero has annulled the marriage.<br /><br />This poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948 . As Harry Davenport , a veteran supporting player who is in it , died in 1949 ; this must have been his last film . What a bomb to go out with after such a distinguished career.<br /><br />Walter Abel co - stars but he can do little with such poor writing . The costumes look more like those that would come out of the stone age . I ca n't fathom what Fairbanks was wearing .
0 The final film for Ernst Lubitsch , completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch 's untimely death during production , is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness , romance and music , fantasy and costume dramatics . In a 19th century castle in Southeastern Europe , a Countess falls for her sworn enemy , the leader of the Hungarian revolt ; she 's aided by her ancestor , whose painted image magically comes to life . Betty Grable , in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers , has never been more beautiful , and her songs are very pleasant . Unfortunately , this script ( by Samson Raphaelson , taken from an operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch ) is awash with different ideas that fail to mesh -- or entertain . The results are good - looking , but unabsorbing . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 Let me start out by saying that I used to really like Betty Grable , particularly from " Down Argentine Way " , but by the time she got around to this disaster , she had also got " round " and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment . Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr ( who must have been fairly desperate ) the story was bad , the colours good , and the film far too long . It had some of the old standbys in it like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success . The music score was woeful , and I have to say not one tune was memorable in any way .... as I was such a fan of Miss Grable , I always wish I had never seen this one !
0 I get the feeling that the producers of this mess were out to make the most painful , ridiculous Western ever made . " PAINFUL " is the best word I can think of to describe it.<br /><br />On the plus side you have nice color photography and beautiful and well - spoken Rhonda Fleming . My sympathy goes to Jacques Aubuchon ( who played the cripple ) , who acted well enough in an annoying role , written so atrociously that no actor could give an enjoyable performance . The production values were quite good , which only served to highlight the terrible story and screenplay.<br /><br />Things I hated : Stewart Granger looked so little like a western figure , what with his British accent , neat tailored outfit , and silly immaculate always - white kerchief tied around his neck . It got tiresome the way the townspeople and his son were constantly haranguing and insulting Granger , and he never spoke up or replied back . I know we are supposed to suspend disbelief and appreciate Westerns as symbolic morality plays , but this one broke the spell with it laughably unrealistic and predictable scenes , the worst being at the end where Granger miraculously , speedily and single - handedly plants dynamite around a canyon pass that the bad guy 's cattle will pass through , and then Granger plants himself in the perfect spot so he can shoot the dynamite from a very far distance to create rock slides to bury and spook the cattle and bad guys , seemingly destroying them all , save the two main bad guys . Next worst is everything about the plot , which is loaded with soap opera scenes . Nothing in the movie seemed believable : I could n't believe what all the conflict was about . The bad guy was driving his herd through to market and wanted the cows to chew some grass along the way ; I do n't see why something could n't have been worked out . You need a land ownership dispute for that ? Do n't bother to see it .
0 I 'm a big fan of the old westerns , and do not believe that Hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory . But not even Ronda Fleming and Stewart Granger can help this 1957 movie which carries nearly all the trite characteristics of westerns of the reformed gunfighter turned good guy . fallen but virtuous woman , bigoted townspeople who must turn to gunfighter for salvation , etc . I ca n't help but notice the last names of the writer and young " actor " who plays Granger 's son . Any nepotism there ? I 've seen better acting in high school plays . Chill Wills plays a cartoon characterization of Chill Wills . Have I reached the 1000 words yet ?
0 SAPS AT SEA < br /><br />Aspect ratio : 1.37:1<br /><br />Sound format : Mono < br /><br />(Black and white)<br /><br />Suffering from ' hornophobia ' , Ollie embarks on a ' restful ' boat trip , but he and Stan get mixed up with an escaped convict ( Rychard Cramer ) . Chaos ensues.<br /><br />This feature length comedy - an OK entry which nonetheless unspools like a mere imitation of Laurel and Hardy 's best work - marked the final collaboration between L&H and producer Hal Roach . Episodic in structure , the movie culminates in a memorable ocean voyage after The Boys are taken hostage by villainous Cramer ( who shoots a seagull to prove how tough he is ! ) . The gags are OK , but inspiration is lacking , perhaps due to the recruitment of actor - turned - director Gordon Douglas , previously responsible for Ollie 's first solo effort in the sound era ( ZENOBIA , produced in 1939 ) , but whose work here lacks a measure of pzazz . Fair , but nothing special . L&H regulars Charlie Hall and James Finlayson make guest appearances .
0 Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so I am happy to see any of their films . Basically a man at a horn factory is the fourth to crack , and soon enough Ollie cracks with all the horn noises . He is resting at home with Stan by his side , needing quiet , and the Doctor ( James Finlayson ) phones to say he is coming over to check on Ollie . After realising plumbing and electricity is muddled up by a cross - eyed repairman , the Doctor comes in for a check - up , and after some tests , he recommends drinking goat 's milk and getting some sea air on the ocean . After Stan practises some trumpet playing , hanging out the window by the phone cord and a car crash , he and Ollie to a dock to rent a boat . They keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat , and Stan has brought his trumpet ! Meanwhile , the newspaper 's front page reads that Killer Nick Grainger - Escaped Convict ( Richard Cramer ) has escaped , and he sneaks onto the boys ' boat while they are sleeping , and the goat chews through the boat rope , drifting out to sea . In the morning , the see their location , and the Killer comes out demanding something to eat , and he spots Stan and Ollie making fake food , e.g. string for spaghetti , soap for cheese , belt for bacon , sponge for meatballs , and he forces them to eat it . When Ollie starts choking on something , Stan blows his trumpet to help , and Ollie 's rage gets him punching the Killer , and it keeps going till the police arrive , only to have Ollie 's rage get them put in prison too . There were the tiniest moments of comedy , but it is n't a great black and white film . " Well , here 's another nice mess you 've gotten me into ! " was number 60 on 100 Years , 100 Quotes , and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians ' Comedian . Okay !
0 The Twilight Zone has achieved a certain mythology about it -- much like Star Trek . That 's because there are many devoted lovers of the show that no matter what think every episode was a winner . They are the ones who score each individual show a 10 and can not objectively evaluate the show . Because of this , a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes ( the good and the bad ) because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive . Now , it 's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />While I have scored many episodes 10 , this one gets a 3 simply because it was bad . The writing was in fact embarrassingly bad . Two people from opposing sides in a great war are seen wandering about through the entire episode . After a while , it 's apparent that they are the only two people left on Earth -- as you learn in the really stupid and totally unconvincing conclusion . Usually the twist at the end makes the episode great -- this one killed it !
0 Firstly I would like to point out that I only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it . I find it the most annoying program on TV . There is nothing funny about any of the ' jokes ' and the canned laughter is unbearable . The show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience . That way the laughter would show just how ' unfunny ' the show is . However I give credit to the acting talents of the young cast . It sickens me however to think that they 'll look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was . The show links in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the CBBC presenters . Why the youth of today need to be shouted at so much is beyond me . That is all .
0 ... and how they bore you right out of your mind ! The Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD films from the 70 's made with no actors of any note , an embarrassing script , woeful direction , and a tireless desire to fuse " horror " with light comedy . This movie introduces a paleontologist who finds drawings of an aquatic dinosaur underneath Crater Lake ... a meteor falls from the sky , and an aquatic dinosaur of the claymation variety begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants surrounding Crater Lake . The whole matter is taken care of by Steve our local sheriff . Much of the film - when not showing pools of blood left behind from what we imagine must have been the beast dining - is spent following the bumbling antic of two guys named Arnie and Mitch who run a boat rental place . They try so bad to be funny , that we get lines like , looking at a business sign , Mitch saying to Arnie " You spelled bait wrong , it 's spelled B - A - T - E. " The laughs were rather scarce here . We then see them get drunk together and imagine a tree trunk to be the dinosaur . Laurel and Hardy watch out ! The dinosaur looks fake , but the movie is fun in a bad way . And at the very least , the lake is beautiful .
0 * * * * Do n't read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of " The Crater Lake Monster " to be a total surprise****<br /><br />A claymation plesiosaur rises from the depths of Crater Lake to wreak havoc on a group of local rednecks , not to mention your fast forward button . To call " The Crater Lake Monster " amateurish is to overstate the obvious . If you are n't a fan of low budget drive - in films , you probably would n't be looking here in the first place.<br /><br />The problem with the movie is that when there 's no monster action going on , it really sucks and goes nowhere . The script is very Ed Wood - ish , in that it 's utterly contrived in the way it sets up the main action sequences . Nothing is too outlandish for " The Crater Lake Monster " . It explains its dinosaur by having a meteor crash into Crater Lake , ' superheating ' the water to the point where it incubates a dinosaur egg that has apparently been resting at the bottom of the lake for millennia . Even if we could accept that the egg could have been lying there for so long and remained uncovered and viable , would n't " superheating " the water to such a high temperature cause most of the lake to evaporate ? Other than some token fog in one or two scenes , we see no evidence of the water being hot , other than a few lines in the script.<br /><br />The script is padded rather obviously in a few sequences , and it will do anything to get the characters near the lake so that they can be menaced by the claymation dino . A couple just passing through experiences car trouble and while their automobile is being serviced , they decide to rent a boat and head out into Crater Lake . Hmmmm ... do you think these strangers in the story could be there so they would run into our title monstrosity ? In a sequence that 's just plain bizarre , a drunk robs a liquor store and decides to murder the cashier and a bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of booze . A car chase ensues , and would n't ya know it ... they end up right by the lake . Snack time for Cratey ! Yeah , it 's not hard to figure out , and you 're so far ahead of the script that you 're irritated when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold.<br /><br />The shamelessness of it all is endearing , and I really want to like " The Crater Lake Monster " . I just ca n't do it . There 's not enough here to go on , and this is more of a movie to put on during a party , because you could talk right over it and it would n't matter . < br /><br />The film has a slim list of the things going for it , the most important being the dinosaur itself , which appears in three forms : a shadow puppet , a large model head that is dragged woodenly through the water , and a fully realized claymation insert that actually looks pretty good . There are also a pair of lovable hicks in it , and they carry the majority of the intentional humor in the movie . A downbeat ending leaves us mourning the death of both the monster AND one of our beloved hicks , so every good thing about this film is dead by the end of it . Why was I so affected by this conclusion ? Was it the mournful song played over the closing credits ? Or was I just weeping inwardly for the time that I waste watching films like this ?
0 We have a lake . We have an animated meteor crashing . We have a killer stop - motion dinosaur with flippers . Okay , so let 's call this movie THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER . What else can we add ? Hmm , two idiots called Arnie & Mitch to define the ultimate definition of " comic relief " . We also got to have a sheriff who does n't really do a damn thing in this film and whom nobody listens to . Aw crap , we 're over halfway through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy ! No worries , let 's introduce some guy with a moustache , have him rob a store to indicate he 's a bad guy , then have him pop up somewhere near the lake , have him chased through the woods and all this for the sole purpose of him ending up as dinosaur snack food . That should work.<br /><br />A complete , clumsy mess , this film . Its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you . The first film to feature Dave Allen as a " stop motion supervisor " . After this one , he joined forces with Charles Band for several years until the the mid - nineties , when Band ran out of money to pay him , I guess . The dinosaur effects are charming and the whole film is pretty damn unintentionally funny . Unfortunately , that 's about the only good thing that can be said for it.<br /><br />Good Badness ? Yes . The mind - bending logic in the narrative should be enough reason to put it on the list . If not , Arnie & Mitch will do the trick . 3/10 and 8/10
0 Well , what are the odds ! At the exact right moment that a few redneck amateur - scientists discover cave paintings indicating that some type of dinosaur monster might have inhabited the area thousands of years ago , a burning meteor crashes into the lake and spontaneously hatches a monster 's egg that has been lying there   for over a thousand years , I suppose ! " The Crater Lake Monster " is a movie that literally must be seen to be believed , but you better do so in the company of many friends and a pile of ganja in order to make the wholesome a little bit easier to digest . Yes , this is a terrible film with the utmost ramshackle screenplay imaginable and numerous irrelevant padding interludes that are downright embarrassing , but it 's also irresistibly charming and so clumsily put together that you simply have to cherish some kind of fondness for it . Half of the film  at least  revolves on the wacky adventures of Arnie and Mitch . These two local yokels own and run a boat renting shop near the lake , but spend most of their days picking their noses and quarreling over fascinating stuff like to spell the word " bait " . It is mostly during their prototypic Laurel & Hardy situations that new puddles of blood or decapitated heads are discovered in the lake . Steve Hanson , the heroic but not exactly sharp Sheriff is on the case , but only if he 's not too busy chasing big city thugs traveling through the area . Halfway through the film , there suddenly is an abrupt scene about a thug robbing a liquor store and killing two people in the process . This textbook " WTF " moment appears to take on the complete other side of the country , like in New York City or something , and has absolutely nothing to do with the events going on at Crater Lake . Only like twenty minutes later the robber pops up again in Hicksville and there 's an " exhilarating " chase through the woods , ending in the Dino 's hungry muzzle . The absurd little details in " The Crater Lake Monster " are too numerous to mention ! For example , this is probably the only creature - feature in which the players discover the obligatory gigantic footprint AFTER they already spotted the actual monster . The goofs in continuity should be legendary as far as I 'm concerned . It 's like everybody forgot to pay attention to it . Night turns into twilight into day and back into twilight   all during one and the same diurnal course ! The monster is undeniably the best aspect about the film , especially since it 's accomplished through good old fashioned and adorable stop- motion effects . The cute critter is a Plesiosaur ; meaning an aquatic dinosaur looking like a crossbreed between Denver the Last Dinosaur and an alligator . " Crater Lake Monster " is a unique and unforgettable movie- experience that I can only encourage to track down ! The miserable 1 out of 10 rating is just out of principle ( and because basically , this IS a very bad film ) should be put into perspective , because I might as well could have given it 10 out of 10 for sheer entertainment value .
0 - The movie opens with a meteor crashing into a lake . Unbeknownst to the locals , a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake . The meteor heats the lake , turning it into a giant incubator . You guessed it , the egg hatches releasing a dinosaur that proceeds to terrorize the community.<br /><br />- What utter garbage . It 's not that I mind the stop - motion clay dinosaur , it 's everything else about the movie that bothers me . The acting is atrocious . The dialogue is utterly ridiculous . The comic relief is anything but comic . Logic is non - existent . Any similarity between the " scientists " in this movie and an actual scientist is purely coincidental . I could go on for an eternity on the bad aspects of this movie , but you get the idea . I feel it 's fairly safe to call this disaster " MST3 K Worthy " .
0 ... and it is this film . I imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife , damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity . < br /><br />Okay , maybe it 's not that bad , but it is probably the worst film I have ever seen next to " Manos , the Hands of Fate " ... and I have seen a lot of bad movies , believe you me . < br /><br />This is just a crummy B movie , bad film - making at it 's finest(or is it worst ? ) The thing I really did n't like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief . Now , a little comedy relief is a good thing , but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons , rather than on the " heroes " of this film , who are actually in it for less time than them ! < br /><br />To be fair , Crown International really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a poor job editing . But honestly , this was probably a bad film to begin with , so Crown really could n't have done that much to hurt it . < br /><br />This really needs to be in the bottom 100 list . I would n't wish this one on my worst enemy . < br /><br />Actually , it 's my kind of campy B movie . It was bad , but I still liked it , despite my one star rating .
0 Man , what a scam this turned out to be ! Not because it was n't any good ( as I was n't really expecting anything from it ) but because I was misled by the DVD sleeve which ignorantly paraded its " stars " as being Stuart Whitman , Stella Stevens and Tony Bill . Sure enough , their names did not appear in the film 's opening credits , much less themselves in the rest of it ! ! As it turned out , the only movie which connects those three actors together is the equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY ( 1975 )  but what that one has to do with THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER is anybody 's guess   < br /><br />Even so , since I paid $ 1.50 for its rental and I was in a monster - movie mood anyhow , I elected to watch the movie regardless and , yup , it stunk ! Apart from the fact that it had a no - name cast and an anonymous crew , an unmistakably amateurish air was visible from miles away and the most I could do with it is laugh at the JAWS - like pretensions and , intentionally so , at the resistible antics of two moronic layabouts - cum - boat owners who frequently squabble among themselves with the bemused local sheriff looking on . The creature itself  a plesiosaur i.e. half - dinosaur / half - fish  is imperfectly realized ( naturally ) but , as had been the case with THE GIANT CLAW ( 1957 ) which I 've also just seen , this did n't seem to bother the film - makers none as they flaunt it as much as they can , especially during the movie 's second half !
0 This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it 's EXTREMELY boring with lots of boring dialog and has some VERY annoying characters and a laughable looking creature . The only reason i watched this piece of garbage is because it was on that 8 disc horror set i got . The plot is preposterous and totally stupid as is the finale . No blood what so ever except a few bloody marks on the creature , and a couple of bloody gunshot wounds . The acting is TERRIBLE!!. Richard Cardella is terrible as the sheriff and was quite laughable plus his character is annoying . Glen Roberts is the comic relief and was not funny at all!. Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and was also NOT FUNNY!. Bob Hyman is decent but not much more then that . Richard Garrison is annoying and had no chemistry with Kacey Cobb what so ever . Kacey Cobb is so so here and had no chemistry with Richard . Overall Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs ! BOMB out of 5 .
0 A meteor hit 's Crater Lake ( hence our title ) , awakening a Plesiosaur , who proceed 's to snack on the hick population ( in California , that hick capital of the world . ) < br /><br />There 's bad movies , and then there 's " The Crater Lake Monster " , which somehow managed to escape MST3K. Featuring grating acting , a decent stop - motion beast , and more , this is a dreadful piece of 1970 's low budget exploitation / monster movie dreck.<br /><br />While the movie is guilty of many crimes , the biggest one is Arnie and Mitch , two obnoxious rednecks who serve as our comic relief . They bumble around , fight to stock " banjo music",ogle women , and act like pathetic excuses of humanity . The characters are so bad , they should count as a crime against humanity .
0 A handful of nonprofessional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature . This creature appears in about thirty seconds of marginal stop - motion animation , but oh how you will long for that margin when for the rest of the movie the animation is replaced by production assistants waving around an inner tube with teeth . No time for terror when this movie is hijacked halfway through by these comic relief boat rental doofuses , who suddenly become the lead characters ; but again you got ta admit watching them try to be funny is better than plodding around after the sheriff . Only at the end one of them gets eaten and the other one is left sitting on a rock crying tears of loneliness - that 's no fun !
0 The Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most awful , amateurish film I 've ever seen - ranking right up there with Manos , the Hands of Fate in terms of poor acting , useless direction , and kindergarten - level production values . In this movie a silly - looking claymation / stop - motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in Bumblebum , CA , and begins dining on the local hayseeds . In the thrilling climax , the creature , described by one local as " a giant alligator with flippers " , drags it 's ponderous bulk over the ground to chase its would - be lunch , before a bulldozer bumps it a couple of times & it dies from boredom . Every character in this moovie is a complete moron . One pointless subplot shows a hick go into a liquor store to purchase a $ 4.75 pint of Ripple ; instead of simply buying the bottle , the idiot shoots the cashier and another bystander , shoots at a cop , gets chased towards the lake , all so that he can eaten by the monster . Unfortunate close - ups of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of styrofoam . There 's a fake magician struggling with a phony British accent ( to make him seem more legit ) , two overly - bumbling redneck boat renters , some cheesy " pre - historic cave art " done in crayon , and annoying banjo - pickin ' background moosic . In one painful scene , the fake magician and his dopey wife / girlfriend / accomplice manage to pad the movie an extra 4 minutes by cowmenting on how may stars they can see in the night sky , even though it is clearly day time still . Even on constant fast - forward , this moovie hurts , and hurts bad . MooCow says call the fumigators , 'cause this cow pie really stinks ! : = 8P
0 I 've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde , and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version , in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang . Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow , and the capture of his wife Blanche . This actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband . However , this movie is still Hollywood , and our anti - heroes stay pretty to the end , even after being shot full of holes ( in life , Bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush , and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death ) . The script is tedious , and the acting is poor , particularly the leads . Very disappointing . Stick with Beatty and Dunaway . Their 's may not be " the true story , " but it 's a great film .
0 Here we have 2 misunderstood kids who never stood a chance against a cruel , poverty riddled existence : Robin Hoods singled out by the police for persecution because they were a trifle wild at times . Gad ! According to this crap Bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of the Missouri who was taught to be a psychopathic murderer by a fun loving boyfriend who did n't really want to hurt anybody .... he just wanted things without putting a lot of energy into getting them . Badly acted , poorly filmed , unbelievable dialogue , unrealistic use of weaponry , gore that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing . Avoid this bilgewater . Thumbs down . -5 stars .
0 Even though this was a made - for - TV production , there 's absolutely no excuse for the rock bottom results of the finished product . This movie DID have a budget and it had a casting department , so , if you 're going to make a movie about a true life story , and actually put " the true story " in the title , should n't some effort be put forward to try and capture some realism ? First of all , this movie is absurdly cast . These actors belong in daytime television soaps , or in those ridiculous Lifetime channel movies , and not in a real - life gangster / criminal tale . Everything about them , from their looks to their mannerisms , just screams of the 90's - shopping - mall - alt - rock - listening generation . What about the script ? Two words describes it - stupid and insulting , and again it 's way too 90ish sounding . I do n't think the real Clyde Barrow ever uttered the words " I 'm outta here . " It 's as if a bunch of " New Kids on the Block " fans got together and decided to make a really " kewl flick " about Bonnie and Clyde , you know , one that would be totally rad and rockin ' . Well , this sticker does n't even rank on the rad and rockin ' scale . Everything that can be wrong with any kind of film is wrong here , from the casting and acting to the editing and music . Every single thing is grossly wrong .... and it 's infuriating that the parties responsible for this atrocious turkey had the nerve to put " the true story " in the title . It 's certainly NOT the true story , but even worse , it 's not even remotely entertaining as a mindless popcorn flick that 's accepted on its own terms . Like I stated in my heading , it 's simply horrible beyond words , on every level imaginable . Trust me on this , or watch at your own risk .
0 While it contains facts that are not widely reported , it is not exactly the truth . They took a lot of liberties in rearranging events , excluding people , and using sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 30 's . There were more than just Bonnie , Clyde , and W.D. in the gang at various times , and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included . Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout , and in fact got drawn back into crime . Some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night . Bonnie 's wound was much more severe and never healed right . It was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it healed up , and even then it stiffened up so she walked stiffly . Clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe . I know , I 'm being nit picky , and it was a TV movie , but even without these factual errors in this " TRUE " story , the movie moves too fast from event to event and comes across more as several separate snapshots of their lives , rather than being a cohesive flowing story.<br /><br />I'd recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth .
0 Once again a film classic has been pointlessly remade with predictably disastrous results . The title is false as is everything about this film . The period is not persuasively rendered , and the leads seem way too young and too vapid to even be criminals . Arthur Penn 's film had style , humor , a point of view , and was made by talented people . Even if the 1967 version did n't exist this would still be an unnecessary film . The 1967 version strayed from the facts , presented a glamorized version of Bonnie and Clyde , but it was exciting , and innovative for 1967 , and it had some outstanding performances that allowed you to care . This 1992 remake seems culled from the original film rather than the truth as known and the actors in this version are callow , unappealing , and not the least bit interesting . By all means skip this one and hope the 2010 version will be better . Could it possibly be worse ?
0 If you have n't seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH , you have n't . A contest like ' make your own horror movie in one day ' could not possibly come up with a entry than this outrage of an insult on any viewer 's intelligence . Mr. Sheets forgot a story , a plot , proper dialog , the fact that people need some BASIC acting talents and the credited lighting designer obviously forgot to show up . It seems to be recorded on the crummiest of handycams , and copied on even worse equipment . Make - up effect consist of black mascara for the zombies and yoghurt being poured over people 's heads in order to simulate their skin melting . This is nothing more than a home - movie , and a really bad one as well . Only fun to watch for the friends , familymembers and neighbours that were willing to show up for the filming . I can not for the life of me understand why this mockery of a product is listed in ANY serious film magazine or website - I have home - movies of wedding parties that are way better and more interesting . A total waste of time , money and energy . The sequel ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just more of the same rubbish .
0 If Todd Sheets were to come out and admit that this movie was intended to spoof the zombie genre , I would change my rating to an eight . Try to imagine a movie where every scene , line , and even every acting nuance was designed to be a parody . I could probably crap out alphabet soup , rearrange what was left of the letters , and still have a better script . Two scenes in particular come to mind when I think of this movie . SPOILER ALERT ! One is when Mike 's dad and the other dad walk , I repeat walk down a staircase jam packed with zombies . This is a small staircase and even though they brush up against the flailing undead , nothing happens to them . When they reach the end , the ex - marine turns around , says " God you 're a horny bastard " , and shoots only one . The other is in the military complex . The girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded . The camera moves around her for roughly forty seconds , while she is surrounded by zombies at an arm 's length away . She then almost casually runs out from the crowd and joins the other humans . SPOILER ALERT OVER ! These scenes must be seen to be believed . Still , I enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it 's so damn funny . Kudos to Todd Sheets for getting so many people in his movie and having the drive to make it but not really for anything else .
0 Well , I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy thinking it would be mindless gory fun . That 's what it is , without the fun . This film truly is mindless , it is absent of any plot or character development , or any sort of storyline . The basic problem with this movie is the kills and gore . Basically , every kill looks EXACTLY the same . ZOmbies ripping someone apart . Yeah , that 's okay , but you need some original kills too . I mean it got really lame , every kill looked exactly the same , filmed exactly the same way . That s what killed me . I love gore , and the gore in this film did nothing for me . It was just boring . No storyline , just the same lame scene over and over again with a different person . I wanted to like this movie , too . I love shot on video gore movies ... like Redneck Zombies . But I could n't kid myself . This film has it 's good points , but none of those are in the film . I understand that many of the " zombies " helped out with the flood and there were like over 100 zombies , which is pretty cool how they got so many people involved and helped out in the world . But overall , this is a terrible film .
0 Every once in a while , a group of friends , with a minimal budget but bags of enthusiasm and talent , will create a low budget masterpiece that takes the world of horror by storm . Raimi and co. did it with The Evil Dead , Jackson and pals succeeded with Bad Taste ; and Myrick and Sanchez made a mint with The Blair Witch Project.<br /><br />Director Todd Sheets and his chums , however , are destined to wallow forever in relative obscurity if Zombie Bloodbath is anything to go by . A lesson in how not to make a cheapo horror , this miserable effort ( about a plague of flesh - eating zombiesnatch ) serves as a reminder that , whilst many people these days have access to a video camera , most should n't take that as their cue to try their hand at making a full - length movie.<br /><br />It 's not that Sheets has n't got an eye for a nicely framed shot ( some of his camera angles and movements are actually pretty good ) , but rather that a ) he has a lousy script b ) he has a lousy cast , and c ) he does n't realise that he has a lousy script and cast . Which means that the final film is amateurish in the extreme , and unlikely to be watched in its entirety by anyone other than zombie film completists ( like me ) or members of the cast and crew ( like those who have given the film favourable comments).<br /><br />Zombie Bloodbath is obviously aimed at undiscriminating gore - hounds , and Sheets ( who currently has an incredible 34 titles under his belt as a director ) certainly goes out of his way to please , with buckets of offal and blood thrown about at every opportunity . But whilst these moments are undeniably yucky , they are n't particularly convincing , and soon get rather tedious.<br /><br />So , to summarise , this is a really bad film , with almost no redeeming features . Except for two:<br /><br />Firstly , it features the single greatest mullet in the history of film , as sported by Jerry Angell , who plays Larry ( as well as several zombies ) . The magnificence of his barnet ( coupled with a fetching moustache ) is reason alone to watch this film.<br /><br />Secondly , it has ' pathetic stealth zombies ' : flesh - eating corpses that lie in wait for unfortunate victims to wander by , before leaping from their hiding place to launch a feeble attack , which requires almost no effort to escape from . Best known for lurking behind a door for hours waiting for someone to open it , ' pathetic stealth zombies ' also occasionally hide behind low walls , or sit in churches posing as members of the congregation.<br /><br />Normally a film this bad would get 1/10 for me , but , in celebration of Jerry Angell 's flowing locks , I will generously raise my rating to 2/10 .
0 I got myself a copy of this film thinking it was the 1964 film with ' Zombie Bloodbath ' as one of it 's alternative titles . Perversely , this film actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title ; which may mean that the other one is really bad ! This film is pretty bad too ; obviously you ca nt go into a film that calls itself ' Zombie Bloodbath ' and expect to see a masterpiece , and in fairness it does live up to the title with the amount of gore on display ... but it all feels very old and tired , which is n't helped by the atrocious acting and stupid plot line . It 's just your average nuclear spill causing people to turn into zombies etc etc . The film kicks off with a sequence that sees people melting and that pretty much lets you know what you 're in for ; low quality zombie garbage . There 's plenty of gore in the film , and it 's a real good job otherwise the film would have been really boring . Zombie Bloodbath looks really cheap too , and was clearly put together by inexperienced filmmakers ! The main influence seemed to be Romero 's superior Day of the Dead , although it could really be just about anything that features zombies and gore . It all boils down to a typically predictable and pointless ending and overall I ca n't say I was impressed with it !
0 OK , I really do n't have too much to say about this film , other than this : I have seen over 4,000 films in my life , and more than 2,300 of those were horror films . While I have some difficulty deciding which is the best ( as opposed to my favourite , which I can tell you is George A. Romero 's DAWN OF THE DEAD ) , I can tell you without the slightest hesitation that Todd Sheets ' ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is the absolute worst horror film I have ever seen.<br /><br />There is simply nothing positive I can say about this film . The acting , the dialogue , the directing , the make - up , the music ... Every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable that it boggles my mind that this was ever even released.<br /><br />Even if you are a horror or zombie movie completist , please heed my warning and DO NOT waste your time on this garbage . There is no pleasure to be gotten from viewing this . You wo n't even get any laughs out of the utter ineptitude on display ... Trust me . Please .
0 and a 30,000 $ budget and this movie still looks like it was made for 50$. You can tell from the first frame to the last that he did n't care one bit about the movies continuity or plot , he was just happy to be making a zombie movie . < br /><br />What the end result shows is a lazy film maker who loves zombie movies . It could have been great if he just had of given a care . The end result is endless zoom ins on poorly done gore , and even more poorly produced metal plays over it.<br /><br />What happens when you combine high hopes , big dreams , a decent budget , hard work , and one idiot behind the camera .
0 Wow , this was a very bad movie ... as read in other comments this movie has no plot , no character development , they possibly had some kind of script but it 's difficult to tell based on the actual end result.<br /><br />The editing of this movie was really non - existent , it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is actually happening.<br /><br />All in all this is simply a low budget zombie flick that was not thought out at all , has bad acting , bad dialogue , bad everything.<br /><br />The only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor , I think this must be where they spent whatever money they had to try to justify making this.<br /><br />Unless you are ( like me ) dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find , do not watch this . Period .
0 A terrible amateur movie director ( no , not Todd Sheets ) , his new friend and sister explore a cave . The friend and sister fall in and get rescued . Meanwhile a gang of horribly acted girls are defending their ' turf ' . Whatever the heck that means . This film and I use the term VERY loosely is so bad that it 's .. well bad . The humor is painfully unfunny , the " action " merely sad . Now I 've seen some atrociously awful ' horror ' films in my time & failed to grow jaded in my approach to watching low - budget films , yet I still weep openly for anyone who choose to sit through this . ONLY for the most hardened maschocists amongst you . but the rest run away FAST!!<br /><br />My Grade : F
0 You would n't expect a movie like this to be good , and it is n't . It 's a no budget , ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand - held camera ... and it 's hilarious . The actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings . There is no plot to be seen . The little plot I could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families . The gore effects are actually some of the most sickening I 've ever seen . It seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts , and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs . It 's a funny and sickening film , and it 's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie.<br /><br />My rating : BOMB/****. 90 mins .
0 A Vietnam vet decides to take over a backwater town run amok , and anyone who steps in his path is eliminated ( including women ) . Released to theaters just prior to " A Star Is Born " , which turned his career around , this action - drama mishmash starring Kris Kristofferson is wildly off - kilter , thoughtless and mean - spirited . Filmed in Simi Valley , CA , the results are truly unseemly , with redneck clichés and mindless violence making up most of director George Armitage 's script . Armitage has gathered a most curious ' 70s cast for his film , including Jan - Michael Vincent , Victoria Principal , Bernadette Peters , and , in a bit , Loni Anderson ; however , the center of the whole thing is Kristofferson , who is gruff and rude throughout . It deserves points I suppose for being a completely unsympathetic drive - in thriller , but the bad vibes ( and the ridiculous climax ) coat the whole project like an ugly stain . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 Let 's be honest here : the only reason anyone bought this , the only reason anyone reviewed this , and the only reason anyone could possibly claim to enjoy this is because David Lynch made it and because you want to have David Lynch 's children . But guess what ? Even David Lynch can produce a piece of crap.<br /><br />Maybe Lynch wanted you to transcend normality and experience absurdity in - itself as a pure subject - of - knowing . Maybe the atrocious , cacophonist sounds , and chicken - scratch visuals are supposed to imply something about humanity 's place in the world , about our relation to the Real , about the absurdity of it all.<br /><br />Instead , it just says one thing to me : I just lost $ 20.<br /><br />If I wanted offensive for the sake of offensive , I could crank Hansen on high and let me ears bleed . If I wanted absurd for the sake of absurd , I could just take a dump on a plate and watch that for 33 minutes.<br /><br />There is a single redeeming quality to Dumbland -- it is meta , meta funny . That is , it is so bad that it is n't even funny because it 's so bad . This fact , however , is a little funny.<br /><br />If you hate yourself and hate your money , then buy Dumbland . If not , spare yourself the agony .
0 David Lynch 's crude and crudely drawn take on South Park presents us with a nightmare of disturbing clichés about suburban middle class families . The father is a hideous monster with three teeth and a disproportionately large circular mouth - hole from which are uttered the most horrendous guttural noises , the son and mother are permanently horrified , incoherent creatures for whom terror is a way of life . A number of equally absurd characters are introduced throughout the series.<br /><br />Lynch is not famous for his comedies ( i.e. On the Air , aspects of Wild at Heart ) , and I am not particularly fond of comedies in general . However , there were a couple of scenes in Dumbland which made me laugh out loud . There are some clever bits of animated cinematography - where Lynch conveys wide ranges of reaction in his characters through a syntactical arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions ( which never really vary in Dumbland).<br /><br />I believe Lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight - forward , if disturbing , animated comedy here . Interestingly , he chose to follow in the footsteps of the recent wave of ultra - low - brow humor ( i.e. most Will Farrell films ) while adding elements of vicious social critique and classic cartoon violence and gross - out humor . While the blend does n't really work very well here , it is nothing if not Lynchian.<br /><br />Worth seeing by Lynch fans .
0 In film , I feel as though it should be more than just art . I think it should be more than that , a way to tell a story on screen . This short from David Lynch tells a story but not much of one . I felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy . It is good film - making but there really is n't anything else to it . As I 've said before , I am a huge David Lynch fan but I get frustrated by some of his work because I do n't see a need for it at all . This is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but I know he 's still got a ton of talent and I am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future . If you like Lynch , check this out but do n't be surprised when you do n't like it very much .
0 I 'm somewhat of a fan of Lynche 's work , so I was excited when I found this DVD . Unfortunately , I was very let down . It 's a series of short cartoons which attempt to show a disturbing and disgusting sort of humor . The animation is very crude , no doubt done using Macromedia . Each cartoon has a big fat guy beating up his family and generally acting like a jerk to everyone he knows . < br /><br />For people who are not familiar with this vein of animation , they will probably be somewhat impressed by it . However , if you 've spent much time on Newgrounds.com , like me , then these cartoons will be no different than any of the other stuff you 've seen before . Many of the popular amateur artists on Newgrounds are doing much better work than what was shown on this DVD . If Lynch submitted this work to the website , then he would blend in perfectly with some of the better of Newgrounds artists . But , since I saw this on DVD , instead of on Newgrounds , I give it a 4/10 , instead of a 7/10 , as I would have otherwise . These cartoons are fit for the internet , but with a name like David Lynch on it , I expected better quality both in story and in animation .
0 Lynch . The man has some really great stuff ! He knows how to disturb us , then reward us by getting us think in different ways . This , however , is altogether different . Dumbland 's reward is 1 % absurd comedy , earned by enduring 99 % stupidity . I may have laughed once , but somewhere around episode 4 I just started watching on fast - forward . Did n't miss a thing . I felt relieved when it ended , and that 's part of the point with this series . It 's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations , rounded out with annoying animation , voices and sound . But recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make Dumbland worthwhile .
0 I am a great fan of David Lynch and have everything that he 's made on DVD except for Hotel Room & the 2 hour Twin Peaks movie . So , when I found out about this , I immediately grabbed it and ... and ... what IS this ? It 's a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and foul mouthed and unfunny . Maybe I do n't know what 's good , but maybe this is just a bunch of crap that was foisted on the public under the name of David Lynch to make a few bucks , too . Let me make it clear that I did n't care about the foul language part but had to keep adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have . All in all this is a highly disappointing release and may well have just been left in the deluxe box set as a curiosity . I highly recommend you do n't spend your money on this . 2 out of 10 .
0 I hate to throw out lines like this , but in this case I feel like I have to : the American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst film I have seen in theaters in the last 5 years . There , I said it . And now that I have gotten that out of my system , please let me explain why.<br /><br />"When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage , a curse is born . The curse gathers in that place of death . Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury . " That is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I will admit it sounds intriguing . Unfortunately , the filmmakers take it no further . Those who encounter the " curse " are indeed consumed by its fury and that is all you get . You want more ? Well too bad . Some critics and fans are pointing out that the sole purpose of THE GRUDGE is to scare you . The problem is that when there is no plot to speak of , creepy images and sounds can only go so far . Director Takashi Shimizu , pulling a George Sluizer and remaking his own original film(s ) , valiantly attempts to build atmosphere in the first hour  by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over . It pretty much unfolds like this:<br /><br />-person walks into house < br /><br />-something flashes by the camera and/or a strange sound is heard < br /><br />-person goes to investigate < br /><br />-sound starts to get loud < br /><br />-person sees a ghost < br /><br />-loud scream and/or cat screech < br /><br />-cut to black < br /><br />Before the audience is even given a hint of plot , this exact same scenario unfolds 5 times in the first hour . The first time was actually somewhat creepy . Each subsequent use became laughable as the film went on . By the time the end of the film rolled around , my friend and I were laughingly wondering if this scene would end " with a loud scream and a cut to black . " We were never proved wrong.<br /><br />The film has no liner storyline , instead unfolding in a series of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled . I have no problem with non - linear storytelling when it is done right . The film jumps from time period to time period with no rhyme or reason . I have n't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2 . And this storytelling technique mars any sort of mystery that film could have possibly had . If you already know the ghosts have scared two characters to death , how is it shocking when their bodies are found in the attic ? And why should we care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone?<br /><br />Obviously greenlit the second the American version of THE RING made $ 15 million its first weekend , THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated imitation disguised as an actual movie . The scariest things about THE GRUDGE are that it made $ 40 million dollars its first weekend and some people consider it the " scariest movie ever made . " I wonder what happens to those who get consumed by the fury of paying to see THE GRUDGE ?
0 OK when I saw the previews for this movie I thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group I was with . Now living in America especially during this election I see some very deceiving things but I have to say these previews were towards the top of list . I do n't see how so many people could be scared by this movie . I only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one . The whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me . As for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of I thought they were comical at best . Oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why ? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning . How does that scare someone ? I can make that noise easily . Now do n't get me wrong I have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but I did n't even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad .
0 This movie may seem scary on commercials , but the actual movie was a reason to vomit . This is a below below average , ( even lower than that ) and has no plot . I mean every house can make you feel scared and sure , a dead Japanese woman would scare the poop out of you , but so what ? Make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair ( dead Japanese woman ) . Can you say " horrible rip - off of Samara ( The Ring ) " ? Do n't get me started with the " dead child " . Not even that scary ! So what ? He has a cat and he can imitate it , big freaking deal ! Just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the Grudge ! 1/10 ! Yuck ! >.<
0 My husband and I went to see this movie , being the horror movie buffs that we are . Two hours later I found myself wanting both my money and time back . I was so disappointed . The teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film . There was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances , etc . I found most of the ' scary ' parts to be more comical than anything . After viewing other movies based on the works of Japanese writers , I have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in Japan is not what is frightening here in the US . My advice : If you are a fan of true horror movies , save yourself the pain of sitting through this one . I ca n't really say that I would recommend renting it either , unless you have a free rental coming to you .
0 Okay , if you 've seen The Ring , you 've basically seen The Grudge . It 's trying to be scary by just having freaky camera work and loud sounds , but it fails miserably . The plot , if you can call it that , is weak and rather full of holes , for instance , how would the care center have known that Yoko did n't show up for work when the people who lived in the house were not there ? And it 's not really clear what Bill Pullman 's character had to do with anything . He just kind of came out of nowhere to advance the plot . It did n't make a lot of sense what happened to the original family . Who was hanging in the room , the little boy or the dad ? And was Yoko alive or dead when the care center guy found her ? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think about it more .
0 This movie is really nothing besides an admittedly well - crafted series of tense sequences punctuated with an inevitable " gotcha ! " at the end of each . Really , there is no character development and no real plot to speak of . There are only the most skeletal of motivations for the characters to do anything while they trudge forward to their unavoidable dooms . It 's all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid ( who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm ) and his ghost mom ( with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like " The Ring " ) take down a bunch of cardboard cut - out , two - dimensional excuses for human characters.<br /><br />This English - language version of " The Grudge " is the equivalent of cinematic junk food ; satisfying momentarily , but not really what you ought to be living on.<br /><br />Not recommended .
0 this movie was horrible . I could barely stay awake through it . I would never see this movie again if I were payed to . The so - called horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and over played . There was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the $ 7.50 I payed to see it . Do n't go see it , do n't rent it , do n't read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time . Sarah Michelle Geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie . Shame on you Sarah for being associated with this horrible , horrible movie . Horrible movie , no need to ever see it .
0 Wow , what a total let down ! The fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous . The special effects were a direct rip - off of " The ring . " The story ? Was there one ? Not in my opinion .. Just a bunch of flashy imaging . The entire film was a boring , stupid , mess . I guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns . However , this is the worst horror film I have seen in years . And that Buffy chick ? Well , she 's a bad actress ! As plastic as Barbie and just as talented .. No , wait , that would be an insult to the talents of Barbie ! I suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box office as it was PG-13 , and had it been rated R , it would have bombed IMO ! Stupid movie !
0 Gee , what a crappy movie this was ! I can not understand what people find so scary about " The Grudge " . The director plays one trick ( I 'd have to admit a very good one , that is brought to life very stylized ) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again . As a consequence I startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie , but once I knew the drill I practically fell asleep as The Grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute . To conclude , I can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with , that the so - called predecessor " The Ring " was way scarier and that buying a ticket for " The Grudge " is a waste of money .
0 If you go see this movie you 'll be holding a grudge against the movie theatre , the director , the producer , the actors and the person that told you to go see it ! Shame on you , Sarah Michelle Geller , for putting your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie . It may have been more scary if the Japanese actors would have just spoken in Japanese instead of attempting to ' act ' in English . I wanted to boo when the movie ended ... a true disappointment after all of the hype on TV and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker . Sarah Michelle really did n't have to act at all to make this movie ... she just practiced her frowning skills . Do n't waste your time or money on this film .
0 Imagine that you are asked by your date what movie you wanted to see , and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer about " The Grudge . " So , in good faith , you recommend seeing that movie . It is the Halloween season , after all . And it did boffo box office this past weekend , so it must be pretty good ... so you go.<br /><br />And you 're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it does , and you hear yourself audibly saying , " that ca n't be the end of the movie .... " But , alas , it is . < br /><br />And imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed for recommending such a dog of a movie . You think that your date thinks you 're a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity , and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship . Actually , it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was . I see no future for Miss Gellar in the movies , and suggest that she sticks to television in the future . Actually , it wo n't be long before she is consigned to flea - market conventions selling Buffy memorabilia , and it ca n't happen soon enough , if you ask me . Horrible , horrible , horrible . The plot did n't make sense ; continuity was terrible . It 's apparent that the whole ending was contrived to have a " Grudge II -- The Return of ' Cat - Boy ' . "
0 All the kids aged from 14 - 16 want to see this movie ( although you are only allowed at 18 ) . They have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it . I feel very sad kids ca n't see what a good movie is , and what a bad movie is . This was one of the worst movies i saw in months . Every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie . And the end ? It 's an open ending ... why ? Because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story . This movie is just made to make you scared , and if you are a bit smart and know some about music , you exactly know when you 'll be scared . < br /><br />When the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told ( a bit to loud ) him that this was a total waste of money , some stupid kid looked strange at me . These day i could make an Oscar with a home - video of my goldfish , if only i use the right marketing .
0 * * * spoilers***spoilers***spoilers***spoilers < br /><br />There are bad movies and then there are movies which are so awful that they become affectionately comical in their ineptness . Such is the case with Columbia Pictures ' ' The Grudge . ' This cinematic atrocity began when an otherwise well intentioned American saw a Japanese made for TV film ' Ju - on ' and was inspired to remake the movie in English . This began a virtual tsunami of bad decisions which circumnavigated the globe until it washed ashore in Orlando on October 21 , 2004.<br /><br />The premise , and I use the word loosely , involves a house in Tokyo haunted by a skinny Momma ghost who looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette , along with her ghastly sidekick a chubby , rambunctious but evil second grader . Is there anything scarier than a creepy 8 year old Japanese boy ? Sure there is ! Count Chocula comes to mind . With this whimsical bunch we must add a mysterious black cat who I have affectionately named Chim Chim . ( Remember Speed Racer ? ) As you have already guessed , they were murdered in this domicile of doom and now desire to kill everyone who enters the premises . You see , as explained by a Japanese detective , when someone dies in a rage their ghost seeks revenge on everyone who steps on the property lines as defined by the county commissioner or something like that , I forget . < br /><br />The story begins innocently enough with acclaimed thespian Bill Pullman leaping to his death from a balcony . My guess is Bill Pullman got this job because of his kids begged him for a trip to Tokyo Disneyland . Next we endure the mildly interesting saga of Nurse Yoko , ' oh no do n't go in there ' screams the audience , but alas she heeds not the dire warnings and is predictably snuffed out like a magic lantern . About 30 minutes into the movie we finally see its American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen . Sarah Michelle Gellar might be a competent actress but I could not help thinking of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , so much so that it was distracting . It is the equivalent to having Jennifer Anniston star in a movie about the adventures of six friends in New York . Try as you may , you just ca n't stop thinking about the other project which made her famous . But I digress , Karen , the nurse is hired as a replacement for the original care giver who disappeared at spooks r us . < br /><br />She snoops around , meets the ghosts , coma lady dies , and some other stuff happens . Watching the fair haired vixen searching for clues I half expected her to find the ghost and pull its mask off to reveal it was actually old man Gower who owned the abandoned amusement park ! ' I would 've gotten away with it too if it were n't for you meddling kids and that dog of yours ! ' < br /><br />Director Takashi Shimizu , who is vying to be the Ed Wood of Asia , made two unfortunate decisions involving sound . First , he choose to use a soundtrack only when someone is about to be killed . This is an excellent devise for obliterating any suspense because the audience gets a two minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder . Second , he gave the ghosts a bizarre guttural noise that sounds like a gargling gopher . After the movie , I heard several people exiting the theatre making the sound and laughing.<br /><br />Sarah Michelle Gellar ends up being the sole survivor . And of course we learn that the fire she set to burn down the house was extinguished in time for the obligatory next chapter . However , considering the humorous reactions of the audience , they did not want a sequel but an apology . ' The Grudge ' could be easily re - edited into a comedy , perhaps then it will be appreciated for its camp value . Baring that , this will go down as the greatest cinematic thriller since ' Godzilla vs. Megalon . ' I would suggest waiting until the movie comes to your local discount theatre where it can receive the public ridicule it so richly deserves .
0 Difficult to call The Grudge a horror movie . At best it made me slightly jump from surprise at a couple of moments.<br /><br />If one forgets the ( failed ) frightening dimension and looks at other sides of the movie , he is again disappointed . The acting is OK but not great . The story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning , while one is trying to get what 's happening . But toward the end one understands there is not much to understand . " Scary " elements seems sometimes to have been added to the script without reason ... <br /><br />So ... ( yawn ) See this movie it if you have nothing more interesting to do , like cutting the carrots or looking at the clouds .
0 Takashi Shimizu had a great opportunity with a remake of his original film Ju - On The Grudge . While I have n't seen that film , I would have to wager that there 's more imagination and originality ( or some rip - off originality , in other words skill with known tropes of the Japanese ghost movie ) than in his own directed remake . Maybe the script was written to somehow have some kind of warped appeal , or I would guess accessibility , for an American audience . What starts off with some potential - the hint of something very screwed up going on with Bill Pullman 's sudden movement - just goes into a total jumble . And as a horror movie ? Gimme a break.<br /><br />Tension could have been built on the situation - a nurse going to take care of a disturbed woman in a house that is haunted - but he undercuts everything he wants to get his audience to feel . Scares ? How 's about some music timed just so you know when exactly to expect something . A black cat ? Yeah , why not just make the ghost - boy thing sound like a cat for creepiness which , in effect , is only creepy if you want cats . Plot ? Why not just shuffle between past and present without any semblance of an actual flow of how a story could be told ( meaning , while the flashbacks are inserted and are meant to be organic with the story overall , they are n't ) , or for that matter have us care about ANYONE in the cast.<br /><br />By the time the characters , or those that are there for exposition , get around to telling us what is going on or whatever , there 's little point to care . The film - making is shoddy ( i.e. the 180 degree rule is broken many times over and not in a forgivable or intriguing way ) , and the performances are wooden even when looking frightened or shocked ( Gellar especially is disappointing , but Pullman , who shows up later after his first scene , is sorely miscast ) . Even when Shimizu tries for some average old " Boo " scares , like when the woman is in the office building and chased by the Grudge ghost , it 's still silly . Just watch when she 's going on that elevator and the ghost is in the background of shots . Either you 'll go with it , and if so more power to you , or you 'll laugh hysterically at the results . Count me in the latter.<br /><br />I'm not totally sure where this project went wrong - was it Shimizu having to retool it for the studios , or him not giving enough leeway with his revamp of his vision ? Or maybe Raimi had some say in it and made things more confusing and/or dull than they would be with someone else . The Grudge gives us a lot of information that does n't make sense or at the least give us some horror - fodder to chew on . It 's cineplex trash of a sad order .
0 Freeway Killer , Is a Madman who shoots people on the freeway while yelling a bunch of mystical chant on a car phone . The police believe he is a random killer , but Sunny , the blond heroine , played by Darlanne Fluegel detects a pattern . So does the ex - cop , played by James Russo , and they join forces , and bodies , in the search for the villain who has done away with their spouses . Also starring Richard Belzer , this movie has its moments especially if you like car chases , but its really not a good movie for the most part , check it out if you 're really bored and have already seen The Hitcher , Joy Ride , or Breakdown , otherwise stay away from the freeway .
0 Even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow , Wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film . It barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981 . Kilmer just goes through the motions as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles ; as Holmes 's wife and underage girlfriend , respectively . The rest of the cast has such small roles that it 's impossible to get any dimensions from them . The film also stars Carrie Fisher , Ted Levine , Franky G , MC Gainey , Dylan McDermott and a cameo from Paris Hilton .
0 I was excited when I heard they were finally making this horrific event into a movie . The whole era ( 1980 's Southern California ) and subject matter ( drug and porn industry ) is intriguing to me . I thought this would be a sure fire hit . I was not thrilled with the choice of Kilmer as Holmes , they do not resemble each other in physical appearance or mannerisms . I guess he sells tickets ? However , I was willing to overlook this and give it a fair shot . I was a bit shocked that there were only like four other people in the entire theater with me on that first day of showing . Now the whole crime and story in the film is hard to do , I will admit that . There were no witnesses to this very violent and brutal act . John Holmes was there , but he was also a pathological liar and worried about what would happen to his family ( and self ) if he talked to police about it . In fact , Holmes never really testified about what happened and the crime did go unsolved . So this was still really one big mystery , a mystery that this movie does nothing to cast light on . The person writing the screenplay had a whole lot of discretion and most of the principal characters are dead . However , there is no real storyline , it is fragmented claptrap . The script is light and the actors try to hard to beef up paper thin lines by overacting . The film gives no insight into Holmes or the other people involved . Kilmer 's character disappears for long stretches , his girlfriend is dull , the police are jokes . Even Kudrow tries hard to make a flimsy role look substantial . It is a very shallow piece and dare I say , boring . The director even tries to turn it into a love story . Which is nice , unless you know anything about what a piece of trash John Holmes really was . Perhaps a couple of viewings of Anderson 's " Boogie Nights " might have helped here . " Boogie Nights " was innovative and exciting in all regards . This film on the other hand was flat and without any real charm or style . Even the music is out of place , with Duran Duran being played in a scene that was supposed to have taken place in 1980 . Then we have Gordon Lightfoot ? Gordon Lightfoot ? There could have been a great film based on this gruesome event , but I have not seen it yet . I have not seen even a decent one yet ( unless you consider the Rahad Jackson scene from Boogie Nights ) .
0 I am wanting to make a " Holmes with Doors " pun but I ca n't quite string it all together . Suitably grubby and over edited WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that channels Morrison at the same time .... but how coy is this film about the famous 14 inches ! Australian crime films flash it all the time and skip the graphic violence instead ..... as someone famous said once about US cinema double standards : " kiss a breast and it 's an X , stab it and its an action PG 13 " ... WONDERLAND is 14 minutes too long too , and at the end the tawdry spiral we were all glad to escape the cinema . How many films called WONDERLAND are we going to get ? There must be six in the last decade . The pixilated violence and muted color sets the seedy tone but the wobble - cam gets tiresome , as if we are gawking at their nostrils all the time . Taking a few cues form THE DOORS and TAXI DRIVER it all becomes forgettable the next day .
0 Unlike others , I refuse to call this pitiful excuse for a movie a triumph of style over substance ( I do n't want to give style a bad name ) . Still , it 's the most apt description that comes to mind.<br /><br />A pointless , unpleasant and ultimately meaningless assault on the eyes and ears , " Wonderland " leaves one wondering only why the film was made in the first place and who in their right mind gave the greenlight to this dreary and tangled mess . A biography of porn star John Holmes ? A study of who the man was , why he went into the business and how it affected him ? Great . Bound to be compelling , bound to be entertaining . Bound to be enlightening and fascinating on about a million levels ( and I have zero interest in porn).<br /><br />But a confusing , violent , Rashomon - style study of a series of murders Holmes was connected with after his career ended ? Who in hell cares ? What insights do we gain ? This film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of John Holmes 's life -- that he was a porno star ! " Wonderland " might as well have been about anyone : the fact that the main character is the most famous male adult film star in history is almost irrelevant.<br /><br />To make matters about a thousand times worse , the picture is loaded down with jerkoff gimmicks -- annoying machine gun editing , sloppy Dogme-95 camerawork , unnecessary split - screen graphics and animation , etc . etc.<br /><br />In the absence of a compelling story and unique main character , the director ( and I use the term loosely ) has thrown together a dozen or so techniques from other films and decided to call the resulting mess a movie , among these : the trendy , bleach - bypass look of " Narc " or " Traffic " or " Minority Report ; " the frantic , often incomprehensible , throw - the - pieces - of - film - in - the - air cutting style of " Natural Born Killers " or " 28 Days Later ; " the fill - every - moment - of - silence - with- an - old - song - to - evoke - the - period soundtrack of " Goodfellas " or " Blow ; " the groovy , retro title sequence of " Velvet Goldmine " or " Autofocus " or " Catch Me If You Can . " The list goes on and on and on . Pathetic.<br /><br />I wanted to like this movie . I had real hopes for it . " Wonderland Avenue " had been around for years ; had the context of the murders been emphasized rather than the murders themselves , I think it could have worked . Had the murders ( and Holmes 's growing involvement with seedy L.A. types ) signaled the end of a career , or the end of the swinging ' 70s , I think the film could have had meaning ; it could have served a purpose . As it is -- meaningless . Pointless . Who cares how many perspectives exist on a series of murders generally unknown by the public ? The case is n't famous enough to merit such painstaking examination.<br /><br />This film should have been the third act of " The John Holmes Story . " That 's it . Period . And it could have worked . What 's that ? Oh , right , right , they did n't want to tell a traditional rise - and - fall story . They did n't want to make " Boogie Nights " or " Goodfellas " or " Star 80 " or " Autofocus . " They wanted their film to be different . Right?<br /><br />Well , in one sense , they succeeded . There 's a big difference between those films and " Wonderland . " The difference is those films are good.<br /><br / >
0 Val Kilmer , solid performance . Dylan McDermott , solid performance . Josh Lucas , solid performance . Three very engaging actors giving decent performances . The problem is , who cares about the plot ? John Holmes . Infamous for his well - endowments , a drug addict , and a guy who , despite contracting AIDS , continued to make adult films , just does not make an intriguing character.<br /><br />The story surrounds the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late 80 's in Los Angelos to which Holmes was linked , arrested and charged with murder , and who ultimately was acquitted . Just like in the case of O.J. , the guilt factor , regardless of the outcome , ranged quite high in the " He did it " zone.<br /><br />There is no one to sympathize with in this film , as everyone is a self - serving criminal . There is just nothing remotely interesting here .
0 The plot certainly seemed interesting enough . How can a real - life brutal murder be turned into a truly boring movie ? Well , you can watch " Wonderland " and find out.<br /><br />I had heard of the Wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely sadistic people . Unfortunately , there is zero character development , so we never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters . The pace of the direction was very tedious . This all leads to an extraordinarily boring movie.<br /><br />Given that Dawn Schiller - a central character as Holmes 's girlfriend - was an associate producer and that Holmes 's wife was a consultant on the film , we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters .
0 The premise was intriguing , but sadly this film just does n't do any justice to it . The casting was quite good , and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent ( overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect .... I was waiting for Steven Bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial ) , characters were identified exclusively by on - screen coke usage ( and pretty much everything else left to Boogie Nights for character development ) , and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story . A very forgettable film .
0 Bad Movie - saw it at the TIFF and the movie gives me a sense of ' been there done that ' - it reminds me alot of the movie Blow - expect the Blow was actually interesting.<br /><br />This one story told two ways and both times it is not told that well.<br /><br / >
0 This is the only movie I have ever seen that has prompted me to write a critique on any internet site , and that is a significant statement from someone who likes " The Attack of the Monolith Monsters . " This movie is perfect for anyone who wants an inoffensive movie . It is devoid of sex and violence , for example . I believe that this movie is safe for children of all ages . This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained , challenged , or stimulated in any way . Adults could easily catch up on their sleep in front of the TV while the kids watch this movie . Do n't be surprise , however , if you wakeup to find the kids have turned the TV off and started a board game . As an adult who enjoys being entertained , who enjoys everything from the mundane to the fantastic in realism , drama , comedy , and action , all of those adult things that reflect real life on earth and/or stimulate the imagination , this movie has nothing to offer .
0 I saw this in the market place at the Cannes Film Festival . < br /><br />It 's a real cheapo prod - nothing wrong with that but you have to make up for it with a bit of sex or gore or both . < br /><br />Think Larry Cohen . < br /><br />Sean Young is an interesting actor - well done to the producers for hooking her I guess.<br /><br />The opening scene in the space - ship coming down is hilarious - you could picture all the crew hands shaking it around ! < br /><br />Ha ha - but I wish the people who made this well - at least it 's not pretentious .
0 The movie 's premise is spooky : a woman gets pregnant when kissed by a stranger in a bar.<br /><br />But as soon as the movie begins , a horrible opening scene establishes that this is a C type Sci - Fi TV movie . It 's a big Star Trek and a bit X - files , but more than anything else it 's boring.<br /><br />When the movie kicks into action everything is predictable and cliche . It looked more like a 2 parter in a bad Sci - Fi TV series . No suspense and no thrills , but not for a lack of trying . Just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters.<br /><br />Don't waste your time .
0 Here we are : two travelers from a distant futuristic world arrive on earth ... one is on a desperate mission to preserve a life , another is an inhuman killing machine determined to eliminate the woman who will give birth to the saviour of an entire race.<br /><br />So what could we call this killing machine ? It 's almost like he 's some kind of destroyer , or eradicator ... sort of like an exterminator or something . What 's the word I 'm looking for ... something that -terminates- things ? Hmmmm .... <br /><br />Anyway , the protector ( who swiftly doffs the white tunic he stole from Luke Skywalker in favour of local clothing ) finds the young woman first and impregnates her with a future - born hero - to - be . The evil uhhhh ... " exterminator " kills some rednecks and steals their guns and clothes , then attempts to locate the woman by visiting her workplace and asking around by looking menacingly into people 's eyes and repeating her name threateningly.<br /><br />Then begins a desperate race for survival as the seemingly deathless and unstoppable " exterminator " pursues the couple across the countryside . At some point he may acquire boots and a motorcycle , but I 'm not sure.<br /><br />Perhaps , in an exciting finale , he will attempt to crush them under the wheels of an enormous tanker truck full of ... acid . Then the truck will crash . They will be saved ... but no ! He will then re - emerge , as strong as ever . He will kill the protector and pursue the girl into a meat packing plant , where in a terrifying finish , he is pushed into a large piece of industrial chopping machinery , and destroyed once and for all.<br /><br />But maybe I 'm extrapolating too much ... after all , I did stop watching this movie after Mr. Protector magically impregnates Sean Young by kissing her at a bar , then tells her the child will be born in 3 days . < br /><br />The costumes and effects are great in this movie ... I loved them the first time I saw them on Star Trek : Next Generation too ! Sean Young does another great turn as an unemotive Replicant , and career sweat - hog Stephen Baldwin is also on board as Young 's Fat Cop Boyfriend . Not sure where he fits into the plot though ... maybe he 's an import from a different James Cameron movie ?
0 Being a music student myself , I thought a movie taking place in a conservatory might be fun to watch . Little did I know ... ( I had no idea this movie was based on a book by Britney Spears ) This movie was implausible throughout . It 's obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a conservatory and does n't know a thing about classical music . Let me give you just a few examples : 1 ) There is NO WAY anyone would be admitted to a classical conservatory with no classical training whatsoever ! Just having a nice pop voice is n't enough , besides , that 's a different thing altogether - another genre , different technique . It 's like playing the violin when applying for a viola class . 2 ) How come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury ? If she was n't a singing professor herself , she would have no say in a situation like that , and if she was a singing professor , why were n't we told so ? 3 ) Being able to read music is a necessity if you 're to major in music . 4 ) How did Angela get a hold of that video tape ? That would have been kept confidential , for the jury 's eyes only . Now either she got the tape from one of the professors or the script writers just did n't have a clue . I wonder which ... 5 ) The singing professor gave Holly the Carmen song saying she " had the range " , which she clearly did NOT . Yes , she was able to sing the notes , but Carmen is a mezzo - soprano , while Holly 's voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre , not at all compatible with that song . 6 ) Worst of all : Not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music , but it does n't even try to hide it . The aria that Angela sings is mutilated beyond recognition , a fact which is painfully blatant at the recital , where it is cut short in a disgraceful way - Mozart would roll over in his grave . The Habanera from Carmen sounded a bit weird at times , too , and the way it was rearranged at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music - it 's stiff and boring but hey , add some drums and electric guitars and it 's almost as good as Britney Spears ! I know these are all minor details , but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research . Anyhow , I might have chosen to suspend my disbelief had the characters and the plot been well elaborated . But without that , I really ca n't find any redeeming qualities in this movie except for one : it 's good for a laugh .
0 I actually liked this movie until the end . Sure , it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon . Until the end , that is . For her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch - up to the other classically trained students , what does the main character do ? Wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition ? No . She tortures and butchers the great sensuous Habanera from Carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable Brittany Spears - wannabe pop song . My ears bled ! And , in the supreme moment of horror , her teachers gave her a standing ovation ! Any teacher not in a Spears - induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot . Save your time , save your ears - skip this movie !
0 can any movie become more naive than this ? you ca nt believe a piece of this script . and its ssooooo predictable that you can tell the plot and the ending from the first 10 minutes . the leading actress seems like she wants to be Barbie ( but she does n't make it , the doll has MORE acting skills).<br /><br />the easiness that the character passes and remains in a a music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography . i wo nt even comment on the shallowness of the characters but the ONE good thing of the film is Madsen 's performance which manages to bring life to a melo - like one - dimensional character.<br /><br />The movie is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth . i can think some 13 year old Britney - obsessed girls shouting " O , do give us a break ! If we want fairy tales there is always the Brothers Grimm book hidden somewhere in the attic " . I gave it 2 instead of one only for Virginia Madsen .
0 It was a decent movie , I actually kind of enjoyed it . But the ending is so abrupt ! ! There is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends . What happens after the concert ? What happens with her boyfriend ? Does she hook up with Grant ? Does she come beck in the next semester ? And what about Angela ? Obviously Holly 's performance would knock Angela down a few pegs , but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts . There is so much left up in the air and it 's very unsatisfying . I do n't know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something , but it is a terrible ending and I think that it really makes the movie a joke . I was very disappointed .
0 This movie is entertaining enough due to an excellent performance by Virginia Madsen and the fact that Lindsey Haun is lovely . However the reason the movie is so predictable is that we 've seen it all before . I 've have n't read the book A Mother 's Gift but I hope for Britney and Lynne Spears sake it is completely different than this movie . Unless you consider ending a movie with what is essentially a music video an original idea , the entire movie brings to mind the word plagiarized .
0 I have read the book a couple of times and this movie does n't follow exactly as it should . I could let this slide , it is after all a movie . However I have serious issues with the setting of the movie . Nobody has seemed to mention that this movie and the book it is based on are based in actual events that happened in Nebraska . I live in Nebraska . I grew up in the town that this movie is supposed to be based on . First of all , the " small " town that is talked about as the setting , is the third largest city in the state . With a population of around 50,000 . Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver . Second the scenery for the movie is wrong . Grand Island is in the Platte river valley . Which is very flat with very few trees . I tried watching this movie , but it made me mad to see my hometown being treated so bad . This was a real event . Large sections of the city were wiped out . In the book they talk about riding bikes from Mormon Island to Fonner Park . I guess you could if you do n't mind a 15 mile ride each way . For anyone who wants to know what really happened go here http://www.theindependent.com/twisters/
0 TV version of " Twister " springs a few leaks but manages to remain watchable . My sister bought this at a Wal - Mart a few years back when it was released , I saw it back then and thought it was okay . Later " Twister " with Bill Pullman and Helen Hunt comes out ( or was it before ? I think it was ' 97 ) and did a better job overall . But " Twister " was more silly fun ; this is realistic with a message . It all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters : Twisters , or a low - budget character study?<br /><br />John Schneider and Devon Sawa ( he 's the reason my sister bought it ) star , and Devon Sawa , who went on to " Wild America , " " Final Destination " and " Slackers " got his big break here . So in a way , I was one of the first people to see him really take off . I do n't know if it 's an honor or a shame , I have n't seen how he acts in recent films.<br /><br />"Night of the Twisters " all depends on personal taste , like I said , it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters : Twisters , or a low - budget character study . " Night of the Twister " has the latter . So you decide.<br /><br />I give it a 2.5/5 ... <br /><br />- John Ulmer
0 This film , although not totally bad , should have been filmed where the actual events took place . Grand Island , Nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornados on the night of June 3 , 1980 . Grand Island is situated in the nearly treeless , flat Platte River Valley in Hall county . The makers of this movie filmed in the tree covered hills of Ontario and moved the whole event to a non - existant town called Blainsworth . The people of Grand Island bravely survived this awful night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie .
0 This film is totally garbage . Some imbecilic intellectual comforting himself by making all his best to claim superiority of aristocrat over working class . Nothing more than a piece of self - complacence catharsis . Disgusting.<br /><br />If this kind of a movie is set in US , it will sure make itself a big joke . And simply because it comes out from ' the other side ' , it makes itself a masterpiece , a wonderful amusement for certain brain - washed and/or brain - washing westerns ( some George W. maybe : ) . A typical cold - war sequelae , some kind of joke anyway.<br /><br />I would say , if this -- like expressed in this film -- is all what Soviet intellectuals had been thinking about all those years , then maybe they deserve all the miseries they claim they had gone through . BUT NO ! 'cause like many others , I 've read and watched real masterpieces made by real outstanding Soviet intellectuals . For example , something also relevant with dog , " White Bim Black Ear " -- both Gavriil Troyepolsky 's book and Stanislav Rostotsky 's movie -- is a real masterpiece . Real life , real tragedy , real sad , real pride and dignity , one of the real best of the Soviet era .
0 It 's a pretty good cast , but the film has nowhere near the grace of the original Italian comedy " Big Deal on Madonna Street " Anyone looking for an entertaining caper film should visit the original . William Macy may be one of our greatest living actors , but here he 's put to little use . And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni , so I sort of feel sorry for him trying to fill those shoes . Might as well try to imitate Bogart or a young De Niro . The art direction is rich and textured but brings nothing to the story , the extra bits they add to the story feel completely unnecessary and the things they take away are missed . Even starting the way they do seems bizarrely gratuitous and takes away from the surprise of the original . Sam Rockwell has his odd and genial charm and Luis Guzman has that odd charisma , but the love story part of the movie just seems clunky and flat . It 's too bad nobody has figured out how to make this movie as well as it was first made , but then again it 's too bad we live in a culture where we feel like we need to remake amazing things instead of simply learning to savor the originals .
0 it ai nt bad , but it ai nt good . it is just entertaining.<br /><br />as a comedy which it is supposed to be , it 's dreadful . not many laughs at all as every joke in the movie has been done a million times before.<br /><br />it 's a shame as all the actors in the film are great usually , but none of them really do much . and the ending sucks .
0 " Welcome to Collinwood " is kind of a disaster . Considering the people involved , it should 've been multiple times better.<br /><br />Watching it , if you 're at least somewhat attached to the faith that it 'll get better , will probably make you cry . It 's one of those movies that had potential , but was robbed of this potential thanks to a terrible script and some bad acting , not to mention the strangely annoying and unnecessary George Clooney character and the guy who reminds me of Richard Dreyfuss but about whom I care so little that I do n't even want to know his name.<br /><br />The film 's only saving grace is the weird con vocabulary it introduces . I found myself thinking of it time and time again as I watched more crime capers . This is the only reason I gave the film a 3 . The plot is boring , the characters are neurotic , needlessly offensive , and highly unlikable . They are in a constant state of agonizing stress and they 're all so irritating that I celebrated their obstacles . They yell at each other and swear crassly . The dialogue is insipid at best and insultingly stupid at its low points.<br /><br />I find that Steven " Traffic " Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney are to blame for this . They should be tried for war crimes , if anyone actually remembers this crap long enough to care .
0 There 's nothing new here . All the standard romantic - comedy scenes , even down to the taxi sprinting to the airport to stop the woman flying away . The only thing that saves this is the acting of Alison Eastwood & some of the minor characters ( blink and you 'll miss Gabrielle Anwar ) , who obviously had some fun.<br /><br />Turn it off when the pair are in bliss , and you wo n't have to go through the inevitable plot pain .
0 Formula flick of guy who wants girl , guy who will lie to get next to girl , guy who will get best friend to help in outrageous way ( comedus reliefus , no ? ) to help deceive girl , etc . This one 's been done to death , and with rare exception of a few z - rated outings , it 's been done better.<br /><br />Stale plot aside , the leads are attractive and there 's a couple of good moments . Jonathon Schaech has done better , and his acting here came close to being phoned in . Not a complete loss , but nothing new here in this tepid affair .
0 I 've tried to watch this so - called comedy , but it 's very hard to bear . This is a bad , narrow - minded , cliché - ridden movie . Definitively not funny , but very much boring and annoying , indeed . Bad script , bad acting . It 's a complete waste of time - and there remains nothing more to say , I 'm afraid.<br /><br />1 out of 10 points .
0 One of the worst romantic comedies ( nay , worst movies ) I 've ever seen . Boy ( who works as a phone psychic ! ) must pretend to be gay to move into apartment with woman of his dreams . Hilarity does not ensue . Boredom , light gay - bashing , and horrible dialogue do . If you read Brad Meltzer and like his crappy dialogue , you 'll like this movie.<br /><br />Be smart . Avoid this . if you see it , destroy the copy .
0 Yet another insult and slap in the face to gay men everywhere . This lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it . Once again we have an attractive ' straight ' hero who supposedly ca n't get any woman to be interested in him . Yeah , right ! And we 're also presented with the ' sympathetic , attractive ' gay friend who is actually a fat , balding , ugly old man whom the lead is supposed to find attractive . Even I did n't find him appealing and I 'm a fat , ugly old gay man ( but thankfully not balding ) ! Whatever acting talent there may be here has been thrown away on a bad script , and truly awful direction . Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from filmdom , but then he 's no different than the countless other hacks working in Hollyweed .
0 This horrendously bad piece of trash manages to be racist , sexist and homophobic all at once , while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated . Atrocious performances , a cliche ridden screenplay , and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of . Two scenes were especially offensive - the one in which Schaech scrubs his tongue after being kissed by another man ( could it really have been that gross ) , and the scene where Eastwood is kissed by Schaech 's best friend , who is pretending to be Russian . After he leaves the room she exclaims " f**king foreigners " ! So much for her being a cultured artist who dreams of living in Paris!?!<br /><br />Jonathon Schaech can be a likeable actor on screen , and is astonishingly good - looking . It 's a shame he did n't learn more from working with cutting edge gay director Gregg Araki on an earlier film , and try to salvage this film from descending into a string of gay stereotypes and a mire of homophobia .
0 They played this on the July 4th Twilight Zone marathon and this is , hands down , the worst Twilight Zone episode I 've ever seen . It 's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone . Even though Twilight Zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being groaningly predictable , this one was completely out of place . Compare this to legendary episodes like " A Stop at Willoughby " or " Midnight Sun " , and you realize there is no comparison.<br /><br />Buster Keaton did what he could with such terrible material , and frankly it surprises me that someone of his historic comedy stature would stoop to the level of this episode . Even though he seemed to be giving it some effort , he MUST have needed the money ... there 's no other explanation .
0 I am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and have probably reviewed more Buster Keaton films for IMDb than any other person . Every film he made from the beginning of his career to the early 30s with only two exceptions have I reviewed , so you can tell I am a major fan . It 's because of this that I found this episode so painful and hard to watch . I loved this man 's films and kept thinking " Buster , how could you ? ! " . Well , now that I think about it , I guess I can see why Buster Keaton starred in this god - awful episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE . He 'd lost much of his fortune after a messy divorce in the early 1930s and his film career as a leading man was long passed as well . Now , in the 1960s , Keaton needed the money and loved his resurgence in popularity so he whored himself out to anyone willing to pay -- appearing in Beach films and this mess of an episode of a great series.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the episode is that it is just terribly written and Buster deserved much better . The show is supposed to be funny but is n't and instead of a homage to silent films is just painful to watch -- particularly with Keaton putting that stupid time travel helmet on as well as all the poorly executed slapstick . Do yourself a favor , SKIP THIS ONE -- it 's a pale imitation of the greatness that once was Keaton 's career ! ! !
0 = = = minor spoilers=== < br /><br />I am , like many others , a huge Jerry Bruckheimer fan . So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front , and the trailer coming by before MI:2 , expectations were rising . A Jerry Bruckheimer production . Big cars . Nic Cage and fresh from an Oscar- Angelina Jolie . What can possibly go wrong ? A lot . < br /><br />The script is neither funny ( which it tries really hard to be ) nor exciting . You put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and Wooh - haa ! ! you 've got comedy ? I do n't think so . Excitement is totally out of the picture . First of all ( and this is probably said many times ) there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed ? IF you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gon na kill Nic 's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days , next thing you know is that Kip ( the brother ) is walking with Nic in the streets again . Is this excitement ? Think not . Then comes the best bit- the romance between Nic and Angelina . She actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to Nic . ' Do you have a girlfriend ? ' ' Are you seeing anybody ? ' ' What went wrong ? ' etc.<br /><br />Then there 's only one sparkle of hope left : the car chases . They 're disappointing to say the least , because the trailer made it look like it was full of them , and there 's only one . A very long one , caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement . I really had trouble following the action.<br /><br />So is it an action movie ? a thriller ? a romantic comedy ? - there 's no need to decide , just avoid this horrible mess . I 'll give 3 out of 10 stars , and I feel like I 'm being generous .
0 This movie should be shown to film school students as an example of what NOT to do . The original kicked some major tire squealing butt , this horrible disaster breaks the cardinal rule of Bruckheimer films , which is : we all know they suck , but they have great action . This film has NO ACTION . This film is BORING . Where are the cars ? Where are the chases ? Where 's the tension ? Where 's the suspense ? Where 's the rush ? Where ! ! ? ? This is n't really a movie at all , it 's a bad commercial . 50 cars in 24 hours ? That is wrong . They have 3 days to steal them , the ad is wrong . How bad is that ? The leads acting is stiff , wooden and forced . The villain , the cop , the others ... who cares . They utter their pointless lines , they serve the illogical plot . They slog through it the best they can as the music video director says " do n't worry we 'll make a lot of fast cuts and no one will notice how bad the film is " or " we 'll fix it with lots of loud music " The " script " is n't really a script at all , it 's more like a list of cliches with an ending that is a total ripoff of : -------Warning - possible spoiler------ 5 - -----4 - ----3 - ----2 - ----1 - ----- The Fugitive . The biggest crime of all is the underuse of Vinnie Jones , man .... this is the baddest , coolest mofo since Jules in Pulp Fiction . And what do they do ! ? They make him a mute who 's hardly in the film ! Make Vinnie the main villain and he could have saved the film . How could they have been so dumb ? How ? How ? Why ? The original film is very entertaining with a cool trick at the end that gets the driver away . The original has a great 40 minute chase that delivers ! Go find the original . Or if you 're craving some real car chase action go rent RONIN . The chases in Ronin raised the bar by which all other car chases will now be judged . Bruckheimer and Cage had all that money , all those resources , all that experience , and they ca n't even come close to matching a film made 25 years ago for $ 250,000 ? How can that be ? You feel like you got ripped off after seeing this movie . Where I was once excited to see Coyote Ugly , Remember the Titans and Pearl Harbor , now I say : God help us all . < br /><br / >
0 WARNING : REVIEW CONTAINS SLIGHT SPOILERS < br /><br />There 's a parallel universe out there where Gone In 60 Seconds is a dark , edgy , controversial independent movie . Unfortunately in this dimension Gone ... is a flashy , vacuous , testosterone - fuelled moronfest starring Nicolas Cage.<br /><br />For reasons not really worth getting into , he and his large number of cronies have four days to steal fifty expensive cars , only one of which has an alarm . This crew consists of the guy with the funny - shaped ears who 's rumoured to be the new Superman ; a guy who conducted electricity in The X - Files ; an ex - professional footballer and two token black men.<br /><br />Their enemies are cops , rival car thieves and Bilborough from Cracker , his Manchester accent suitably flattened and broadened for American audiences who are now used to that sort of thing since Daphne in Frasier . There 's also Angelina Jolie , who gets no character ; save to be a receptacle to men 's sexual desires . She and Cage are supposed to be old flames , which is odd , as they never have anything approaching a normal conversation in all of the film 's overlong 135 m running time.<br /><br />In fact , characterisation is so poor that whenever anyone has a " moment " a violin plays in the background to accentuate the " emotion " . It 's no spoiler to reveal that Vinnie Jones ( who recreates his famous Paul Gasgoine " hand ball " manoeuvre and is quite menacing when silent ) only gets one line ; not because his inability to speak is integral to the plot but because his eloquent summing up of the film 's dubious morality after appearing mute the whole way through is funny . Allegedly . After he struggles through it in his " not - quite - acting - but - it'll - do " London drawl , Cage quips " I always thought you were from Long Island " . My ribs , as you might imagine , were well and truly tickled.<br /><br />In fact humour is the most undeveloped aspect , from the tactless comedy policeman to the two token black characters . This sees the biggest aspect of Hollywood take hold ; why is it that a black man can not appear in a major motion picture without being constantly aware of his skin tone and endlessly refer to it ? The younger man , who , like the elder , jive - talks for the whole duration , proclaims : " us black people do n't like the cold ... we 're tropical people " . He then goes on to express an urge to smoke a joint and watch Roots . He is , of course , parodying the image of black people , but how funny is that ? His older counterpart can not speak without referring to himself , and thereby his colour , in third person . " My black ass " this , " my black ass " that . Does anyone know any black people who actually speak like that ? Thought not.<br /><br />The film 's soundtrack is played almost non - stop and with increasing volume , some of the tracks - especially Apollo 440 's " Do n't Stop The Rock " - so loud they 're actually more audible than the sound effects and dialogue . The surroundsound system even separates the two to such a degree that it makes them sound like two different films running together . No background music concept here , it 's the aural equivalent of trying to watch a film while someone at the back of the cinema has their stereo turned up full blast . " Keep that music down , young man!" < br /><br />This is n't the worst film in the world and in many ways I enjoyed it . It 's just that it 's predictable , lazy and witless , with minimal effort in its construction . Apparently box office expectations are considerably down for this movie . After being force - fed junk for several years it appears the general public are starting to wake up to the fact .
0 This review may contain some spoilers.<br /><br />The remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie Gone in 60 Seconds begins well . Actually it is well acted and the plot moves quite well . But even a big Hollywood budget does n't change the fact that the original plot was more believable . For those who do n't know , the original plot had the thieves working as insurance inspectors . Who would suspect them . But even with a change to nearly every aspect of H.B. Halicki 's original , the remake is a very good movie , until we get to the final chase scene , the part of the 74 version that made it great . The one in this version is watered down , only 10 minutes , and it culminates in a monster special effect that takes all believability out of the chase . Where the original chase was very believable , the star was a stunt driver who did all his own stunt , the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes . My advice , if you want to watch a classic car chase film , fine the original in the bargain bin at your local rental joint and stay clear of the new remake .
0 Randall " Memphis " Raines is a retired master car thief who is forced back into the " game " when his younger brother faces death for not filling an order for British crime boss Raymond Calitri . The job involves " lifting " 50 cars in 24 hours or Calitri will enact his punishment . So Raines quickly assembles a crew he can trust and sets about the task to hand . But the police are on to him and some of the cars on the list are not easy takes . It would seem a near impossible job to complete.<br /><br />It 's got quite a cast has Gone In 60 Seconds , Nicolas Cage , Angelina Jolie , Robert Duvall , Will Patton , Delroy Lindo , Vinnie Jones , Giovanni Ribisi , Christopher Ecclestone , Scott Caan & Timothy Olyphant . All of whom deserve better . Enough acting horsepower there to propel a Porsche 998 Turbo . Trouble is , is that this is very much a case of too many cars overstocking the car park , mucho characters , not enough zest . From the off we are in no doubt that this is a Bruckheimer / Simpson production , bonkers script laced with loud noises and lashings of cheese , scattergun editing , and directed with sledgehammer subtly by Dominic Sena . It 's essentially a big budget remake of H.B. Halicki 's 1974 indie movie of the same name , with the premise offering up the potential for an adrenalin fuelled car based movie . Potential that sadly is never realised . There 's one or two high impact moments , daft for sure , but enjoyable none the less . But if you pardon the pun , the film never gets out of first gear , it 's more content to labour with its ream of characters who mope about trying to make the boorish screenplay { Scott Rosenberg } work.<br /><br />Car fans will get something from it { the cars are ace on the eye } , as will fans of unintentional comedy movies { check out Ecclestone 's carpenter grief moment}. But no , it 's really rather poor all told . 4/10
0 I watched this because I thought there were going to be a lot of car chases and cool cars to gawk at . Guess I was lied to . This movie is very boring.<br /><br />The movie starts out Kip Raines(Giovanni Ribisi ) sitting outside a Porsche dealership checking to see if they have the right car . When they confirm it 's the right one , Kip gets a brick out of the trunk and chucks it at the window , shattering it . He gets the Porsche while his friend gets the keys . They start up the car and take off into the night . They deliver it to a warehouse only to have been followed by the police . So , the whole crew ditches all the cars and go their separate ways . Then , we get a glimpse of Memphis Raines . He is giving a little speech to a bunch of kids at a go - kart track . Then , he is confronted by Atlee Jackson(Will Patton ) . Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is in deep * bleep*. Memphis is known as one of the most notorious car thieves in Los Angeles . Memphis heads to a junkyard and meets Raymond Calitri(Christopher Ecclesten ) . This guy threatens to kill Kip if Memphis does n't deliver 50 cars within 72 hours.<br /><br />There are a few problems with this film : < br /><br />1.Story : The first 48 in - movie hours take place when Cage and Duvall are looking for a crew and planning everything out . The last 12 in - movie hours are a waste ! < br /><br />2 . The Cars : You see maybe 10 cars out of the 50 as the movie advertises . So , where are the other 40 cars ? Why do n't we get to see them ? < br /><br />3 . The Chase : The chase at the end of the movie was a joke . It was not suspenseful at all.<br /><br />4 . The Dog : Somewhere in the movie , the dog eats the burgers and swallows three keys as well . This is impossible . The keys were flipped open . The keys would have severely damaged the dog 's esophagus , stomach , and large intestines . The guys suggest giving the dog laxatives to help him poop it out . This wo n't work . The dog will get a lot of diarrhea but no keys . It was stated in Jackass after Ryan Dunne stuck a toy car up his rectum . Take laxatives , lots of diarrhea , but no car . Same case with the dog.<br /><br />5 . The Cop During The Chase : When Eleanor breaks down for a few minutes , Nicholas Cage tries desperately to start up the car . You see a police cruiser behind him who is n't looking at his car at all . But , right when Nicholas Cage starts the engine up again , the police officer jerks his head to the right , sees the car , and immediately begins to chase after him . It is stupid . So , right when he heard the engine start , and saw the car , he knew that was the car he was looking for . How does he know it 's the right car ? He only sees the back of it.<br /><br />Overall , the movie is boring . There is no action . There are very few cars . The movie is stupid . I have never seen the original but I plan to.<br /><br />I give this movie 1 star out of 10 . Get The Fast and Furious instead .
0 The remake of H.B. Halicki 's classic seventies chase film is simply horrible . Along with Vanishing Point , Gone in 60 Seconds represent the quintessential car chase films . The remake takes the original and stands it on its head . Whereas Halicki gave us 75 % car chase and 25 % supporting drama , in GISS 2000 we get 25 % car chase and 75 % supporting drama . Cage as super man , saves his brother , kisses the girl . MTV edits , tits and ass . Save your money , rent the original . At least Halicki did n't live to see his baby ( he wrote , produced , directed , and starred in the ' 74 ' film ) degraded in this manner .
0 This was a horrible film ! I gave it 2 Points , one for Angelina Jolie and a second one for the beautiful Porsche in the beginning ... Other than that the story just plain sucked and cars racing through cities was n't so new in 1970 . The Happyend was probably what annoyed me the most , seldomly seen anything so constructed !
0 This movie shows us nothing original . Every idea or ( action ) scene can be found in many previously released movies . Fabulous Nick is completely plain here . Even Will Patton is calm and evil nor good . Mr. Duvall is ok , but has a very small part . So does Angelina , so how can we determine her newly acclaimed stardom ? Overall , there are too many characters , so that nobody and nothing is especially detailed . This makes the movie easy to forget . Too bad , do n't you think ?
0 1975 's MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE is an amazing and wonderful film to watch . This is n't because the fighting is particularly inspired or because the film makes any sense at all . It 's because the film is so silly and so over - the - top that it is a camp classic -- bad , but enjoyably bad . The film stars a blind guy who has a Frisbee - like device on a chain that chops off people 's heads as he expertly throws this at his foes ! Who cares that the physics are impossible or that the film features such silly things as fighters with 12 foot long papier - mache arms or that the guy was blind ! It 's just a ball to watch from start to finish -- and one of my favorite " bad " films and great to see with friends.<br /><br />Because of this film , I was eager to see THE FATAL FLYING GUILLOTINES ( 1977 ) , though sadly it turned out NOT to be a sequel but a bit of a knock - off -- taking many of the ideas from the original but neglecting to make the film as coherent or watchable . Sure , it 's silly fun , but it never comes close to MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE in entertainment value . Like the original film , there are these weird flying devices that sever heads , but they are quite different -- with circular saw blades and almost a mind of their own . There also is no blind guy but instead are a bunch of baddies who really have no depth nor does the audience understand exactly what 's occurring in this English - dubbed version , as the plot is completely incomprehensible . However , at the same time , some of the martial arts action is very good . While not up to the high standards of most Bruce Lee or Sonny Chiba films , the action is worthwhile despite the ludicrous and often confusing plot.<br /><br />Overall , this is a film that martial arts fans may like ( despite its many , many , many , many shortcomings ) , but also one that others will probably turn off or laugh hysterically at instead of enjoying the action because the film is just so ludicrous . BUT , most importantly , it never comes close to being as funny or watchable as MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE . Too bad .
0 Although there 's Flying Guillotines as part of the title of this movie , it has no connections to the original Flying Guillotines ( 1975 ) and its sequel Flying Guillotines II ( 1978 ) . The two originals are masterpieces of kung - fu movie and still stands out as a classic . This is a much inferior copy of the original , and even as a regular kung - fu movie , it 's below average.<br /><br />First of all , this movie does n't have much acting . It 's one senseless fight scene after another , and flying guillotine does n't even play a major part in them . Story is about some Shaolin monks who are tracking down some villains who 've took off with a sacred book , and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot . The same evil prince has plans to lure the monks in and use the flying guillotines on them.<br /><br />There are four movies with Flying Guillotine as part of its title . This in my opinion is of least quality . The design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three indicating that this movie was produced by a different entity from the other three.<br /><br />The movie has no chemistry asides from being unintentionally funny due to poor production . < br /><br />Best skip this and watch the two originals .
0 This movie got extremely silly when things started to happen . I could n't care less about any of the characters ; Susan Walters was so annoying , and the leading actor ( forget his name ) also got on my nerves . Ca n't quite remember how it ended and so forth but the whole idea of aliens possessing human bodies and all just seemed stupid in this film , things did n't quite carry off . My dad told me it 's s stupid movie ... I should 've listened to him .
0 I read the comment of Chris_m_grant from United States.<br /><br />He wrote : " A Fantastic documentary of 1924 . This early 20th century geography of today 's Iraq was powerful." < br /><br />I would like to thank Chris and people who are interested in Bakhtiari Nomads of Iran , the Zagros mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie Grass , A Nation 's battle for life . These traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life endures . I am from this region of Iran myself . I am a Bakhtiari . < br /><br />Chris , I am sorry to bother you but Bakhtiari region of Zardkuh is in Iran not in Irak as you mentioned in your comment . Iran and Irak are two different and distinct countries . Taking an Iranian for an Irankian is almost like taking an American for an Mexican . Thanks,<br /><br />Ziba
0 Documentary about nomadic Persians making a treacherous traverse of massive mountains to get their herds to grass . Watching this silent , black and white feature , marred in part by a twink - twink - twink Oriental music score that could not have been used in the original exhibition , is even duller than it sounds . The spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen , and there is an utter failure to establish any kind of plot line . I loved Nanook of the North and March of the Penguins , but despised this movie , notwithstanding the similarity of the theme . Physical hardships alone are just not that interesting .
0 The problem I find with this title is that I am not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie . A blend of the two genres just does n't work and that leaves the whole thing hung in the middle of nowhere . This is more so as the director has picked the most extremes of what is supposed to be happening around our everyday life making it an unconvincing documentary . If it is meant to be a thriller / drama this is too dull and monotonous . In either case , what is the moral or the message which the director is trying to convey to the audience ? That around us there are people who ill - treat others who are willing to be ill - treated ? That there are many crazy lunatics around us ? So .......... so what ?
0 This film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depths of the darkest side of human behaviour . Loosely linking a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravities , perverted sex , greed , violence and intolerance . All the action is played out over a few very hot and sticky days during a heatwave in Vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film . For me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode , closely followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the ' slags ' flat . You will be gripped and I hope horrified by this film . I hated it but I felt compelled to see it through . 1/10 for ' fun ' 8/10 for displaying ' man ' as he sometimes is .
0 This movie reminds me of " Irréversible ( 2002 ) " , another art - work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature . I did not like the movie but I can not say that it is a bad movie , it is just special . I reminds me also of " Camping Cosmos ( 1996 ) " where a bunch of low - class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in Belgium . The same description of people living together , side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match together . I also thought about the books by the French writer Emile Zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism . I did not like the movie and I also do not like the people who are in it . They all seem so vulgar , without any basic good taste . One could ask the question why do they live , they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce , forced to live against their will . Or you could say : the hell is on this world .
0 Earlier today I got into an argument on why so many people complain about modern films in which I encountered a curious statement : " the character development in newer movies just is n't nearly as good or interesting as it used to be . " Depending on the film(s ) in question , this can be attributed to a number of things , sometimes generic special effects and plot - driven Hollywood garbage like War Of The Worlds , but in the case of over - the - top , uninteresting attempts at social commentary and a desperate struggle to put " art " back into cinema , it 's movies like Dog Days that are to blame.<br /><br />I normally have a very high tolerance for movies , no matter how dull or pointless I find them ( ranging from good , long ones like Andrei Rublev and Dogville , to ones I 've considered painful to sit through a la Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West ) . I shut this movie off 45 minutes in , which is 30 minutes more than I actually should have . I was n't interested in any of the characters whatsoever and found nothing substantial beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism . In an attempt to say something about the dregs of society , this film too easily falls into being self - indulgent , trite , and exploitative in a very sincere sense . Granted , I 've seen many disturbing movies on the same subject , but there are so many better films out there about depressing , pathetic people ( Happiness , Gummo , Kids , Salo , Storytelling , Irreversible ) that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality . Dog Days had none more than an eighth grader 's distaste for society , choosing to ignore any true intelligence about the way people actually are , and instead choosing to be a dull , awful , and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of " art . " This is n't a characterization of the unknown or a clever observation into the dregs of society , it 's just boring and nothing worth caring about .
0 I once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck , such as Rambo 3 , Baise Moi , Deep Impact ) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded . Hundstage was a truly awful experience . Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a miserable , pathetic bunch of retards . It shows a world where love and humanity do n't exist , a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence . By choosing a documentary - like style with non - professional actors ( most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock - cartoonist Deix ) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian ( European ? Western ? ) suburbs . The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies , violence against women and handicapped people , madness and degradation . But this is n't social criticism . This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value . Instead you get bad acting , bad cinematography , bad filmmaking . If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes . This is pseudo - social criticism with a sledge hammer . And it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way . It shows ugly people - that is not the reason why I hate it . But it depicts average people in an ugly , misanthropic way . And this is why this film is truly despicable .
0 If you are looking for a film the portrays the pointless and boring existence of middle class lives caught in a web of non - communication and false ideals , then this is the film for you . If you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest , then you should probably look elsewhere . There are many films that do this far better . For example , try some of the darker films by Bergman . The Filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he should subject the viewer to one agonizingly dull and vacuous incident after another until the film finally comes to its tortuous and pathetic end . If you value your time there are far better ways to spend two hours , like cleaning your house , for example .
0 Fragmentaric movie about a couple of people in Austria during a heatwave . This kind of movie has been done more often , and most of all , better . The stories do n't really have anything to do with each other , apart from the pathetic finale : ' people are cruel ' . Ugly flesh , unpleasant people and a movie that goes on way too long without really making a point ... Ultra - realistic ? Hardly ... Boring ? Indeed . Not even gorgeous Franzisca Weiss can save this one ! 3/10
0 I did n't think it could be done , but something has come along and replaced Open House- a low budget horror about someone killing over the high price of real estate- as the worst film I 've ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet life.<br /><br />It was touted as the best film in Montreal 's most recent film festival , which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blank - wall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetry.<br /><br />Watching this movie was like a little slice of Hell . It 's from Austria , and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet- scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark underbelly . There 's the fat dog owner and his fat maid wife who stripteases for him , the skinny divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child , the über - annoying woman hitchhiker who recites top ten lists ... The list goes on . Forever . Much like the two hours plus I spent in that theatre.<br /><br />Yes , the characters interact , but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way . I could n't say if they were any good as actors , as , according to the subtitles , they were given lines that were the Austrian equivalent of " You are so lame ! " They certainly did n't have to learn many , as each repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scene.<br /><br />This is no Gummo , or any of the aforementioned movies . There is no art to discover , and nothing to dwell on afterwards except maybe whether or not you should change your " never walk out during a movie " policy ( which quite a few older couples did during a random orgy scene- and if that sounds appetizing , it 's not , unless you 're one of few who does n't find the idea of your parents having sex- and with a few local middle - aged couples , to boot- revolting).<br /><br />This movie was offensive to me . Not the flabby nudity , not the cringe - inducing soundtrack , not the shockless scenes involving guns . I was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding . I was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see Dog Days and come out wondering if that was the best us Montrealers could find . Most of all , I was offended that , somehow , the people involved with the festival duped everyone into believing that the emperor had a gorgeous and mesmerising new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat maid wife doing a striptease.<br /><br / >
0 What an appalling piece of rubbish ! ! ! Who ARE all these people who blubber on about how good this is ? Yes , it 's " arty " ; and yes , it 's " foreign " , but .... that 's not enough . The plot is boring and disjointed , like a reality show but not so slickly made.<br /><br />The people are intrinsically uninteresting ; but as characters they do n't have enough depth to feel empathy for them . If they are based on real people then I feel very , very sorry for them.<br /><br />The violence ( and some of it is very violent ) seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous . It 's like the producer has visions of being Quenton Tarantino . Not that I think very much of him , either.<br /><br />And oh yes : if I had neighbours like these , I 'd move !
0 This movie sucks ass . Something about a heatwave in some European country , complete trash . There 's nothing going for this movie whatsoever . maybe 30 seconds of sex but that 's it . There is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off . This movie is complete rash and you should n't subject yourself to watching it . I regret it it 's very boring . I would rate it zero but i ca n't . No body in their right mind should see this . i 'm sure you 'll regret it completely i did . How could they think up something this bad . Even Mystery men was better . MYSTERY MEN . That sucks . That movie was n't worth being made . complete waste of time . The characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored .
0 Despite being a huge fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers ' movies , it was n't until about 6 years ago that I first saw ' Follow the Fleet ' . I knew all the songs from an old Astaire / Rogers record ( yes , vinyl ) but knew nothing of the plot.<br /><br />Unfortunately , while the songs are catchy and Ginger Rogers ' character is sweet and funny , you just ca n't like ' Bake Baker ' . While trying to make up to his longtime partner , he continually sabotages her career . His character does n't have the usual humour and elan of the other films ' Astaire characters.<br /><br />Worth watching for the songs and a great solo tap routine by Ginger Rogers .
0 It 's hard to believe that this is a sequel to Henry Fool . Hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies . While Henry Fool is refreshing , witty , comical , Fay Grim is slow , boring , and does n't go anywhere . Where has the wit gone ? I am baffled.<br /><br />It is 10 years since I saw Henry Fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory . Fay Grim is painful to watch . This is no fault of the actors , who are good ( Parker Posey ) or great ( Jeff Goldblum ) -- the blame lies entirely with the plot , the dialog , and even some of the filming ( low budget is no excuse ) . A huge disappointment . < br /><br />Sorry I could n't pay attention to the plot , I was so bored , so disappointed ... if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy Henry Fool so much ... the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other ... there is no continuity in the characters ' personalities ... it 's all a fraud to entice fans of Henry Fool to watch the sequel.<br /><br />I'm switching this off now -- Henry in some sort of jail with a Taliban ? ! ? !
0 I say ' I 'd figure ' in that line because , frankly , I 've not seen a Hal Hartley movie until now . It 's not that I have n't heard of him though , as he was seen as one of those small NY filmmakers ( when I say small I mean even smaller than Jim Jarmusch ) , who made ultra - personal projects on limited budgets . In an ironic way , much as with Pasolini 's Salo , though in a slightly different context , Fay Grim interests me to see some of Hartley 's more acclaimed features , because there seems to be at least present some semblance of talent behind it , as if Hartley * could * be a very good filmmaker who may be so good he 's just taken a big experimental blunder . Or , on the other hand , he could just be someone far too impressed with his own idiosyncrasies and would - be Godard - like cinematic collisions.<br /><br />I ca n't quite explain the story , which may or may not be a problem I suppose , however it 's not really in due to not having seen the film that preceded Fay Grim , Henry Fool . I think even if I had that experience it would n't make too much of a difference based on the final results . There 's a lot of international espionage , a double plot wrapped inside of another that 's fallen through the fake pockets of the title character , played in an aloof way by Parker Posey ( not sure if that 's good or bad either , maybe both ) , and also involving a CIA operative ( Jeff Goldblum , as usual a solid presence amid the mania , even conjuring some laughs ) , not to mention an orgy - laden picture box , and author Henry Fool . It 's not that the script is totally impenetrable , however much it goes into over - extended loopholes just for the sake of it , because there are some touches of witty or affectingly strange dialog.<br /><br />Quite simply , the direction just sucks . Harltey is in love with the Third Man , which is fine , but he imposes a consistently headache inducing style of everything being tilted in angle , with characters having to get into frame equally oddly . Not since Battlefield Earth , in fact , has a director come off so annoyingly in trying to make the unnecessary choice of titled angles for some bizarre dramatic effect , only this time Hartley is n't amid a cluster - f * * * , he 's mostly responsible for it . This , along with the crazy wannabe Godard title - cards that pop in here and there , some a little amusing and some just totally stupid , and the montage segments all in still shots , AND a couple of moments involving action that almost call to mind Ed Wood , undermine any of the potential that is in the script , which is already fairly hard to decipher . In a way , it 's fascinating to watch how bad this all goes , but a kind of fascination that comes in seeing the flip - side to total creative control on a sort - of small - scale story.<br /><br />But let it be known : you 'll likely not come across a more wretchedly pretentious example of American independent film - making this year .
0 I have n't seen " Henry Fool " , but after watching " Fay Grim " I 'm not sure I want to . Maybe Hartley aims to be the " anti - thriller " director --- he sure succeeded with this yawner . Based on the official description --- woman discovers that her dead husband 's manuscript contains material that could pose a threat to national security --- I expected a taut geopolitical drama . Instead I got flimsy structure , goofy dialog , flabby characterizations , a convoluted plot , and a " tone " that shifts so often it suggests that Hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time . I can hang for a long time with a frustrating , hard - to - follow plot ( e.g. " Duplicity " ) because I figure that the loose ends eventually will come together . Even when they do n't , or they do but they leave lingering questions ( e.g. " Duplicity " ) , sharp writing and acting can hold one 's interest . But half - way through " Fay Grim " I reached a deadly realization --- I did n't know what was going on , and I did n't care . Too bad , because I really like Parker Posey , reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent , estranged wife and indifferent , clueless mother to tough , shrewd international " player " capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists . There 's also bad casting . Jeff Goldblum can be very good , but he 's not capable of overcoming miscasting as a CIA operative . He looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as I was watching him in it . His CIA sidekick is worse ; he looks like a refugee from the quarterfinals of " American Idol " ( are there really young CIA agents with big licks of hair rakishly draped over their foreheads ? ) . Then there 's the sticky question of the characters ' ages . Goldblum was 54 when he made " Fay Grim " ; Thomas Jay Ryan , who plays " Henry Fool " , was 44 . Neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages . Yet , a key point in the story is that they served as CIA agents in Nicaragua " back in the ' 70s . " Goldblum 's character would 've been in his 20s then ; Henry Fool would 've been a teenager . Was Hartley being " quirky " or lazy ? The problems are too numerous to list ...
0 This is a low - budget spoof of the espionage genre . To help frame your expectations , you should know that : ( 1 ) The acting is wildly heavy - handed . The stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement , frequent hand gestures , and off - key pacing . ( 2 ) The script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility . Oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements . ( 3 ) Shots are frequently framed in off - balance angles , poking fun at genre excesses . ( 4 ) A pop - eyed Jeff Goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic manner.<br /><br />The film has a guiding intelligence , deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the B - films of the 1930 's : a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by Carl Sagan . The film 's over - the - top acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes . In an early running gag , Fay Grim 's son Ned is so frequently told to leave that you ca n't help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad . Parker Posey 's nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the film.<br /><br />The film 's slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge . The film 's impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy . Moreover , it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic . The musical score is intentionally heavy handed , and I found this ( and the off - kilter camera angles ) more irritating than humorous.<br /><br />The over - the - top acting , the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of conspiracies / counter conspiracies , and the slow pacing will grind on many viewers . The movie is much too long at 158 minutes.<br /><br />That said , fans who are receptive to the film 's sarcasm might want to watch again ... using closed captioning to best catch the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog . The film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavy - handed than light - hearted . But , the comedy may well appeal to your tastes . The film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films , fans of director Hal Harley , or devotees of Parker Posey ( who has the most camera time ) .
0 First off , I really loved Henry Fool , which puts me in a very small pool of movie goers . Parker Posey is one of best actresses on - screen today . But this film was a full - out travesty . Watching Hartley and the actors talk about the film in the extras - so full of pride , and making pointless analogies to Star Wars - was stomach - turning . This was hype on the producers part ( HDNET ) realized to the max . A true example of the Emperor and his new clothes . Mostly I feel that Hal has spoiled HENRY FOOL forever . I do n't think I can ever see it again in it 's pure , innocent light.<br /><br />Remember Hal , you can FOOL some of the people some of the time ... etc . The director would be nowhere today if all he did was churn out meaningless garbage . Sadly , it 's a pure example of the lesson taught in the film ADAPTATION . The story must be exciting and active , or its box - office hopes are dim indeed . Never mind a decent story . For the actors , it was like trying to act in a straitjacket.<br /><br />The score , I believe Hartley 's , is tasteless . With drum hits walking all over dialog . There was one Apple Soundtrack loop I recognized that gave me a smile.<br /><br />When I saw the trailer , I thought , oh , they 're just trying to grab a new audience . But it 's really this ridiculous ride . I 'd be happy to spoil this movie for you , but it 's been done . It 's rotten . The FOOL franchise is dead . Long live Henry Fool .
0 I have been a fervent Hal Hartley supporter since I saw his short " Surviving Desire " in high school , and even then was still completely unmoored by his searingly brilliant " Henry Fool . " But this 10-year - later sequel is not only unnecessary , it 's disgraceful.<br /><br />After a choppy and expeditious start , " Fay Grim " devolves into pseudo - intellectualism , flat out boredom , and finally unwarranted - and unwanted - nihilism . And that 's just the plot.<br /><br />The majority of the new faces are as frivolous and poorly - developed as the movie : one particularly flat character ends up hogging half the time we spend with the infamous Henry Fool himself , and it 's his only spoken scene in the film!<br /><br />Jeff Goldblum 's Agent Fulbright , it seems , is the only bright character ( a pun surely intended by Hartley as well ) . How , then , is he left ? * * SPOILER * * Dead via a car bombing , easily making this the gentle - natured Hartley 's most violent film to date , and tonally all wrong in a film that 's already all wrong from the word go.<br /><br />As for the other new characters , Angus James , Ned Fool ( or is it Grim ? ) , not to mention Fay herself ... well , I wo n't spoil their fates , as the movie does a good enough job of that all on its own ( when it is n't busying itself with yet another godawful canted angle , which gives the disconcerting impression that Hartley is moving backwards from Auteur to crappy film student).<br /><br />This piece is a complete disaster , a dreadful mess that is n't even good - humored enough to revel in its messiness . Instead it self - indulgently crams the typically fun hipster pretenses of its director into the " real world " , one uglier and meaner than it need be but not nearly ugly or mean enough to come close to having anything to say . In doing so , Hartley tracks sh*t all over my memories of these people and the marvelous world he originally created for them.<br /><br />I have rarely been so depressed at the movies , and I 'm counting " Leaving Las Vegas , " which at least developed fresh new characters we grew to love before destroying them , instead of immediately disregarding characters already beloved.<br /><br />Grim , indeed .
0 You MUST be kidding ! ! ! ! Let 's entertain the possibility that Parker Posey is really an actress , and not just some entry in the " quirk of the month club " of actors . Really , unless this is meant to be a tongue - in - cheek satire on David Mamet-- terse , confusing dialog delivered alternately in machine gun rapidity or monotone ( think Ben Stein ) blandness -- or a flat out dry comedy ; this film has got to be in the running for a Rotten Tomato Award --- or worse.<br /><br />As if the stiff and uncomfortable Posey were n't enough , we 've got the stiffer and even more uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum . There 's more wood in this film than a toothpick factory.<br /><br />Adding to this already bizarre casting , are several other roles , all populated by forgettable actors , who look or sound like escapees from America 's Next Top Model , Don Pardo , or even the kid , who pronounces the word " been " like " bean " , which just brings our attention to the fact that there is so little to like about this film , we are analyzing his accent to guess if he 's Canadian or not ! ! I think I laughed heartily in places that are supposed to be serious , and took seriously sections that are meant to be humorous . Even the soundtrack sounds like a caricature of Alarik Jans music for Mamet 's " The House of Games " . If taken as a spoof , the film is almost droll ; if taken seriously , just a self - conscious piece of drek .
0 BE WARNED . This movie is such a mess . It 's a catastrophe . Do n't waste your time with this one . I warned you!<br /><br />The acting , story , dialogue , music ... basically everything is so over the top , it 's absolutely annoying and ridiculous . It made me want to throw up ( if the dialogue / acting / story was n't doing it , it 's everyone being shot crooked ) . You 'll feel like you 're watching a comedy . The problem is , the parts that are supposedly funny is n't even funny . The acting , story , cinematography , you can feel everything is just trying WAAAAY too hard -- but it never succeeds . Practically every shot is canted , but so what ? ! This movie just feels like a student film . No wonder they shot this in HD because it would be a waste to spend more money to shoot this on film.<br /><br />If you 're easily amused or like poor acting , writing , editing , directing , full of clichés , everything that 's forced in your face , oh and did I mention poor acting ? ( well , actually , it 's not all the actor 's fault - it 's the director ! ) then I guess you 'll like this movie.<br /><br />I had to watch this for a class . I would have turned it off right away if I could . If you still ca n't tell by now , I HATED this movie . It made me want to throw up and get my time back ... at least I did n't have to pay for this garbage.<br /><br />Jeff Goldblum , you know ... the guy from Jurassic Park / Independence Day , is in this movie but he sure went downhill from then -- accepting roles for movies like this catastrophe .
0 Despite the lavish production numbers and wonderful costumes this film is a chore to watch . The murder - mystery plot is just a vehicle to mount the musical numbers on but it often brings the proceedings to a staggering halt besides not being very involving . Although there has obviously been a lot of money spent on them the numbers are badly staged and poorly photographed . It 's obviously a pre - code film because the girls often wear very little clothing and there 's even a song singing the praises of marijuana ! The performances are all one - note although it 's nice to see Carl Brisson in a musical but when Victor McLaglen , as the police Lieutenent , lurches into view for the umpteenth time on the hunt for clues , you may want to throw in the towel or at least fast - forward to the next number . Pity the patrons who were trapped in the cinema on its release though !
0 I used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters , but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap . If you look at promotional pictures / posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging / kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime . This proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing Police drama to an average type of television soap . When i watch it i feel like I 'm watching a police version of Coronation Street or something similar . I have to say i still like the bill as I 'm interested in Police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that The Bill used to have . I want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over.<br /><br />As for the script and characters they have both gone downhill , most of the great characters are gone now ( although a few still remain i think ) and I 'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely are n't , its just that they lack the tough looks , personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble.<br /><br />Overall being one of the only Police programs on television these days , The Bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch , but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness ( if that s the right spelling ) and would now be classed as a terrible , unreal television soap.<br /><br />Recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved - 2/10
0 Veteran sleazeball Bruno Mattei is at it again with this erotic thriller that clearly echoes Joel Schumacher 's 8MM . But , as expected , Mattei does his movie on a minuscule budget - so that it already looks obscure when it 's newly released.<br /><br />After her daughter gets abducted , a mother enters the dark world of underground pornography , because the kidnappers belong to an international organization that direct snuff films as long as the exclusive clients pay well . The search for her daughter does not only lead the mother across Europe , but also into prostitution . She goes to bed with some guys to get her clues . When she finally reaches contact with the snuff organization lead by the mysterious Doctor Hades , she 's getting into great danger herself.<br /><br />There is not much good to say about this one , even though it starts promising . Problem is that the movie is by far not as sleazy or explicit as one might expect from the director who made films like BLADE VIOLENT . SNUFF TRAP ( which was first released in Russia ! ) is neither gory enough nor does it contain the amount of nudity and sex to really keep the viewer 's attention . The plot is n't that special either , except maybe for the surprisingly many different locations throughout Europe . The ending is hugely disappointing . The acting is n't really remarkable either , except for Anita Auer who plays Doctor Hades : She looks and acts extremely creepy . You do n't want to meet her like this in a dark alley ( or Your bedroom , for that matter).<br /><br />All in all , SNUFF TRAP only appeals to collectors of Bruno Mattei 's films . But it 's good to see the man back on the helm again : It was his first thriller since 1994 's giallo GLI OCCHI DENTRO .
0 This film is terrible . Every line is stolen from 8MM ( the Italian dubbed version , at least ) . If you like trash ... real trash , give it a try ; but beware : this ai n't the " so bad it 's good " kind of flick . In its cheapness , it may really look like a porno but , believe me , if you 're looking for " snuff " , s & m , hardcore , softcore ... or even an ordinary erotic thriller , go find something else in store ! I 'm telling you this , 'cause the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing shooting , acting , plot , dialogues ( the only good lines , as I said before , are the ones they stolen from Joel Schumacher 's 8MM ! ) will bore you to tears in a few minutes and the " happy ending " is absolutely revolting ! I 'll give it one star : a half for the sudden shot in the back scene , after " the eyes of the victim " monologue ( stolen from 8MM as well ) and a half for mom & daughter 's sexy bodies ( that did n't manage to keep me completely awake while watching this turkey , anyway ! )
0 Unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there 's nothing to spoil about that movie . Even if B. Mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun Eurotrash director . But for the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it . This film is just empty , nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 min . No sex , no blood(it 's suppose to be about snuff?),no actors , no dialogs , just as bad as an 90'T.V film . It 's even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics . So Rest in peace Bruno , you will stay in our minds forever anyway , thanks to such unforgettable gems as : Zombi 3 , Robowar , Rats , l'altro inferno , Virus , Cruel jaws and few others . So except if you want to see B Mattei possessed by jess Franco 's spirit 's new film , pass on this one . But if you do n't know this nice artisan 's career track down his old films and have fun .
0 A cheap exploitation film about a mothers search for her daughter who has been kidnapped by people who make snuff porno films . The trail leads the mother all over Europe as she searches for her child and we in the audience struggle to stay asleep.<br /><br />This is one of the countless soft - core sleaze films that are made for people who want the excitement of porno with out the stigma or danger of it showing up on their credit card bill . Personally I 'd rather have the stigma since those films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we 're seeing . This is suppose to be a sexy thriller but its not . Mostly its people talking about things followed by lots of walking from place to place and lead to lead . Periodically through out the film various people get undressed and everything has more than a touch of S&M to the proceedings . The violence and fetish material is of the sort to provoke laughter rather than horror or even excitement , its all so incredibly fake . Worse there is not even enough nudity to keep it interesting . ( Basically par for the course for many of these films)<br /><br />You'll forgive my lack of details but it simply is a dull boring film that I stayed with to the end hoping for something remotely prurient to occur , but there was nothing . The most interesting thing was the blonde haired villainess with the huge over bite and nose the size of a Buick . I watched her with morbid fascination wondering what she had looked like as a young girl and wondering whether she had had plastic surgery , not the type of things you should be thinking about in a gripping thriller.<br /><br />Avoid .
0 Well what can I say , there are B - Grade Movies and there are B - Grade Movies and this definitely falls into the latter . However since it 's obvious that even the makers of the film know that it 's not a credible movie ( take a look at the closing credits ) it can be forgiven.<br /><br />The plot is basically a convicted psycho killer is killed . He accidentally has his genetic material mixed up with some experimental acid that get combined and then lost in the snow . The killer now takes on the form of a snowman - if you can believe that . The snowman , Jack Frost , is after the country town Sherif who put him behind bars . In doing so , Jack Frost ends up killing half the town.<br /><br />This movie lacks any real scares and the effects alone remind me of the B - Grade movies of the 50 's . This alone makes it worth watching for a laugh . A movie to pass the time away .
0 I may not be a critic , but here is what I think of this movie . Well just watched the movie on cinemax and first of all I just have to say how much I hate the storyline I mean come on what does a snowman scare besides little kids , secondly it is pretty gory but I bet since the movie is so low budget they probably used ketchup so MY CRITICAL VOTE IS BOMB ! ! ! nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much .
0 and this movie has crossed it . I have never seen such a terrible movie in my life ! I mean , a kid 's head getting cut off from the force of an empty sled ? A snowman with a costume that has the seams clearly visible ? This was a pitiful excuse for a movie .
0 It 's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn - off for bored audiences . It 's the terrible direction with a horrible script and mistakes left and right that makes this too agonizing to watch . I 'm sorry but I do not see the ' fun ' in this . Just the thrill of pointing the many mistakes and stupid one - liners . Well I 'm wondering how dumb the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced . Probably as dumb as that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound . Oops ! Did I forget to mention this sheriff 's not only a poor actor but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh ? I guess he kind of forgot when he won a not - so - thrilling victory over the snowman .
0 You know what kind of movie you 're getting into when the serial killer main character is being transported to the electric chair ( in what seems to be a bakery truck ) , only to have the prison vehicle collide with ( and I 'm not making this up ) a genetic engineering tanker truck . The goo which spurts forth melts him , and fuses his DNA with the snow , creating our protagonist , the killer snowman.<br /><br />My favorite portion of the movie , however , is an over - the - shoulder shot of the snowman thrashing some poor schmuck , in which his hands look suspiciously like a couple of white oven - potholder gloves.<br /><br />Mmmmm , schlock ...
0 The 1998 Michael Keaton kiddie comedy of the same title was roundly condemned for it 's , um , shoddy special effects , but compared to what Screaming Mad George cooked up for this horror comedy they 're positively mind - boggling . The killer snowman seems to be made out of styrofoam and his arms look like oversized oven mitts . Which they probably were . The cast lays it on thick in this parody of dozens of other ( much worse ) movies and Paul Keith as the town doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role .
0 Boy this movie had me fooled . I honestly thought it would be a campy horror film with absolutely no humor in it whatsoever , boy I got the cold shoulder that time . This movie was , and I 'm truthful , pretty damn good . It was not scary at all but the campiness and the sly humor really mad this movie interesting . Some to the horrible acting and cliché killings were so painful to watch , I almost laughed at how bad it was , but to some extent I enjoyed it . The killings all vaguely relate to snow sports and Christmas , which made things more intriguing . The POV camera angles were awesome.<br /><br />The movie is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison . He is later resurrected in that very same chemical with snow spliced into the mixture . These were the ingredients chosen to make the perfect killer snowman . He than takes his revenge , as the snowman , on the police officer who convicted him.<br /><br />This movie had such bad acting , with the exception of Christopher Allport , that is was funny . I will say that I am also pretty disappointed that this movie was not a horror , but in fact a dark sitcom . They had a great story with a good plot but it was n't executed right . All in all I like the movie at first but now it is really annoying . But this movie is way better and darker than the sequel .
0 A serial killer dies in a snowstorm and gets mutated into Frosty the Snowman 's evil twin . Then goes on a killing spree . Interesting plot . Sounds scary . And it is scary . If you 're five years old . Otherwise , it 's kind of cheesy . I saw it on cable and I 'm glad I did n't pay money to see it . It has all the charm and style of a low - budget movie which may become a cult film . I 'm sure it has a loyal fan base somewhere . I 'm just not in it . Even though I did n't like the movie as a whole , there were some scenes I found amusing . Such as the bathtub scene and the post - explosion scene with the Picasso reference . It was also enjoyable to watch the many ways the heroes try to kill Jack and he just does n't seem to want to die . In short , " Jack Frost " is a good low - budget B - movie comedy , but a bad low - budget B - movie horror .
0 Jack Frost , no kids it 's not the warm hearted family movie about a dad who comes back from the dead in the form of a snow man . It 's about a sadistic killer named Jack Frost who is sprayed with some acid fluid and is morphed into a killer snow man . I happened to catch a copy of this movie so I could have a nice sit back and laugh at it . A killer snow man ? Ha , sounds like the perfect comedy / horror movie ! Well I was wrong , very wrong.<br /><br />Jack Frost is about a killer who is being transported via truck to jail so he could fry in the chair at midnight . But it 's a snowy night and it collides with a government tanker carrying a new DNA fluid . Jack escapes only to be burnt to death by the acid and morphs into a killer snowman . He returns to the small town of Snowmonton where he was caught by a small time sheriff . Here he is ready to kill again , now as a snow man with cooler powers . He can condense into water , shoot out ice cycles as spears , and grow killer fangs . The only question is , who can stop Frost ? This movie is below the typical B - Movie line . The movies begins cheesy but as soon as Jack is burned by the acid , it quickly drops below the cheese line and goes flat . The acting for one is appalling ! Here we have a whole cast of unheard of actors who either ca n't act , can act but has a pointless character , or is just here for a few extra bucks . The only good actor is Scott MacDonald who plays Jack . He looks like a young Richard Kiel combined with Frankenstein . Sadly his appearance is only reduced to three minutes and all we ever see of him is his new snow man form and his wise cracking voice . Plus his wisecracks are anything but funny . Groaning , stupid , and bad.<br /><br />The plot is horrible ! Throughout history there have been numerous murderers . A killer in a hockey mask , a killer with a razer glove , a chainsaw wielding moron , a rapid St. Bernard , but now we stoop to a tacky killer snow man ? Oh come on ! And the way the characters are introduced are terrible . For one I really wanted Jack to kill the sheriffs son , I mean giving his dad oats with Antifreeze in them so they wo n't freeze ? All the characters are dumb and pointless and the deaths are to cartoony . One woman in strangled with Christmas lights and has her head smashed into a decoration box and a girl is humped to death in the shower ( where is the carrot in that scene eh?).<br /><br />And to top of this horrible movie is the special effects . The first big special effect we have is Jack 's DNA mixing in with snow and boy is it terrible . I mean it looks like a 60 's fashion of art design , PU ! Jack looks fake as well . He looks like a person covered with rubber snow man skin . All the blood and gore is cheesy and the film never takes off with greatness but instead stoops to low levels.<br /><br />Jack Frost is one of the worst slasher movies ever made . I thought it would be a riot but no ! It does n't try to be funny and it actually tries to be scary . Jack Frost gets 4 out of 10 , it at least made me laugh from it 's awfulness . Do n't even bother with this piece of trash . Jack Frost= D+
0 I am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie ! Jack Frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by A - pix entertainment , and without exception , everything this company deals with is pure crap ! First , and this is very important , never ever watch this movie sober ! Why would you ? Unlike many other entertaingly bad movies , this one I feel was made intentionally bad . I just ca n't get over how fake the snowman is , which is why its always shown only briefly , the way it moves is the best ! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than the Michael Keaton piece of crap , becuz that was made too be a good movie , and that version is as bad as this .
0 This is the crappiest film I have ever seen but in all fairness it 's watchable and rather funny . I do n't think the film - makers intended it to be your typical Hollywood blockbuster quality . It 's just a stupid film about a serial killer who gets doused in a load of toxic waste causing a reaction with him and the snow ( as it 's the middle of winter ) . He then turns into a killer snowman which is enough to to make you laugh on it 's own . This film is really stupid but it 's funny . The killings are hilarious . I would n't advise you to go and buy it ( like I did -the cover looked good!)but if it happens to be on TV one night and you 're up for a laugh then stick it on .
0 THis movie may be the worst movie I have ever seen . Basically it is right above Leprachaun 5 , the only difference is that it missing Ice T. The scene where he does the chick with the carrott ... priceless . Oh yeah they made a second one , genius
0 This movie , no correction , this THING , this abysmal abomination from the burning pits of hell should have been killed before it even left the writer 's head . I could not possibly come up with enough adjectives to describe this movie . But let 's try anyway . Horrible , bad , nauseating , tasteless , crap , vomit inducing , gut wrenchingly bad , hideous , nasty , putrid , there just are n't enough words in the English language ! The " plot " involves a serial killer who becomes a snow man . Do n't ask how , not important . The killer snowman runs about killing people . How , you may ask , can a snowman kill someone ? In tasteless ways that make you want to remove your eyes if only so you do n't have to endure that Styrofoam snowman anymore . In ways that make you want to fill your ears with hot wax so you do not have to endure his snow puns anymore . Do n't watch this movie ! Destroy it on sight ! For the sake of your very soul do n't watch it !
0 Whoever made this movie must have done it as a joke . I mean , this was the stupidest movie I think I have ever seen ! ! A killer snowman terrorizes a small town ? Give me a break . Love it when he takes off driving the cop car . More like a comedy than a horror movie . If you want a laugh , rent this . If you truly want a horror movie , stay the hell away from this one ! !
0 A " friend " , clearly with no taste or class , suggested I take a look at the work of Ron Atkins . If this is representative of his oeuvre , I never want to see anything else by him . It is amateurish , self - indulgent , criminally shoddy and self - indulgent rubbish . The " whore mangler " of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of hookers . There is a little nudity and some erections , but no single element could possibly save this from the hangman 's noose . The lighting is appalling , the dialog is puerile and mostly shouted , and the direction is clueless . I saw a doco on American exploitation filmmakers during the recent Fangoria convention . Atkins was one of those featured . He spoke like there was something important about his work , but after a viewing of this , I see nothing of any import whatsoever . There is no style , either , and the horrible video effects ( like solarization ) only enhance the amateurishness . Not even so bad it 's fun . Avoid .
0 Director Ron Atkins is certifiably insane . This ultra - low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one Harry Russo ( John Giancaspro , who also co - wrote ) , a nut - job who receives a Rubberneck doll from his bitch girlfriend . He starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs , rape and kill , not always in that order . What starts off as being a balls - to - the - wall exploitation film , well stays like that , but it gets VERY repetitive VERY fast . I 'm leaning more toward the certifiably insane . It IS hard to forget once seen though . Kinda like if Tom Green ever did a horror film.<br /><br />My Grade : F < br /><br />Eye Candy : Laurie Farwell gets fully nude ; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and bush < br /><br />ANTI - eye candy : seeing John completely naked repeatedly
0 I was interested to see the move thinking that it might be a diamond in the rough , but the only thing I found was bad writing , horrible directing ( the shot sequences do not flow ) even though the director might say that that is what he is going for , it looks very uninspired and immature ) the editing could have been done by anyone with 2 VCRs and the stock was low budget video . I would say that it was n't even something as simple as mini digital video . < br /><br />There are some simple ways to fix a film with what the director has , like through editing etc . But it is obvious that he just does n't care . There is as much effort put in to this movie as a ham sandwich . It could be made better , but that would mean extra work .
0 There are bad movies , then there are the movies that are SO bad , that they become almost art . This is one of those films . My partner and I are still both kind of shell shocked , you know , staring off into space and drooling ! You can tell that the people involved ( I hope they changed their names to protect themselves ) were having a blast , and they definitely were n't shy . I give this one a three out of ten just because of the gratuitous smut and REALLY bad gore effects . I laughed out loud during most of the movie , so I guess you could say that it showed me a good time . Beware viewer , the above words in no way construe that this is a good film , because it is not . All I can say in my defense , is that it was impossible to pass up a movie with such a GREAT title !
0 SCHIZOPHRENIAC : THE WHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens when you get a bunch of untalented people together to make an " extreme " horror film . Any sort of acting , production , storyline , FX , etc ... go out the window in an effort to create " shock - value " . Now do n't get me wrong - I consider myself a connoisseur of " shock " films , and the sleazier / gorier / nastier the better - but it 's still nice to see SOME sort of talent from SOMEONE involved in the film.<br /><br />SCHIZOPHRENIAC chronicles the life of Harry Russo - a drug - addicted freak - show who takes orders to kill from his ventriloquist 's dummy , Rubberneck . He goes on a few sprees killing hookers and other random people , and screaming about how much he hates " hoo - uhs " ( that 's " whores " for those of you that do n't speak New York - ese ... ) and how he wants to rape them in the ass . There are a few weak necrophilia scenes , very little gore , and some nudity to mix things up a bit - but nothing that you have n't seen in a better film ... <br /><br />The only redeeming thing that I can find in this retarded film are the often ( unintentionally ? ) hilarious screaming - fits from our main man , Harry . He goes on - and - on - and - on about wanting to kill everyone and do them in the ass , and it really becomes quite comical after a while . In fact , I 'm almost tempted to believe that there 's supposed to be some sort of homo - erotic undertone to this film , with all the ass talk and constant shots of Harry running around with his dong hangin ' out . In all honesty , that joker is nekkid more in this film then the few chicks that show some T - and - A ( and some full - frontal , for good measure ) . SCHIZOPHRENIAC is mildly amusing as a 1-time watch , but I can really only recommend this to those that want to be able to say that they watched a film called SCHIZOPHRENIAC : THE WHORE MANGLER . To be honest - the title , by far - is the best thing about this trash ... A generous 3.5/10
0 Well , I like to be honest with all the audiences that I bought it because of Kira 's sex scenes , but unfortunately I did not see much of them . All sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other B movies - it just does n't look much like two people having sex . There is a tiny bit of plot toward the end - Kira 's new lover is a killer . Whoa ! ! ! how shocking ! ! ! Why do n't we nominate this movie for Oscar Award ? I ca n't imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were R - rated ( Mine is imported from UK , rated 18 ) . Conclusion ? Put it down and walk away , so yon wo n't end up with being a moron like me.<br /><br />Score : 2/10
0 Losing Control is another offering in the erotic thriller genre which could be considered as the pulp fiction of the film world . Usually , they involve a roundabout route to murderous intent , interspersed with copious disrobing . This is not a complaint , especially when it is done by the stunningly beautiful women who invariably inhabit this make - believe world.<br /><br />Kim Ward ( Kira Reed ) is suffering a bout of writer 's block . Just by chance , ( or is it ? ) she meets a man ( Doug Jeffery ) who engages with her in ever more risky sexual encounters . The man refuses to divulge any information about himself , yet Kim steadfastly refuses to stop the affair . Her agent , Alexa ( Anneliza Scott ) thinks it will do wonders for her book sales . As in most films of this type , the denouement comes near the end but some things do not add up . I have seen enough of this kind of film to think , no change there , then - but I like them . They are so undemanding.<br /><br />Performances of the cast vary . Doug Jeffery carries the film as the psycho / sociopath you do not want to cross . Kira Reed looks good but fails to convince as the woman in peril . Clay Greenbush as the PI did not convince either.<br /><br />Finally , a note of caution about the DVD under review . Both the cover and the disc state R - rated and running time as 93 minutes but the run time is less than 86 minutes . This probably explains why the sex scenes appear truncated and why Jennifer Ludlow 's performance is cut short just as she 's getting started . 4 stars .
0 Personally I think this show looks pretty cheaply made . Some of the actors are terrible . They over do it & seem fake . I can always tell how it 's going to end within the first 10 minutes or less of watching because they make it so transparently clear . It 's not very well written either . I love to watch it to laugh at it . You know the saying " It 's so bad that it 's good ? " Well , that saying applies to this show . I also like to watch just to see if I 'm right when I guess how it 's all going to end . So far I 've been right every time . It 's like a little game that I play . It 's nice when you are bored & you feel like laughing at something .
0 Wow . Simply awful . I was a fan of the original movie , and begrudgingly sat through part 2 , 3 was and improvement . 4,5 and Freddy 's Dead were pretty bad . But NOTHING is as bad as Freddy 's Nightmares . Freddy acts as a Rod Serlingesq host of this anthology series.<br /><br />I can accept how Freddy became one punchline after another , but at least in the movies the appeal of Freddy carried the movies , but here these were so poorly made , they looked like high school productions of a horror series . The poor actors , if you really want to call yourself that after doing this show were obviously exactly what they paid for . I 'm nearly certain this was a stopping point for two types of actors . Ones just starting on the Hollywood ladder , brand new willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week , or seasoned actors on their way down the Hollywood ladder willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week.<br /><br />I half expected Dana Plato to guest star , but she was already dead by the time this was in production.<br /><br />To paraphrase Nancy 's line in the original Elm St,"What ever you do try not to fall asleep watching this . "
0 This is my first movie review on IMDb . I was forced to register after watching this movie . I can not in good conscience allow this movie to be unreviewed by me . The people must be warned!<br /><br />First of all , my rating is : 0 ( as in " zero")<br /><br />I love Jack Black , Ben Stiller , Rachel Weis , and Christopher Walken , and yet , I hated this movie . There is a plot , but who cares when there 's no script . The dialogue is unreal and plain boring , the situations are contrived , the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary , the characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting , and the story , although based on a good premise , is stupid . This movie is a piece of poo.<br /><br />Never mind wasting MONEY on this movie , it 's not even worth your TIME spent watching it . Please do not see it ... I beg of you !
0 This could be looked at in many different ways . This movie sucks , its good or its just plain weird . The third one probably explains this movie best . It has strange themes and just has a strange plot . So who else but Christopher Walken would play in this no matter how bad , average or even how good it might be.<br /><br />The acting was what you would expect especially out of Ben Stiller . Jack Black I have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad . Christopher Walken is always off the wall . He is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is . Comedy wise it is somewhat funny . This of course meaning that it does have its moments ( though very few ) but can get a little over top here and there which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughs but of course not in a good way.<br /><br />The directing was average as well . Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job here . This movie seemed that it had a lot more potential and he did not do much to reach it . Just very average and did not seem like a lot of effort was put into making this film.<br /><br />The writing is the key to a good comedy . Obviously that means the writing here failed . At best it is below average . Considering it does have its moments it was not too horrible . That is never a good thing to say about a movie though . < br /><br />If not for Christopher Walken and it stupid ridiculous ending I would have given it a lower rating . He is always quite a character in his movies . Stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really do n't go anywhere . Not completely horrible but I would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie .
0 This has to be the most brutally unfunny " comedy " I 've ever seen in my life . Ben Stiller , Jack Black , and Christopher Walken as a crazed homeless man CAN'T make me laugh ? Something 's got to be wrong with this picture . This is the only movie I 've ever felt like walking out of . I used free passes , and still felt like I wanted my money back . I can wholeheartedly say that the only movie I 've ever seen worse than this one was HOUSE OF THE DEAD . The . ONLY . worse . movie . I laughed very slightly at the merry - go - round scene , and that 's it . Spending 2 hours in something billed as a comedy should get you more than one laugh , right ? I do n't know , I guess the filmmakers thought that " flan " was a funny word , or something . And the other running joke really is beating a dead horse -- literally .
0 I could n't wait to put this movie in my DVD player when I rented it . Then after I started it , I could n't wait to get it OUT of my DVD player . Actually I watched all of the movie . My wife and I kept waiting and waiting for something funny to happen , but nothing funny ever does . The box read like the it would be really funny . The premise of the movie sound good . Ben Stiller is funny . Jack Black is funny . How could this movie miss ? Well .... it does miss ! This is the unfunniest " comedy " I have ever watched . Nobody I have talked with thought it was even slightly funny . It is just a really lame movie . Trust me . Avoide it .... AVOIDE IT ! !
0 " Envy " is bad for a number of reasons . Yes , there are unlikeable characters . That 's not the problem . It is that they are unlikeable and we do not care for them at all . " The War of the Roses " featured unlikeable characters but due to proper introductions we grew to at least find ourselves interested in their fate , whereas in " Envy " the introduction is thin , the characters are never believable , and the plot only makes things worse.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is simply repulsive in his role and I 'm a fan of his work most of the time . Stiller campaigned to have this released straight - to - video and now I can see why . The movie proposes that he 's " best friends " with Jack Black , but from the first five minutes we are given footage that seems to indicate Stiller hates Black . I thought this would develop into some sort of one - sided relationship ( a la " The Cable Guy " ) but it never does , instead Stiller insists he 's his " best friend " and I felt confused as he seemed to treat Black like , well , " poo . " The movie 's plot is ridiculous but it does n't matter , because it 's supposed to be an exaggerated morality tale . Unfortunately the message is lost in the mess . Walken gives a good performance but Black is off - key and annoying ( and I usually find him very funny ) . No , it 's not a horrible film but I still ca n't believe Barry Levinson ( " Rain Man , " " Sleepers " ) is responsible for this - it 's not one of the worst films of all time but it could certainly be a whole lot better . I wish Va - Poo - Rize did exist - so we could make this film disappear forever ....
0 I admit to liking a lot of the so - called " frat - pack " movies . No matter how bad they are , I can find something to like about Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell or Jack Black . But " Envy " just left me about as cold as the white horse that Ben disposed of . This time , it 's Ben and Jack Black as a couple of nutty neighbors , one of whom ( Black ) discovers a aerosol spray to make animal poop disappear and becomes incredibly wealthy while the other ( Stiller ) writhes in envy . That 's supposedly the plot , but then it veers off in other directions that do n't really make much sense.<br /><br />I guess the ' Vapoorize ' thing is sort of amusing at first . The problem is , they try to sustain the gag for the whole picture ( Black has a license plate that reads ' Caca King ' ) and it gets fairly tiresome . But even Ben and Jack are used poorly ; the energy level for both of their performances seems significantly dialed down . The two best performances by far are Rachel Weisz and Chris Walken . Walken 's neo - hippie - dippie guy is so offbeat and so well - modulated a performance that it really never suggests any of Walken 's other familiar nutcase characters . It 's completely unique , yet comes across as unmistakably Walken . And Weisz is about the best actress in the business that nobody knows about . Even with limited screen time , she still dominates every scene she 's in.<br /><br />The whole crux of the so - called drama is that Ben , in a jealous drunken stupor , accidentally shoots Jack 's prize white stallion , and then goes to ridiculous lengths to cover it up , fearing his best friend will find out and cut him dead . But the plot twist is n't believable because there 's nothing about Jack 's character to indicate that he would do such a thing . He plays such a sweet guy that it renders the whole excruciating horse chase null and void . You discount it completely . It 's all filler . And what 's the point of the out - of - control merry - go - round , except that Barry Levinson wants us to know that he 's seen " Strangers on a Train " ? The screenplay is painfully bad and the acting of the two leads poorly directed . Someone with Levinson 's track record should know better . Maybe someone will invent something to make this film disappear . Oh , wait , they already have .
0 How can Barry Levinson possibly assemble white - hot comedy talents Ben Stiller and Jack Black , the gorgeous Rachel Weisz , old pro Christopher Walken and still deliver such a humourless stinker?<br /><br />Stiller and Black are friends until the latter invents a spray to make dog mess vanish and becomes a conspicuous consuming multi - millionaire.<br /><br />The premises is thin but sound enough in the right hands to have been a springboard for some great bitching between the two stars but all concerned overplay every hand , every chance they can.<br /><br />Stiller and Black are simply not funny for way too much of the time , Weisz looks sensational as always but is criminally underused and , with the exception of Walken as a batty barfly who urges Stiller 's character to take revenge , it 's a turgid trudge to the end of this strained farce .
0 Start with the script . I have seen cartoons with more depth than " Envy " . Anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen , and was not funny the first time , a movie is in deep trouble , which " Envy " certainly is . A movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it . Here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere . Christopher Walken especially would like to forget this bomb , because his character is so weak . Ben Stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies , " Flirting With Disaster " , and " Duplex " , immediately come to mind . Be certain that " Envy " is not a black comedy . There are no double meanings , just total nonsense . " Envy " deserves it 's low rating , because like it 's subject matter , it stinks . - MERK
0 I ca n't say much about this film . I think it speaks for itself ( as do the current ratings on here ) . I rented this about two years ago and I totally regretted it . I even /tried/ to like it by watching it twice , but I just could n't . I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever , ever again . And I 'm not one to trash a movie , but I truly believe this was awful . It was n't even funny in the slightest . The only bits I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them . I think this film ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me . All I can think of when I see one of their films now - a - days is this terrible movie , and it reminds me not to waste my money . Amy Poehler is so very annoying , too.<br /><br />Overall , well , I think you get my point . The stars are for Walken , by the way .
0 Please , someone stop Ben Stiller from acting in ANY movie . Write the studios , hell , write your local congressman even . I 've gotten more laughs going to a funeral then I have watching ANY Stiller flick . Jack Black tries to make something about a comedy about disappearing dog crap , and Christopher Walken , perhaps on of the greatest actors of his generation , simply looks embarrassed to be there . Stiller is his unfunny self , but now even with someone to bail him out , proves that he is way overrated as a comic . It 's no wonder why this movie tanked badly , and was available of the dollar movie theaters after only a handful of weeks . I warn you , and you must warn your friends , Do not watch this flick , it is just awful , worst then Gothika ( personally , i 'd never thought i 'd say that ) , worst the Plan 9 , Worst the Ishtar , worst then The Golden Child . Please Hollywood , quit allowing Ben Stiller in your movies , he 's not funny , he 's a god awful actor , and he 's bringing others down with him . The following film was ranked 1 because there are no negative scores allowed , so while the board says one , I 'll give it a Zero .
0 It seems that the people behind Envy realised that recent comedies - especially ones involving Ben Stiller and to a lesser degree Jack Black - have been situation spoofs , which have steadily declined in originality and generally laughs . I found the sheer absurdity of Zoolander utterly hilarious when it was released , Starsky and Hutch was also enjoyable , and then Dodgeball kept the laughs going for a lot of people , although personally i was a bit tired of the over - the - top characters - especially when the scenario was n't quite so funny ( perhaps the comedy of a Dodgeball tournament does n't quite translate to Australia , where it 's rarely played ) . So in an attempt to do something a little more original , Envy moves away from an absurd scenario and instead revolves around the absurd creation of Jack Black 's character ( i wo n't spoil what it is for those who intend to see the movie ) . The problem is that the movie seems to drag , i 'm not a big enough movie buff to be able to think of examples , but it seems like this set up has been done a thousand times before - and very rarely successfully . So instead of a nice , crisp , enjoyable and fresh comedy , you get a film that seems to just go through the motions . Sure the motions can be quite amusing , and they 're centred on an idea that is quirky enough to provide a few laughs - especially with Jack Black playing the excited and amusing , though a bit 2D , creator . Ben Stiller on the other hand seems a bit lost , he 's asked to play a fuller role than the ridiculous characters of his Zoolander breed of movies , but he struggles as a family man , whether his fault or the scripts , there is n't enough depth to the character and the result is a movie of Ben Stiller doing those typical mannerisms and generally becoming tedious . The performance does n't leave an imprint on the viewer ( he 's just Ben Stiller , Jack Black manages to actually portray a character - though not a challenging one ) . The last annoying element of the movie is Christopher Walken 's role as ' The J Man ' , which is about as typical and two dimensional as characters come , and naturally he becomes monotonous and frustrating very quickly.<br /><br />It 's really not as unbearable as some people would have you think , it 's watchable , especially if you 're in the right mood ( feeling silly would be a good prerequisite for seeing this film ) . Hire it on a movie night with friends and watch it after you 've watched a scary film and feel like something light - hopefully you 'll also be somewhat tipsy by then too . In that scenario i can imagine it would be quite enjoyable , but generally it provides too few laughs to carry itself and most of the time just drags along .
0 I usually like comedy movies . I really enjoy them . But I do n't really get the point of " Envy " . I mean , it has a dull content / topic , and it 's not really funny.<br /><br />Although the acting is generally good , it 's not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting . Stiller and Black do n't show all their talent in this movie.<br /><br />So , if you 're about to rent a comedy , I suggest you definitely do n't go for this one . Unless you want to get bored , and I can see I 'm not the only one with this opinion , because even Jack Black apologized for it ( take a look at Trivia ) .
0 this is the worst movie i 've ever seen . i 'm not kidding . the next time it comes on , i will just continually run my head into a wall . it would me more enjoyable to sit in an emergency room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is swollen than attempting to make it through this movie again.<br /><br />i hope that black and stiller never work together on a project this bad again . they are both good comedians , so i was shocked this was so awkward.<br /><br />if they had to do it all over again , i 'm pretty sure that they would decide to not do it . the folks that fronted the money , must have lost a ton . not really- because the special effects ( all 2 of them ) were terrible .
0 Stupid ! Stupid ! Stupid ! I can not stand Ben stiller anymore . How this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me . I ca n't understand how this happens if I performed at work the way he acts in a movie I 'd get fired and I own the company ..... I would have to fire myself . GOD ! This movie was just a plain , steaming , stinking pile of POO , that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible . Something else I have to say the guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic . What is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie ? I will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary .
0 I watched ' Envy ' two nights ago , on DVD , at a friends house . The premise of this film is quite promising , Jack Black and Ben Stiller in a comedy with a lot of potential , but it completely fails to deliver . I watched it with about five friends and no - one laughed for the entire film . The jokes ( which are few and far between ) are NOT funny in any way ... the story line is crap , and they never answer the question ... WHERE DOES THE SH*T GO ? Of course the answer to that is NO ONE CARES . This film lacks any sort of comedy value , and as a few other users have said the only thing that makes it even almost worth watching is Christopher Walken as the J - man . None of the characters are developed , the plots so thin it 's nearly transparent - and is that song throughout the film supposed to be funny ? ?
0 Envy stars some of the best . Jack Black , Ben Stiller , Amy Poehler , and the great Christopher Walken . With such a cast , one can only expect the best . However , with " Envy " , no one could save this disaster.<br /><br />Tim Dingman ( Stiller ) and Nick Vanderpark ( Black ) are best friends and co - workers at a sandpaper factory . Both are making a decent living , but because Tim has a better performance at work , he 's able to afford more than his buddy Nick . Nick is a dreamer who 's always coming up with new ideas for inventions . One day , Nick comes up with the idea for a spray can that makes dog poop disappear ( Yes , I 'm serious ) . Falling in love with the idea , Nick decides to really invent this product . He makes an offer to Tim to invest in his idea and share the profits 50/50 . Tim refuses thinking the idea will never work.<br /><br />Nick 's invention , titled " va - poo - rize " ( again , i 'm serious ) , ends up making millions . He enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house , a horse , a personal trainer , and fancy deserts . Tim starts feeling envy for Nick . Hence the name of the movie.<br /><br />The concept is n't bad , but it still turns out awful . This movie contains some of the worst dialog and very poor performances from all the cast . Then again , as I mentioned earlier , none of them could save this mess . Not even the great Christoper Walken , playing a homeless character named " J - man " , made this movie funny . The movie is bad from the start and only continues to get worse.<br /><br />I recommend this movie if : * you like crap ( no pun intended ) * you want to see Jack Black in a white tux < br /><br />I say , avoid this movie at all costs , but avoid ESPECIALLY if : * you 're offended by bathroom humor * you love animals
0 i saw this movie last night and even after a couple of beers the only giggle this movie got out of me was when i realized that i was actually watching it . in a word , it is unfunny . UNfunny . i totally believe the trivia tidbit about jack black apologizing for making this garbage . i ca n't believe that barry levinson did n't just toss this script when he read the first page . moreover , i ca n't believe that i watched more than ten minutes of it.<br /><br />i gave it 3 out of 10 * because i love to see christopher walken make terrible movies for the paycheck . also , the horse " corky , " by merely existing as a character in this movie , is actually quite ridiculous .
0 I 'm not sure what . I just could n't laugh at it . I had an open mind . I did n't want to be a tight-@ss about it . But I seriously just could n't laugh at this film . It was just not funny to me . Some parts it seemed like Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried too hard . Just because you put two very funny men together does n't mean that this is going to be an excellent comedy . Some movies just should n't be made . This is one of them . Because it does a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid . I know , I know it 's a comedy . Sort of at least . But I was just not impressed . I 'm sorry , but I can not give this anything lower than a two . And that 's all I 'm giving . < br /><br />2/10
0 I do not envy Barry Levinson , Rachel Weisz , Ben Stiller or Jack Black for doing this film . It 's , in one word , boring . Maybe the fact that is too predictable , the more - than - exploited Ben Stiller 's loser role or the not - at - all funny scenes make this film just something to forget . Even Christopher Walken 's appearance finishes in a pathetic way . I was very disappointed . I love Ben Stiller 's acting . I loved it in most of his films , the last one I saw before this was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and was not that bad . About Jack Black ... Well , apart from High Fidelity I 've never seen him doing something good . What about School of Rock ? Ooops , frightening .
0 Jack Black 's character , Tim Dingman the " Dreamer " in Envy , finds wealth and success in the idea of a aerosol spray " Vapoorize " that when sprayed on doggie dung , makes the poo disappear into thin air . < br /><br />For a moment I was hoping that Vapoorize was a real product so that I could spray it on this " stinker " of a movie and make it disappear into thin air as well.<br /><br />Although Envy is not the worst movie that I have seen in the past 12 months ( that honor goes to The Cat in the Hat ) , it does get the honor of a close second.<br /><br />Not funny , not sad , not anything . A real " Stinkeroo"!!!!!<br /><br />A 0.2 out of 10 ! !
0 Greetings again from the darkness . What ever happened to the great Barry Levinson ? He directed two of my all - time favorites in " Avalon " and " Diner " . He had some fine movies as well ( " Rainman " ) , but always provided something of interest ... until now . I believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it is boring . " Envy " is the definition of boring . Never of big fan of pure slap stick ( " Dumb and Dumber " ) , I was just stunned at how god - awful this movie is . There are maybe 2 chuckles in the whole thing - if you can pay attention that long . The best part of the film is the running gag of the title song by a Redbone sound - alike . If the film had been written as well as the song , it would have been tolerable . Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress and I realize they all want to do comedy ( even Julianne Moore ) , but the real world exposes one weaknesses . SNL cast member Amy Poehler is her usual over the top in her role as trailer park trash turned princess . The disaster of the film is Jack Black and Ben Stiller . The first work commute together flashes some promise , but after that their chemistry disappears due to the poor script . This script is like most of Jack Black 's character 's ideas - not a bad thought , but no hope for success .
0 Working with one of the best Shakespeare sources , this film manages to be creditable to it 's source , whilst still appealing to a wider audience.<br /><br />Branagh steals the film from under Fishburne 's nose , and there 's a talented cast on good form .
0 Such is the dilemma(above ) that Debbie must face at the close of this Sam Sherman production Naughty Stewardesses . Debbie has just hit town , become a stewardess , slept with an elderly rich man(who she describes is in his 50 's but obviously hit that mark a decade or two ago ) , shoots nude scenes for a photographer she just met , and then is the central element to a kidnapping / extortion plot . Through it all and amidst all that emotional upheaval and soul - searching , what in heaven 's name will Debbie do ? Well , I can not give it away completely but do n't expect any real epiphany here . Let 's face it . Naughty Stewardesses is just what it wants to be(at least two - thirds through ) : a soft core porn film with lots of topless women and a funny in that kitchy 70 's way film . There is no grand art here . The movie was designed to make money and exploit a growing trend at the time to put nymphomaniacal stewardesses in films so that the audience could live out vicariously their voyeuristic tastes . By todays standards , the film is pretty tame . What this film DOES do wrong is try to be some kind of statement film at the end . C'mon , anyone here believing that little diatribe by Debbie while on the beach contemplating life . She would spend more time picking out which halter top she will wear that day then do that . And what about the ridiculous plot to steal 50 grand ? It did n't make sense to me so how on earth did these characters " dig " it ? Anyone buying Cal as a member of the PLO(something like that ) or even as a director for hardcore pornography ? He would be luck to get work at Seven Eleven ! This is , as another reviewer noted , more of a Sam Sherman piece then and Al Adamson piece . You can tell when Al is in complete charge . There is virtually no budget and the film does n't look nearly as polished as this . Adamson does a decent job directing this time and I have to give Sherman credit to a degree . While this film is bad just for what it was meant to be , it has a certain style to it . I liked the opening credits with the animation and photographs . I even liked the music of Sparrow . " Silver Heels " was a somewhat catchy tune . The movie does n't look cheap really at all . Compare that to ANY of Al 's horror films . As for the cast , yes , Bob Livingston is a bit old for the lead , but some examination went into his character and the obvious thread that young women are attracted to men with money was explored as well . I had major problems with Robert Smedley who was just plain awful in his role . The girls have all got great sets , so what else was required of them huh ? Naughty Stewardesses is relatively harmless exploitation film from the 70 's and will serve as a living time capsule for certain aspects of life during that decade . By the way , did I mention it is a pretty bad picture ?
0 I sought out this film for one reason -- Al Adamson . He is among the worst directors of all time -- right up there with Ed Wood , Jr. and Ray Dennis Steckler and the pantheon of awfulness . However , I was a tad disappointed because although the film was indeed bad , it never approached the levels of awfulness of some of his earlier schlocky movies . Because of that , this film was n't particularly fun to watch for us bad movie fans.<br /><br />Now I was wary about watching this film , as the title " Naughty Stewardesses " makes the film sound like a pornographic film -- something I would n't be reviewing on IMDb . However , this film appeared to be this at times -- particularly the first 10 minutes . But , you could tell that the script underwent many changes , as for much of the film there is n't any titillation at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly NOT sexy ! The result of all this is total confusion.<br /><br />Sadly , none of the many parts are even good . For example , as a porn video , it shows surprisingly little AND it 's incomprehensible why they would put a 71 year - old guy in some of the love scenes . Sure , for a 71 year - old Mr. Livingston looked pretty good -- but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young nymphet ! Then , when the final 20 minutes becomes very violent , as Livingston became a Rambo - like guy ! Talk about weird and inappropriate.<br /><br />Overall , there is little to recommend this sad movie . It 's not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title like " Naughty Stewardesses " .
0 Connie Hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times.<br /><br />That 's it , folks . The sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not.<br /><br />These 70s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness ( flared trousers , big hair , Zapata moustaches etc . ) . This one isn't.<br /><br />The script is bad , the acting is bad , the direction is bad , and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad.<br /><br />The title , hinting at a sex comedy , is grossly misleading.<br /><br />I heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague .
0 From the start , you know this is a Sam Sherman film more than an Al Adamson film because as the credits roll , " A Sam Sherman Production " appears in letters as big as the title credit . Not only that , Mr. Sherman co - wrote the screenplay and it was his idea to use Bob Livingstone , a washed - up , 69 year old Western star of the old Hollywood era to be his male lead in a picture that Sherman thought would capitalize on the recent success of " Swinging Stewardesses " . < br /><br />Now why would you want to have a wrinkled old man as your male lead in what is supposed to be a soft - core exploitation feature ? It defies explanation , but that is Sam Sherman for you . His obsession with old Hollywood colored a lot of his films for Independent International Pictures , and he and Al Adamson frequently tried to get has - been actors for their films ( e.g. J. Carrol Naish , Russ Tamblyn , Lon Chaney Jr.,etc . ) . But Bob Livingstone ? Tell me the drive - in demographic knew who this ' 40 's second - rater was ; it 's ridiculous ! < br /><br />But then again , " Naughty Stewardesses " was a successful picture for them , so we ca n't just write this off as a Sherman fiasco . Still , by any aesthetic standard , it 's an incoherent mess . Al Adamson wanted out of this picture , and it is easy to see why . First off , it has no genre focus at all and drifts around from super soft core ( tits and ass / simulated sex only ) to a kidnapping thriller ( shades of Steckler 's " Rat Pfink and Boo Boo " ! ) In between , we get subjected to painfully boring sequences of the stewardesses traipsing around Vegas to the hackneyed music of Sparrow , or Richard Smedley and Connie Hoffmann on a photo shoot in San Francisco . Worst of all , we get Bob Livingstone as a Jack LaLanne wannabe in a blue jumpsuit trying to be sexy ... gag ! ( Thankfully , his big sex scene with Connie Hoffmann was deleted , but you can catch him slurping on her titties on the DVD in the Special Features section . Creepy . ) < br /><br />This is a terrible , terrible movie , but I 'll give it three stars for Gary Graver 's photography and out of sympathy to Connie Hoffmann for having to make it with " Wrinkles " Livingstone . " Naughty Stewardesses " is for Al Adamson completists and/or scholars of exploitation film as Sam Sherman 's commentary offers vital inside info . All others , BEWARE .
0 This movie is truly brilliant . It ducks through banality to crap at such speed you do n't even see good sense and common decency to mankind go whizzing past . But it does n't stop there ! This movie hits the bottom of the barrel so hard it bounces back to the point of ludicrous comedy : behold as Kor the Beergutted Conan wannabe with the over - abundance of neck hair struts his stuff swinging his sword like there 's no tomorrow ( and the way he swung it , I really am amazed there * was * a tomorrow for him , or at least , for his beer gut ) . Do n't miss this movie , it 's a fantastic romp through idiocy , and sheer bloody mindedness ! And once you have finished watching this one , dry the tears of joy ( or tears of frustration at such an inept attempt at storytelling ) from your eyes because some stupid f00l gave these people another $ 5 to make a sequel !
0 What we have here is a downright brilliant piece of early 80 's incompetence that will render even the biggest connoisseur of trash- cinema completely speechless ! " Wizards of the Lost Kingdom " is a very cheap and cheesy fantasy / Sword - and - Sorcery adventure that does n't have an actual plot but does eagerly & shamelessly borrows elements from other films . Writer Ed Naha and Hector Olivera ( who ? ) watched enough similar type of movies to know that they needed a handful of essential characters , but probably figured that all the rest would follow automatically . In order to make a fantasy - adventure you need : one super- evil villain ( preferably with a black cape ) , one young hero in training , one lone warrior , one amiable type of furry pet , one wise midget living in the woods ( optional ) and a whole colorful collection of hideous demons , enslaved dwarfs , and winged gargoyles to serve as filler . The story is phenomenal and so original , with Simon the young son of a wizard having to flee from his beloved kingdom after the evil magician Shurka takes over the power and killed the king . Simon wants to go back and save the people , but therefore he needs his powerful ring which he lost during his escape . Simon befriends lone warrior Kor ( the usually cool dude Bo Svenson who clearly needed the pay check ) , who assists Simon during the long and devastating journey full of ordeals , dangerous encounters and magical showdowns . Admittedly it does n't even sound too bad thus far , but that 's merely just because I excluded all the deliciously inept little details . Simon has a best friend named Gulfax , for example . Gulfax is an albino version of Chewbacca and evokes incontrollable chuckles whenever he opens his poodle - snout to yelp something incomprehensible . The obstacles during journey back home are hilariously irrelevant to the " plot " and simply serve as padding footage to cover up the lack of actual content . Simon has nightmarish visions inside the tent of a suspicious forest nymph , Kor settles an old score with the pig - faced nemesis whose sister he refused to marry and there 's the supposedly horrible ' suicide cave ' where you can only sing your way out of . But the absolute most unequally brilliant sequence  not just of this film alone but in the history of cinema  involves the resurrection of four zombie warriors . Simon awakes the legendary courageous warriors , hoping they will assist them in their battle , but the rotting corpses only take a few steps , complain about how tired they are and return back to their graves . That 's it ! So much for the zombie sub plot ! Best sequence ever ! I could go on listing unintentionally hilarious little details for several more paragraphs , but you get the idea . " Wizards of the Lost Kingdom " is a tremendously messed - up " so - bad - it's - good " film . Word of advice : do not watch this joyful piece of junk alone . Invite friends , preferably the dope - headed types with a wicked sense of humor , and watch it in group . It will be a night to remember 
0 All these reviewers are spot on . I 've seen many bad films over the years , believe me , and this beats the lot!<br /><br />This is not just a " so bad it 's good " exploiter waste of time , but a genuine , hilarious , movie atrocity.<br /><br />CHECK OUT the white furry monster type thing!<br /><br />WET YOURSELF LAUGHING at Thom Christopher 's " spell - weaving " acting!<br /><br />GAPE IN SHEER A**E - CLENCHING DISBELIEF ! at the threadbare sets!<br /><br />This is one of those " European co - productions " . No wonder we have so many wars . I swear , some of the people taking part in ' Wizards of the Lost Kingdom ' are n't actually aware they are appearing in a film!<br /><br />FACT ! I originally watched this movie on HTV Wales late one night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation . I had to track down a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really this awful . It is . Worse even than Lee Majors in The Norseman , more laughable than all of John Derek 's films , this is , truly , the Citizen Kane of Trash .
0 If somebody wants to make a really , REALLY bad movie , " Wizards of the Lost Kingdom " really sets a yardstick by which to measure the depth of badness.<br /><br />Start with the pseudo - Chewbacca that follows around the main character ... Some poor schmuck in a baggy white " furry " costume that looks as if it was stitched together from discarded pieces of carpeting . Work your way slowly , painfully , through more not - so - special effects that thoroughly deny the viewer from suspension of disbelief . Add a garden gnome ( just for the heck of it).<br /><br />On second thought , skip this movie entirely and find something else to do for an hour and a half .
0 Go immediately and rent this movie . It will be be on a bottom shelf in your local video store and will be covered in dust . No one will have touched it in years . It may even be a $ .50 special ! It 's worth ten bucks , I swear ! Buy it ! There are n't very many films than can compare with this - the celluloid version of that goo that forms at the bottom of a trash can after a few years . Yes , I gave it a ' 1 , ' but it really deserves much lower . 1 - 10 scales were not designed with stuff like this in mind .
0 Need a lesson in pure , abject failure ? ? Look no further than " Wizards of the Lost Kingdom " , an abysmal , dirt - poor , disgrace of a flick . As we all know , decent moovies tend to sprout horrible , horrible offspring : " Halloween " begat many , many bad 80 's slasher flicks ; " Mad Max " begat many , many bad 80 's " futuristic wasteland fantasy " flicks ; and " Conan the Barbarian " begat a whole slew of terrible , horrible , incredibly bad 80 's sword - and - sorcery flicks . " Wizards of the Lost Kingdom " scrapes the bottom of that 80 's barrel , in a way that 's truly insulting to barrels . A young runt named Simon recaptured his " good kingdom " from an evil sorcerer with the help of a mangy rug , a garden gnome , a topless bimbo mermaid , and a tired - looking , pudgy Bo Svenson . Svenson("North Dallas Forty " , " Inglorious Bastards " , " Delta Force " ) , a long - time b - moovie muscleman , looks barely able to swing his aluminum foil sword . However , he manages to defeat the forces of evil , which consist of the evil sorcerer , " Shurka " , and his army of badly costumed monsters , giants , and midgets . At one point , a paper mache bat on a string attacks , but is eaten by a 1/2 hidden sock puppet , pitifully presented as some sort of dragon . The beginning of the film consists of what can only politely be described as bits of scenes scooped up from the cutting - room floor of udder bad moovies , stitched together in the vain hope of setting the scene for the film , and over - earnestly narrated by some guy who never appears again . Words can not properly convey the jaw - dropping cheapness of this film ; the producers probably spent moore moolah feeding Svenson 's ever expanding gullet than on the cheesy fx of this flick . And we 're talkin ' Brie here , folks ... : = 8P Director Hector Olivera("Barbarian Queen " ) presents this mish - mash in a hopelessly confused , confuddled , and cliched manner , destroying any possible hint of clear , linear storytelling . The acting is dreadful , the production levels below shoe - string , and the plot is one tired cliche after another paraded before our weary eyes . That they actually made a sequel ( ! ! ! ) makes the MooCow 's brain whirl . James Horner's("Braveheart " , " Titanic","The Rock " ) cheesy moosic from " Battle Beyond the Stars " was lifted , screaming and kicking , and mercilessly grafted onto this turkey - bet this one does n't pop up on his resume . Folks , you got ta see this to believe it . The MooCow says as a cheapo rent when there is NOTHING else to watch , well , it 's moore fun than watching dust bunnies mate . Barely . : = 8P
0 Think of this film as a Saturday morning live - action program from ages ago . Even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses ! I ca n't fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting , especially in the costume department ! Too many warrior - wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over , but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings . And who in the world would 've let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place ? I thought this was a " family " movie ! MST3 K , here 's another fine gem for your 1999 TV season !
0 There 's nothing I hate more than self - congratulating pretentiousness . Kevin Smith deserves to be hung up by his toenails for inspiring every white middle - class whiner to make a movie about why they ca n't get laid . I do n't really mind inexperience and low - budget productions but when the writing is this obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes . The money put into this could 've gone to a real struggling filmmaker who actually has a chance like John Gulager . If you watch Project Greenlight you 'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system . Anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that does n't manage to say anything really , at all . When will we be saved from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world ? The revolution ca n't come soon enough . Go watch a real first time effort by buying Desperado or searching out Friends With Benefits . Thank you and good day .
0 In his 1966 film " Blow Up " , Antonioni had his hero question truth against a backdrop of British youth protesters . By setting such questions against a fabric of hippie youth movements , Antonioni questioned , intentionally or not , the effectiveness of these organisations . How can you fight for a cause when what you think is true may actually be a lie ? On the flip side , the film said that we must fight and actively challenge what we see precisely because others may be deceiving us with false images and false truths . Though the hippie aspects were the most tacky parts of " Blow Up " , they created a nice texture and gave the film more meaning than it might otherwise have had . It was a very cautionary and mature little film.<br /><br />With " Zabriskie Point " Antonioni throws away all the ambiguities and subtleties of " Blow Up " and goes full blown hippie . The result is a film awash with bad metaphors , stupid ideas and heavy handed storytelling . How could somebody , who across his career displayed such restraint and intelligence , make something so silly ? < br /><br />The film opens with a nice series of close ups , as we watch a group of radicals discussing the meaning of revolution . Suddenly one man ( Mark ) gets up and leaves . He hates the rigid and ordered nature of revolution . He recognises that , though revolutionaries fight for freedom , to bind oneself to such a militant cause is to effectively give your freedom away . And so like Jack Nicholson in " The Passenger " , Mark just wants to be free.<br /><br />As such , Mark buys a gun and goes solo . He takes orders from no one . When police raid his university campus Mark shoots a guy and runs away . He then flees to a nearby airfield , steals a small private plane and flies out to the desert . Antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia , and contrasts it with the ruthlessly capitalist cities , with their billboards and hollow modern appliances . He sees the desert as a sort of Garden of Eden.<br /><br />In the desert , Mark meets Daria and quickly falls in love . Antonioni then gives us a ridiculous sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand . Free from the constraints of modern life , these tree - huggers and student radicals can now celebrate their individualism by humping in the sun.<br /><br />The film ends with Mark dying and Daria fantasising about blowing up the mansions and stately homes of the rich capitalists who killed him . It 's Antonioni 's challenge to his audience . Pick up the guns , pickets and explosives , he says . Tear the walls down before they cage you in!<br /><br />Of course the film had no effect on its audience . They recognised " Zabriskie Point " as being just another self centred commercial attempt at being radical . A sort of commodified radicalism . It felt untruthful and tame.<br /><br />Thematically the film is pretty stupid . Antonioni basically says that if you are unhappy with the modern world , and the fat cats who exploit you , you should either flee to the desert ( Mark ) or actively fight the system ( Daria ) . That 's all well and good . But though artists constantly warn us of such dystopian nightmares , they 're all mostly unable to show us how to effectively administer change . Like the end of " Fight Club " , nihilism and violence achieve nothing . In the real world , social change tends to be instigated by humble inventors , spurred ahead by minor technological advancements . I mean , what liberated women more than contraceptives?<br /><br />3/10 - A very bad film . The problem is , Antonioni does not really believe in rebellion . He is a quiet and contemplative man . An introvert who seems to have made an extroverted film simply to garner more adoration from the counterculture who embraced his earlier film , " Blow Up " . As such , " Zabrinskie Point " comes across as a very pretentious and stupid film . It 's essentially a 50 year old man say " Look at me , I 'm a daring rebel!" < br /><br />There are many films in which the audience is encouraged to fight " the system " , but they all fall into one of four categories . In the first category you have films like " Network " , " Cool Hand Luke " , " Cuckoo 's Nest " and " Spartacus " . These all show that the lives of freedom fighters all end in failure , though in each case the " spirit of revolution " survives . The message is that you can not effect change , but by dying or failing , the optimistic notion of change survives through martyrdom . Essentially we must keep on failing rather than give up hope.<br /><br />Then you have films like " Fight Club " , " Zabriskie Point " and " Falling Down " , which simply encourage you to explode . Tear it all down . Blow it all up . Everything is a lie , so you might as well go out guns blazing . These films are borne out of angry , reactionary feelings , rather than any sort of common sense.<br /><br />Then you have the " flight rather than fight " category . Terrence Malick and Antonioni are the masters of this genre . Films like " The Passenger " , " Red Desert " and " Badlands " show human beings running from worlds they do not like and forging islands or peaceful havens for themselves . Both directors are pessimists , in that Malick has his islands destroyed and Antonioni has his islands offering no sense of happiness or solution.<br /><br />Then you have the fourth category . Films like Donnersmarck 's " The Lives of Others " , Ashby 's " Bound For Glory " and Kubrick 's " A Clockwork Orange " , treat artists as a force of change and rebellion . In these dystopian worlds , in which everyone is content to be a slave to the state , it is the unbridled creativity and freedom of will of the artist / criminal who keeps the system in check . By simply existing outside of the herd , you create waves . Your comments , actions and critical eye , challenges the status quo . As such , Donnersmarck 's film has novelists and artists undermining Nazi Germany , whilst Kubrick has Alex the artist / criminal fighting Nazi droogs , painting the town in blood and sperm .
0 I admit , having come of age in the hippie - dippy age , I am a sucker for these kind of movies . I can enjoy some of the schlock of the hippie genre far more than most " normal " people . However , this movie is simply awful in every conceivable way.<br /><br />Every trite perception of the hippie silliness is presented as gospel , cops kill a young long hair when he peacefully lands a plane . This movie is so horrible that it is not even funny to watch as a goof on the excesses of the hippie drone . It is like a left wing version of Dragnet , except without professional actors . The only reason I gave it two stars was because there are some obscurities of interest on the soundtrack , besides , I could n't find a selection for negative stars.<br /><br />No actors , almost no plot , sheeze , barely even a script ... you got it , an " art " movie .... All this done at root canal drilling slowness , dragging out each meaningless scene just to fill up time.<br /><br />In a bizarre twist of life imitating art , the star " nonactor " of the movie joined a commune in real life and robbed a bank in Boston , one of his co - robbers was killed and he was sent to jail where he was killed in a suspicious weightlifting " accident" ..... and just think , he got to leave this behind as a legacy .... Oy vey .
0 Antonioni 's movies have aged not well . What always surprised me about them is that , besides an unquestionable plastic beauty , there is a dull and didactic " psychology " of the characters and situations . Remember , for instance , the conversations between Mastroianni and the " wicked capitalistic " that wants sing up him in " La notte " , or Monica Vitti laughing at the peasants flirting in the train in " La aventura " , or Ferzetti dropping the glass of ink at the end of the same film . < br /><br />I have reviewed yesterday " Zabriskie Point " . In this film there are a lot of nice and elaborate shots of the Rod Taylor office , the streets and highways of L.A. , the publicity advertisements , the deserts , etc . , that show the fascination of the author in his American journey , in the same way than Wim Wenders years later . Unfortunately , there are too a lot of hippie - leftist clichés that spoil the movie : - The boy leaves the meeting , steals an aeroplane and flies over the desert in order to liberate himself and find " something different " . - The executives in grey suites speak all the time about speculation . - The girl looks at the " object women " in the swimming pool and leaves because she wants not to be like them . - The couple of fat middle - class in the caravan speak , in front of the beauty of the nature , of building a hotel and earning a lot of money . - Last but not the least , a lot of couples making love in the desert . What a hippie platitude!<br /><br />Sorry , today , half a century after the " revolution " of " La Aventura " we can see that the king is naked , and his films ( except " Le amiche " and perhaps " Il grido " ) are only a handful of aestheticism and commonplaces .
0 This film is definitely a product of its times and seen in any other context , it is an incredibly stupid movie . Heck , even seen in its proper context , it 's pretty bad ! ! Mostly , this is due to a silly plot and very self - indulgent direction by the famed Italian director , Michelangelo Antonioni . In this case , he tried to meld a very artsy style film with an anti - establishment hippie film and only succeeded in producing a bomb of gargantuan proportions.<br /><br />The film begins with a rap session where a lot of " with it " students sit around saying such platitudes as " power to the people " and complaining about " the man " . Considering most of these hippies have parents sending them to college , it seemed a bit silly for these privileged kids to be complaining so loudly and shouting revolutionary jargon . A bit later , violence between the students and the " establishment pigs " breaks out and a cop is killed . Our " hero " , Mark , may or may not have done it , but he is forced to run to avoid prosecution . Instead of heading to Mexico or Canada , he does what only a total moron would do -- steals an airplane and flies it to the Mojave Desert ! There , he meets a happen ' chick and they then sit around philosophizing for hours . Then , they have sex in one of the weirder sex scenes in cinema history . As they gyrate about in the dust , suddenly other couples appear from no where and there is a huge orgy scene . While you see a bit of skin ( warranting an R - rating ) , it 's not as explicit as it could have been . In fact , it lasts so long and seems so choreographed that it just boggles the mind . And of course , when they are finished , the many , many other couples vanish into thin air.<br /><br />Oddly , later the couple paint the plane with some help and it looks a lot like a Peter Max creation . Despite improving the look of the plane , the evil cops respond to his returning the plane by shooting the nice revolutionary . When the girl finds out , she goes into a semi - catatonic state and the movie ends with her seemingly imagining the destruction of her own fascist pig parents and all the evil that they stand for ( such as hard work and responsibility ) . Instead of one simple explosion , you see the same enormous house explode about 8 times . Then , inexplicably , you see TVs , refrigerators and other things explode in slow motion . While dumb , it is rather cool to watch -- sort of like when David Letterman blows things up or smashes things on his show.<br /><br />Aside from a dopey plot , the film suffers from a strong need for a single likable character as well as extensive editing . At least 15 minutes could easily be removed to speed things up a bit -- especially since there really is n't all that much plot or dialog . The bottom line is that this is an incredibly dumb film and I was not surprised to see it listed in " The Fifty Worst Films " book by Harry Medved . It 's a well deserved addition to this pantheon of crap . For such a famed director to spend so much money to produce such a craptastic film is a crime!<br /><br />Two final observations . If you like laughing at silly hippie movies , also try watching THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK . Also , in a case of art imitating life , the lead , Mark Frechette , acted out his character in real life . He died at age 27 in prison a few years after participating in an act of " revolution " in which he and some friends robbed a bank and killed an innocent person . Dang hippies ! !
0 Antonioni , by making this film , had assumed the role of Papa Smurf to all the little long - haired , American , radical student - Smurfs . He had taken them under the guiding protection of his European communist wings , showing appreciation and support for their confused American ways . ( These Smurfs are red and wear blue , not the other way around . ) The radical Smurfs were happy to get the guidance of a wise old man with gray hair who regularly preys to the God of all long - haired Smurfs , Lenin the Communist - another wise old man whose beard made the Smurfs take him even more seriously , for it symbolized something wise , though they did not quite know why they regarded the beard to have this kind of deep effect on them . Castro , another wise bearded man , has often profited from this confusion and exuded magical powers with his beard over his naive overseas admirers . ( Not to mention Che Guevara : that beard has a certain je - ne - sais - pas - quoi about it , makes one want to immediately embrace Marx and his lovely , pacifistic teachings  ) The film starts with a muddled meeting of radically stupid radical students , who engage in dialogues that truly redefine the word " confused " . As confused as a blind - folded dog falling of a high - story building into a bottomless pit . Suddenly , the movie 's " hero " ( well , Antonioni 's hero ) rises up and says something to his pathetic left - wing peers and then leaves , hoping that this display of " mega - coolness " will improve his James Dean image and vastly increase his chances of getting laid with the best " chicks " in the next mass hippie orgy . Eventually he gets into trouble with cops ( i.e. pigs ) at a rally , and spends the movie under the blue American capitalist skies , looking for freedom   Or something like that.<br /><br />Antonioni 's predictable assault on capitalism is not only intellectually hollow , but has ( or had ) nothing new to offer ; it 's just the same old trigger - happy one - dimensional cops , businessmen discussing business deals ( and what 's wrong with that , is n't that how Antonioni 's movies get made ? ) , and endless shots of TV commercials and billboards advertising the oh - so morally decadent products for the abhorrent , selfish , and greedy right - wing rabble - population who thinks of no one but themselves , their families , their work , and their children.<br /><br />Papa Smurf Antonioni , just like his long - haired Smurfs and Smurfettes of the late 60s , failed to notice the most obvious and vital aspect about their silly movement : they were allowed to have their laughable meetings and express their anti - establishment opinions freely within that very establishment , whereas the students in those countries whose left - wing systems they admired , did not ( and still do not ) . By far the greatest irony about the hippies - and Antonioni , naturally , failed to realize this as well ( his judgment being clouded by cocaine - snorting and an excessive intake of LSD ) - is that hippies were ( are ) the garbage - residue of capitalism . This is an incredible irony . Only in a successfully - functioning capitalist system can you find that species called " hippie " ; a spoiled , ungrateful , and selfish bunch of middle and upper - middle class losers.<br /><br />The film itself seems to go on forever . Antonioni takes his sweet time with getting on with it , while including overlong scenes of pointlessness , with a high dullness factor . His attempts at symbolism are annoying and trite . His statements are highly dubious , at best . This film is Antonioni 's way of saying that violent revolution is the solution . And this is what we get from an old , saturated , filthy - rich , fat film - maker who lives in villas and dines in the best French and Italian restaurants.<br /><br />I do n't remember seeing any major Western movie about the Tiananmen massacre of thousands of students in China . But when one Western student gets shot for waving Che Guevara 's face into all our faces , we get ten major films about it at once . I suppose this means that a Chinese life is worth a thousand times less than a Western one  at least to the left - wing hypocrites who infest movies.<br /><br />If you 're a Marxist neo - hippy and disliked this awful review , please klick " NO " below .
0 Here is one of those educational short films made to learn the unknown people out there about facts of life . This time the target audience is preteen girls , the fact of life is menstruation . This animated film , created by Walt Disney Pictures , apparently with some sponsoring from Kotex.<br /><br />It starts with explaining how hormones make you grow and develop . With the help of animation and a female narrator it shows us how the body , especially the ovaries , uterus and vagina , work and why this all leads to menstruation . It is almost amazing , becoming the comic note here , how the subject of sex is avoided . Even the word is never mentioned although " furtilized " will pass once . I do n't really know why I saw this , but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time , you might want to give it a try .
0 A bad one.<br /><br />Oh , my ... this is one of the movies , which does n't have even one positive effect . Just everything from actors to story stinks to the sky . I just wonder how low I.Q. you should have to watch this kind of flick and even enjoy.<br /><br / > Is there something than this is worth watching for ? Well , there is a lot of nudity involved , but it 's nothing particular . And when you just think that it could n't get worse , your realize that all the naked ladies looked like there are forty years old . C'mon guys , where did you search for these actresses . In elderly home , perhaps.<br /><br / > Anyway , the leading actresses has some sex - appeal and knows how to show it . Again , too bad , that she is too skinny & old . All in all , skip these one.<br /><br />2 out of 10
0 Istanbul is another one of those expatriate films that Errol Flynn was making in the last decade of his life trying to support his family and stay out of trouble with the IRS . It 's a remake of the Fred MacMurray- Ava Gardner film Singapore from a decade ago.<br /><br />Unlike that studio product , Istanbul has the advantage of that great location cinematography right at the sight of the Golden Horn . But Errol Flynn , who was aging exponentially before the camera in every film , was way too old to be playing these action / adventure types any longer . His scenes with Cornell Borchers really do lack conviction.<br /><br />As for Cornell , she plays Errol 's former sweetheart who through the trauma of being saved from a fire now has amnesia . She both does n't remember Errol and is now married to Torin Thatcher . < br /><br />But Errol 's got some nasty people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer who are after some diamonds which have come into his possession . Got to deal with them too.<br /><br />Best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole sing and play the piano . Most people today do n't realize that Cole was an accomplished jazz pianist , they only think of him as a singer . Actually he was a pianist first , the singing was an afterthought.<br /><br />Istanbul is a routine action / adventure film for those who are fans of that type of movie .
0 This movie does not rock , as others have said . I found it really boring and silly . The story is about this metal high school kid who idolizes this really bad heavy metal singer . The singer dies , but not before making one last album that is to be played over the radio at , of course , midnight on Halloween ( which would actually make it November 1st , a much less potent date to be sure ) . The kid gets a copy of the record and it contains secret hidden back - play messages . It also is the key that opens the door so that the really bad metal singer can return to bring havoc and death to the world . < br /><br />The first part of this film is not a horror film at all , but rather an After School Special . We see the metal kid ( the outsider ) tormented over and over by the popular kids . And he fails to learn the most important lesson in high school movies : When the cool kids who bully you suddenly invite you to a party , DON'T GO ! It is a trap . Especially if it is a pool party . Anybody surprised when he ends up in the water ? ? It was such an After School Special that I kept waiting for Melissa Sue Anderson to show up and teach Jody Foster a lesson.<br /><br />So back to the horror part of the film . So this metal kid gets some powers and instead of using them to kill the bully boys ( which would have made much more sense ) , he freaks out and tries to protect all of the bully boys and girls from harm . What ? A sensitive hero ? What fun is that in a horror movie ? Thank goodness Carrie White did not follow this lesson . He actually tries to PREVENT having the music played at the Halloween Dance , the very music that could unleash a power to kill all the kids who had been mean to him . If it were me , I would have put that music on , and pronto . < br /><br />The rest of the movie is about this metal kid going around town trying to kill the horrible metal star he idolized . Why not partner with him and REALLY do some damage . Why you ask ? It seems he is in love with one of the popular girls and does not want her hurt .. more appropriate for a Molly Ringwald film . Is this a horror film or an episode of Beauty and the Beast ? The movie just goes on and on at this point , with no scares , horror , or anything worth watching . If you went to high school in the late 80s like I did , this movie is fun to have a little flashback to fashions and big hair , but that is it for this film . Skip it and stay home and just listen to some KISS .
0 Skippy from " Family Ties " plays Eddie , a wussy ' metal ' nerd who gets picked on . When his favorite wussy ' metal ' singer , Sammi Curr , dies , he throws a hissy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall . But when he later gets an unreleased record that holds the spirit of his dead ' metal ' idol . He first gets sucked into ideas of revenge , but then he does n't want to take it as far as Sammi does . Which is n't really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital . This movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say , " Rock Star " . OK , maybe a tad more than that piece of junk , but you get my point . And how ANYone can root for a guy played by Skippy from " Family Ties " I have n't a clue . The cameo by Gene Simmons is OK , and Ozzy Osbourne reaches coherency , I applaud him for that , but otherwise skip this one.<br /><br />My Grade : D < br /><br />Eye Candy : Elise Richards gets topless , an a topless extra at a pool party
0 How can a movie have Ozzy Osbourne and still suck ? I just do n't get it . Trick or Treat managed to do it . This sucks and likes it.<br /><br />Trick or Treat is one of those movies I have to warn people about . It is a vomit - inducing vile atrocity just begging to be viewed so you can feel that much worse about yourself . Trick or Treat has no redeeming factors.<br /><br />For a movie about heavy metal , it sure does n't seem to grasp what heavy metal is or what it represents . This movie manages to make heavy metal look lame and this was in 1986 , probably one of heavy metal 's strongest hours . That is quite a feat , however negative.<br /><br />Trick or Treat = so bad you will be angry at yourself for having watched it . That simple equation will hopefully keep you away from this brainless and gutless film .
0 This movie has a very hard - to - swallow premise , even by this genre 's standards . We are asked to accept not only that a record played backwards can bring a dead man back to life , but that the record also contains hidden messages aimed SPECIFICALLY at one kid , when the singer had no connection to the boy when he was alive , and of course no way of knowing at whose hands the record would end up . Anyway , the film is fun for a while , but eventually the silliness and the pointlessness reign supreme . If they were really trying to create a new Freddy - like horror icon , they were way off : the villain here has no personality , no motivation , and no variety . ( * 1/2 )
0 I have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further . < br /><br />Nothing about this film worked , absolutely nothing . Delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise ex - jailbird . At the same time her friend Hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her . She also happens to be sleeping with Marlon who is desperately in love with her . Then there 's Delmar 's brother Jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict , Missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father . On the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends , one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film . So far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life , death , grief and love in the first half , the film simply loses direction . < br /><br />If the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed . For instance , why does Delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money , especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife ? Why is Hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly does n't love her ? How is it Missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight ? Is Jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems , or is Missy the exception ? Has Delmar and Jethro 's mother always been on the eccentric side , or is it a more recent development ? Why is Jethro so keen on Cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room ? Why did Moses spend years in prison for stealing a car , a relatively minor crime ? How does Delmar manage to end up giving birth to Moses ' baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex ? < br /><br />These questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered . I can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script . Big mistake . Losing several subplots especially the Hortense and Marlon story , which adds nothing to the overall film , would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the Delmar , Jethro and Moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else . < br /><br />Add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all , including Jorja Fox who does her best to rise above the material . I 'm not surprised that this appears to have been the director 's last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story .
0 I had the opportunity to preview this film as a member of a test audience , and the only thing which kept me in my seat was the chance to fill out the post - screening survey . I felt the film 's biggest problem was its lack of a main plot . Instead , it was composed of ( too ) many sub - plots competing for screen time . As a result , there is not a single character who is developed enough for the audience to form any sort of attachment . What the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should care what happens to the characters . In fact any one sub - plot and the characters associated with it could have been removed altogether without serious detriment to the film . ( The time gained would have allowed for the much needed development of the remaining sub - plots and characters . ) Simply put , The Hungry Bachelors Club 's plate is overcrowded with side dishes and appetizers when an entre is desired .
0 not your typical vamp story , not bram stoker or anne rice here . a truly original vampyre story . these vampyres are genetic mutants who the sunlight do n't bother . they are pure evil to . < br /><br />the film is not perfect . many of the actors are clearly amateurs . the two leads who play van helsing and rally the vampyre chick are pretty good though . the film is intensely violent which may disturb some people . also it is loaded with scientific detail that many will find hard to understand and may get bored with . i was sold on the clever storyline and the couple good performances . no telling how successful this film could be if they had a bigger budget and it got mass distribution
0 An interesting concept vampirism having something to do with a virus.(but done several times by now ) Overall the movie is too long and drags a bit . The editing could have been tighter . I am sorry to hear about the problem with the credits . Maybe the movie was rushed to market . The lighting was too dark in places . But the worst technical problem is the audio . The level was good enough to hear the dialog , but many of the interiors have a echo sound to them , which is very distracting . Either they were not careful in the recording , or the sound mixing could have been better . Also too much background noise got through . The should have gotten someone to do sound effects for the martial arts scenes . The tinny clank of swords hitting together was not the sound of an epic battle . Especially in the combat scenes the editing needed to be tighter.<br /><br />Also the acting was a bit flat . I am sorry , but when I see that the same person writes and stars in a movie , in my experience it is a red flag.<br /><br />But it was a good effort so I gave it a 4 .
0 Allow me to start this review by saying this : I love vampire movies . They can suck ( har har pun intended ) , and I 'll still love them because vampires are just cool in movies . Van Helsing , considered by many to be a steaming pile of crap , was enjoyable to me because of the fact that there were vampires . You may ask : " What does that have to do with this movie ? " The answer is that I intend to inform you of how horrible this movie truly is , that even a sucker ( harharhar ) for vampire movies like me can despise a movie like this so much.<br /><br />The movie stars Van Helsing , a college professor guy who is n't at all convincing . He 's a terrible actor , like everyone else in this movie , and he wrote it , to add salt to the wound . I honestly to not mean to offend him , and I 'm sure everyone had fun making this movie , but watching it was actually painful . I 'm not sure why I watched the whole thing ; perhaps it was a morbid fascination , like watching an impending train crash : it 's horrible , but you ca n't manage to force yourself to look away . Its main fault is that it 's just so * * * * ing boring , and its plot is so damn ridiculous , even for a science fiction horror movie.<br /><br />But , I digress . By the way , Van Helsing has sex with his mom . Of course , he does n't know it 's her at the time ; he just thinks it 's one of his students ( which is still illegal and all , but not as disgusting and creepy).<br /><br />If I were Van Helsing , I would at least pull an Oedipus myself when I found out I had done something so gross . It would 've made for one entertaining thing if he just made some comment on it , but no . The point is n't even brought up at all , by any of the characters . It 's as if the writer did n't even think of it . I would 've at least had another character laugh at him and say " Ha ha , you had sex with your mom , " which would be mildly humorous ( although blatantly immature ) . I 'm probably running out of room , so a few more words to dissuade you from ever seeing this film : there 's a vampire ninja fight with an old man . It would be funny , but the filmmakers expect us to take it seriously . It 's not even worth watching the movie to see how bad it is . Stay far , far away from it if you value your time at all.<br /><br />I will say one thing positive about the movie : the guy who plays Van Helsing is pretty slick with that knife of his . There 's like , a minute long segment where he swings around his knife and actually does some pretty nifty tricks . It would be boring in any other movie , but here , sadly , it was the highlight .
0 I do n't want to go off on a rant here , but ..... this is the worst " film " I 've ever seen . Worse than The Avengers . Incompetent directing , disjointed writing , and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout . Shot on very cheap video , it looks like a high school project , but without the emotion . The lighting frequently looks like a single Sun - Gun . The sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera , but everything else about this thing is just awful . The plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution , the techie elements are patently absurd , and the editing looks worse than a rough cut . It 's not even bad enough to be funny . It 's just bad . BTW , the packaging is intentionally misleading.<br /><br />Lion 's Gate owes me $ 4.00 .
0 I ca n't believe that this movie even made it to video , and that video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves . I literary asked for a refund . Take away the fact that the movie has no historical truth it , and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store . It is not even good enough to be called a B rated movie . Do not waste your money or your time on this movie . Just listing to the voice over and the horrible music made me sick . Anyone involved with this movie should be pulled from the union , gives the industry a black mark , but after watching most of this movie I really do n't think anyone involved is a union member .
0 This movie must have been the absolute worst movie i have ever seen . My sister and her boyfriend went to rent Zodiac ( 2007 ) and got this one by accident . thought it was a joke before the actual movie . this was terrible i was waiting for it to get scary and it never did . this movie had not actual facts about the real Zodiac killer . The filmmakers clearly did n't even bother to research anything on the killings ... they only liked the name ... so they decided to write a script about nothing true to its name . I am upset i did n't realize it was n't the movie sooner . I try to like something out of every movie , i do n't hate movies ... ever ... except this one . If you could have given it no stars , i definitely would have . 1 out of 10 .
0 This movie is bad . I do n't just mean ' bad ' as in ; " Oh the script was bad " , or ; " The acting in that scene was bad" ..... I mean bad as in someone should be held criminally accountable for foisting this unmitigated pile of steaming crud onto an unsuspecting public . I wo n't even dignify it with an explanation of the ( Plot ? ? ) if I can refer to it as that . I can think of only one other occasion in some 40-odd years of movie watching that I have found need to vent my spleen on a movie . I mean , after all , no one goes out to intentionally make a bad movie , do they ? Well , yes . Apparently they do ... and the guilty man is writer / director Ulli Lommel . But the worst of it is that Blockbusters is actually renting this to their customers ! Be advised . Leave this crap where it belongs . Stuck on the shelf , gathering dust .
0 Awful , awful , awful.<br /><br />A condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make . Once again I 'm amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they do n't have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crap.<br /><br />I sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that I could at least balance my criticism but the only one I could think of was that the opening track by Pink was pretty good .... I wonder if she has seen this?<br /><br />Watch this at your peril , the boredom may kill you .
0 Zodiac Killer . 1 out of 10 . Worst acting ever . No really worst acting ever . David Hess ( Last House on the Left  . No the one from the seventies  . Rent it it 's really good ) is the worst of the bunch ( Pretty stiff competition but he is amazingly god - awful . ) One would be hard pressed to find a home movie participant with such an awkward camera presence . The film actually screeches to a stunning painful halt when he is on the screen.<br /><br />Not that the film actually has any redeeming qualities for Mr. Hess to ruin . It is filmed with a home movie camera and by the looks of things a pretty old one complete with attached boom mike . No post production either . Come on there has to be some shovelware a five year old computer could use that could clean up this picture . Throw in bizarre stock footage pictures of autopsy 's and aircraft carrier takeoffs and this is one visually screwed up picture . The autopsy pictures are interjected the way Italian cannibal films interject those god - awful real life animal killings . And the Navy footage is supposed to be some anti war statement ( Cause we know all the bloodthirsty maniacs join the Navy ) What in the world is Lion 's Gate is doing releasing this garbage ? It would embarrass Troma . The plot is about the Zodiac Killer ( Last seen in Dirty Harry  . No the one from the seventies  . Rent it it 's really good ) Somebody gets shot in the stomach in LA and the cops assume the Zodiac Killer is back ? Uh - huh . What can you expect from a movie that does n't know that DSM IV is a book not a psychiatric disorder and where the young killer older man relationship resembles that of a congressional page and closeted congressman ? Yeah eighties haircuts and production values meet a Nambla subplot . Sign me up .
0 Well I 'll start with the good points . The movie was only 86 minutes long , and some of it was so bad it was funny . Now for the low points . My first warning sign came with an actual " warning " on the film . When it started the following " warning " was displayed : " The film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images . Because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun , pretty or romantic . " I should have saved myself the 86 minutes and turned it off then . The first words of the film were : " I 'm at the glue factory . " It was some guy talking on his phone , and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory . I do n't know why . So the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the Zodiac Killer and starts imitating him . The budget for this film was at least 50 bucks and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find . The acting was worse than me reading straight from a script . That 's what is looked like they were doing . The script was horrible , and the big " twist " was that this guy who wrote a biography on the Zodiac Killer was actually the Zodiac Killer . Of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first 10 minutes . Without any more painful details of the plot , here were some horrible highlights of the movie . They try to make the Zodiac Killer compare himself to an " army of one " because soldiers are really just murderers . Then they tried to make an attempt at " Satanic Worship " by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting . The great " computer hacker " was able to get this kid 's address when someone gave him the kid 's name and phone number . For some reason he had to hack into the FBI to get someone address . I 'm not sure why he did n't just look it up in the phone book or use whitepages.com . There was also a random allusion to 9/11 for no reason . I also learned that no matter where you get shot , blood will come out of your mouth within seconds.<br /><br />So if you like really bad acting , sub - par scripts , bad camera work and an obvious plot , you 'll love Zodiac Killer !
0 This is easily the worst movie i have EVER seen . I 'm not exaggerating , I told the guy at Blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves . The only thing interesting about this movie is the box . On the box it says " from the director of the boogeyman " so I figured ... eh whatever , if this was made recently I 'm sure the directing at least wo n't be TOO bad : -\ , but after I saw the movie and looked at what " boogeyman " they were talking about , it 's some nonsense from the early 1980 's that he made . Great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers.<br /><br />ANYWAY , I think that they just liked the name " Zodiac Killer " , and did n't bother to research any of the actual Zodiac 's crimes or his MO , or even the years that he was active . All of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the Zodiac and the " stories " about the original Zodiac take place several years after the actual Zodiac 's crimes did . They also compare the Zodiac to " Vampire of Dusseldorf " Fritz Haarman throughout the movie and talk to Fritz 's " son " quite often . The Zodiac and Haarman were nothing alike , and it makes more sense to compare him to BTK who also shot people , not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks . None of the Haarman facts are correct either , just a bunch of jumbled nonsense . His son even says " Do n't forget , his name was Fritz Haarman with 2 t's" ... His actual name just has one ! I think that the writer / director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman . " Ooh those sound like cool names , let 's make a movie about them without doing any outside research ! great idea!" < br /><br />Perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from DSM - IV and getting cured of it . " I was also diagnosed with DSM - IV and have since recovered " , etc . For those of you who do n't know , DSM - IV is the psychological manual for mental disorders . If anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some SERIOUS problems ! Haha.<br /><br />Anyway , my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list , and it 's rare that a movie ever reaches that point . But , if you are interested in watching a totally non - fact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring , full of inexperienced actors , and not completely rational , I 'd say check out this movie.<br /><br /> ... Oh , and I liked how the killer " tear gassed " a few of his victims with dry ice . Nice touch ...
0 This movie was almost intolerable to sit through . I can get beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this movie is supposed to span over weeks in time yet the characters do not once change outfits , but the acting broke the 4th wall to pieces for me . I 've seen better acting in a 4th grade play . Aside from that the plot is unrealistic . If the man suspected the guy he would have turned him in . I was also heavily disappointed that all the killings were done with a gun what kind of gore is that . That is not a copycat the Zodiac did not kill using just a gun the authorities would have known it was n't him . Another thing that really bothered me was that they called Disassociative Identity Disorder DSM 4 when that is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders not the name of the disorder . Overall I think this movie is not the kind of movie that could be done with a low budget at least not as low as they had or they could have made sure they had better actors or more gore . Plenty of people have went the low budget route with out having to use horrible actors look at Easy Rider that had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget .
0 Why would anyone want to see this ? ! If this was a film posted on YouTube by a teenager , I might have applauded the teen in doing so much with his mommy 's video camera . I might have also congratulated his family and friends for doing a good job acting . Sadly , it was made by a very experienced film maker and these were , apparently , professional actors -- making this a very , very sad film . Sad ... and very pathetic , actually . As I said , it has a definite made directly to video look about it . It also has narration and acting that just scream " unprofessionals "-- how could this be ? ! The film is filled with lots of corpses and blood . Normally this would turn me off completely , as I hate ultra - violent films and do n't like seeing all that gore . However , given that none of it is that realistic , it 's bearable . However , I should warn you that there are a few scenes that are still pretty disturbing . For example , the scene with the kid throwing a radio into a lady 's tub and watching her naked and frying is pretty bad . There are also scenes where you can hear the thought of psychos as they fantasize about killing women . With a level of misogyny that is pretty awful . the people who wrote this are pretty sick -- like killing women is meant to be for our entertainment.<br /><br />After a bunch of senseless murders , the film goes to a dining room table -- around which are a bunch of goof - balls wearing black hoods WITHOUT eye holes ! They are talking , with pride , about all the murders they have committed and chant . It 's all very funny , though I am not sure that was the scene 's purpose.<br /><br />Then , the film talks about various sex crimes and killings and even vampirism and cannibalism . Why , I do n't know -- perhaps because they people made this got off on this sort of crap . And , once again , you see and hear the thoughts and actions of a creepy German - looking man as he tracks down people and kills them.<br /><br />By the way , considering the film used what I must assume are professional actors , I wondered why so many people were chosen who were clearly Germans . While they tried to act like Americans and the film was supposed to be in California , the accents are STRONG . Perhaps German audiences watched this and marveled at how " realistic " the acting was , but to any American it 's obvious these folks ai n't their fellow Americans ! Considering that there really WAS a zodiac killer ( who was never captured ) , I do wonder why anyone would want to make a " fan film " of sorts for the sick menace ? ! I mean ... was this film meant as a snuff film for pervs ? I just ca n't see anyone else wanting to see this or enjoying it . In fact , I wonder what would motivate anyone to make such a stupid AND offensive film ? ! Worthless and deserving to be in IMDb 's Bottom 100 list .
0 If I could give it a zero , I 'd change my mind and give it a -10 instead . Absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot , does n't make sense of what is happening . Just PLAIN BORING . Please do n't waste your money on this one . Pleaseee ! ! ! This movie could have done so well if it truly depicted the real zodiac killer 's story , but nopes , I did n't feel anything but disgust while watching it . Do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead , its better to watch a movie you 've already seen like 3 - 4 times than watch this crap ! I do n't understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know its not going to do well . Zodiac killer should be called ' Boriac killer ' instead ! ! !
0 The film is about a young man , Michael , who cares for the elderly . One day he decides to kill some of the relatives of his clients . Around the same time he decides to model his killing after the Zodiac Killer of the 60 's . He gets in touch with the author of a book about the Zodiac Killer and they form a friendship . Michael has a gun ( aparently the only gun , as it seems to be in the hands of some of the other actors , only not portrayed as the same gun . ) and he goes out a - killin ' . Original . < br /><br />This is a great film if you like B movies . I thought the idea of the movie was good , but the editing and the acting really drowned the plot . I thought the ' blood ' was just too fake , the lighting was horrible in some places , and the dialog was just too standard . The movie was shot on video , which is okay , but the editing of the film just made for some weird ' Plan 9 ' scenes . Not a bad movie for fans of the B - movie genre , but if you want something with a bit more polish , move on to something else .
0 I have been learning about the Zodiac for four years now . And I 'm not saying I know much more than anyone else ... in fact out of most of the people who know and read and learn about Z , I am prolly the one with the least knowledge ... But I do know or at least I think I know that most of the stuff in this would n't happen ... From how he signed his name ... to how he killed people ... I thought that Godfather was the worst film ever ... <br /><br />The cinematography was that of a five year old ... not saying that my films are any better but I am not someone who is making movies for the mass population ... <br /><br />The acting I thought for the most part was pretty good really I did ... the lead did n't talk that much on camera or at all I forget and do n't know because I stopped watching ... his voice overs where good ... <br /><br />But really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something else ... like a large pizza or something ... <br /><br />Until I learn how to write a review , Psycho Phil
0 Really , really bad . How does a film this bad get made ? I kept waiting for some redeeming plot point , interesting camera work , or at least some gratuitous nudity but I got nothing . I had just watched Cabin Fever and I thought it was an train wreck ( except for the nudity and Pancakes ) but it looks like genius compared to this dreck . The best script doctor in the world could n't have saved this putrid pile of of stinking poo.<br /><br />The only thing going for this " film " is that it ended.<br /><br />I've got a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something . Ugh ! I 'm glad I only paid $ 5 for it and it will soon end up in a landfill .
0 If I could give it less that 1 I would . Do not bother to rent ; if someone gives you the DVD burn it.<br /><br />This is horrible movie making . A total waste of even digital " film " . I have seen better on Youtube made by 12 year old boys . Lommel claims to have written this , if that is the case he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages . The story line is none existent , the dialog is mainly screaming , the camera work is some sort of attempted arty flairs with nonsensical cutting of totally unrelated jumps to either industrial transportation scenes or some sort of odd angry young woman rift.<br /><br />I can usually follow a less than obvious plot or see the purpose in a " creative " film - I like David Lynch.<br /><br />This one is either so far beyond my limited powers of comprehension I missed it or it is totally pointless . I think this is a " lets see if we can grab a title that will be coming out soon and do a weird rift on it and see if we can grab some of the bucks " con job.<br /><br />I can not see why Lionsgate even bothered with this . Totally worthless , it is so bad I will not rent any other by this same director .
0 I gave this two stars for the awesome DV shot clarity , which lends to the cold and dark sterility of its character . That was being generous , I know.<br /><br />This film fails on all accounts . I can not recommend this , for it is neither poetic , nor blunt . Neither dramatic , nor suspenseful . Neither controversial , nor ordinary . It is just a wretched piece of trash that no horror or exploit fan can recommend in good faith.<br /><br />Do not watch this , whoever you are . . .please , just stay away from this awful product.<br /><br />Thank you .
0 While William Shater can always make me smile in anything he appears in , ( and I especially love him as Denny Crane in Boston Legal ) , well , this show is all about glitz and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and down.<br /><br />It has none of the intelligence of Millionaire , none of the flair of Deal or No Deal.<br /><br />This show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill in the time.<br /><br />I watched it of course just to check it out . I did watch it for over 45 minutes , then I had to turn it off.<br /><br />The best part of it was William Shatner dancing on the stage . He is a hoot ! ! ! unfortunately , this show WILL NOT MAKE IT.<br /><br />That 's a given
0 The comment by " eliz7212 - 1 " hits the proverbial " nail on the head " for this turkey of a program . But it is a hoot to watch William Shatner " cavort " and " dance " ( yes , the " " marks on the word dance are necessary for what Bill does ) . This show would be a great skit on SNL or MAD TV - and it does rate a few stars for one viewing , or so , to see Shatner , who seems to have taken " camp " to new heights - whether in a role or as himself . But the guy is funny.<br /><br />The girls who are in the cubicle areas with the game data scrolls , will be pretty much out - of - luck when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of the whiskey - a - go - go genre , with a resurrected demand for shapely young women to dance in elevated cages once more.<br /><br />I watched the first contestant , who was annoying , and literally " dumber than a : post , " yet through sheer luck , walked away with a quarter mil or so . The second contestant , somewhat more intelligent , but who 'd be lucky to gain $ 1,000 on Jeopardy ! , got zonked by the card which requires answering a special question - which he did n't know , and thereby left with zilch.<br /><br />This plethora of game shows , which dangle , and sometimes award , large sums to everyday individuals , are admittedly a cheap effort , overall , to attempt to woo viewers . Even if the host is well - compensated , and they give away six figures in an average episode , I suppose that the revenue versus costs can be favorable - since you do n't have a sitcom cast where several stars are getting six or seven figures , per episode , with some big residual deals as well.<br /><br />But I suspect even the better ones will wear thin before long . This one has already pretty much reached this point . I think his offerings , especially with James Spader , and the others on " Boston Legal " should give us a satisfying quantity of Bill Shatner 's offerings.<br /><br />Again , the above rating is simply appropriate to view Bill hoot and prance , perhaps one time ; that should be sufficient .
0 I do n't see enough TV game shows to understand the attraction of SHOW ME THE MONEY , but I suppose it holds some appeal for undemanding audiences . Ostensibly a quiz show , it offers contestants huge sums of money for answering a few simple questions . However , its quiz elements play only a small part in the proceedings , which I find tortuously complicated . For example , before answering a question , a contestant selects which question is to be asked by choosing from among random " A , " " B , " or " C " choices . Does this serve any purpose other than to slow the game down ? It would be a lot quicker simply to start with " A. " Contestants can pass on questions , but must answer one of the three questions in each category.<br /><br />After responding to a question , the contestant is then asked to " lock in " the answer -- another delaying tactic . The contestant 's next task is to name which woman from about a dozen go - go dancers in cages is to unveil a card that indicates how much the question is worth . A correct answer adds the card 's dollar figure to the contestant 's running total ; a wrong answer subtracts the same sum . This time - consuming step actually has some entertainment value , as it allows the audience to get a close look at the scantily clad and uniformly gorgeous dancers . Meanwhile , the contestant is reminded that an unlucky selection of the " killer card " will end the game instantly . This naturally makes the contestant sweat and causes further delays as the nervous contestant contemplates the sudden loss of the hundreds of thousands of dollars . My suspicion is that the possibility of sudden disaster is the show 's chief audience appeal.<br /><br />Meanwhile , the whole process is slowed down even more by a lot of empty banter between host William Shatner and the contestant , along with occasional routines by the caged dancers . All these delays burn up so much time that it might be possible for audiences to forget what the original question is by the time the correct answer is revealed.<br /><br />A typical 30-minute episode of JEOPARDY often gets through as many as 60 questions . The first 30 minutes of SMTM that I watched got through only six questions ( many of which pertained to other TV shows ) . No one in his right mind would watch this show because it 's fun to play along by answering the questions at home . That leaves three possible reasons to watch the show.<br /><br />A. To see how a contestant responds to being on the verge of winning as much as one million dollars , only to lose everything in one stroke.<br /><br />B. To look at gorgeous young women performing sexually suggestive dance routines.<br /><br />C. To enjoy William Shatner 's scintillating banter.<br /><br />My choice is " B , " but the women are n't on camera long enough to justify suffering through an hour of this show .
0 On the surface , " Show Me The Money " should have at least finished a full season . You had the always entertaining William Shatner as your host , surrounded by a baker 's dozen of beautiful leggy models collectively called " The Million Dollar Dancers . " You had knowledgeable contestants who had interesting stories to tell of their lives and who presumably knew a lot of pop culture trivia . And you had big money ! So , what went wrong ? < br /><br />The format of this game was the failure . A good game show needs at least two of three things : very simple rules , exciting pacing and the ability for the viewer to play along at home . The best , most enduring ones have all three.<br /><br />Unfortunately , SMTM had none.<br /><br />The rules for this game were among the most complex of any prime time game show in history . Let me try to explain how the game worked , as briefly as possible.<br /><br />A contestant began with a single word or short phrase followed by the choice letters A , B , C ( subtle plug for the network ? ) . Each letter was connected to a separate question , all starting with that word or phrase . Once a contestant chose one of the letters , they could either answer that question or pass and select a second letter . If they passed , they got to view the next question , and had the same option . However , if they passed the second question , they were required to answer the third option.<br /><br />After they answered and before they found out if their answer was correct , they then had to select one of the 13 dancers on stage , each with a different amount of money in a scroll by their side . They revealed their dollar amount ( ranging from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000 ) and depending on if the contestant answered right ... or answered wrong ... that amount would be added to or subtracted from their pot.<br /><br />Still with me so far ? In addition , there was one dancer who held something known as " The Killer Card . " If you selected the dancer with the Killer Card and you had gotten your question right , you were safe , and the game continued . If , however , you were incorrect , you had one final question to answer . If you got that final question wrong , you were out of the game . If you got it right , then , the game continued.<br /><br />There was no quitting , no walking away with the money earned until you either answered six questions correctly or got six questions wrong or you were so far in the hole you could n't earn enough money to get back out . Got it ? Okay ! < br /><br />The biggest problem , as I saw it , was a complete lack of tension , because of the design of the game . A contestant could pass questions they knew they did n't know , and answer many questions they did know , making the pressure even less . Then , they could still find a low dollar amount , even after knowingly missing a question , which meant there still was n't any " drama . " And the fact that they could answer five questions wrong and still have a chance to win was a big mistake . And the pacing of the questions was deadly slow : often the questions were so obvious , it was ridiculous to try to create tension , as if there was any doubt about some of the most common answers.<br /><br />The pacing , the lack of any real tension at any point during the show and those very complicated rules prevented this program from working , despite Shatner 's terpsichorean talents .
0 Unlike endemol USA 's two other current game shows ( Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs. 100 ) , the pacing in this show is way too slow for what is happening on the screen.<br /><br />DOND and 1 vs. 100 can get away with slow pacing because the games can change pace -- or end -- at any moment . There is risk involved in every action the player takes , the rewards are wildly variable , and it is difficult for the players to leave with a significant amount of money . Suspense is usually put to good use.<br /><br />Show Me The Money , on the other hand , is just too slow - paced . When a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer , you can rest assured that absolutely nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes . It would greatly help the pace of this show to reveal the correct answer FIRST , and THEN have the player select a dancer , instead of Shat wasting time talking about what will happen if the player gets an answer wrong when we all know they 're right . The random dancing is filler that actually feels like filler . Too much time is wasted while not enough is happening ... and the fact that players can not choose to quit the game early guarantees that there WILL be a lot of time wasted.<br /><br />Oh , and I have NO interest in watching Shat shake his groove thang , especially right after I 've eaten dinner.<br /><br />I am a lifelong game show fan , but even I had a lot of trouble sitting through an hour of this . It either needs major changes or early retirement .
0 There was such a hype about a game show with Bill Shatner ... and especially right in the wake of Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100 . So , of course everyone had to tune in to see what all the fuss was about on the new game show . What a disappointment ! As Ben Stein so stoically and nasally says , " wooww".<br /><br />The only thing likable about this show was the fact that you knew it would eventually be over . Sitting through a full hour of it was like going to the dentist ... you find yourself looking at the clock in what you think are 10 minute intervals , only to find out that only a minute has passed ( but seemed like an eternity ) since you last glanced at the clock . So , why did n't I just switch the channel ? Well , probably for the same reason most other people didn't ... out of sheer optimism . I mean , no one really * wants * to think that a show with Bill Shatner could actually be SO BAD.<br /><br />Personally , from the first 15 minutes , I never thought this was the kind of vehicle that would showcase the talents of William Shatner . My chief complaint was that the set was so dark . Watching it left me feeling depressed . You kept on wanting to get ahold of a little excitement , but there was just none to be had . There was not even enough light on the set to get a feel of energy from the audience ( who you could n't even see).<br /><br />Dear Network : People do not watch game shows to cure their insomnia ... they watch game shows to be excited and have a good time . Please do us all a favor and lose this in the vault .
0 My wife and I are semi amused by Howie Mandel 's show .. I also like Shatner - even when he 's at his most pathetic .. <br /><br />But this is absolutely the worst show on television.<br /><br />Please cancel this show . It sucks a**.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothing than Deal or no Deal ... <br /><br />The questions are a mixture of way too easy and incredibly obscure . And watching Shatner or the contestant say " Show me the money " makes me want to vomit .. <br /><br />This one will not last .
0 Trying to cash in on the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100 comes this lame excuse for entertainment - Show Me The Money , in which 12 sexy ' dancers ' shimmy out in shiny red hooker attire . A contestant is given the beginning of a phrase , such as " Which team lost . . . " with three choices , A , B , or C , each which completes the phrase . The contestant has three chances to give an answer to one of these 3 choices . The host - William Shatner , at his obnoxious smarmiest - asks the contestant if he wants to " lock into the answer " and when the contestant says yes , he picks a ' dancer ' , to whom he yells " Show me the money ! " She opens a scroll that has an amount , and if his answer was right , he adds that amount to his winnings ; if he was wrong , the amount is subtracted . ( So theoretically , it is possible for a contestant on this dreary debacle to actually wind up owing Shatner money . ) There is also a " Killer Card " and if the contestant picks the girl who has that vile scroll , but he has answered properly , nothing happens . If he 's answered wrong , the game goes into Sudden Death and has to answer another question . If he gets that one wrong , he leaves with nothing.<br /><br />Before going to commercials , Shatner yells , " let 's dance " and Shatner , the contestant and the 12 dancers shake booty . At the end of the show , Shatner asks the ladies for " a last dance " and they all shake it some more.<br /><br />I give this show 6 episodes at the very most , at which time hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door . ( It could 've been worse - they could 've somehow bribed Cuba Gooding Jr to be the host , although I bet he 's a better dancer than ' Shat , ' as they call him these days.)<br /><br />7/08 : Guess what - I was wrong ! It lasted for only 5 episodes . There IS hope for the world .
0 As the summary says you just made the most ignorant comment i have ever heard on an RPG . You seriously thought they were gay ? Are you retarded ? If you went to go save your best friend and someone decides out of the goodness of his heart to help you then you are in a serious debt to that man . Lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other it made them closer as friends . They were n't gay lovers like your bitching about . And to let you know the game is set in a medieval time period . Back then , women did just prepare meals while the men fought . Do you even know your history ? Do you know how long it took for women to be accepted in the army in present day ? This game contains a lot of realism even though your too damn slow obviously to catch it , and you really need to spit out some solid proof instead of ignorant assumptions based off your misguided act to interpret the story .
0 Man , this gets a lot of good reviews in the review books . Frankly , I found it too slow and unappealing right from the start . I kept waiting for it to pick up a little steam but that never happened . This movie is vastly overrated.<br /><br />Shakespeare , with the King James English , has never appealed to me , anyway , so it may just be me . There is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the film as they show Ronald Colman playing the role of Othello.<br /><br />The good points of the film include - thanks to a restored print - some decent cinematography and a young , slim and attractive Shelly Winters.<br /><br />Overall , this is simply too boring , too much repetition in some of the scenes to watch again . Besides , we all know that most actors are nut - cases , anyway , but kudos to Hollywood for demonstrating it here in this story .
0 Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles , particularly as Shakespeare 's Othello . Critically - lauded George Cukor film has a marvelous pedigree , having been written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin . Unfortunately , the witty banter comes off as self - conscious here , and the backstage business is overripe . Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score , and Shelley Winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress ( when theatrical Colman breathlessly addresses her , she asks him , " What are ya ? Some kind of nut ? " ) . Otherwise , this scenario is awfully obvious , surprisingly draggy , and not very funny . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 This seems like two films : one a dreary , pretentious lengthy saga about an ac - tor who is taken over by the parts he plays ; the other a brilliant social comment about a middle aged divorce who is picked up by a waitress . Shelley Winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side . She drops heavy hints about the need for connections , her certificate in massage and her desire to get into the modelling game . I love the glimpse of her seedy flat with a kitchenette behind a curtain , and her terrible seducing outfit of navel - revealing , puff - sleeved crochet top.<br /><br />Do actors get Oscars for Shakespeare ? We know they Oscars for impersonating disabled people , wearing a lot of prosthetics , or pretending to be mad . The Shakespearean scenes ( which go ON and ON ) are embarrassing and dated . And so are the ' going mad ' scenes where Tony looks distracted while listening to his own voice - over.<br /><br />By the way , Anthony John is not aristocratic . He makes it quite clear in an early scene that he used to be a chorus boy . When he quotes his father 's advice , he slips into a Cockney accent .
0 Oh man , this s - u - c - k - e - d sucked .... I could n't even get any camp value out of this ...... and I sat through the whole thing on Showtime .... Do n't bother waiting around for the ' naked ' scenes either ..... it 's too late and only plastic Jenna Jameson is involved .. Shows how much discretionary cash must be laying around Hollywood just to get your name on the closing credits .. I guess Showtime had to throw something in at 1 am ... Next time I think I 'd even rather be watching ESPN loop around every 30 minutes ...
0 Do n't get me wrong , this is a terrible , clichéd film , but it is a delight for fans of Olivia Hussey - quite possibly the most intoxicating beauty ever to grace the silver screen . One poster stated that she was unpleasant to look at - I wonder what his ideal woman looks like - Paris Hil - slut ? Blockbuster should really establish a sub - genre to this type of film , as the Fatal Attraction plot has become a genre unto itself . When will Blockbuster adopt the " Adultry " section ? It will fit in quite nicely between the drama and action sections , right ? This film revolves around Olivia Hussey , who spends a night of passion with an unstable yacht owner who may have murdered his ex - wife , who looks remarkably like Ms. Hussey . This ne'er - do - well proceeds to stalk Olivia and thus make her life a living - hell . I like Olivia Hussey , but I have no sympathy for characters in movies that cheat on their spouses , so I really was n't rooting for Olivia to make it out o this stinker alive.<br /><br />VIOLENCE : $ $ ( There is a smattering of violence in the film . Don Murray and Anthony John Denison get involved in a fisticuffs when Denison says that he will not stop seeing Olivia , Murray 's wife , because she is just too good in bed . Olivia also gets to handle a shooter and might get to squeeze off a round - I 'll let you watch).<br /><br />NUDITY : $ $ ( Olivia is the queen of brief nudity and supplies a little here . She has a love scene with Anthony John Denison and also has a shower scene - shot at a distance).<br /><br />STORY : $ ( We 've seen this plot before - a hundred times over , and oftentimes done much better . The true culprit , when trying to decipher why this film was a dud , is William Riead . The man 's dialogue is sophomoric and moronic . The man has no story - telling abilities and fails to build believable human reactions to the plot . These people , of the upper strata of society , talk like middle school kids - with a habit of sleeping during English class . I have placed Riead on the Never - to - be - Viewed - Again list).<br /><br />ACTING : $ $ $ ( The acting was n't " phoned - in " as the insiders say , but was hindered a great deal by Riead 's juvenile script . Olivia Hussey resorts to calling Anthony Jonh Denison " weird " and " crazy " to his face when he begins to stalk her . Hussey , who is still beautiful , delivers the best performance here but Denison was equal to the task of portraying a demented , love - crazed stalker . Don Murray was basically just there - his character not fleshed out , and Edward Asner , a terrific actor when given something with substance , is ill - used in this film ) .
0 The plot is plausible but banal , i.e. , beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and powerful man has a fling with a psychotic hunk , then tries to cover it up as the psycho stalks and blackmails her . But , what develops from there is stupefyingly illogical . Despite the resources that are available to the usual couple who has money and influence , our privileged hero and heroine appear to have only one domestic , their attorney and local police ( who say they can do nothing ) at their disposal while they grapple with suspense and terror . They have no private security staff ( only a fancy security system that they mishandle ) , household or grounds staff , chauffeurs , etc . Not even , apparently , the funds to hire private round - the - clock nurses to care for the hero when he suffers life - threatening injuries , leaving man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion . Our heroine is portrayed as having the brains of a doorknob and our hero , a tycoon , behaves in the most unlikely and irrational manner . The production is an insult to viewers who wasted their time with this drivel and a crime for having wasted the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray ( what were they thinking ? ) . And , shame on Lifetime TV for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offering .
0 * * * * * Warning : May contain SPOILERS * * * * * * * * * My HUGE problem with this movie is how totally self - centered and self consumed the adulteress wife is ! ! After having a one night stand with a slimy psycho she is being stalked by him . He calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends a video of their night together . He is OBVIOUSLY crazy and very dangerous . The problem is she only thinks he is dangerous to HER ( and exposing her secret ) . Not for one second did she ever have one thought of concern for her husband ! Did she even for a moment think of him possibly being in danger from this psychotic ? ? As soon as she realized how mental he was she should have warned her husband no matter what the consequences . Maybe there would n't have been a movie then but there really was n't one anyway so what 's the difference .
0 I really looked forward to this program for two reasons ; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I am an aviation nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters . I do n't like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level . The world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a Westland Lynx several years ago . The only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental Lockheed AH56A in the 1960 's . It hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter , which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its fuselage providing thrust.<br /><br />In short , no helicopter can fly much over 275 because of the principle of rotary wing flight . And the Bell 222 , the " actor " that portrayed Airwolf was n't very fast even by helicopter standards . And it did n't stay in production very long.<br /><br />There was a movie that came out during this time period called " Blue Thunder " that was much more realistic .
0 I remember loving this show when I was a kid . I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I 've seen . It was ultra high - tech for it 's time . It could repel enemy fire , do all sorts of acrobatics in the air , and take down nearly anything in it 's way . Now I go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is . The casts members are hardly compelling , there are a lot of cheesy moments , and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking . And nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage . Lot of the footages appear to date from the Vietnam War era.<br /><br />Airwolf has basically the same theme as Knight Rider , except the crime - fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car . After watching a few episodes , I found myself utterly bored . I do , however , love the theme music .
0 This film is roughly what it sounds like : a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend but with songs and ( fairly tame ) sex scenes ! The film is not sure what it wants to be and pretty much ends up a mess . It 's more expensive looking than most of director Al Adamson 's films but it 's not at the same budget level that viewers have come to expect from sci - fi films . The actors are pretty bad and unlike most Adamson films , there are no former big namers or B actors . Some of the music is OK but it 's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years .
0 Life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers . Such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for ; but to be effective they must also be entertaining . Unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read ; whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round . The first such work to become really widely known was probably George Orwell 's " 1984 " ( first published in 1948 ) , and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film.<br /><br />Watch or read it : and then , when you are feeling a little depressed by man 's inhumanity to man , reach for Cinderella 2000 . This is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing ; and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period . Most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments . To exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a DVD or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption . There are many worse films appearing as DVD 's these days , and frankly I do not care much what happens either way.<br /><br />So far the best of the films of this genre has probably been " The Handmaiden 's Tale " , but I would very happily swap them all for a well made film of Jack London 's towering novel " The Iron Heel " . Ambitious as this would be , it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it ( IMDb only lists a B / W silent version made in Russia in 1919 ) .
0 This movie is pure guano . Mom always said if you ca n't say anything nice ... but even Mom would say I had to do my part to warn others of this movie.<br /><br />I can guarantee this is the film that Geoffrey Rush wishes would just go away . I would hope that Greg Kinnear fired his agent .. from a cannon for giving him the script . After this Ben Stiller is probably praying for someone to pitch " There 's Still Something About Mary . " I have always been a fan of Wes Studi 's , thank whatever you hold holy that he wore a mask through the film so maybe people wo n't identify the film with him.<br /><br />It starts of promisingly with a stylistic spoof of the cinematography of the Batman films and then just loses something ... like a coherent plot and half decent effects.<br /><br />The jokes are telegraphed an hour before the punchline comes , and even then they fall flat . If you want to see an effective spoof of the comic book world see " Chasing Amy".<br /><br />RUN ! DON'T WALK AWAY FROM " MYSTERY MEN " !
0 Oh , it 's the movie - I thought I waited too long to take out the dog ... I ca n't believe I watched the whole thing . I guess I was optimistically anticipating that it was going to get better . Horribly disjointed dialog , pathetic acting , and totally improbable events . Like Toby 's mom hanging herself in the time it takes Col to walk upstairs and back down in a room with a 24 ' ceiling and no chairs , counters or anything around her motionlessly suspended body that she could have possibly used to climb on to do herself in . The little girl that played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole movie , and the puppy of the first couple was a close second . The basic storyline has potential and with a good script and director could be a seriously creepy flick , but this version sadly is not it . I get more scared when I open my electric bill every month .
0 This is not an entirely bad movie . The plot ( new house built next door seems to be haunted ) is not bad , the mood is creepy enough , and the acting is okay . The big problem I had is that , being familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle ( from Twin Peaks and other shows ) , I could n't get over how different she looks with her apparently new , big lips . I kept staring at them . They look so out of place on her face ! They make her look completely different ( and not better).<br /><br />Mark - Paul Gosselaar , the actor who plays Kim the architect who designs and pours his heart and soul into the house , does a fine job . And Lara ( as Col ) is also quite good ( but those lips ! ) as the owner of the house next door . Her husband , Walker ( Colin Ferguson ) is appropriately wooden . The various characters who live in the house were also fine . I particularly liked Pie ( Charlotte Sullivan ) and her husband , Buddy ( Stephen Amell ) , the first people to move into the house . The attempt to involve us in the overall neighborhood vibe fails , unfortunately , as the other neighbors are not particularly likable.<br /><br />For some reason the director was unable to make the " haunted " house particularly ominous . Other movies ( such as Amityville Horror , The Legend of Hell House ) manage to achieve that spooky feel , but it just does n't happen here . The closest is when Col paints a depiction of the house.<br /><br />Another thing that did n't work for me is the plot twist that occurs with Kim , the architect . Initially , he appears to be a victim of the house like the others ( it has sucked him dry of inspiration ) , but later he seems to have joined forces with it in evil.<br /><br />Overall , not a bad movie for horror fans if you can take your eyes off those big lips !
0 No mention if Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for " The House Next Door " from her 1970s novel of the same title , or someone else did it . This Lifetime - like movie was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough . Having read the book a long time ago , we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television . You know that when the critical moments precede the commercials , which of course , one ca n't find in this version we watched.<br /><br />The film 's star is Lara Flynn Boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through . From the new eyebrows to other parts of her body , Ms. Boyle is hardly recognizable as Col Kennedy , the character at the center of the mystery . This was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera . That goes for the rest of the mainly Canadian actors that deserved better.<br /><br />The film has a feeling of a cross between " Desperate Houswives " with " The Stepford Wives " and other better known features , combined with a mild dose of creepiness . The best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting .
0 The cast is OK . The script is awkward at times , and it takes a while to figure out what the point of the movie is . I found myself looking forward to doing the dishes . The Shehan bit is a cheesy statement on the war . I guess we were supposed to not notice it ... we did . Its a house , you did nothing more than kill forty five minutes . The shower part ... huh ? What was that about ? Literally , it is I have a client , " Ok you can use our shower . " Yawn . The angles are trying way to hard . There was a set of woods , suddenly its gone cause you can see right through , then next it is deep and animals are dying . In the end this is a horrendous movie of boring proportions .
0 It would help to know why it took so long for a book as movie - ready ' as " The House Next Door " to be adapted for film or television . The book was copyrighted in 1978 . One reason could be problems designing ' the house ' . The house in this Lifetime film is really so ugly that I ca n't imagine anyone buying it . In fact it 's so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was built.<br /><br />I'm not crazy about horror genre books , but this one was hard to put down when I came across it around ten years ago . The main characters are not the kind of people to look for anything occult in life , and this is one of the book 's strengths . They are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demon .. (or the devil personified ) without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book . However , it is a downbeat book for the most part , and I do n't think that appeals to the people who run Lifetime . Maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in years to come . A better house .. better music .. a better screenplay and darker lighting ... would certainly help .
0 Not that I was really surprised .... movies are never as good as the books that they originated from . I was looking forward to seeing this movie because this is one of my favorite books , even though I knew it would probably suck . I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised . However , they strayed from the book 's storyline too much , and the movie version did not convey how horrible this house really was . Ending was different too . Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible due to some really bad cosmetic surgery . The acting was unremarkable at best . Perhaps if a theatrical version was made so that they would n't have to stay so much in Lifetime 's " made for TV movie " box , it would be a better flick . If you saw this movie I highly encourage you to track down the book and read it . I doubt you 'll be disappointed and hope you enjoy it as much as I do every time I read it .
0 I read the book a long time back and do n't specifically remember the plot but do remember that I enjoyed it . Since I 'm home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and Hey ! ! It is a Lifetime movie.<br /><br />The movie is populated with grade B actors and actresses.<br /><br />The female cast is right out of Desperate Housewives . I 've never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and I get the gist . Is there nothing original anymore ? Sure , but not on Lifetime.<br /><br />The male cast are all fairly effeminate looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands I suppose.<br /><br />In one scene a female is struggling with a male , for her life , and what does she do ? ? ? Kicks him in the testicles . What else ? Women love that but let me tell you girls something ... It 's not as easy as it 's always made to look.<br /><br />It was n't all bad . I did get the chills a time or two so I have to credit someone with that .
0 For all its visual delights , how much better Renaissance would have been in live action . The animation is fantastic in the big picture , yes , but the characters are cold and hollow , much like the story and the style of this film . With real actors , perhaps the world of the film would not have felt so lifeless . There is much to admire here , but at the end I found that all I could do was admire . I did not enjoy the movie that much , and it clarifies something that I did not see before : that the visual elements can be the defining positive aspect of a film , but without a good story and strong characters , it can all be for nothing . I will not go so far as to say that this movie comes to nothing , but sometimes it comes dangerously close . I love Dark sci - fi thrillers . Blade Runner and Dark City are two films I thought were wonderful . But Blade Runner had its tragic villain and Dark City had its thought - provoking story arc . Renaissance has shadow and light , but little else . I wish I could have liked this movie more , but the weak story and the empty characters stood in the way of that . The Renaissance was a historical and artistic burst of color and life . How ironic , then , that one of the most bleak and lifeless movies I 've seen this year takes its title from the Renaissance .
0 A shaky hand - held camera was used , presumably to give the film a documentary look , but the effect was so exaggerated that I started to get motion - sickness just from watching it . It looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera ( no offense meant to CP sufferers , but I do n't think you would expect to get much work as a cinematographer ! ) The camera work was so nauseating , and so distracting , that my wife and I considered it unwatchable and gave up on it after 10 minutes of torture . I checked back a while later ( it was showing on TV ) , and it had n't gotten any better . I suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you may have eaten !
0 Why were there so many people crowding into an evening showing of Roberto Moreira 's " Up Against Them All " ( " Contra Todos " ) at the San Francisco Film Festival ? " It 's about a hit man , " my friend said . " Well . . . and it 's Brazilian , " I added . Beautiful multicolored people , tropical weather , lush rhythms , and a hip gangster plot ? Ample enticements no doubt.<br /><br />Somebody forgot to tell us one little detail : this is a very bad movie , really pretty horrible , and as unpleasant to watch as it is poorly made.<br /><br />So how on earth did " Contra Todos " get to make the rounds of Berlin , Melbourne , London , Manila , Stockholm , Cairo , Chicago , numerous smaller local festivals , and now San Francisco ? Apparently , because of the way the promotional process and the film festival circuit work.<br /><br />First of all , it won first prize at the Rio Film Festival where it was called the best Brazilian movie of the year . It must have been a bad year ; they 've had much , much better ones . Next , snappy synopses in catalogs plus imaginary buzz lead to crowded auditoriums and -- since the movie is n't featured anywhere and so avoids close scrutiny by critics -- it keeps going the rounds.<br /><br />Festival blurbs aimed at promotion sometimes goose it up a lot . A Chicago Festival one called " Contra Todos " " a speedball cocktail shot straight out of Brazil " and referred to Claudia 's s boyfriend as the " stud of the slum - like neighborhood . " Soninha is " Teodoro 's nymph - like teen - aged daughter of burgeoning sexuality . " The movie is " shot with the urgency of a frequently hand - held camera " and the director " works up a genuine and palpable sense of frustration borne from domestic desperation and decay . " The effect is " unbearably raw and honest , " and the movie hurtles " toward a conclusion as dead - ended as the lives on display . " Not the best writing , but it sure pumps up the excitement for a certain kind of potential viewer.<br /><br />"Contra Todos " does concern a hit man , two hit men actually , and a wife and daughter and a born - again Christian girlfriend . It 's shot -- in execrably ugly digital video with no talent behind the camera - work -- mostly in a barren - looking poor suburb rather than in one of the teeming " favelas " or village - like Brazilian city slums where such wonderful films as " Black Orpheus " , " Pixote , " and " City of God " were made , and not in Rio this time , but São Paulo.<br /><br />The hit man with family problems is Teodoro ( Giulio Lopez ) and his partner with a drug problem is Waldomiro ( Ailtan Graça ) . Both actors have a little TV experience as does the actress who plays Teodoro 's sluttish blonde wife Cláudia ( Leona Cavalli ) and Silvia Lorenço who plays his pouting , ready - to - revolt daughter Soninha . These actors might make it through the back corners of a few telenovelas . Who knows ? -- in a better directed film they might even be good . Aside from them there are some young men who get bumped off by Teordoro or , when he 's busy , gangs of thugs . The principals do n't work up much presence , even though the camera magnifies their pores.<br /><br />A couple of observers , one at the Berlin Festival and one at London 's , did see this movie 's failings but alas they 're buried in the Web hinterlands . Henry Sheehan noted from Berlin that the " film " ( his quotes ) was " the worst of the video works " shown . " The filmmaker seems to have chosen video simply because it was a cheap alternative to film , " Sheehan wrote , " and has n't made any creative use of the new medium " -- nor , he adds , done anything else creative.<br /><br />Sheehan pointed out the movie 's first big mistake : it " starts off as a domestic drama that 's supposed to ratchet up when , half an hour into the action , Moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends are professional hit men . Waiting the thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie ; it seems like a perfectly arbitrary decision and is , at the very least , a waste of time . But ratcheting up is all Moreira ever does , like a little kid who 's gotten a tool kit for his birthday , and goes around banging everything in sight without rhyme , reason or skill . " Devastating , but true.<br /><br />Writing about the 2004 London festival for Kamera.com , Metin Alsanjak tried to look at the positive side but nonetheless gave away the lack of redeeming features in calling the performances " easily the film 's best feature . " Yes , very easily , given that everything else is so bad . Alsanjak admitted that " this low - budget , violent and seedy account of the lawless in Sao Paulo is devoid of any likable characters , and as a result , of hope . Too dark and cynical to be a telling account of the human condition , the film is not helped by poor subtitling .. . " Alsanjak 's connecting Contra Todos to " Dogme " and Mike Leigh did n't help matters.<br /><br />Apart from that meaningless first half hour in which nothing redeems the boredom of our wait for the first acts of violence -- which , when they come , are just " banging everything in sight without rhyme , reason or skill " -- Moreira clumsily tries to redeem his abrupt finale by adding what appear to be outtakes right after it , followed by an implausible ironic concluding scene where one of the characters gets married . No doubt the director wanted to exhibit the " banality of evil " of low - level hit men in working class neighborhoods , but he ca n't make the characters , which he sees generically , come alive for us . And the structure of the film shows that he also ca n't edit his material . < br /><br />(Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 28 , 2005 . )
0 I found the pace to be glacial and the original story blown way out of proportion to the content . My wife slept through most of it and I did not try to wake her because I felt she was not missing anything.<br /><br />When Holmes and Watson enter the house and then are potentially caught , it is unclear how they could hide all of their entry and burglary tools so quickly . It is also unclear how the door to the study is locked , preventing the servants from getting in.<br /><br />The thing that puzzled me was right at the end when there was a glint in the eye of the broken statute . I have no clue what this was supposed to represent .
0 At the end of this episode Holmes asks Watson not to record the case for posterity . For a good reason ! The super sleuth left his little grey cells(sorry Agatha)at home for this tale . There is no deductive reasoning , no acute analysis of signs at crime scenes . Holmes bumbles along fifty yards behind the plot . The dastardly CAM is finally dealt to by an old frail - in a manner that would have made Charles Bronson 's heart swell with pride - six bullets in the breadbasket . In an ensuing chase a pursuer gets hold of one of Watson 's shoes . Mercifully the writer did n't decide to tack on the story of Cinderella to lengthen the film . The murderess , Holmes and Watson , escape scot free . Oh well , it is a bit of a change of pace in late Victorian London . A bit of sixgun law:- )
0 My roommate got the No , No , Nanette soundtrack as a dub on a tape and she proceeded to listen to it non - stop . After it finally totally brainwashed me into submission , I found the songs to be irresistible , especially the famous , I want to be happy , but I ca n't be happy ... But of coarse from the soundtrack I had no idea what the film was about . So the other day I saw a copy of it at the video store and I rented what was supposed to be a long lost version of the film . I was thinking that it was going to be amazing , because the soundtrack is so cute . Unfortunately most of the songs that I loved were nowhere to be found in the video I saw . Now I 've never seen the 1930 version of the musical but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dancing and beside that the sound was really bad through out and you could n't really understand what people were saying a lot of the time . Really the only highlights of this film were the outrageous 1940 's fashion . Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that stick out like rabbit ears and Kansas Kitty has this bizarre feather muff that she keeps on her fore arm and then has herself wrapped in this net scarf . The one dance sequence is a little weird too with Nanette doing this weird ballet stuff with pin - up girl imagery superimposed on top of her . Actually one more bright spot of the film was the artist Guillespe who dreams of being a fine artist but it currently condemned to drawing pin - up girls for money . I like how Guillespe keeps it old school , and disses Nanette when his masterpiece , the piece that was to make his career , is sold by Nanette for a paltry $ 5250 . Does n't she realize that that piece was his immortality ? Silly rabbit / girl with your feather rabbit ears on your hat . When will you learn ? Why does n't he just pencil in a cigarette before the ad men take the Work away ?
0 This version is likely available at your local dollar store on DVD . The print is not great , nor is the sound , but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 or so minutes to spare , you 'll get your money 's worth ( which is not saying an awful lot ) . Anna Neagle is extremely vapid as Nanette . Whatever her charms may have been back in the day , they are not evident in this film . A great number of fine character actors appear in this film ( Helen Broderick , Zasu Pitts , Even Arden ) , but the material falls remarkably short of their talents . Still , it is interesting to see how such accomplished performers make the most of the weak writing . The musical numbers ( there are really only two ) are quite horrible . Clearly the studio did not feel compelled to cash in on the rich musicality of the original " No , No , Nanette " . For what it 's worth , the DVD can be had for $ 1.00 . It 's worth that much just to say you 've seen it .
0 This sad little film bears little similarity to the 1971 Broadway revival that was such a ' nostalgic ' hit . Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove directed that revival , he rewrote the book extensively . I have a feeling that this screenwriter wrought as much of a change from the original 1925 version as well . I played the ' innocent philanderer ' Jimmy Smith on - stage in 1974 , and thought this $ 1 DVD would bring back memories . Not a chance . Even the anticipated delight of seeing " Topper " Roland Young play ' my ' part was a major disappointment . Three songs from the play remain , and are done very poorly . Even the classic duet , " Tea For Two " , is done as a virtual solo . The many familiar faces in this 1940 fiasco do not do themselves proud at all , and the star , Anna Neagle , just embarrasses herself . When I feel gypped by spending a dollar , I know the film must be bad . Another commentator mentioned the Doris Day version , which is actually called " Tea For Two " and is about doing the stage play ( the original , of course ) , so those who are seeking the true " No No Nanette " might find a more recognizable version there .
0 Well I just paid a dollar for a DVD of this movie , and it was n't even worth that . It seems to be from a poor print and is in the public domain , I am guessing.<br /><br />Neagle - despite her glory , awards , and reputation - is a homely British gal who ca n't sing or dance or act.<br /><br />Some of the fine old Hollywood character actors on display here must have thought they were doing a classic . Director Herbert Wilcox ( Neagle 's husband ) always thought Anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen . He was mistaken . She was improbably popular in Britain before and after WWII . Her " serious " roles are even more ludicrous than her musical appearance here.<br /><br />Only a couple of the famous songs are included and neither one is well presented . Skip this one and find the one that stars Doris Day . At least you get some real comedy and professional style dancing !
0 This film , originally released at Christmas , 1940 , was long thought lost . A very poor copy has resurfaced and made into a CD , now for sale . Do n't buy it ! The film is unspeakably terrible . The casting is poor , the script is awful , and the directing is dreadful.<br /><br />Picture Roland Young singing and dancing . And that was the highlight.<br /><br />Perhaps this movie was lost deliberately .
0 Franco Rossi 's 1985 six - hour Italian mini - series of Quo Vadis is a very curious beast , creating an absolutely convincing ancient Roman world shot in matter of fact fashion ( very few long shots , no big cityscapes ) , but playing the drama down so much in favour of allusions to classical literature and history that the story constantly gets lost in the background.<br /><br />The shifting structure ( much of episode one is played out via voice over letters ) and lack of narrative urgency makes the full six - hour version simultaneously demanding and undemanding , and certainly far too often uninvolving , but it has something going for it . The two main strengths are the characterisation of Petronius ( a thankfully dubbed Frederic Forrest , whose own voice would almost certainly flatten his dialogue ) as a man whose spent so long looking for an astute angle to survive court life that he 's become incapable of experiencing emotion , and Klaus Maria Brandauer 's unique take on Nero as a wannabe actor whose every move and action is calculated on how his ' audience ' will receive it . Elsewhere , Max Von Sydow briefly appears in a few episodes , being rewarded with the show 's most impressive and genuinely moving scene here he encounters a child as he attempts to leave Rome . It 's the kind of thing the show could do with more of , but it seems all too often to flatten every potentially emotional , inspiring or exciting moment under it 's relentlessly low - key direction.<br /><br />Unfortunately Francesco Quinn makes a staggeringly anonymous hero , blending in with the walls and coming over less as a Roman officer than that quiet , slightly gormless but inoffensive guy who works in the same office as you who never says much at office parties - you know , the one who you think is called Dave or something like that . The budgetary limitations are very visible once its Meet the Lions time for the Christians and Ursus battle with the bull is so determinedly low key that it just passes over you before the show just abruptly loses interest and suddenly ends.<br /><br />Not a trip I can particularly recommend , I 'm afraid , but if you do embark on it it 's one not entirely without its small rewards .
0 Do n't let the name of this film deceive you , In reality Jake Speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known to film . When Jake Speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen , which he is often not , he 's seriously relaxing . Perhaps this adds to his charm , but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to " chill out " whenever he gets the chance . Furthermore , unlike other daring heros who usually have an impressive list of talents , this man has none , unless of course you call sleeping a talent . Anyhow , this movie is basically worthless , the writing is sub par and the action , when there is some , is very lame . ( The machine guns on the jeep were n't bad , but that 's about it ) So , if you 're in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia , then this piece is perfect for you - It has a hero that not only puts himself to sleep , but also his audience .
0 So what 's the big fuss out of making an INDIANA JONES wannabe when you have an actor who 's cast as a fictional dude from adventure storybooks who does n't want to go out on an adventure ? ? ? Whoever wrote the script for JAKE SPEED was probably fired , but for whatever reasons possible , this movie greatly lacks in excitement ! That does n't mean it has no action , but look on the dark side of the picture . This has got to bare no resemblance to INDIANA JONES or other action - adventure thrills containing cliffhangers and narrow escapes , and JAKE SPEED was promoted that way using clever propaganda to make me and several others interested in it ! Besides , I 've never heard of the guy , so who needs his attention ?
0 This could be a strong candidate for " The Worst Flick Ever " . Perhaps without the presence of John Hurt , it could be tolerated as a kid - film . However , the TRAGEDY of this entire endeavor , is that John Hurt , one of the screen 's greatest actors , diminishes himself in this .... I gave it two points just because Mr. Hurt SHOWED UP ... I take AWAY 8 points , because he did n't run from it fast enough . As far as the rest of the cast , they are , simply , terrible . Janine Turner , as pretty as she might be , can not act to save her soul . And the lead actor is , for all intents and purposes , AWFUL . If you can spare yourself this embarrassment , please do so . It 's so bad , it almost HURTS .
0 I would have liked to give this movie a zero but that was n't an option ! ! This movie sucks ! ! ! The women can not act . i should have known it was gon na suck when i saw Bobby Brown . Nobody in my house could believe i had n't changed the channel after the first 15 minutes . the idea of black females as gunslingers in the western days is ridiculous . it 's not just a race thing , it 's also a gender . the combination of the two things is ridiculous.i am sorry because some of the people in the movie are n't bad actors / actresses but the movie itself was awful . it was not credible as a movie . it might be ' entertaining ' to a certain group of people but i am not in that group . lol . and using a great line from a great , great movie ... "that 's all I have to say about that . "
0 Alright , I got passed the horrible acting . I got passed the fact that Lil Kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands were n't moving , I got passed the weaves , I got passed the colored contacts.<br /><br />This is what killed it for me : In the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing . Lisa - Raye and Monica Calhoun stand up and , and then Lil Kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying , " Whoa , Whoa , Whoa , Hold up . Let 's CHILL OUT here for a HOT SECOND . " I am a fan of the western movie genre , and I never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of Clint Eastwood 's movies.<br /><br />If anyone thinks this movie deserves over a 1 rating , please tell me another movie that 's worse than Gang of Roses.<br /><br />I'm through .
0 This was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but that 's where it ends . It seemed like a lackluster Set It Off meets The West . The plot barely made any sense . There were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities . There were too may unnecessary things going on that did n't pertain to the plot nor did it help further the story along . There were also long blank moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations . The script should have made more sense as well as the directing . I had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie . But the casting was great in my opinion . If you 're only watching for eye candy then this is the movie for you .
0 Must have to agree with the other reviewer . This has got to be the WORST movie , let alone western I have ever seen . Terrible acting , dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic ( let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s ) , and oh , did I mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters ? I was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene . And the ending ? The least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie ... completely awful . And yes , it did contain every cliché in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable " let 's remember when " shots when a main character dies . Luckily I saw this on free TV . Do n't waste your time .
0 the costumes , the dialog , historical accuracy are terrible . For instance , - Stacey Dash and the hanging scene . The noose was accurate ( as for as I could tell ) , but that type of noose broke the person 's neck . Ms. Dash is left hanging at the end of the rope with no ill effects until the rope was shot . This type of not did not strangle the person , it killed them at the end of the drop.<br /><br />And right before they go in to rob a bank ( in a flashback ) , they pause on the street for a group hug - with their bandannas hiding their faces - that would have been obvious to people on the street.<br /><br />The poor editing - that is a battery pack under that shirt and it is obvious , the clip of the " long ride " shows them riding along , then reverses the film.<br /><br />I did like the fact that they kept the scene with the horse taking a crap - it seemed symbolic . The entire movie was crap .
0 An absolute steaming pile of cow dung . It 's mind - blowing to me that this film was even made . Hip - Hop and old westerns just do n't seem to mix . What target audience were these people thinking of when planning this trainwreck.<br /><br />Not only is the concept and plot a joke , but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare of a film makes their entire careers a laughing stock . The chick from clueless should never be forgiven and she is stripped of any remaining dignity she had . After reading the first ten pages of dialogue she should have been asking which one of her friends was playing this sick joke . After some research , I actually found a list of some other actors who passed on this film : Jada Pinkett - Smith , Denzel Washington , Brandy , Monique , Kim Kardasian , Jenna Jameson , Oprah , and finally Marge Simpson.<br /><br />Simply put , I would rather stare at a blank TV than watch this movie again .
0 Oh , come on people give this film a break . The one thing I liked about it was ......... Sorry , still thinking . Oh yeah ! ! ! ! When John Wayne came and shot up the the bad guys . Oh , sorry , wrong movie , I was thinking of a better quality film . Let me see now , I 'm still trying to defend it . Oh yeah , the chick that was from Clueless was in it . Do n't put down Stacy Dash . I mean , we all make mistakes . But boy , Stacy , you made a dooooosie.<br /><br />Hey , one thing that has never been done in a western , even an all female cast , they actually hung a woman from the gallows . That might be a western first . Even though her neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal , still , you 've got to give the director some effort for trying a western first . Also , I 've never seen a woman lynched from a horse in any western , although that did n't happen in this movie , I just thought I would give the director another idea for Gang Of Roses#2 , which should be made right after Ed Wood 's Bride Of The Monster # 2 . Maybe that was what the makers of this film were going for . Orginality , especially with an all African woman cast and an oriental cowgirl.<br /><br />Heeey , if the makers of Gang Of Roses want to make a sequel to this mess , you could have such slang like , " Hey , do n't you be takin about my homegirls " and " talk to the hand , baby , talk to the hand . " You could also have a surfer dude type deputy marshal that says things like , " That gunfight was TOTALLY RAD man , totally . " You know things like that .
0 Who ? What ? Where ? When ? Why ? The acting was terrible . Very robotic , rehearsed . I have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles . The screenplay was very elementary . By the end of this film , the story line was tied up . And Jeane Claude LaMarre should be tied up , too . So that he never attempts to write / direct another film .
0 Sistas in da hood . Looking for revenge and bling bling . Except da hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s . I do not remember any westerns like this when I was growing up . What would Randolph Scott say ? If he saw Lil ' Kim , he might say , " Alright ! I have to admit that I tuned into this just to see her . Bare midriffs and low cut blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy flick , but these are the cowgirls , and they are fine.<br /><br />Now , do n't go looking for any major story here , and the usual stuff of ghetto crime drama are here in a different setting . And , when 's the last time you heard John Wayne call someone , " Dawg " ? And , I do n't remember the Earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to the OK Corral.<br /><br />I watch this on BET , so I missed the action that got it an R rating , but I doubt if I will buy the DVD to see it unless I can be assured it was Lil ' Kim in that action .
0 I should have known when I looked at the box in the video store and saw Lisa Raye - to me , she 's the female Ernie Hudson A.K.A. " Le Kiss of Death " for * ANY * movie . Its almost * guaranteed * the movie will be bad ( e.g. Congo)if Hudson is in it ( with the exception of the Ghostbusters films , which were intentionally campy and bad ) . Despite my instincts , and the fact that I just saw Civil Brand , yet another cinematic " tour de force " starring Lisa Raye , I rented it anyway . After all , I ignored my " Hudson instinct " on OZ and ended up watching a very quality series so I figured I 'd give this movie a chance.<br /><br />If you are a lover of bad movies , this is a definite must see ! This has got to be the most unintentionally funny movie I 've seen in a loooong time . The plot is fairly straightforward : Racheal 's ( Monica Calhoun ) sister is killed by a band of brigands ( Led by Bobby Brown ! ) and , like many an action movie before this , she straps on her guns ONE LAST TIME and vows to avenge her sisters death . To do this , she reassembles the titular Gang of Roses ( supposedly based on a true story of a female gang ) and they go out and exact revenge and , along the way , there 's some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town . One nice thing I will say about this movie is that from what I could tell , the stars did their own riding and they looked GREAT galloping.<br /><br />The funniest ( albiet unintentionally funny ) scenes ? Look for when they introduce Stacy Dash 's character or when Calhoun 's character rescinds her vow not to strap on her guns ( replete with a clenched fisted cry to the heavens ) or Lil ' Kim 's character joking with Lisa Raye 's character or Stacy Dash 's character being killed or Lil ' Kim 's character convincing Lisa Raye 's character to rejoin the gang or the Asian Chick or Macy Grey 's character talking bout " The debt is paid " , etc . With the exception of Calhoun 's Racheal and Bobby Brown 's Left - Eye , I ca n't even remember the names of the other characters cuz I was laughing so hard when they were introduced.<br /><br />If the director had gone for parody and broad comedy this would have been a great movie . Unfortunately , he tries to take it seriously seemingly without first taking exposition , sound design ( in his defense , Hip - Hop is notoriously difficult to work into a period piece ) , set design , script writing nor period historical research ( was it me , or were these the cleanest people with the whitest teeth in the old west ? ) seriously . Usually when I see a movie that 's not so good , I ask myself " Could you have done any better ? " This is the first time in a long time where the answer is an unequivocal " YES ! "
0 Hmm , Hip Hop music to a period western . Modern phrases like " cool " and too many others to keep track of . " The sistahs are in tha house"!?French manicured nails on hard riding girls . Microphone packs CLEARLY visible on Li'l Kim 's back . I just ca n't go on with the litany of errors made by the director and editors.<br /><br />The acting is n't as bad as I 've ever seen . The women did well enough with a poor script.<br /><br />It was weird hearing Louis Mandylor speaking in his native accent.<br /><br />The girls are beautiful . The costumes fabulous albeit completely incorrect . I just ca n't believe they would dumb down what could have been a great story . I would feel offended to believe that this movie was loaded with such trappings that it would play well in the inner city.<br /><br / >
0 Pathetic is the word . Bad acting , pathetic script , cheezy dialog and hip hop music & fashion ... what the hell was up with that ? The directer of this movie acts as bad as the movie he made . If someone would have taken some time and effort to rework the whole thing , it may of had a chance . Bet the studios are still trying figure out how they could screw up up so badly.<br /><br />The absolute best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... the Asian chick was n't too bad neither . These too gals carried the whole movie . If it were n't for them I would have destroyed my copy of this movie.<br /><br />If any of those who have not seen this yet and had a notion to , do n't waste your time ... you'll only regret it later .
0 Wait , do n't tell me ... they threw out the movie and kept the out takes . You know , This movie could have been shot in a back alley in New York . The " Gangster Bangster " I guess . Gangster Rap , Designer gangster duster clothes including the kerchief which somehow got moved from the neck for protection from the dust storms to the head . I guess it was to protect the head from the heat filtering through the K - Mart hats . " Budget rent - a - horsie " , it seems , supplied the horsies . The one bedroom scene where the girl was talking and the guy was mouthing her words .... I though it was him talking . You know , watching this movie just confirms that , it is n't about the acting anymore ... its about looks and it 's about the money . Could n't have been too much of that where this movie is concerned . Well , all in all , I think that this movie will go down as the all time worst movie ever made . Just one more thing though , where was Ice T ? Did he finally get to go on Oprah ?
0 How is it possible that a movie this bad can be made . Bad acting . Bad script . Just an embarrassment all around . This is just one bad cliché after another.<br /><br />This movie actually has some big name stars in it . Unfortunately they 're singers and not actors.<br /><br />This movie made hardly any money for a good reason . The appeal of black cowboy movies just is n't there . It 's a shame they did n't have a good story to tell . < br /><br />This movie actually has some big name stars in it .

0 To be completely honest , I have n't seen that many western films but I 've seen enough to know what a good one is . This by far the worst western on the planet today . First off there black people in the wild west ? Come on ! Who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly , no no , completely retarded!Secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns . Thirdly what s with the Asian chick speaking perfect English ? If the setting is western , Asia is n't where your going . Finally , the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning . Now do n't get me wrong I 'm not racist or white either so do n't get ticked after reading this but this movie , this movie is the worst presentation of black people I have ever seen !
0 Some people have made a point of dissing this movie because they question the plausibility of black people in the Old West , Asian people in the Old West or women with guns in the Old West period . Get a grip and read a book . There were quite a few Asians ( Chinese ) , there were quite a few blacks ( freedmen ) and everybody outside of the gentile class had ready access to guns ; it is the second amendment you know . And as far as the use of modern language goes , none of those Westerns people have waxed nostalgic about actually used language that was consistent with the era depicted . Americans had different accents , used different inflections , spoke at a very different pace and used plenty of words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today . Do n't blame historical inaccuracy for the fact that you just did n't dig it . Be honest . Maybe you 're just uncomfortable with what you 're seeing .
0 Mario Van Peebles pops up for less than a five second cameo . Glenn Plummer shows up a little longer but its a ladies show all the way . Stacey Dash and Lisa Raye have been in better projects . Bobby Brown leers and mugs through his little time on screen . This is how it was pitched ... Five tough women shootin ' and lovin' in the Wild Wild West . Four black and one Asian . Oh and Lil ' Kim is a tough talking ' heartbreaker and Marie Matiko can bring in the pacific rim market . We can shoot it for less than 15 million . Straight to video and we 'll double but more likely triple our dollars.<br /><br />Greenlight that puppy.<br /><br />You got it boss .
0 This really does n't do the blues justice . It starts out badly with images from the voyager probe and Blind Willie McTell ( or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson ? Someone blind anyway ) apparently narrating from outer space ( ? ) and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians . Corny as it is , this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary . Afterwards the only thing to see is actors incompetently mouthing the classic tunes , filmed in fake 20s black and white intercut with the likes of Beck and Shemekia Copeland raping the same songs afterwards . This is a good device to show us why the old Blues greats were really so great , but it does n't make for compelling viewing . There is hardly anything in here that could justify making it a film and not a radio play . Nobody should be forced to see these badly done reenactments . It 's a shame for Wenders , Scorsese and especially for the Blues . Avoid at all costs .
0 This film is deeply disappointing . Not only that Wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of Blues , it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring . The only highlight of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories . Wenders 's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world 's culture ( or actually , American culture ) traveling in space , but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid . Yawn . I had expected more of him .
0 Watching this film for the action is rather a waste of time , because the figureheads on the ships act better than the humans . It 's a mercy that Anthony Quinn could n't persuade anyone else to let him direct any other films after this turkey.<br /><br />But it is filled with amusement value , since Yul Brynner has hair , Lorne Greene displays an unconvincing French accent , and the rest of the big names strut about in comic - book fashion .
0 Just saw this film and I must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film , this was absolutely horrible -- but not in the sense that was intended I 'm sure.<br /><br />It was like a child was directing this insult to intelligence with the belief that all would - be viewers are morons OR extremely hard up for entertainment OR both .... Thank God for fast forward ! I ca n't imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when making this film . I mean , you have actors trying to be serious , albeit barely , and a script that cries for a total rewrite , .... I just ca n't say anymore . If Harlequin Romance decided to do horror films , this would be a good effort.<br /><br />If you found this movie to be entertaining , then I strongly suggest that you seek out some guidance as to the purpose of movies . There is MUCH BETTER fare out there . Join a club , READ REVIEWS , but above all , avoid crap like this .
0 The Tooth Fairy is set in a small town somewhere in Northern California where Peter Campbell ( Lochlyn Munro ) has brought a farming property which he is renovating & planning to turn into a holiday inn , he is joined by his girlfriend Darcy Wagner ( Chandra West ) & her young 12 year old daughter Pamela ( Nicole Munoz ) who arrive to help for the weekend . While exploring the property Pamela meets another young girl named Emma ( Jianna Ballard ) who warns her that evil lurks within her new home , she tells a tale of an evil old witch known as the Tooth Fairy who takes baby teeth from children & then kills them . Pamela is worried & becomes even more so when she falls off her bike & her last baby tooth falls out , it 's not long before the evil ghost of the Tooth Fairy has her eyes on Pamela 's tooth & just for kicks she also decides to kill anyone she comes across ... <br /><br />Directed by Chuck Bowman I thought The Tooth Fairy was just another poor straight - to - video low budget horror film that fails to distinguish itself from the countless other 's which litter video shop shelves & fill late night obscure cable TV schedules , basically it 's not very good . The script by producer Stephen J. Cannell , Corey Strode & Cookie Rae Brown is a complete snooze - fest for the first 40 odd minutes , nothing of any great interest happen during this period at all & is basically dull exposition as if this stuff was going to surprise anyone . It introduces the character 's , sets the Tooth Fairy legend up & that 's it . The second half of the film improves slightly but even then it 's hardly spectacular stuff , there are a few decent set - piece gore scenes but apart from that it 's all very predictable & forgettable stuff . The character 's are n't great & most of them are there purely to be killed off , the story has inconsistencies like the story of the Tooth Fairy herself , it says she kills children after they give her their baby teeth so why does she go on an indiscriminate killing spree that has nothing to do with teeth ? What happened to her after the prologue set during 1949 ? Why has she come back as a ghost ? Despite being a ghost of some sort she seems very human having to open doors herself & using weapons to kill people , there is no attempt to make any use of the supernatural elements except the ghostly children who are played for maximum sentiment.<br /><br />Director Bowman does OK , it 's reasonably well made & there are a couple of half decent scenes but nothing to get that excited about . There 's nothing I would describe as scary or atmospheric in here & do n't take any notice of the comparisons between this & Darkness Falls ( 2003 ) as besides the teeth thing they 're quite different . The gore is OK , someone is shoved into a wood - chipping machine , there 's a decapitation , someone has their penis chopped off & the best scene when someone is nailed to a door & then has their stomach hacked open with an axe & their guts slide out.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $ 1,500,000 The Tooth Fairy is generally well made but there 's nothing special on show here . The acting is n't anything great but it 's not too bad & unusually I did n't find the child actors that annoying so that 's something I suppose.<br /><br />The Tooth Fairy is the usual just below average low budget modern straight - to - video horror fare that seems everywhere these days , if you can find a cheap copy then it might pass 90 odd minutes if your not too demanding otherwise it 's pretty poor & forgettable stuff .
0 Darcy and her young daughter Pamela are heading out to the country where her mum 's boyfriend Peter left his doctor 's position in the city to become a writer and fix up a bed and breakfast inn . Although this inn has a terrible past and Pamela learns from one the girl 's who lives in the town that a deformed witch once reside in that house . They called her the ' Tooth Fairy ' as she would kill kids after getting their last baby tooth . This work on the inn , has awoken the ' Tooth Fairy ' . Now she has her sights on Pamela and her last baby tooth , but if any gets in the way they face the same fate that awaits Pamela.<br /><br />This flick 's old folk myth of the ' Tooth Fairy ' does n't paint her in a very generous way , as you would believe when you were a child . Do n't they just love turning happy childhood memories into nightmares ! Another one which did fall into the same category was " Darkness Falls ( 2003 ) " . I ca n't compare how similar they are in the premises , because I have n't seen the latter , but I mostly read they have basically share the same idea . For a little straight to DVD film , this DTV effort looks good and has some promising images surrounding the senseless and traditionally by the book plot device . Low expectations are needed , as I would n't class it as an success , but I found it be to marginally entertaining.<br /><br />Cory Strode and Cookie Rae Brown 's story or background for this ' Tooth Fairy ' character is completely bare with it leaning more towards a slasher vehicle than anything really supernatural . Silly is a good way to describe what 's happening in this poorly scripted story , but it never really feels like a fairytale horror . The dialogues can seem rather redundant and morally hounded . While the acting is simply sub - par with the bland characters they have to work off , but director Chuck Bowman offers up some inventive blood splatter and terribly nasty jolts . This kinda makes up for the lack of suspense , the zero scares and generic tone . His direction is reasonably earnest and visually able , where he gets some atmospheric lighting contrasting well with its slick photography . The promising opening scene is creepily effective . His pacing can slow up in parts and there 's the odd and unnecessary slow - motion scene put in , but nonetheless it never gets too stodgy with something active occurring which made sure that I was n't bored.<br /><br />The make - up special effects provided the goods , as there 's enough repulsive gruel and the Tooth Fairy 's appearance is especially gooey . The figure of the tooth Fairy can look threatening in its black robe , bubbling make - up and swift movements . Being on location helps carve out a more natural feel and can get atmospherically rich in its sense of eeriness . Child actors can be incredibly annoying , but Nicole Muñoz was decent in her part . Lochlyn Munro and Chandra West are somewhat solid , but can be a little too causal in their performances as Peter and Darcey . The radiantly gorgeous Carrie Anne Fleming is one of their lodgers . P.J Soles shows up in small part as a superstitious neighbour who tries to warn them about the evil that lurks at the inn.<br /><br />I thought it was a okay time - waster that has a sound concept , which just is n't fleshed out enough and the execution is pretty textbook stuff . Watchable nonsense , but at the same time extremely forgettable .
0 I was duped into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another website and man was I p.o'd ! ! ! it took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up off the shelf b / c I did n't want anyone to see me . then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it . I thought that all my stress would pay off by the time I got home to and watching the movie b / c the review I read said the movie was a pleasant surprise ; what a joke ! if you can make it through the first hour of the movie then your in luck ! b / c it 's not until then the movie turn 's into a horror . do n't bother with this one folks , your better off watching " dankness falls "
0 Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and dabble in horror . The result , " Dead Above Ground " , is an abysmal piece of junk . Now , had I noticed his name in association with THIS particular film I 'd have put it back but no , I did n't have my glasses on and therefore I missed it , damn , I really do need to bring those with me while video shopping . First question would be , who the heck is the target audience for this ? It 's almost like a " scary " kids movie , but then again there 's topless babes and some gore and some bad words spouted here and there . The main characters are so cute that you want to see someone , anyone , go after them with farm implements of SOME kind . Seems that a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past , a child - murdering witch that collected children 's teeth lived there . Probably something the real estate agent failed to mention . Of course now in the modern day there 's a little girls ghost around to warn the real - live little girl that now lives there that something bad is going to happen . It does , and there 's also two Bubbas that were squatting on that property when the new owner took over so they 're out for revenge too . This whole thing has the feel of some made - for - cable junk that 's for the kids at Halloween except for , of course , the things that are n't suitable for little kids , so not only is this mediocre , it 's confused , too . A big boo and hiss to Anchor Bay for putting this out too , considering their usual track record with fine releases this is a new low . The UK gets a Phantasm Box Set , we get " The Tooth Fairy " . Hardly seems fair . 1 out of 10 , absolute garbage .
0 When I saw this movie cover , the first thing I thought was that it was made for video . The second thing that came to mind was how similar this looked to another terrible movie " Darkness Falls " , the tale of this dumb witch who killed people in the dark . Unfortunately , Darkness Falls was quite the masterpiece compared to this pile of garbage , and this movie should not have been made.<br /><br />The film starts off with a small back story for the witch , or , more like a pointless introduction of two little kids who are going to go meet the tooth fairy in hopes of her giving them a shiny new bicycle for their tooth . The opening is filmed poorly , and like the rest of the movie , it 's certainly not scary . In present time , the movie is about Peter ( Lochlyn Munroe ) . Peter 's renting out his house , and his ex - girlfriend Darcy ( Chandra West ) , and her daughter Cole come to stay there . Cole meets a neighborhood child , and they talk of the Tooth Fairy , and how you should n't lose your tooth , or she 'll come for you . Unfortunately seconds later , it looks like the Tooth Fairy steals her bike and knocks her tooth out ( How ironic ) . Will Cole survive the wrath of the Tooth Fairy , and will her mother and Peter be able to save her , and rekindle their romance ... this is a bad movie , you could probably figure it out.<br /><br />One of the main problems with this idiotic film is how undefined the Tooth Fairy is . They say she kills you if you lose your tooth , but nope . She 's more like a serial killer who kills at random , and if you lose your tooth , you 're definitely going to go . She steals a bike , so apparently she 's a thief too . I said earlier that the idea for this movie was based on Darkness Falls , but where did they get the inspiration for the Tooth Fairy 's appearance ? Let 's see . She looks like a burn victim , and she previously went around the neighborhood slaughtering children . Hmmm ... it 's almost as though she 's an exact rip - off of Freddy Krueger from the " Nightmare on Elm Street " films . And this is not the worst part of this awful mess , the climax is . This movie might have the most laughable climax ( Not literally laughable because I found it more sickening than funny ) I 've ever seen . Do n't see this.<br /><br />Just a little trivia . Lochlyn Munroe was in Scary Movie , and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3 , and they both were in this , so apparently Scary Movie stars are forced to end out their career with bad scary movies.<br /><br />My rating : 1/2 out of * * * * . 80 mins . R for violence .
0 this movie is similar to Darkness Falls , and The Boogeyman(2005)but it 's also much more graphic than both , and not as good as either.it's also slow and fairly predictable.it's also got shades of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror.plus , we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational / inspirational sermon.really,this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything.even though it is gory , the makeup effects are not very realistic looking.in fact they look kinda cheap.aside from all that , there is some really awful clichéd dialogue.and i wo n't say when , but there is a point where a couple of the character 's actions were not authentic or believable , given the circumstances.nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way.once you watch the movie , you'll know what i mean.there's also some gratuitous nudity for nudity 's sake.it just was n't necessary at all.the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good.better than this movie deserves.so,after carefully weighing the evidence , id say this movie was passable , but not good.my verdict for The Tooth fairy:4/10
0 The only scary thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel.<br /><br />From start to finish " The Tooth Fairy " was just downright terrible . It seemed like a badly - acted children 's movie which got confused , with a " Wizard of Oz " witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearing.<br /><br />Half of the cast seem completely unnecessary except for conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion . The sister of the two brothers , Cherise the aura reader and Mrs. McDonald have entirely no point in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but apparently could n't be bothered . The people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but come on , at least TRY and have a slight plot for them . The story in general is weak with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you wish they all get eaten by the witch.<br /><br />Add the weak plot and the weak acting together ( the children are particularly wooden ) and the movie ends up a complete failure . If only MST3 K could have had a go at this one ...
0 ... the child actors were annoying . Also it seems as if the makers on this film were struggling to fill 90 minutes . Decent death scenes , though . If not for the death scenes , this movie would have a very Disneyish feel to it.<br /><br />The main child protagonist did n't seem nearly as scared as she should have been . If I was in the middle of the woods with a tooth fairy ghost killer type individual , you can bet your arse I would n't be out wandering around and riding my bike.<br /><br />Overall , I 've seen worse ( i.e. It Waits ) but it 's nothing I would watch again , or recommend anyone bothering with it unless you 're an avid horror collector .
0 I tried to finish this film three times , but it 's god awful . Case in point : mom and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfast , mom stops for gas , crazy gas station weirdos mad at her hubby whose running the B&B try to rape her . She escapes , heads to B&B and instead of hubby going ballistic and she wanting to call the cops , story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both their parts . Wow.<br /><br />Other action logic deficits abound . Acting is also lukewarm , and the next door neighbor 's warning is delivered in a really corny , badly acted moment.<br /><br />Moments of intense gore / death unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of time - filler interplay between characters.<br /><br />Less focus on gore , more focus on mood and story would have been appreciated .
0 The Tooth Fairy is about the ghost of an old deformed witch that lures children to her house to get a prize for their loose tooth and then takes their lives . The first few minutes introduce you to the 1949 beginning of the legend of the tooth fairy and then switches to present day . The worn out horror plot is pretty much saved by the solid acting . They could have done without the Hammond brothers and a few other scenes , but overall the gore scenes were bloody but quick which had a minimizing effect . The eye candy is pretty good for both genders . Camera work is good . Dialog is fair but cheesy . I expected the film to be a bare bones , low budget , slasher with very few redeeming factors . I was surprised by the quality of the film .
0 Where to begin . This movie started out as something that seemed like a rip - off of " Darkness Falls " . An old , disfigured woman living in the woods , giving kids presents for their teeth . Sound familiar ? Then it changes . In " Darkness Falls " , the tooth fairy only killed you if you saw her . The tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what . Why did they need the rocker , his hippie girlfriend or the Bubbas and their sister ? I think the movie would 've been fine without them . It seems like the producers sat around and decided that they needed to put extra people in the movie just so the tooth fairy would have people to kill . Although , it 's nice to see a pretty blonde girl not being portrayed as a bubble - head for a change . Okay to rent , but I would n't suggest buying it .
0 i was enjoying this movie most of the time , but i kept getting the feeling that i was watching a children 's movie . i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then , while filming , decided to add in some blood , nudity and language . it was a big let down . there 's that believe the children magic that exists in movies like " babe " ( the pig ) or " angels in the outfield " that defeats the evil tooth fairy . the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy . when i bought this movie , i thought it would be a b - film response to the dreadful darkness falls ; somehow manage to make a better film with 1/4 of the money , but they do n't . they made a worse film and will probably lose the same proportion of money lost on darkness falls .
0 This movie has one redeeming feature . At one point , after a character is attacked by an ax - wielding fairy , his brother asks him , " Why is your dick over there , Chuck ? " After suffering through almost an hour of bad film , this almost made my drink come out my nose.<br /><br />Some of the acting is n't too bad , but the kids all stink and P. J. Soles should be ashamed of herself for doing this film . The story is weak and nobody does what you think ( or what common sense dictates ) they should.<br /><br />Of course , there are a lot of story points that do n't add up . For example , in one scene the ghosts of young children must concentrate hard to move a physical object so they can prove they exist , a difficult feat since they apparently ca n't interact with physical matter . However , minutes later they all pick up branches off the ground and beat the Tooth Fairy with them . Apparently they CAN sometimes move matter and sometimes they CAN'T. Go figure.<br /><br />Lots of blood and guts , though ... a few nice boobs . But this does n't make up for the deficiencies.<br /><br />If you want a movie about the Tooth Fairy , go rent " Darkness Falls " . I think it 's great , though a lot of other reviewers do n't share my opinion . At least it sets a mood .
0 This movie is so stupid it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous . I wanted to watch " Darkness falls " actually and thought that this was the movie . Boy , what a mistake ! I fast - forwarded as much as I could and still I could n't get rid of the boring moments . I just envy the people who was paid to play in or work on this movie . They were actually given money for this crap . Is n't that amazing ? I mean in this movie a man gets killed and chopped in a wood - grinder to little bloody pieces and few minutes later the mother and the kid talk calmly at the table as nothing happened and drink coffee . Please ! Come on ! Who gives money for such crap movies ? Oh , and the " tooth - fairy " was lame . Not scary at all and was obvious that it is a bored stuntman wearing a badly made make - up .
0 First , let 's get it out of the way . . . yeah , this film steals a LOT from ' Darkness Falls ' ( 2003 ) . The plot for ' Darkness Falls ' goes something like this : The Tooth Fairy , a murderous woman who hides her face due to disfigurement kills people who look at her out of revenge . In ' The Tooth Fairy ' ( 2006 ) , the disfigured Tooth Fairy ( who , yeah , hides her face ) unleashes her furious vengeance on just about anyone . A little too similar to be coincidence.<br /><br />But , what must be asked is this : If you 're going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie , why choose something as mediocre as ' Darkness Falls ' ? Sure it made a few bucks at the box office , but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered . A low - budget , straight - to - video movie will not have that same effect . And it didn't.<br /><br />As I watched the opening 15 - 20 minutes of the film , my expectations actually rose . There seemed to be at least SOME production value . The story did n't seem terrible , just blatantly ripped off . Past the first scene , we get an okay cast of characters including an ex - doctor with secrets ( played by that guy who looks like a Busey ) and some hot veterinary student ( Jenifer from Argento 's ' Masters of Horror : Jenifer ' ) . After those few minutes , however , the film just slowly goes down the drain . It serves all the basic horrible clichés including , but not limited to : some crazy old person with an unheeded warning , the buff dumb jock , the psychic , and the stripper with the heart - of - gold.<br /><br />One of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with a target audience . It 's kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time . When the adults were on screen , it had a more mature feel . When Star ( the stripper ) and whatshisface ( the jock ) were on screen , the dialogue went down to a more stupid , err immature , level . When the kid was on screen , it felt like an episode of ' Are You Afraid of the Dark ? ' . . . only less scary.<br /><br />Technically , the film is all over the place . The visuals range from fairly good to plain boring . The writing is subpar , as is the acting for the most part . On the plus side , there 's some excessive gore at parts ( including a fairly cool ( yet painfully predictable ) ) woodchipper scene and a pretty vicious nailgun scene . Also , if you 're looking for a bit of the sexy stuff , there 's a brief topless scene ( but if you want to see this chick topless , there are better films to do that ) . Other than that , there 's not much to bother with when it comes to this film.<br /><br />If you 're a huge fan of ' Darkness Falls ' ( do those exist ? ) , maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way . . . but , that 's about the only reason I can find to see this one.<br /><br />Final Verdict : 3/10 -AP3-
0 The first episode of this new show was on today , and it was horrible . Not only did Shaggy have a squeaky new voice that made listening to his lines torture , but it 's so far away from the original concept and animation style that it 's barely recognizable as a ' Scooby - Doo ' show.<br /><br />Even back in the dark days when Fred and Velma were gone and Scooby 's nephew Scrappy was there , the team still solved mysteries . This new show instead features Shaggy and Scooby battling a James Bond type super - villain and his henchmen while living in a mansion . There 's not even a van called ' The Mystery Machine ' ( and the teaser for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did NOT put my mind at ease ) . How can anyone take Scooby Doo and make THIS ? < br /><br />The show earns two point for two scenes featuring the whole Scooby Doo gang , all of whom speak with the correct voices except Shaggy , and even then I 'm being far too generous .
0 Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem . That is the first , most important , and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re - imagining Scooby - Doo and company.<br /><br />Shaggy 's voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the Scooby shows . They 've also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original.<br /><br />I'm not sure what they 're on about yet with the villain angle , but it surely is n't following the formula used in any of the previous Scooby shows.<br /><br />And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted . I like it , but it 's not real Scooby - Doo type animation . But the weird animation used for other WB shows grew on me ; this might , too.<br /><br />It 's worth a glance at -- once -- if you can handle the lack of proper Shaggy voice . That right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly . Besides , I am trying not to be an inflexible , nitpicking fan . Evolve or die , as the saying goes . We 'll see how it looks after two more episodes -- by then I 'll have formed a much more solid opinion .
0 Scooby Doo is undoubtedly one of the most simple , successful and beloved cartoon characters in the world . So , what happens when you 've been everywhere and done everything with the formula ? You switch it up right ? Wrong . You stop production and let it rest for a decade or so and then run it again , keeping the core of its success intact . That is to say , stick with the formula for the most part but add your particular flavour to it . This to me is why " What 's New Scooby Doo " worked , they want back to the classic Scooby Doo formula which had only successfully resurfaced a decade earlier in " A Pup Named Scooby Doo " but for the most part had not been tapped since the original " Scooby Doo Where Are You".<br /><br />The first sign ( to me ) of a weak offering is the inclusion of extraneous characters ; there might be a few fond memories from past iterations but generally if you think " Scooby Doo " you are n't thinking of Film - Flam , Scrappy Doo or Scooby Dum . Even worse , the exclusion of the other core members of " Mystery Inc " generally indicate a group of production people who do n't understand from a kids point of view how the show works . The basic premise has always been a group of people who are diametrically opposed getting together and through their own individual , stereotyped qualities manage to surmount the tasks given at hand.<br /><br />This next paragraph is just my theorizing so skip it if you want : I hope that I can explain why I think fiddling around with the basic elements of the show are detrimental with my interpretation of what the gang represents and how they contribute to the whole ; Fred represents the Driver , I think in general it is the purpose of Fred to give the group direction , organization and sub - tasks . Fred is n't a happy - go - lucky teenager , he 's your boss , your teacher , your dad , your authority figure . Fred moves without hesitation and is driven by tasks ( problem always equals solution for Fred ) . In many ways Fred is the antithesis to Shaggy . Shaggy is your best friend , that guy who is just a little more afraid of things than you are , he enables you to be brave , to not be at the back of the pack . Shaggy represents emotion and is frequently showing emotional extremes from elation to fear . Velma represents rational thought , she applies logic but as we see time and again on the show she requires clues that for the most part are collected in pieces by the other members of the show . Left on her own would Velma solve a mystery ? The group often finds itself in situations where truths are n't obvious and only through chance encounters do they achieve the necessary information to complete their task , chance is represented by Daphne . At one point ( I think it is the first Scooby Doo series ) she was known as " danger prone " . Writers have used Daphne to link unrelated events together through accident . She frequently is the one who finds the secret door , collection of objects or some other detail that can help the gang link clues together . Finally Scooby himself represents us , the participant . He is always in the centre of events , capable of all the things the rest of the gang are capable of , yet handicapped because he is not human and much like us the television viewer is unable to truly participate . Scooby Doo works because all these personified elements of problem solving are immediately identifiable and entertaining.<br /><br />Maybe I 'm over thinking things but , in my life I 've seen a lot of Scooby Doo ( being a 30 year old self - proclaimed nerd , it kind of rolls with the territory ) . To me there is a magic with the classic " Scooby Doo " formula that should never be messed with.<br /><br />As many have pointed out ; Scooby Doo is not a great work of art nor is it completely trite , it falls into the category of programming that can be watched by young eyes with a hearty bowl of breakfast cereal . Messing about with the raw simplicity transforms it into something else , something lesser .
0 I grew up with scooby(kinda the re - runs of where are you)I hate scrappy , love Daphne , and feel its not complete with out the whole gang . But this is sad , scooby doo is mystery solving comedy - not bad totally spy 's jap anime . i like " what s new " , they had to give danger - prone Daphne a makeover sometime :( and try to lose the * sex * drug jokes of many a generation , but this " get a clue " is flat out crap and should not have the Scooby name attached . They even tried to do some lame punk thing with the theme song . now i 'm gon na go watch my DVD of scooby doo where are you to wash the filth of this new series off my eyes
0 The animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds , and looks more like caricatures rather than characters . I 've been a fan of Scooby Doo ever since the series premiered in 1969 . I did n't think much of the Scooby Doo animated movies , ( I 'm talking about the TV Series , not the full length movies . ) , but some of them were pretty cool , and I like most people found Scrappy Doo to be an irritant , but this series is pure garbage . As soon as I saw the animation , and heard the characters , ( and I use that term loosely ) speak , I cringed . Also , Mystery Inc. , was a team , and without the entire crew to compliment each other , it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones , and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants . What 's New Scooby Doo was better than this . If you 're going to have a Scooby Doo TV series , include the elements that made the series endure so long . The entire cast of characters , and quality animation . They need to put this one back under the rock from where it came .
0 Shaggy & Scooby - Doo Get a Clue . It 's like watching a much - loved relative in the final throws of a degenerative illness ! ! Clearly the work of people with no soul , no love or respect for the original work . What in the name of all that 's holy were they thinking of ? It seems they were trying to go all post - modern and ironic . Instead it 's just abysmal swill ! ! What 's the point in taking up a successful franchise like ' Scooby - Doo ' if you just going to flush it down the toilet ? My son loves the original series - and even some of the spin - off movies - but he ca n't stand this drivel ! And let 's face it , you ca n't argue against the tastes of a seven year - old
0 I am 17 , and I still like most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes . I love the 1990s movies , and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade , Scooby Doo and the Goblin King , which I was n't expecting to be as good as it was . Anyway , back to Get a Clue ! I watched some episodes , expecting something very good , but from what I saw of it , I was n't impressed at all . First of all , I hated the animation . It was flat , deflated and very Saturday- morning -cartoon -standard , easily the worst aspect of the series . Even some shows I really hate had slightly better animation . Even worse , Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens , and I really missed Fred , Velma and Daphne , as they added a lot to the old episodes , when Scooby Doo was positively good . I also hated the character changes , because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries , Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superhero , something they would 've never had done in the movies or in the Scooby - Doo Where Are You ? show . The theme tune was n't very good either , I ca n't even remember it , and the jokes were lame and contrived . Though , I do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast , had they had better material , and had n't been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible , which they did , might I add . In conclusion , I personally thought it was awful , and I am not trying to discredit it , it 's what I personally feel . 1/10 Bethany Cox
0 As a mother of 2 young children who are or should I say have been growing up with the many reincarnations of Scooby I feel well positioned to comment on the historical and current version of Scooby.<br /><br />If as a family we had not seen any episodes prior to Shaggy and Scooby get a clue we may have enjoyed it as a light weight , nothing special Saturday morning cartoon . But that in essence is the problem it is in it 's current format so light weight that it will not have the longevity of the " old " Scooby and gang . I 'm sure it may succeed in a quick monetary return but I 'm sure the long term buy in of old and young is in very real danger of being lost . My 6 year old son on seeing the new version was really disgruntled and without any prompting said that it looked really badly animated and why was n't it anything like the last series(Where are you).<br /><br />Scrappy Doo was an anomaly but still infinitely better than this . Let 's hope Get a clue will be apropos with reference to the producers .
0 I thought " What 's New Scooby - Doo " was pretty bad ( yes , I 'm sorry to say I did n't like it ) , since Hanna - Barbera did n't produce it and it took a drastic step away from the old series . When I heard " Shaggy and Scooby - Doo Get a Clue " was in the works , I thought it could be better . But when I saw a pic of how Scooby and Shaggy were going to appear , I knew this show was going to be bad , if not worse . I watched a few episodes , and believe me , it is just yet another " Teen Titans " or " Loonatics Unleashed "- wannabe . No longer are Scooby and Shaggy going against people wearing masks of cool , creepy monsters that rob banks . Now they are going after a typical super - villain whom wants to destroy the world . Shaggy and Scooby - Doo have become more brave , too . Also , since Shaggy IS NOT going to be a vegetarian in this series , Casey Kasem ( whom actually IS a vegetarian ) , the original voice of Shaggy , will NOT voice Shaggy . He will only voice Shaggy if he does n't eat meat , and that was just a stupid corporate - done change to update the franchise , as if the Internet jokes were n't enough . So Scott Menville ( whom previously voiced Red Herring on " A Pup Named Scooby - Doo " ) voices Shaggy here . Believe me , the voice is REALLY BAD ! It makes Shaggy sound like a squeaky 10-year - old , and I must agree the voice definitely fits his new ugly look . However , Kasem DOES voice Shaggy 's Uncle Albert , which is a sort of good thing . Scooby - Doo , on the other hand , does not look that well . He seems to have been designed to look more like the CGI Scooby - Doo from the live - action movies . Also , Scooby 's Frank Welker voice ( need I mention Brain the Dog again ? ) still has n't improved . Robi , the robotic butler , is practically worse than Scrappy - Doo ! He tries to be funny and does " comical " impressions and gives safety tips ( " Remember kids , do n't stand under trees during a thunderstorm ! " ) , but it just does n't fit into a Scooby - Doo cartoon . Again , the Hanna - Barbera sound effects are rarely used here . However , on one episode , " Lightning Strikes Twice , " they use the " Castle thunder " thunderclaps during it , almost extensively ! ( Although they DO still use the newly - recorded thunder sound effects , too . ) Scooby - Doo has n't use " Castle thunder " sound effects since 1991 . But my question is , why use " Castle thunder " on " Shaggy and Scooby - Doo Get a Clue , " while NOT use it on the direct - to - video movies or even on " What 's New Scooby - Doo ! " ( Two episodes of WNSD used it , and it was n't enough , unfortunately . ) If WNSD and the DTV movies used it , then they might be better than this crappy cartoon . The day this show premiered , I watched the first episode , and it was SO bad I turned it off after only five minutes ! To get my mind off of this poor show , I rented " Scooby - Doo , Pirates Ahoy ! " which came out around the same time . And you know what ? The " Pirates Ahoy " movie was actually BETTER than " Shaggy and Scooby - Doo Get a Clue " ( and even better than " What 's New , Scooby - Doo ! " ) And it looks like the new designs that the characters have is n't permanent to the franchise . The direct - to - video movies coming out while this show is being made use the regular character designs , thankfully . But , whether you loved or hated " What 's New Scooby - Doo , " I do n't recommend it . But if you HATE the old series , THEN you 'll love it ! ( Oh god , I hope the old Scooby - Doo cartoon stay better than this new $ # * % ! ) Anyways , like WNSD , a really bad addition to the Scooby canon .
0 I have grown up with Scooby doo all my life , My dad grew up with scooby doo . We have just watched the first episode of the travesty that calls itself Shaggy and Scooby get a clue . What planet are Warner Bros on allowing this shambles to air . The characters could have been drawn better by my younger sister . The story could have been better written by my 3 year old twin cousins ( who are Scooby Doo fans too ) . Scooby and Shaggy just are n't ! ! ! ! ! if anyone but Casey Kasem does the voice of Shaggy it just is n't gon na work folks ! ! ! ! trust me.<br /><br />This program was disgraceful . What 's New Scooby Doo is much better . Why change a winning format . Bin this piece of garbage and go back to the true Scooby
0 What a let down ! This started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters . Admittedly it moved along at the speed of a snail , but I was nevertheless gripped and kept watching.<br /><br />David Morrissey is always good value and he Suranne Jones were good leads . The Muslim aspects were very interesting . We were tantalised with possible terrorist connections.<br /><br />But then Morrissey 's character was killed off and all the air left the balloon . The last episode was dull , dull , dull . The whole thing turned out to be very small beer and the dénouement was unbelievably feeble.<br /><br />Five hours of my life for that ? My advice : watch paint dry instead .
0 If you do n't mind having your emotions toyed with , then you wo n't mind this movie . On the other hand , if you enjoy British crime mysteries , following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end , you 'll be very disappointed.<br /><br />Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment : < br /><br / > * While the police utilize the CCTV cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery , the huge truck that stopped and blocked the children 's view just before her disappearance does n't get caught on camera . This is a critical piece of the mystery . It 's inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery.<br /><br / > * The movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the children 's movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera - visible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues.<br /><br / > * In England , driving is on the left . The director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right , several meters away from the flower kiosk , when it could have easily parked immediately behind , or even on the side ; as the huge truck did.<br /><br / > * The police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime , but ca n't find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene , even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall.<br /><br / > * Search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children ; this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting.<br /><br / > * It is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kiosk.<br /><br / > * It is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators even coaxing her daughter to do the same-- while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home . If she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails , she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park.<br /><br / > * The suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow / dimwitted --justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother but , he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self - incriminate.<br /><br />There are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a true sleuth aficionado 's disappointment . ' Five Days ' is a very weak British crime story .
0 I can not believe that I wasted five hours of my life on this rubbish . The previous five day offering by this author was highly enjoyable and I was really looking forward to this . But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible . Suranne Jones was the principal culprit since she either mumbled or gabbled her lines , but most of the rest of the cast followed her example . Notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid , old stagers whose diction was exemplary . Do producers not listen to productions before they are aired to make sure the dialogue is audible ? As a result I suppose I lost track of what was going on , and since the original plot line seemed to metamorphose into to the standard them - and - us thing between Muslims and the rest I soon lost interest . The ending was a complete anti - climax . A complete dud .
0 the writing of the journalists and the required over eager reckless press officer and sobbing grandma was ham - fisted and cliché ridden.<br /><br />I ca nt blame the actors , but surely someone must have said " are you joking I ca nt say this!" < br /><br />This episode had a press perspective and police perspective , while the police perspective was standard enough , the press perspective and characterization was overdrawn exaggerated and at points insultingly unbelievable.<br /><br />I notice that this was an HBO co production , if so then perhaps the sledgehammer stereotypes can be explained in that light,<br /><br />I was completely cringing during the press conference scene . it lacked any credibility and did not remotely ring true . 40 minutes into the first episode and I am still waiting for the suspense.<br /><br />Skip Five Daysthis . the 2008/9 production with these characters is far better and more suspenseful even if the crime is over the top.<br /><br />This story had unforgivable moments which can only be described as staggeringly unbelievable.<br /><br />For a press officer to start a press conference without an investigating officer present to take press questions.<br /><br />so unbelievable it felt like amateur hour.<br /><br />I then began looking for Journalists called " Scoop " and for Perry White to make an appearance.<br /><br />I saw the 2009 Hunter before " five days"made it to Australia , not realizing it was a prequel and was looking forward to Bonneville and McTeer going around again.<br /><br />Head shakingly awful .
0 Come on ! Get over with the Pakistan bashing guys . Bollywood can not only make brilliant movies- but can seriously affect a generation of viewers.<br /><br />I am a HUGE Bollywood fan- but anti - Pakistan movies just make me wince too much to enjoy screenplay , cinematography , action sequences- everything.<br /><br />I'm really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda , and there are movies like Main Hoon Na out there that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved to because of the quality of its Bollywood masala- but also because it tries to say : give peace a chance and shows that there are crazies out there on both sides who do not represent the masses .
0 Where to begin ? < br /><br />#1 Amitabh 's son , played by Akshaye Khanna , is 30.<br /><br />Amitabh 's been in prison for 33 + years ... he < br /><br />A ) Telepathically transmitted the sperm home?<br /><br />B ) Asked a nice Pakistani guard to mail it for him?<br /><br />C ) They allow conjugal visits in secret Pakistani Jails < br /><br />D ) All of the above < br /><br />E ) The producers were having a little too much bhang at < br /><br />the time they approved the script?<br /><br />#2 ) Amrita Rao ( Yummm ! ) wants Khanna - he 's yum , yum , yummy ... and apparently he wants her - who would n't , right ? ! ... But , when her dad gets ratted out , and then killed ( I hardly think this is a ' spoiler ' as you 'd have to be brain - dead and blind not to see this coming in the film ) he 's pretty emotionless towards this catastrophe and with the tip ( metaphorically ) of his hat , leaves her behind to save his dad , never mind her loss , and says ( paraphrasing ) " If god wills it , we 'll meet again " ... Basically meaning , " I 'm gon na get my dad and MY job done , sorry for your loss - CYA ! Buh Bye ! " - callus beyond even low - life Hollywood standards ... <br /><br />#3 ) There are so many holes in this horrible waste of time called a movie , that you can drive all the jeeps , trucks camels and any extra stuff through it . Pass - really , complete and total waste of time - Oh ! There is a great dance sequence ( yes , only one - as in dance sequence - regardless of quality ) great belly dancing - but NOT worth watching just for this.<br /><br />Rent Veer - Zaara or Lakshya ( will Hrithik Roshan ever take acting lessons ? ) for better Indo - Pak conflict movies ... In fact , Veer - Zaara is pretty damned good - 7.5/8 I 'd say !
0 The first half hour or so of this movie I liked . The obvious budding romance between Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer was cute to watch and I wanted to see the inevitable happen between them . However , once the action switched to the home of Ingrid 's fiancé , it all completely fell apart . Instead of romance and charm , we see some excruciatingly dopey parallel characters emerge who ruin the film . The fiancé 's boorish son and the military attaché 's vying for the maid 's attention looked stupid -- sort of like a subplot from an old Love Boat episode . How the charm and elegance of the first portion of the film can give way to dopiness is beyond me . This film is an obvious attempt by Renoir to recapture the success he had with THE RULES OF THE GAME , as the movie is very similar once the action switches to the country estate ( just as in the other film ) . I was not a huge fan of THE RULES OF THE GAME , but ELENA AND HER MEN had me appreciating the artistry and nuances of the original film .
0 Spoiler warning.<br /><br />When the main character 's sister is pushed down the stairs , the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her , to make it appear that she 's been drinking . But right before she is killed , tells her sister 's business partner ( Teri Garr ) on the phone that she has n't had a drink in 4 days . Yet the police never mention the results of a toxicology report ! And , the characters talk about her being drunk when she fell down the stairs . Huh ? Really bad mistake in this movie , which is pretty awful , overall . < br /><br />Surprisingly bad , considering the great cast . Some faults : the writing is n't very good , the music is made - for - TV bad , and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery from the first scene in the movie .
0 Chinese Ghost Story III is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films . The film delivers the spell - casting special effects that one can expect , but fails painfully on all other fronts . The actors all play extremely silly caricatures . You have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny . The plot is predictable , and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow . Towards the end , the movie begins to resemble old Godzilla films , including shabby larger - than - life special effects and a ( well , yet another ) ghost with a Godzilla head . Maybe I would have grinned if I was expecting camp.<br /><br />It is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with - in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula . They wo n't be able to do it again : the cash cow is now dead as a dodo .
0 Follows the usual formula in putting a new recruit -- this time the first African - American ( Cuba Gooding ) after President Truman desegregates the Armed Forces -- through the U. S. Navy 's deep - sea diver training program that is run by a racist zealot ( Robert DeNiro ) . If the program were n't bad enough , it 's got to be located in Bayonne , New Jersey.<br /><br />There 's nothing wrong with the performances . Robert De Niro activates his Southern accent and shouts gibberish effectively . Cuba Gooding , raised by a stern father as a poor black farm boy in the South , is the expectable paragon of rectitude . The girls -- one could hardly call them women -- are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee . They have minor roles and are mostly there to argue that their men should exercise common sense . Other decent performers -- Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook -- have even more perfunctory roles.<br /><br />That 's about it . Almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer . A ship is called a boat . Robert De Niro salutes indoors , uncovered . After a brutal assault on hospital personnel , he 's transferred out of his outfit instead of being busted . Somebody shouts " I 'm outta here " in the early 1950s . ( Maybe it was a common expression at the time . If so , " my bad . " ) People address each other by rank -- " Lieutenant " , " Boatswain 's Mate , " " Commander , " as they do in the Army , whereas in the Navy they are simple " Mister " ( if an officer ) or addressed by their last name ( if enlisted ) . I did n't bother to check if there was a rank called " Senior Master Chief " in 1950.<br /><br />Cuba Gooding has a tough row to hoe . Everyone in the Navy , it seems , hates Negroes except for one guy from Wisconsin . He stutters and is held in contempt by the others in his class . It 's like the scene in " Animal House " , in which the applicant to a tony fraternity is asked to wait in a room with a Sikh , a black man , and a blind kid.<br /><br />Gooding is an enlisted man , a second class petty officer . He manages to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated from medical school . In one of their arguments she pleads with him . She just wants to be a doctor and he should join her , quit the Navy , and lead a quiet life . " And just let life pass you by ? " , he retorts . Yes . Yes , just be a doctor 's spouse and let life pass you by . You can wave to it from the golf course in Boca Raton.<br /><br />These kinds of flicks were common enough in World War II . " Bombardier , " " Airial Gunner , " that sort of thing . Cheap as they often were , they had some educational features . You learned something about becoming a bombardier or a gunner . Here , the technical details are skipped over , perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them ( except Boyle 's law , which we learned in high - school chemistry).<br /><br />I could n't follow what was happening during some of the emergencies without which a movie like this would n't exist . If I got the mechanical problems right , it was because I guessed correctly . The direction is no help either . The movie abounds in close ups , so many that they lose any dramatic impact they might have had . And the emergencies are confusing because they 're ill focused.<br /><br />Why go on ? Want to see a better example of this kind of movie ? Almost any will do -- except maybe " G. I. Jane " , in which the abused hero is a heroin . Try the training camp scenes in " The Young Lions . " There the victim is a Jew . Or try " From Here to Eternity , " in which no easy sympathy buttons are pushed and the victim is a grown man who refuses to bend and who is active in bringing the conflict on , just like " Cool Hand Luke . " No easy excuses are offered , because easy excuses are too easy.<br /><br />Thoroughly formulaic , and not well done .
0 Final Score ( an average of various classic cinematic qualities- acting , visuals , creativity , payoff , humor , fun , ect):<br /><br />4.3 ( out of 10)<br /><br />Had " Atlantis : The Lost Empire " come out a few years ago it would have seemed like a bold , serious new direction in Disney animation . However , it comes just a year after the innovative and nearly genius " The Emperor 's New Groove " and marks a step back in freeing Disney from it 's repetative " Disney Formula " . I 'm a big fan of the feature length Disney animated films . Have to see them all love it or hate it . " Atlantis " is an animated throwback to " 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea " and similar live - action sci - fi adventures of the 50s and 60s . Problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea . It feels like a remake of something , even more so than actual Disney remakes(Tarzan , The Hunchback of Notre Dame ) . The characters are little more than a walking cliches of the usual suspects that typically populate these type of films ( the oddball mechanic , the gung ho general , the sassy tough women ) . Beyond Milo Thatch ( Fox ) and Rourke ( Garner ) the supporting cast is flat - out obnoxious . The movie also suffers from it 's succinct pace . Instead of fleshing it out into an epic story , Disney jams a lot in the usually brief running time brushing over opportunities to develop ... suspence , characters , anything really . They thow us into this new and wonderous world and barely let us get our barings . The awkward pace sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story . The animation is dark and dreary and cheap . This thing looks like a slapped together saturday morning cartoon . Let 's hope they have n't forgotten that 2D traditional animation can still be wonderous . " The Iron Giant " among others proved that.<br /><br />Negatives : The visuals , pace , and sheer lack of originality.<br /><br />Positives : Quite possibly the coolest death scene for a Disney villain in a long time . It 's the creative highlight of the movie .
0 If the makers of Atlantis had something to say in this film , its theme was ( literally ) drowned out by the emphasis on " special effects " over characterization . Almost as if in an attempt to " keep up " with the rest of the summer action blockbusters , Disney has ditched the character - driven , movie - with - a - message approach in favor of a Star Wars " shoot-'em - up " with stereotype heroes and villains.<br /><br />The art is cartoony and the producers think that they can rely on computer generated images ( CGI ) of flying fish - craft and submarines to fill the gap . They are wrong , and the days of beautiful , handcrafted animation is fast flying out the window in favor of assembly - line CGI.<br /><br />This movie is all spectacle with no heart . At times the film comes close to being a good , worthwhile movie , but frustratingly misses the mark so many times by copping out of talking about something meaningful and instead choosing to go with the glitz.<br /><br />Another problem with the movie is the pacing . It starts confusingly and then begins to rocket along with a choppy story editing style that is not appreciated . The viewer is rushed out of the door along with Milo Thatch ( voiced well by Michael J. Fox ) and is left thinking " Gee there must be an awful lot of stuff that 's going to happen once we get to Atlantis " . Unfortunately , not much happens . The secret of Atlantis remains a secret with the story - tellers not really knowing how to explain the legendary island / continent . They are afraid to commit to saying where Atlantis is , even in a fictional story . Is it in the Atlantic ? Is it in the Mediterranean Sea ? Who knows ? Nothing is hypothesized , even from a purely fantasy - based point of view . The viewer will leave the theatre asking themselves " Now what was that all about ? What was the point of the movie ? Why could n't the surviving Atlantean 's remember how to read when many of them lived through the disaster to the " present " day ? And WHY did Atlantis sink ? " and then promptly begin to forget about what they saw . There is nothing left to think about or mill over ... except the loss of money in their wallets.<br /><br />The characters and their motivations are equally unfathomable . From the eccentric zillionaire who founds the expedition with seemingly more money that existed on the entire planet in 1914 , to the ( spoiler ) collective consciousness that enters Kida and VOLUNTARILY deserts its people ! ? ! The crew are a collection of quirky , 2-dimensional people of anachronistically ( for 1914 ) P.C. race and gender . The demolitions expert talks like he came right out of a Warner Brothers ' Bugs Bunny short . Most of the jokes are gross one - liners that are largely missed by the audience for two reasons : They are delivered at lightning - speed pacing and usually mumbled . The way these supporting players do a moral turn - around near the end of the movie is hard to believe.<br /><br />While we applaud Disney for trying to create animated movies for adults - and this is the first Disney not to have cute , talking animals or objects - it fails to make the transition . Younger children will be frightened by some of the action scenes and be left in the dark by the large amount of subtitles ( when the characters speak Atlantean ) . In the first five minutes of the expedition , approximately 200 people are killed without a second thought . Obviously Disney thinks that if you did n't know who those people were , then why should you care ? Again , the movie has no feelings on any level.<br /><br />Mulan and Tarzan were the last animated movies produced by Disney that were done extremely well . Sadly , Atlantis harkens back to those failed attempts in the past such as the Black Cauldron and Hunchback of Notre Dame . Disney needs to get back to their roots . A sequel to Peter Pan is coming out shortly but one never knows what the results will be until you see it for yourself . And now that Disney has discovered Science Fiction one hopes that they will realize that that genre must have more than spectacle to it . We also hope that the upcoming " Treasure Planet " , a sci - fi adaptation of Robert L. Stevenson 's " Treasure Island " , will have more heart to it than the unfathomable " Atlantis : The Lost Empire " .
0 I went to see this one with much expectation . Quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest . Even a child can see the missing logic to character 's behaviors . Today 's kids need creative stories which would inspire them , which would make them ' daydream ' about the events . That 's precisely what happened with movies like E.T. and Star Wars a decade ago . ( How many kids imagined about becoming Jedi Knights and igniting their own lightsabers ? ) Seriously do n't waste your time & money on this one .
0 Some have praised _ Atlantis:_The_Lost_Empire _ as a Disney adventure for adults . I do n't think so -- at least not for thinking adults.<br /><br />This script suggests a beginning as a live - action movie , that struck someone as the type of crap you can not sell to adults anymore . The " crack staff " of many older adventure movies has been done well before , ( think _ The Dirty Dozen _ ) but _ Atlantis _ represents one of the worse films in that motif . The characters are weak . Even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best . An MD / Medicine Man , a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons , if we have not at least seen these before , we have seen mix - and - match quirks before . The story about how one companion , Vinny played by Don Novello ( Fr . Guido Sarducci ) , went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing.<br /><br />Only the main character , Milo Thatch , a young Atlantis - obsessed academic voiced by Michael J. Fox , has any depth to him . Milo 's search for Atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him . The opening scene shows a much younger Milo giddily perched on a knee , as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head.<br /><br />And while the characters were thin at best , the best part about _ Atlantis _ was the voice talent . Perhaps Milo 's depth is no thicker than Fox 's charm . Commander Rourke loses nothing being voiced by James Garner . Although Rourke is a pretty stock military type , Garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery . Garner 's vocal performance is the high point . I 'm sorry to say Leonard Nimoy 's Dying King is nothing more than obligatory .

0 Some have praised -Atlantis :- The Lost Empire- as a Disney adventure for adults . I do n't think so -- at least not for thinking adults.<br /><br />This script suggests a beginning as a live - action movie , that struck someone as the type of crap you can not sell to adults anymore . The " crack staff " of many older adventure movies has been done well before , ( think The Dirty Dozen ) but -Atlantis- represents one of the worse films in that motif . The characters are weak . Even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best . An MD / Medicine Man , a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons , if we have not at least seen these before , we have seen mix - and - match quirks before . The story about how one companion , Vinny played by Don Novello ( Fr . Guido Sarducci ) , went from flower stores to demolitions totally unconvincing.<br /><br />Only the main character , Milo Thatch , a young Atlantis - obsessed academic voiced by Michael J. Fox , has any depth to him . Milo 's search for Atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him . The opening scene shows a much younger Milo giddily perched on a knee , as his grandfather places his pith helmet on his head.<br /><br />And while the characters were thin at best , the best part about -Atlantis- was the voice talent . Commander Rourke loses nothing being voiced by James Garner . Although Rourke is a pretty stock military type , Garner shows his ability to breath life into characters simply by his delivery . Garner 's vocal performance is the high point . I 'm sorry to say Leonard Nimoy 's Dying King is nothing more than obligatory . Additionally , Don Novello as the demolition expert , Vinny Santorini , was also notable for one or two well - done , funny lines -- but I 've always liked Father Guido Sarducci , anyway.<br /><br />Also well done was the Computer Animation .

0 How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy , I never did see the reason for a remake . Not to mention a remake that was made with humans , the cartoon was just perfect enough , what 's the purpose of this film ? But it also seemed a little odd for Jim Carrey to be the Grinch . I mean he 's a great comedic actor , but him as the Grinch ? It just did n't make any sense to me . His performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments . Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable . The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy Lou - Who was over done and was n't needed . They actually just destroyed the story , period.<br /><br />All the who 's in Whoville are getting ready for their best Christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly . But Cindy Lou - Who is curious and worried about the Grinch that lives above them and that he 's not going to get as good of a Christmas as the other who 's . He kicks her out and decides that he does n't want Christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal Christmas all together to show the who 's what his version of Christmas is all about . But soon he realizes that the who 's may know that it 's a little bit more than what is the materialized version of Christmas.<br /><br />How the Grinch Stole Christmas was n't needed and was a bit over the top . I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version , at least in my opinion . The make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done , not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas ! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring Jim Carry . But at least this version makes you grateful for the Boris Karloff version that is played every Christmas.<br /><br />1/10
0 ( possible spoilers)<br /><br />Someone once asked Dr. Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas . He turned them down , insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 ( also in mind , perhaps , was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953 's The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T ) . When the good Dr. died in 1991 , his widow , Audrey Geisel , still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights . But with the commonplace use of CGI effects becoming a reality , Mrs. Geisel had a change of heart . Universal made her a generous offer she accepted ; she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character . Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result . Well , Mrs. Geisel , that makes one of us.<br /><br />The film was given a $ 123,000,000 budget ( which is more than even Heaven 's Gate cost , including the adjustment for inflation ) , which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup , set design , and special effects ( which are undermined < br /><br />somewhat by the rather hazy cinematography ) . Unfortunately , it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman ( scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit ? , which made much better < br /><br />use of a high budget ) turned in . Whereas the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials , this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch . It turns out that , as a child , he was the subject of ridicule , including an especially humiliating experience one Christmas at the age of eight . So it turns out that everything that ails our poor Mr. Grinch is directly because of the Who s . Trouble is , it seems like a rather long 105 minutes , with too much dead wood clogging up the story . That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more ... well , Grinchy . The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change ( and exponential growth ) of heart . Carrey 's Grinch is a loud , hyperactive oaf and , at times , a thug who , when made the holiday ` Cheermeister , ' trashes the Whoville town square in anger < br /><br />(hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked ) . This undermines the script 's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic , with all the Who s down in Whoville so unsympathetic ( at least in this interpretation).<br /><br />The Whoville of Dr. Seuss 's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas . The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled , selfish , materialistic ninnies ; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism . This is offensively < br /><br />hypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism , and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandising < br /><br />campaign.<br /><br />The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who , a small but crucial character in the original . The innocent two - year - old waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser , constantly questioning the false values of the Who s and trying to understand the Grinch 's point of view ( her one major scene from the original is re - enacted , making it seem out of character ) . She < br /><br />seems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations , thus making her a completely different , and more annoying , character.<br /><br />Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in their < br /><br />stockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this overlong , overacted , excruciatingly tedious , ham - handed , crude attempt to turn the children 's classic into a feature film . It proves once and for all that darkness , vulgarity,<br /><br />manipulation , and heavy - handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm , wit , sincerity , and heart . The folks at Universal should get down on their collective knees and thank God that this truly bilious $ 123 million stink bomb grossed $ 260 million domestically or they 'd not be here today . Furthermore it made Mike Myers ' The Cat in the Hat possible !
0 Having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christmases , I feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of Dr. Seuss ' classic tale , and well ... it 's not very good . First off , following a classic act like Chuck Jones ' animated TV special is going to be difficult for anyone , but this interpretation is so heavy - handed and padded as to be positively numbing . I will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags , but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab , at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of Christmas . Jim Carrey is typically over the top here , but that is completely at odds with the character of the Grinch . As characterised by Boris Karloff , he was a slow burn ; methodical and sly . There is no method to Carrey 's madness , and that is only the most obvious error made . Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are utterly wasted here . Why , Universal , why ? I mean , I understand that Tony Hopkins will take just about any role offered ( much like his countryman Michael Caine ) , but this one needs to be filed under " Films that should never have been made . " This does not bode well for the Cat in the Hat , an even thinner tome that Universal is prepping for this Christmas . I get the feeling that I will be making the same recommendation for that one as I am with this one : skip it , and either read the book or watch the TV special . This is 2 hours you can never , ever get back .
0 Ron Howard directed this ? The 1966 cartoon is charming , teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot . In this movie , Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy , manipulative , self - centered Who s . Jim Carrey is terrible , but I 'm sure it 's not his fault ; I imagine the script called for the nastiest person imaginable , so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is movie magic . Much like Danny Devito 's Penguin in Batman Returns , Carrey 's Grinch is so thoroughly unlikeable that any degree of comedy that might be mined from his character simply evaporates . Where the 1966 cartoon featured a Grinch that we could all identify with , Carrey 's Grinch is that angry , soulless old man that we 've all seen at one time or another , sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or tripping toddlers at the supermarket with his cane . This Grinch is thoroughly bereft of any degree of humanity , humor , or insight whatsoever , and his redemption at the end of the movie rings false . The whole movie rings false : there is some stupid Christmas lighting competition , a failed attempt at explaining why the Grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood , and an indecipherable mystery as to why some of the Who s have that weird lip extension and some of them do n't . Contrary to the 1966 cartoon , I would imagine children would find this movie tiresome , irritating , and filled with contradictory messages . Did we really need to see Slutty Smurf , aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier ? In addition , Ron Howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives . Throw in the requisite butt jokes , fart jokes , sex jokes , and other obligatory Carreyesque low - brow humor , and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon ( or book that inspired it ) as George W. Bush is from rational , lucid thought . Thumbs down on this big fat turkey .
0 DR . SEUSS ' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / ( 2000 ) * * ( out of four)<br /><br />If you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional Dr. Seuss classic fable , do n't see " Dr. Seuss ' How the Grinch Stole Christmas . " If you are old enough to read this review , then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture . It contains lots of colors , creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction , joyous load noises , and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village Whoville . Unfortunately that is where the movie 's positive elements end ; the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin , all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to do.<br /><br />Many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole Christmas from Whoville , so I will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read . However , I will say that the movie 's story is executed in three major acts ; the development of the grinch and setting , the Whoville festival , and the Dr. Seuss vision of the mean one robbing the Who 's from their Christmas . There are many familiar names within the credits here , but no familiar faces . Like in " Battlefield Earth , " I just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes . Regardless , there is SNL 's Molly Shannon as Betty Lou , the wife of Bill Irwin , the later playing Lou Lou , the father of little Cindy Lou , played by Taylor Momsen . Jeffrey Tambor is the Whoville mayor , Anthony Hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the film 's narrator , and Christine Baranski is the Grinch 's lone lost lover.<br /><br />The filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little Cindy Lou . The screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape ; there is little if any focus by director Ron Howard and the screenplay is predictable , too extensive , and contrived . The only character given any distinctions here is the Grinch himself , all of the other characters are puppets of the plot , shapeless and uninteresting . And the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic . Example - Grinch : Oh , the Who - manity!<br /><br />The movie 's redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer Michael Corenblith , the costume designer Rita Ryack , and the ample makeup department . " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " is a very good - looking production . The sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative ; it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream . The people of Whoville are plastered with makeup , to the point in which we can not tell the actor reciting the humorless lines . Although dazzling , I really ca n't give credit to the performances , for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is one actor who I can talk about . His performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself He is way too egotistic as the Grinch , too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of Seuss . Surprisingly , although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences , no laughs come from Jim Carry 's zany silliness . It is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for Carry to overplay his part . This factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy , which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic " How the Grinch Stole Christmas." < br /><br />After this movie , historians should check the coffin of the late author , Dr. Seuss may have rolled over in his grave.<br /><br / >
0 Ironic that Dr. Seuss ' fable emphasizing the non - commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most hyped , marketed , and successful blockbusters of the holiday season . The general gist of Ron Howard 's adaptation is that the Grinch 's bane against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the Who s themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for Cindy Lou Who ( played very well by Taylor Momsen ) . This movie makes an ardent , ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Seuss ' story , but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of Chuck Jones ' animated version . Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish Grinch , but whether it 's the dialogue , the pacing , or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot , the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly . There are some wonderful visuals and the make - up work is amazing , yet beyond the technical triumphs there 's an element or two here that 's missing.<br /><br />Succinctness?<br /><br />Soul?<br /><br />Or maybe Jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25-minute cartoon that Howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long . Howard , Carey , and crew are all very capable and talented , but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product . If you must see the feature - length version , rent it on video with Jones ' animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better . I give this film three cans of Who - Hash out of five .
0 About the baby : Why was n't big brother assuming he 'd be hungry for a bottle or some nourishment or a diaper change ? He should have been screaming non - stop after that many hours without care . Definitely stupid to take the baby from a safe place when he did n't need to.<br /><br />And why was the road miraculously clear whenever anyone wanted to drive somewhere ? Did n't any uprooted trees fall on the roads and block them?<br /><br />I ca n't imagine the cops at the roadblock not immediately following after any young person who would crash it , especially when they said it was dangerous to go there.<br /><br />That being said , it was nice to have a movie children could safely watch , for a change .
0 For some strange reason the film world is driven by fashion . Someone makes a film about a killer shark then all of a sudden the film world`s oceans are awash with giant Squids , killer octopusses and sea monsters of every ilk . A man is stalked by an erstwhile lover from hell then every film character is stalked by a cop from hell or a flatmate from hell or a babysitter from hell . Then when a major Hollywood company produces a big budget FX laden blockbuster about tornados then other film producers jump upon the bandwagon , the fact that they don`t have the budget to pull it off doesn`t stop them . NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS is a case in point . What struck me about this made for television film is the fact that it tries to hide its lack of budget by cutting to the ad breaks . Everytime a tornado appears the camara locks onto the horrified expression of the actors as they scream things like " Oh my gawd it`s heading this way " and " Run for your lives " then the screen fades to black saving the producers the need to up the special effects budget . Unfortunately NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS budget should have been upped to include better actors . The cast are by no means bad but they are unimpressive and lack the skill to carry a film which is character driven . Where`s Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them ? < br /><br />And the last word on this being a TWISTER clone ..... Yes NOTT was released a couple of months before TWISTER but TWISTER had been hyped for several months as being the Summer blockbuster of 1996 and NOTT has a rushed feeling to it which leads me to believe that it was made and released to tie in with the hype surrounding TWISTER
0 I am not saying that Night of the Twisters was horrible , but it was far from great . Mediocre at absolute best . I seems though that every time one type of movie is released , a second must be around the same time . ( Think about Armageddon and Deep Impact , Volcano and Dante 's Peak ) Night of the Twisters is really just Twister except worse and with mundane special effects.<br /><br />I have nothing against the actors who starred in it , even if they were n't great , it was the movie itself , the directing , the special effects , the whole storyline was just too strange to interpret . A series of tornadoes strike a town and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage.<br /><br />I really do n't know why it seems as though duplicates of disaster movies are released almost in sync with each other , but this one would have been better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt .
0 Carlos Mencia continually , violently , hatefully screaming " B**ch ! " at women is like screaming " N**ger ! " at black people , except it 's worse . Remember , the B word , unlike the N word , is the only pejorative term that is still associated on a daily basis with violence . " B**ch ! " is the last thing women hear before they are raped , beaten , or murdered . This guy is perpetuating violence by hatefully using the language of violence . Sounds like he may be a gay guy trying to cover by woman - bashing , so that he will sound like a hetero . And how about all the Nazi white guys in his audience giving the fascist salutes while their stupid little bimbo white women whimper tee hee hee at their side , clearly terrified to protest this tidal wave of woman - hating . Tee hee hee . Bet Mencia does n't believe or support free speech for THEM ! Come on , Carlos  do you want women to have the free speech to b**ch - slap you as loudly and violently and big - mouthed as you do , or do you think " free speech " is only for men to crap on women ? ? ?
0 It 's hard to believe people actually LIKE this dreck ! I do think kids can enjoy it , but to me it 's the kind of kid film parents ca n't bear to sit through . Predictable plot , boring Belushi , and possibly the worst kid actor of all time . I will give the director some of the responsibility for the kid , but she was truly painful to watch . I feel embarrassed for her now , having people know it was her . When she sang the Star Spangled Banner I had to turn the sound off -- then I came here and discovered they did that because she won Star Search . I 've always felt Jim Belushi should be ashamed to trade on the name of his wonderful , sadly missed brother , and this crap shows why . Zero stars .
0 If you rent a movie titled " Exterminators of the year 3000 , " the odds are good you know what you 're getting yourself into . I myself was sold by the promising descriptions of " nuke mutants , " " motor - psychos , " and of course the " exterminators " themselves which , according to the back of the movie - store case , are all cavorting around a post - apocalyptic barren wasteland wreaking all sorts of mayhem . Let the wacky hijinks and low budget buffoonery ensue -- at least , such were my hopes for this " film." < br /><br />Now I like the occasional terrible movie , and if you 're reading the comments on Exterminators of the Year 3000 , you probably do too . That being said , I rated this film a solid " 1(awful)"--not because I completely hated the film but because it is one of the most legitimately dreadful efforts at movie - making I have ever seen . The dialogue , the acting , the cinematography , the sound - editing , the editing in general , the plot , etc . , etc . , etc -- all are worthy of what must surely be low spectator expectations given that marvelous title.<br /><br />So what is really " good " about this bad movie ? It does have several of what my circle affectionately terms " quality kills . " A quality kill , for those few of you unfamiliar with the phrase , is n't a hard and fast term , but in general refers to someone killed in a particularly gruesome , creative , or ridiculous fashion.<br /><br />Exterminators of the Year 3000 also has a fair supply of " dialogue - so - bad - it - becomes - funny , " provided in great part by Crazy Bull , the aptly titled leader of the hapless motor - psycho gang -- who incidentally also provide most of the quality kills ( if you 're hoping for big things from the nuke mutants , think again , they play essentially zero part in the movie ... shucks ! ) . Crazy Bull , however , is all you could ask for in a b - movie motor - psycho . Shakespearean paraphrase and oddly PG - style insults are all he knows how to say ... and that 's terrific.<br /><br />Despite its quality kills and bad dialogue , however , if you 're looking for a truly entertaining bad movie , Exterminators of the Year 3000 does disappoint somewhat in that with its draw limited to things like silly and outdated special effects , quality killing , and bad dialogue , there is simply not enough to justify a full feature length , owing principally to the forty minutes or so in which the audience is forced to follow the characters in protracted and boring car " chases " and long desert hiking sequences ... All in all , a pretty good awful movie , but hey , it 's no Death Race 2000 .
0 Bottom of the barrel , unimaginative , and practically unwatchable remake of THE ROAD WARRIOR . This film follows the exact plot as the Filipino film STRYKER and is worse by far ! Bad acting , dialog , effects , dubbing , pacing , action sequences ... The list goes on and on . Italy made literally dozens of Road Warrior rip - offs in the early 80 's , some good , some bad . This is the worst by far , no contest . Not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable , the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half . There was 1 ( one ) good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie , and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding . But EVERYTHING else about this movie seriously reeks ! For actual post - nuke fun , go track down a copy of ENDGAME , AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK , or ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX instead . They 're much more enjoyable than this rubbish .
0 This movie surely has one of the strangest themes in history -- right up there with Ed Wood 's impassioned defense of cross - dressing in " Glen or Glenda?" < br /><br />The subject : playing bridge . The Park Avenue set plays it ; the Bohemians play it . The Russians -- who speak very questionable " Russian " and have most unconvincing accents when they speak English -- play it at the restaurant where they work.<br /><br />If one is n't interested in bridge , one -- even despite the great cast -- is n't likely to be much interested in this bizarre movie.<br /><br />Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine . ( Well --Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer -- as Lukas is an unlikely Russian . ) But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script .
0 This film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness . While a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony , it certainly ca n't promote winning bridge , so the satire did n't work for me . But there were some items I found enjoyable anyway , especially with the big bridge match between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film . It is treated like very much like a championship boxing match . Not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring , there is a referee hovering between the contestants , and radio broadcaster Roscoe Karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings . At one point he even enumerates " One ... Two ... Three ... Four ... " as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event . And people were glued to their radios for it all , a common event for championship boxing matches . That spoof worked very well indeed.<br /><br />Unfortunately , few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire . Paul Lukas does n't have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast ; lovely Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank McHugh were n't given good enough lines ; Glenda Farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film , but she practically disappears thereafter . What a waste of talent !
0 I usually enjoy Loretta Young 's early movies : her acting back then was light and breezy , and she sure knew how to wear clothes . But this one is just a loser from the word go except for a funny supporting turn by Glenda Farrell . Young is a hatcheck girl who talks her writer - husband ( Paul Lukas ) into becoming a championship bridge player . It 's not the most cinematic of games , and the long , talky middle part in which their marriage falls apart just about kills the film.<br /><br />There 's one interesting bit though . As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their climactic game , a series of quick shots show airplanes , trains , football games , even a diver in mid - air , freezing in anticipation of the event . It 's the earliest use of a freeze frame I 've seen in an American film . Wish the rest of it were that inventive - and funny .
0 Having read another review , I thought this movie would actually be good . I do enjoy the " B " movies , but this could n't even be classed as such . The photography is probably the only half - way decent thing in the movie . But the editing left much to be desired . It was very choppy and staccato . Whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job . The music was awful , specially anything atmospheric or scene setting . If the acting had been better , they could have pulled the movie off . Unfortunately , I 've seen better acting in porn flicks . If you want to see a " B " vampire movie , check out ' Blood Ties ' . You 'll be much more entertained .
0 To Die For ( 1989 ) was just another d.t.v . feature that made an appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties . The only thing notable about this feature was the last movie Duane Jones appeared in . Other than that there 's no reason to watch this vampire flick unless you like pseudo chick flicks masquerading as a horror film . A tired vampire longs for love and searches the back streets of L.A. looking for it . Will he succeed or will Vlad just strike out again like he has for the last century?<br /><br />This movie must have been big because a couple of sequels soon followed . They 're so bad they make this one look like a classic . I know this is a movie about vampires but the film makers could have used to lighting.<br /><br />Not recommended by me because I did n't like it.<br /><br />'nuff said ?
0 Contains spoilers . < br /><br />The British director J. Lee Thompson made some excellent films , notably ' Ice Cold in Alex ' and ' Cape Fear ' , but ' Country Dance ' is one of his more curious offerings . The story is set among the upper classes of rural Scotland , and details the strange triangular relationship between Sir Charles Ferguson , an eccentric aristocratic landowner , his sister Hilary , and Hilary 's estranged husband Douglas , who is hoping for a reconciliation with her . We learn that during his career as an Army officer , Charles was regarded as having ' low moral fibre ' . This appears to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition ; throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world , and his main sources of emotional support seem to be Hilary and his whisky bottle . The film ends with his committal to an upper - class lunatic asylum . < br /><br />Peter O'Toole was , when he was at his best as in ' Lawrence of Arabia ' , one of Britain 's leading actors , but the quality of his work was very uneven , and ' Country Dance ' is not one of his better films . He overacts frantically , making Charles into a caricature of the useless inbred aristocrat , as though he were auditioning for a part in the Monty Python ' Upper - Class Twit of the Year ' sketch . Susannah York as Hilary and Michael Craig as Douglas are rather better , but there is no really outstanding acting performance in the film . There is also little in the way of coherent plot , beyond the tale of Charles 's inexorable downward slide.<br /><br />The main problem with the film , however , is neither the acting nor the plot , but rather that of the Theme That Dare Not Speak Its Name . There are half - hearted hints of an incestuous relationship between Charles and Hilary , or at least of an incestuous attraction towards her on his part , and that his dislike of Douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy . Unfortunately , even in the swinging sixties and early seventies ( the date of the film is variously given as either 1969 or 1970 ) there was a limit to what the British Board of Film Censors was willing to allow , and a film with an explicitly incestuous theme was definitely off - limits . ( The American title for the film was ' Brotherly Love ' , but this was not used in Britain ; was it too suggestive for the liking of the BBFC ? ) These hints are therefore never developed and we never get to see what motivates Charles or what has caused his moral collapse , resulting in a hollow film with a hole at its centre . 4/10
0 This movie was a rather odd viewing experience . The movie is obviously based on a play . Now I 'm sure that everything in this movie works out just fine in a play but for in a movie it just does n't feel terribly interesting enough to watch . The movie is way too ' stagey ' and they did n't even bothered to change some of the dialog to make it more fitting for a movie . Instead what is presented now is an almost literally re - filming of a stage - play , with over - the - top characters and staged dialog . Because of all this the storyline really does n't work out and the movie becomes an almost complete bore- and obsolete viewing experience.<br /><br />It takes a while before you figure out that this is a comedy you 're watching . At first you think its a drama you 're watching , with quirky characters in it but as the movie progresses you 'll notice that the movie is more a tragicomedy , that leans really more toward the comedy genre , rather than the drama genre.<br /><br />The characters and dialog are really the things that make this movie a quirky and over - the - top one that at times really become unwatchable . Sure , the actors are great ; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York , amongst others but they do n't really uplift the movie to a level of ' watchable enough'.<br /><br />The story feels totally disorientated . Basicaly the story is about nothing and just mainly focuses on the brother / sister characters played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York . But what exactly is the story even about ? The movie feels like a pointless and obsolete one that has very little to offer . Like I said before ; I 'm sure the story is good and interesting to watch on stage but as a movie it really is n't fitting and simply does n't work out.<br /><br />The editing is simply dreadful and times and it becomes even laughable bad in certain sequences . < br /><br />More was to expect from director J. Lee Thompson , who has obviously done far better movies than this rather failed , stage - play translated to screen , project.<br /><br />Really not worth your time.<br /><br />4/10
0 I thought maybe a film which boasted a cast including Peter O'Toole , Susannah York , Michael Craig & Harry Andrews might be worth watching . Alas , I was wrong . Utter pretentious nonsense from beginning to end with both O'Toole and York overacting wildly . I watched it twice and still have no idea what is was about . I 've a feeling O'Toole plays the Laird of a Scottish castle who has a drink problem and likes reliving childhood games with his sister ( York ) . He is also barking mad . But apart from that , your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />The film has no redeeming feature whatsoever . I can only assume the cast and director were blackmailed into making this dreary , unimaginative , stagy piffle . Clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director . Risible .
0 Shame really - very rarely do I watch a film and am left feeling disappointed at the end . I 've seen quite a few of Ira Levin 's adaptations - ' Rosemary 's Baby ' and ' The Stepford Wives ' - and liked both them , but this just did n't appeal to me.<br /><br />When I read the plot outline - an award winning playwright ( Michael Caine ) decides to murder one of his former pupils ( Christopher Reeve ) and steel his script for his own success - I was excited . I like thrillers , Michael Caine 's a good actor , Sidney Lumet 's a good director and Ira Levin 's work is generally good.<br /><br />I wo n't spoil it for anyone who has n't seen it yet , but all I 'd say is there are LOADS of twists and turns . So many its kind of hard to explain the film 's plot line in detail , without giving it away . I enjoyed the first ... 45 minutes , before the twists and turns began to occur and at that point my interest and enjoyment began to fade out . Though I have to give Lumet credit for the very amusing ending which did make me laugh out loud.<br /><br />The main cast - Michael Caine , Christopher Reeve , Dyan Cannon and Irene Worth - were all brilliant in their roles . Though Worth 's obvious fake Russian accent got on my nerves slightly ( nothing personal Irene , I think any actor 's fake accent would irritate me ) . Not sure if Cannon 's character was meant to be annoyingly funny but Dyan managed to annoy and amuse - at the same time.<br /><br />Anyone reading this - I do n't want you to be put - off watching this because of my views - give it a chance , you may like it , you may not . It 's all about opinion .
0 I do not believe all the praise for this movie . The play and movie were a ripoff of Sleuth . Michael Caine wishes he were Olivier , and Reeves wishes he were Caine . Caine even had the nerve to do a remake of Sleuth with Jude Law playing his original part . Jude Law ? You mean the one that did the remake of " Alfie " ? < br /><br />This movie was made during a period of Caine 's career when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling debts . He would do anything for money . He would star in such award winning movies such as this , and " Beyond the Poseidon Adventure " . What seems to be driving the praise for this movie is Reeves death . He deserves better than to be remembered for this lousy movie . And so does Caine . This movie can be found in the $ 5.97 bin at Walmart . Along with gems like " The Island " , and " Blame it on Rio " .
0 Ira Levin 's Broadway smash comes to the screen with hardly any meat on its bones , a mystery plot with just a few tricks and twists but nobody worth caring about . Frustrated writer Michael Caine plots to steal the work of a brilliant young man and pass it off as his own ; his devious plan may include murdering the talented kid , which has Caine 's flighty spouse up in arms . The first act in which everyone is introduced is excruciatingly dead , with Caine doing everything an actor can to keep the pacing up . Dyan Cannon is miscast as his wife ( she 's too smart and clever herself to be passed off as a ditz ) and Christopher Reeve ( in the middle portion of the film ) seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the better writer . These three characters , and Irene Worth 's bothersome neighbor , are so undefined that what happens after the set - up barely even registers until well after the second act has begun . Sidney Lumet 's direction is stagy and fuzzy , the set design unconvincing and poorly - lit , and the finale is a total disaster . The actors struggle to give the script some substance , but with such thin material all we see are their laborious efforts . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 Gods ... where to start . I was only able to stomach about the first 10 minutes before I turned it off in disgust . Aside from the actor playing Robin Hood himself , the rest were just terrible . And , I can only stretch my suspension of disbelief only so far.<br /><br />From the very opening of the first episode , I lost count of how many errors , plot holes , and horrible costumes there were . It began with some poor peasant trying to hunt for a deer to feed his family . All well and good . However , the poor blighter must have been mostly deaf , because a handful of soldiers , in full armour , on horseback , were able to sneak up on him to within about 10 feet.<br /><br />Then , as he 's running away , he goes from having them 10 feet behind him , to a shot where you can not even see them at all , immediately followed by them about 20 feet behind him again . Then , he runs into some bushes , and is immediately manhandled by two of the soldiers ... who just mere seconds before , were galloping on horseback , dozens of feet behind him.<br /><br />The " armour " on the soldiers is so painfully obviously cloth which they tried to make look like maille , and miserably failed . Not to mention , the lead soldier 's " armour " being about 5 sizes too big for the poor fellow . Seriously , he looks like he is a small child wearing his father 's over - sized armour ! Finally , Robin manages to fire about 5 , perfectly aimed shots all around one soldier 's hand , in the span of about 2 seconds , from what appears to be a recurve bow . No human alive could make those kinds of shots , in that short amount of time , with a scoped rifle , much less a bow.<br /><br />After that , they escape the soldiers and stop to help an amazingly well dressed and clean " peasant " with digging a ditch ... something that all noblemen were willing to do all the time , right ? How this sorry excuse for a series ever got a second season is beyond me . The production costs ( at least for what I saw ) must have soared in the dozens of dollars ( or Euros) ... <br /><br />Seriously - I think a highschool drama class could have put on a better rendition . This was so bad , even that terrible Kevin Costner version of Robin Hood was better.<br /><br />I highly suggest you skip this monstrosity , and go rent or buy the mid-80 's " Robin of Sherwood " series . Much better written , acted , costumed , and produced.<br /><br />For shame , BBC ... for shame ...
0 Well , it 's Robin Hood as ' geezer ' all right ... just as advertised ! That did n't sound very hopeful , and alas , it was worse than I 'd suspected.<br /><br />A laddish Robin I can take ; a Robin who tangles with a pert dyer 's daughter I can credit ; but a Robin who exchanges not - very - funny banter with his single henchman is harder to swallow , and a Robin and * entire cast * who seem to be having difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of doom . How could anyone let such laboured delivery pass without re - shooting the scenes ? Again and again , Much sounds as if he 's struggling with half - comprehended Shakespeare rather than letting loose with a salty quip ; I hoped at the onset that it was just a failed comedy trait in a character clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick , but then it started spreading throughout the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Whatever else you say about Errol Flynn in the role , he had the knack of delivering high - flown dialogue as naturally as if he 'd just thought it up on the spur of the moment ... and as this production shows , that 's not at all as easy as it sounds ! If they were going to cast the characters as cheeky chappies , the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines : they sound as if they have n't a clue how to handle them.<br /><br />I'm afraid I did n't even like the pantomime Sheriff , for a similar reason ; the lines are clearly not intended to be taken seriously but delivered ( and in this case written ) with a nudge and a wink at the audience . They 're out of place all right -- fourth - wall - busting stuff -- but really not that funny.<br /><br />This much - promised production reminded me of a limping school play . The only actor and character I felt any appreciation for at all was the one playing Guy of Gisbourne , who was the sole one who appeared to have any handle on ( a ) credible villainy and ( b ) credible characterisation -- but frankly , I would n't have said that was a very good augury for the future of the series ! As of the time of writing , I 'll give it another shot in the hopes that things may improve and bed down a bit by next week , with less stilted scene - setting required and perhaps the actors more at ease with the dialogue : after all , the opening episode of " Doctor Who " was n't exactly a show - stopper , though it was nowhere near as bad as this . But if I see no improvement after episode 2 , I 'm afraid the series has almost certainly lost one viewer.<br /><br />Which would be a pity , because I 've got a soft spot for the " Robin Hood " legend on screen , from the adventures of Douglas Fairbanks to the sturdy reliance of Richard Greene . But this Robin fails to stir my blood in the slightest .
0 I can clearly see now why Robin Hood flopped quickly . The first episode of it is probably the worst ever thing BBC has aired . The opening scenes were about as intense , meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting , Robin Hood had no character , and the sword fight was just laughable . The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood snogging some cow clad in make - up at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century ? Nobody . The series may have improved drastically since then , but this first episode quickly put people 's hopes down , and is essentially a pile of cr*p . A great hero of England has been disgraced.<br /><br />"Will You Tolerate This ? " I wo n't , that 's for sure , unless the BBC start to understand what is a wise investment . 3/10
0 Siskel & Ebert were terrific on this show whether you agreed with them or not because of the genuine conflict their separate professional opinions generated . Roeper took this show down a notch or two because he was n't really a film critic and because he substituted snide for opinionated . Now , when Ben Lyons comes on I feel like I 'm watching " Teen News " -- you know , that kids ' news show , hosted by kids for kids ? Manckiewitz is not much better . It 's obvious they 've encountered only a steady diet of mainstream films their entire lives . The idea that these two rank amateurs have anything of interest or consequence to say about motion pictures is ludicrous . If they are reviewing a non - formula film , they are completely lost . Show them something original and intelligent -- they just find it " confusing " . Wait -- I think I get it ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids . While Siskel , Ebert , and Roper promoted independent films and were only hit - or - miss with the big budget studio productions -- what a surprise : these two guys LOVE the big studio schlock and only manage to tolerate a few indies . Plus everyone knows the age group TV advertisers are aiming for . The blatant nepotism is the icing on the cake . In what alternate universe do these guys qualify as film critics ?
0 I have been familiar with the fantastic book of ' Goodnight Mister Tom ' for absolutely ages and it was only recently when I got the chance to watch this adaption of it . I have heard lots of positive remarks about this , so I had high hopes . Once this film had finished , I was horrified.<br /><br />This film is not a good film at all . ' Goodnight Mister Tom ' was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4.5/10 of the book was missed out . Particularly , I found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this . There was not much dialogue , It was rushed and far too fast - moving , but I was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between William Beech and Tom in this film which was a true let down . The casting was not all that good , either . I thought this could have been really good , but it was so different to the book ! Anextremely poor adaption , one of the worst I 've seen . This deserves a decent remake that 'd better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage .
0 Goodnight , Mister Tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine . Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II . Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted with reluctant , gruff old Tom ( who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold ) our tale begins.<br /><br />And what a load of sentimental claptrap it is . In fact it 's just the old odd - couple buddy formula . Are n't any new stories being written?<br /><br />As I suggested there 's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in London apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around . And certainly no hint of the horror of the Blitz as London 's citizens file politely into air - raid shelters . Even when the local schoolteacher 's husband is declared missing presumed killed , he is later restored to life.<br /><br />I found ` Goodnight , Mister Tom ' cliched and obvious and John Thaw 's accent conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his ` country bumpkin ' accent.<br /><br />Incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that I disliked it and looking at fellow - imdb reviewers I seem to be in a minority of one.<br /><br / >
0 Let me confess . I found this video used and bought it because Guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket . But inside was another story . Besides the fact that the movie was basically a parody of " invisible - man " genre special effects ( highly visible strings and other such paraphernalia ) , the script wasted no chance -- in fact it went out of its way -- in insulting all non - WASP races and real - or - imagined homosexuals . Every insult aimed at a person in the script was either homophobic or racist or both . It starts to grate on your nerves , along with the shaky sound , candid- camera style photography and melodramatic story . However , the end is somewhat of a surprise . But by the time you get there , you hardly care less . Too bad , it could been a reasonably good movie .
0 The 3-D featured in " The Man Who Was n't There " stands for DUMB , DUMB , DUMB ! This inept comedy features lousy 3-D effects that makes the 3-D effects in " Jaws 3 " , " Amityville 3 " , and " Friday the 13th Part 3 " look better by comparison . Not to mention the movie is asinine to the extreme . This was one of many 1983 movies to feature the pop - off - the - screen effects . Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor got trapped in this mess , but at least it did n't kill their careers . Tambor would go on to star on HBO 's " The Larry Sanders Show " and Ron Howard 's box office smash " How the Grinch Stole Christmas " , while Guttenberg followed this flop with " Police Academy " and " Cocoon " . What them in those projects instead of them here in " The Man Who Was n't There " . If you do , you 'll regret it.<br /><br />1/2 * ( out of four )
0 this film tries to be immensely clever , and Tarantino - like < br /><br />before you try that though , you need solid filmic fundamentals . these include good sound , editing , set design etc ... <br /><br />lets talk about the sound in this movie . absolutely atrocious . i have never been more distracted by a sound track , ever < br /><br />and before we talk about low budget , film made in Chile etc .. lets bear in mind that desent sound these days is far more achievable than it ever has been . anywhere . and more info on technique is available then ever before < br /><br />the sound in this movie is plain bad . the foley in particular is out of place and inappropriate throughout , the atmos is equally terrible . i heard at least four loud clicks during the movie , which are the result of poor sound editing . the sound inside cars is awful , the sound of car doors closing is awful . the sound of the lady singing is wrong . foley is either overboard , or simply not there like the sound person just got bored and gave up . the spaces are wrong . everything about it is wrong < br /><br />and yet , not letting limitations of creativity get in the way , at the same time the movie tries boldly to be clever . for example the sound of the aquarium is used in the following street scene . we hear sound when we 're not supposed to . sound edits precede visual cuts . every trick in the book is used , and yet the foundations are just not there < br /><br />editing - wise we have scenes using heavy jump cuts , we have tinkering around with the time line etc etc etc , yawn . all of these techniques are imitated to a splendidly low standard < br /><br />overall the mix is crap , the sound is crap . and so , the film is crap . how can a movie with so many fundamental flaws be considered for awards and high praise ? Chile 's cinematic new wave ? the best creative output that Chile has to offer ? i hope not , and i think not.<br /><br />my theory is that Chile 's more selective and better talent avoided this film like the plague maybe due to its risqué content . equally , the film has likely received so much unwarranted critical acclaim from so called ' world - cinema ' enthusiasts for the same grubby reasons . they likely revel in it 's trashiness . of course film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality < br /><br />this film is rubbish . it 's all mouth and no trousers and is never deserving of a 6.8 rating . the film has all the production quality of a cheap Tarantino , new wave inspired porno !
0 This is an hybrid creature born at Carl Macek mind . With Robotech the second generation ( Robotech Masters ) and Megazone 23 into one miserable movie , that have no logic ! The story is very , very bad , and you can not forgive the action of Megazone when have nothing to do with Robotech . If this movie have so high rank is for the TV series and not for itself ! ! I did said it , the name can not save this !
0 You will recognize the plot immediately . Daughters of a divorced couple trying to get Mom and Dad back together again . Yes , that was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60s , 80s and 90s . But here 's the spooky thing . Even though Deanna Durbin was younger than the 21 year old Hayley Mills while playing the doting daughter(s ) roles , Durbin looks much older , as in adult . And so do all of her so - called siblings . < br /><br />And this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film . The girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits but look ridiculous in them as the director seems to take pains to point out their ample tops and tushies throughout the film . So you 're constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women . When Ray Milland and others start " hitting on " them you get the feeling as if they 're pedophiles , and you might be one , too for noticing those tushies and tops the director was pointing out . Teens or temptresses , little girls or little foxes , you are never quite sure what you 're supposed to be thinking of them as.<br /><br />The parents , too , seem very old and the whole film seems very dated.<br /><br />It is a rusty version of the Parent Trap and you should avoid it , or at least ensure your tetanus shots are up to date if you do n't believe me .
0 Well , the big money machine has done it again ! Disney very shrewdly takes advantage of morons like myself who feel we must own every video ( good or bad ) stamped with the Disney moniker . Why is it that I continue to look forward to these " sequels " which make Don Bluth on a bad day look like Leonardo DaVinci ? Cinderella 2 consists of three storylines ( already a poor choice ! ) Does n't one of the most endearing Disney creations at least deserve a linear story ? Of these three , only the last comes anywhere near the quality of animation and storytelling that I would expect . The music is atrocious and modern ( meaning in 2 years it will already be dated ) and adds nothing to the story . Why does everything have to be updated ? You know , the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness , so why not be respectful and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style ? Gee , I ca n't wait for a sequel to Sleeping Beauty . Instead of music based on the themes of Tchaikovsky , we 'll get music inspired by Britney Spears ! ! ! So Disney , if you 're listening , remember we 're not all indiscriminate children out here . How about throwing a bone or two to the fans who 've been around long enough to know the difference between craft and crap ?
0 Possible Spoilers , Perhaps . I must say that " Cinderella II : Dreams Come True " is one of the worst movies ever made . First of all , the movie was made during the height of Disney 's sequel rampage . It was created around the same time as " The Little Mermaid II , " " The Jungle Book II , " and " Peter Pan II , " all of which were disservices to their original film classics . ( Disney also made " The Hunchback of Notre Dame II " and " Atlantis II , " but I 'm going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place . " ) Let me go ahead and say that I am an avid supporter of good Disney films , and I absolutely adore the original Disney " Cinderella . " The sequel to " Cinderella , " however , was a waste of time . The character of Cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that I grew up watching . In the original , Cinderella was kind and loving . The new Cinderella had very out - of - character moments with current - era phrasing like , " I 'm going to do this banquet my way ! " Let me also tell you that new Cinderella ( as I have affectionately named her ) says , " Ewww ! " That is the anti - Cinderella . I try to find the best in people , but in the sequel , Anastasia , one of the stepsisters , is good ! What the heck ? Why ? They made it all out to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just horrible family members for poor little Anastasia . My question to the world : did the people at Disney watch the original " Cinderella " when making this sequel ? Well , it surely does n't seem so . If I remember correctly , Anastasia was just as abusive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine . I am all for redemption and forgiveness , but there was no point of redemption for Anastasia in this movie . In the first one , Anastasia was evil . In the second one , she is good . One just ca n't leave a story like this . I hope Disney realizes that this movie , among other movies , is shaming Walt Disney 's name . Perhaps now that Michael Eisner is gone , things will start shaping up around the House of Mouse .
0 The original is a relaxing watch , with some truly memorable animated sequences . Unfortunately , the sequel , while not the worst of the DTV sequels completely lacks the sparkle.<br /><br />The biggest letdown is a lack of a story . Like Belle 's Magical World , the characters are told through a series of vignettes . Magical World , while marginally better , still manages to make a mess of the story . In between the vignettes , we see the mice at work , and I personally think the antics of Jaq and Gus are the redeeming merits of this movie.<br /><br />The first vignette is the best , about Cinderella getting used to being to being a princess . This is the best , because the mice were at their funniest here . The worst of the vignettes , when Jaq turns into a human , is cute at times , but has a lack of imagination . The last vignette , when Anastasia falls in love , was also cute . The problem was , I could n't imagine Anastasia being friendly with Cinderella , as I considered her the meaner out of the stepsisters . This was also marred by a rather ridiculous subplot about Lucifer falling in love with PomPom.<br /><br />The incidental music was very pleasant to listen to;however I hated the songs , they were really uninspired , and nothing like the beautiful Tchaikovsky inspired melodies of the original.<br /><br />The characters were the strongest development here . Cinderella while still caring , had lost her sincerity , and a lot of her charm from the original , though she does wear some very pretty clothes . The Duke had some truly funny moments but they were n't enough to save the film , likewise with Prudence and the king . As I mentioned , the mice were the redeeming merits of the movie , as they alone contributed to the film 's cuteness . I have to say also the animation is colourful and above average , and the voice acting was surprisingly good.<br /><br />All in all , a cute , if unoriginal sequel , that was marred by the songs and a lack of a story . 4/10 for the mice , the voice acting , the animation and some pretty dresses .

0 I 'll just put it out here , that was the Worst sequel to a classic Disney film I 've EVER seen . In 1950 , Disney released what I hail as one of his greatest films of all time . Now Take away the great songs , add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost TV show . " Put it together and what do you get ? " the biggest load of Crud I 've ever seen . After i saw this , I thought it was all over for Disney . Cinderella should 've ended with , " and they lived happily ever after . " not this garbage . This film did not deserve a sequel like this . I thought it would be like " A twist in time " which was moderate but better than this . Also , What do we care of Anastasia ? She switched sides like Iago did , but it did n't help anyone .
0 I 've got a question for those who thought of this idea . Why ? What made them think to make a second movie of this . If memory serves , did n't Cinderella end with " They all lived happily ever after " ? I 'm pretty sure it did , or it was implied . Wait a minute , if they all lived happily ever after , how could there be a sequel ? Unless they were trying to make the most boring story in history , there could n't be a sequel . I mean sure , they could have Cinderella singing about nonsense for two hours , but why ? A movie that ends in " happily ever after " can not have a sequel ; if it does then they do n't live happily ever after ! Something 's got to go wrong which causes problems with the first ending ! Why ? That 's not right , it 's evil . That 's my final word on the matter .
0 I 've always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I 've ever seen , ( followed by Peter Pan 2 , and some other sequels like The Lion King 2 and the Hunchback of Notre Dame 2 ) . All these movies are made with the same idea ; because the movie has no plot , they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes . I 'm not saying the jokes are bad , but they make up most of the movie . The first time I saw the movie , I would have given it a 1/10 . But now I think about it , most kids do n't care how good the original movie was , they just care that the movie is entertaining . I still think the movie was a bad sequel , but that does n't mean it 's horrible . Now I think it deserves a 3/10 .
0 I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella , and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.<br /><br />Accordingly , I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV and I would be able to see it.<br /><br />I should have known better.<br /><br />This movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have just been left alone . It holds absolutely NONE of the originals super charm ! It seems , to me , quite rough , and almost brutal , right from the ( don't)Sing - a - longs to the characterization.<br /><br />While I remember the character 's telling a story through a song , this film 's soundtrack was laid over the top , and did n't seem to fit . Jaq 's transformation into a human is a prime example : Where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there , he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall ! And in the ballroom , there 's old barn dance type country music . It 's as though the writers forgot where and when this story was set . The upbeat fiddles certainly did n't fit.<br /><br />Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 is n't up to scratch with the original . The artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed . And we see part of Cinderella 's hoop skirt , which does n't feel right.<br /><br />The movie itself could have been it 's own story , I think that it should have been just that . I would n't say that I hate it , but I believe that it had many shortcomings . It seems to downgrade in a significant way from the beloved Cinderella original .
0 If you are under the age of 6 or 7 , then you 're going to really enjoy this movie . My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she watches it . As an adult , I ca n't stand it ! ! I 'm all up for sequels .... when they have a decent storyline . But this is nowhere near up to standard . Please forgive me for slating what is after all a kid 's film , but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much , you 'll understand why . My daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her.<br /><br />I've given this film 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained .
0 I had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend , who , like me , is a fan of the first . This movie down right sucked ! It lacked the magic of the first . You could actually understand every word the mice said , the animation is crappy , the palace is much much different from the first movie , there 's new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible , luckily the Prince did n't have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid . Basically its like The Lion King 1 1/2 except its different stories all told by the mice . The reason I 'm giving this a 2 out of 10 is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable .
0 Assassin Hauser 's ( John Cusak ) mission is to whack a Mid - Eastern oil minister , whose name happens to be Omar Sharif ( Neikov ) , in the country of Turaqistan which is run by American interests . Hauser poses as Trade Show producer to allow him to get to Omar.<br /><br />Sometimes a satire can be so overdone it becomes most annoying . Here it does too much : the government , politics , music , war , people not generally accepted by society , and did I mention " war . " And , that is what we have here - a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life . I am still asking myself why I continued with the DVD . Also , there are so many Cusak family members in this that John Cusak appears embarrassed by the family just being there , or is that just me?<br /><br />It used to be that a John Cusak movie , while a little offbeat , was , in the end , rather good . Not here . Believe that John Cusak had a hand in the writing and producing of this mess . Make of that what you will.<br /><br />There is too much going on in the movie accompanied by constant gun - fire , bombings , and shouting that you really can not focus or was that the point ? Probably . It just takes too long to set up the hit , which is largely forgotten until the last 15-minutes . In the meantime we have meaningless banter among all in the cast . And , chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei ? I do n't think so , but you know : the boy  girl thing  and they needed something to take up more time . < br /><br />Yes , for what they were supposed to be , ( offbeat and annoying ) the performances of Duff , and Kingsley were good . But , when I saw Dan Aykroyd 's character , in the beginning of the show , sitting on a toilet taking a dump , I knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well . I was not wrong . I am sure some will sing praises of this effort , but if a rose is still a rose by any other name so , too , is a mess  < br /><br />I now remember why I continued with the DVD . I was hoping that the story would somehow level out and save itself . Never did.<br /><br />Violence : Yes . Sex : No . Nudity : No . Language : Yes .
0 I really wanted to like this , but in the end it 's a poorly made film with too few laughs.<br /><br />The politics are spot on , it 's gon na offend the hell out of republicans but that 's what it 's designed to do . That alone gives me reason to chuckle.<br /><br />The problem is , it looks like it was made in a REAL hurry ( like about a week ) . And it contains a stupid subplot about some bimbo singer , which seems to be completely off topic.<br /><br />Turiqistan is obviously Iraq , or Afghanistan , or any other number of countries the US has f**ked with since the 50s . The humour is a little dark ( amputees dancing with prosthetic legs made by Tamerlane corporation ) but it IS on the mark , especially with the corporations cashing in on the reconstruction ( " democracy lite " ! ) < br /><br />However like a lot of satire criticising the US , it seems terribly heavy handed and laboured . I guess it 's running counter to so much bs propaganda so it has to bludgeon people over the head to make a point . Who knows . I prefer more of a nudge , wink approach - a bit of subtlety . But that 's just me.<br /><br />Anyway I might watch it again , perhaps I missed something.<br /><br />I'm hoping " W " is more on the mark .
0 War , Inc. - Corporations take over war in the future and use a lone assassin Brand Hauser ( John Cusack ) to do their wet - work against rival CEOs . A dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike . It was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on . I kept waiting for things to make sense . There 's no reason or method to the madness.<br /><br />It 's considered by Cusack to be the " spiritual successor " to Grosse Point Blank . I.e. , War is more or less a knock - off . We again see Cusack as an assassin protecting * spoiler * the person he 's supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience . To be fair , John Cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease . The brief fights look good . The rest of the film does not . It 's all quirky often bordering on bizarre . War Inc 's not funny enough to be a parody , and too buoyant for anyone to even think about whatever the film 's message might be , which I suppose might be the heartless ways that corporations , like war factions compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens . Interesting , but the satire just does n't work because it 's not funny and at its heart the film has no heart . We 're supposed to give a damn about how war affects Cusack 's shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by war.<br /><br />John Cusack gives a decent performance . His character chugs shots of hot sauce and drives the tiniest private plane but quirks are meant to replace character traits . Marisa Tomei is slumming as the romantic sidekick journalist . There really is n't a lot of chemistry between them . Hilary Duff tries a Russian accent and does n't make a fool of herself . Joan Cusack just screams and whines and wigs out . Blech . Ben Kingsley might have to return the Oscar if he does n't start doling out a decent performance now and again . Pathetic.<br /><br />It 's not a terrible movie , but in the end you got ta ask " War , what is it good for ? " Absolutely nothing . C-
0 Even the first 10 minutes of this movie were horrific . It 's hard to believe that anybody other than John Cusack would have put money into this . With a string of anti - military / anti - war movies already being destroyed at the box office , it 's almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind would want itself associated with this script.<br /><br />At first , it may have seemed like some kind of politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack(s ) all over again . But only about 90 seconds into the movie , it becomes obvious that this is a talentless attempt at DR STRANGELOVE.<br /><br />I liked so many of Cusacks movies that I thought I would risk seeing the DVD of this one . I have to say that I do n't know if Cusack is sane enough for me to even watch another feature starring him again unless somebody else can vouch for it . Cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred for George Bush and the Iraq war that he is willing to commit career suicide . Tom Cruise was never close to being this far gone . Not even close .
0 Quite possibly the worst movie that I have ever seen . When has Hollywood ever made a successful movie that attacked Republicans ? Why do n't they learn . The Dixie chicks have n't . These Lefties live in their own elite bubble interacting among themselves ; oblivious to the fact that most of America is much further right than they are.<br /><br />The best Hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely political at all.<br /><br />Dan Akroyd 's imitation of Cheney was bad.<br /><br />I would have thought Cussack could have landed better movies.<br /><br />It was n't funny .
0 Just utter trash . I 'm a huge fan of the Cusacks , this being the sole reason I watched this movie , but the only reason I can see for their presence was the reprise , in complete and depth less quality , their exact roles from Grosse Point Blanc . Apart from that , the films ' role as a political satire fails miserably as being too obvious for even the most moronic out there to serve any purpose . And to bill it as a satirical satire would be just plain insulting even to chimps . Imitation is , apparently the highest form of flattery , but seeing as though this is nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as meet the ( watch if your a moron ) Spartans in terms of political satire , lets leave well enough alone and let this one fade into the obscurity it absolutely deserves .
0 With this cast and budget you will expect more.<br /><br />John Cusack has made a number movies that border on the strange , yet still work . Neither he , his sister , nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this travesty of trite poorly written garbage.<br /><br />The movie is nothing more than a series of sight gags and poor ones at that . The plot goes nowhere , the writing is contrived , senseless and the characters paper thin . If you think of a movie as being three dimensional where the story and characters bring a depth to the imagery , this stinker comes across as flat as steamboat mickey.<br /><br />Dan Akroyd 's appearance in this brought back memories of another truly awful movie , 1991 's Nothing but Trouble . Frankly this movie is the type of project that kills careers and gets agents fired .
0 First things first : I 'm not a conservative . And even though I would never refer to myself as a liberal or a Democrat , I was opposed to the war in Iraq from day one . I think it 's safe to say John Cusack and I would probably see eye - to - eye on politics , in fact , I 'm sure we 'd become drinking buddies if we ever got to talking about how great Adam Curtis ' BBC docs are . My point is this : do n't discredit this review by thinking I 'm not a part of the choir Cusack is preaching to in War , Inc. There 's no question WI 's politics are tailored to appeal to my demographic , but the problem is , the tailoring is substandard and the the film Cusack co- wrote , produced and stars in , fits worse than a cheap suit.<br /><br />As they say " the road to hell is paved with good intentions . " Cusack , his co - writers , director Joshua Seftel and even the actors involved , no doubt had every intention of making an anti- war film every bit as biting and funny as Robert Altman 's M*A*S*H , unfortunately for the viewer , they ended up with one as unfunny and unintelligent as Michael Moore 's Canadian Bacon.<br /><br />The current state of US politics , foreign policy and the war " effort " is already absurd and , as a result , tragic , pathetic and , regrettably comical -- just watch The Daily Show and see for yourself . The bottom line is : you ca n't write material as funny as what the Bush administration provides us on a daily basis , so why try to compete?<br /><br />The main problem with WI is that it feels it was put together in a hurry . To get it done , Cusack basically cannibalized Grosse Pointe Blank ( one of his best films ) , changed the setting and crammed in a shopping list of ideas lifted from the collected works of Naomi Klein . Most of these ideas are rammed down your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film and what makes them so obnoxious is none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to Halliburton , the Neo - Cons and the US occupation of Iraq , are imaginative , clever or funny . The writers are so blinded by their own dogma they felt that by simply referencing these issues the film would be funny and subversive . The trouble is ... it is n't . By now these ideas are yesterday 's news and unless you 've been living under or rock or are so blinded by ignorance , denial and sheer stupidity ( read : a right - wing Christian ) , these jokes insultingly simple.<br /><br />Perhaps WI would work if it was more nuanced , subversive , offensive and fattened up with detailed research / insights into the Occupation . As it is , the jokes and sight gags are all surface and are so bad , with so little finesse , subtlety or satirical wickedness , they did little more than make me groan . Homer Simpson once said " It 's funny 'cause it 's true " and The Daily Show proves this every night ; War , Inc. however proves that just because it 's true does n't make it funny . The bottom line : hyperbole is n't required when it comes to lampooning US / Neo - Conservative politics ... it 's already a big enough joke.<br /><br />http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
0 This film tried to be too many things all at once : stinging political satire , Hollywood blockbuster , sappy romantic comedy , family values promo ... the list goes on and on . It failed miserably at all of them , but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end.<br /><br />Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR , INC . , it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort , especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique , rather than simply the poor writing , direction , and production of this particular film.<br /><br />There is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war . But poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening . Reminds me a bit of THREE KINGS , which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern .
0 I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist ( as this film was touted ) but this one failed me miserably . For me , the plot was a bit confusing to follow and I rapidly lost interest . I feel so sorry for John Cusack , Joan Cusack , Ben Kingsley , Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for getting involved with this movie . I 'll remain a fan of all of them but only time can heal my feeling over this one . The one thing I can say positively about the film is that Hillary played Yonica 's character so well that I did n't even recognize Hillary ; it took me a few scenes to realize that it was her . Luckily I rented it for $ 1 through Red Box ; had I paid to see it in on the big screen , I would be really fuming ! !
0 I guess I am coming late to the party . I just saw this 1995 version of Bye Bye Birdy on Sky TV . I did n't know it existed and was fully prepared to see the 1963 film version when I turned it on.<br /><br />I played Albert a long time ago and I am thinking of putting on an amateur production of the show because I remembered it as being so much fun to do . I was not impressed with this newer version . It just was n't enough fun . It was not colorful . It lacked the exuberance of youth . The lighting was bad . No one seemed to mention this fact . This is not a moody musical , it is bright and up beat . The lighting decision was a poor creative choice.<br /><br />Bye Bye Birdy is a farce , a comedy of errors . I got no sense of that in this version . The lighting was awful and it dulled the overall performances . The dance numbers seemed anemic as well . We do have music videos these day . At least the dance numbers should have measured up to some of the best of those , or how about some of the best of Broadway . The choreographer was asleep at the wheel it seemed.<br /><br />Although all the actors were supremely talented , there were some really bad casting choices . Vanessa Williams is not Latin , and with so many talented Latin performers out there , would n't it have been more correct to cast one of them in the role of Rosie . Vanessa is African American , lovely and talented , but bad casting . Jason Alexander 's effort was astounding , he always does intelligent work , but he just was n't Albert . He was miscast and I think that is obvious to most people who see this version.<br /><br />The medium of film is not the medium of stage . There needs to be translation from one medium to another . The exuberance and the flash of stage musical must be TRANSLATED to film . There is no merit being faithful to a stage script when it is being filmed . The spirit , the essence of the production must be brought forth . To me the 1963 film production of Bye Bye Birdy was bright and lively , while the 1995 production was as gloomy as the lighting and as lackluster as the dance numbers . It turned out to be an unfortunate waste of effort by many really talented people .
0 In my humble opinion , this version of the great BDWY musical has only two things going for it - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script . ( OK Vanessa Williams is good to watch.)But to me that 's all there is . Most of the cast seem to be walking through the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is and no wonder people walk over Harry McAfee when it 's played by George Wendt who looks like he 'd rather be back on a bar stool in Boston . Jason Alexander is passable , but that wig has to go and I saw better dancing in Bugsy Malone . As I mentioned , it 's good to have a version of the stage script now , but I hope the young out there , who have never seen a musical , DON'T judge them all by this .
0 Needless remake , and it ca n't come close to capturing the charm of the original . The extreme length causes more than a few yawn inducing parts . This version is ridiculously politically correct . The film lacks style , and mostly it lacks talent , not just with the acting , but the direction , sets , costumes etc . are all below par . It has a blatant disregard for period detail . Vanessa Williams is the only cast member that shows any flair , Tyne Daly is n't too bad . They should have left well enough alone . The singing ranges good ( Vanessa Williams ) to poor ( everyone else ) . Watch the original 1963 version and skip this one . There is not much here to recommend .
0 Why ? Because for one reason , there has never been a more adorable scene in any film than Ann Margret singing " Bye Bye Birdie " at the opening . She reprises it again at the ending , too ( in a different mood ! ) . Both wonderful . Rent it and see . Even if that 's all of it that you watch . You 'll agree , I 'm sure.<br /><br />Everything about the original was so excellent it just did n't need a remake , sorry ! Jason and Vanessa gave commendable performances , as well as Tyne and Chynna . In fact , all the actors and singers in this new version were giving their ' all , ' but it 's like trying to improve on " Casablanca " -- it just ca n't be done ! It 's even annoying finding yourself comparing the two mentally as you try to appreciate the remake , and it just falls short , through no fault of the actors .
0 Jason Alexander is a wonderful actor , but it 's ridiculous to cast him as a cuddly romantic lead . The fact that he dances so well , croons so effectively , and throws himself into the part so completely somehow just made him seem all the more creepy . In his more cutesy moments ( with the girl in the train station , in the final number with Rosie ) , I could n't take my eyes off him he was so repellent . You keep expecting him to drop the nice - guy act and start snarling . Vanessa Williams was the real star , the only performance that was better than the 1963 movie . By the way , if you see a production of the stage musical , the 1963 movie and this 1995 movie , you 'll see three versions that have more revisions ( different songs , same songs assigned to different characters and in different situations ) than any other musical I 've ever seen .
0 If I had n't been forced to watch this for work reasons I never would have made it past the first 10 minutes . And even then I admit I fast forwarded through parts . The ' 63 film version was vastly superior in all regards . Yes , I 've read this one is more faithful to the original play , but what a wise thing it was for the writer to change the script in ' 63 ! It 's overlong , it drags , the songs that are in this version and not in the film version are boring and unimaginative . The version of " Kids " in the ' 63 version was very funny and a true classic of sarcastic parent humor . In this version the Kim is way too old , the Conrad is * absolutely horrible * to behold ( when someone ripped his shirt off him I shuttered in disgust ... the director of this version has no idea what sexy is . ) . This Conrad ca n't dance , ca n't sing ( he ca n't even stay in tune ) and is simply repulsive . If Elvis Presley had really been like that his career would have been over before it began . As for the other actors , well I kept waiting for Alexander 's toupee to fall off as he danced and Daly was totally over acting as Momma . See Stapleton 's performance in the film version to see the same role properly executed by someone who understands comic timing . This TV version is nothing but a total waste of anyone 's time .
0 This film concerns the story of Eddy as mentioned in the title and his homecoming to old friends in a seaside community . The plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that Eddy left as a means to deal with death of a friend in which he feels in some way responsible . But this is inconsequential , as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized . Screenplays not always need be ' chatty ' , but they should at least assist the development of the story . Here one line attempts such as " he just took off " or " I know you do n't have love in heart " just do fully evoke something worth the audience 's time . Also whenever the writer feels at a loss to where to go to next he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to some indie mood music . Talk about trying to hard . If you are interested in a good film , the type that gives quality and substance over just style then this is not the film for you .
0 I go to UCSB and take some classes with the executive producer , Alison Anders . She 's a superb teacher and director so anything she put her name on , I thought must be pretty good . This film as a selection at the Santa Barbara film festival seemed like a good choice.<br /><br />While this movie included some nice shots and cinematography , the lack of story and coherence really took away from anything the it was attempting to accomplish . My main problem was that this was someone 's first film and you could obviously tell . Bad acting and an even worse screenplay stopped this film from getting off the ground . The soundtrack had some nice music that gave a sense of the main characters struggle to cope with the sadness that lead to his leaving and now returning the place he grew up . I just have to say that despite some of the better craft of the film , it 's lack of story and performance really prevented it from being some good .
0 Although in some aspects Seven Pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style , Gabriele Muccino 's project is rather mediocre . The movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end : hearts human and emotional , eyes physical and metaphorical . Seven Pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of Alejandro González Iñárritu 's Amores Perros and 21 Grams , with lots and lots of flashbacks . The problem is the story is quite predictable from VERY easily on through the movie . That 's too bad , because Seven Pounds could have been as authentically " good " if Ben and Emily had been put in the right hands .
0 Quite frankly it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well . What is it ? What is it about Will Smith that I just ca n't stand any longer ? I guess he just seems too hellbent on being taken seriously and obtaining an Oscar . I understand how bias this is , but unless he undergoes some new acting lessons I ca n't ever see him winning one . He 's a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor . He 's just not . I give him credit for trying so hard , and being able to cry at the drop of a hat . That 's about it.<br /><br />Seven pounds was kind of an eyeroller for me , right from the start . The suicide 911 call did n't intrigue me in any way . I was n't curious to know why he was calling in his own suicide . There were absolutely no surprises . The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had some decent on screen chemistry . Also , I do n't know her name , but the hispanic woman did an excellent job with her role as a scared and beaten wife . Woody Harrelson had very limited screen time , but I 'd say he stole the show whenever he was on.<br /><br />All in all , just an extremely run of the mill unoriginal plot . I could n't help asking myself the whole way through why I cared about any of these people . Never once felt sorry for ' Tim / Ben ' . He killed himself with a jellyfish ? Was the only survivor in an 8 person accident ? Geewiz .. didn't see any of that coming ... <br /><br />5/10 is pretty generous .
0 I considered myself to be quite melancholy , especially when I watch a great touching and tear - jerking movies . But not for this one ( which surprised me ! ) and it is also really surprising me to see how many people praised this movie so highly.<br /><br />There are several disturbing facts throughout the movies : 1 . Despite guilt - ridden Ben 's real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past , I find it disturbing that the film seems encourage this type of suicidal action . Some people may perceive this is a heroic action and some others think he behaves cowardly , in the end this was a disturbing action to me.<br /><br />2 . The movie story line is over - dramatized , but the logic is over - simplified . Medically , blood type match is required to be an organ donor . Toward the end of the film we learnt that Emily had rear blood type that limited her chance to get the donor within short time period . Nevertheless , it seemed that Ben had the rare blood type , same as hers which allowed him to be her donor and conveniently , despite the rarity of Ben 's blood type , he was able to donate not only his heart , but also his kidney , his cornea and his bone marrow which in all cases require not only matching blood type but also tissue antigen.<br /><br />3 . Why the doctors allow Ben 's organs being donated despite the jellyfish venom he used to kill himself?<br /><br />I might be over - analyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie . However , some disturbing facts outlined above hopefully will help you reconsider your plan to go to watch this movie . If you go for a soap - opera type of film , go for it . But it you go seeking for an intelligent entertainment , give this one a miss !
0 SEVEN POUNDS : EMOTIONALLY FLAT , ILLOGICAL , MORALLY DISTURBING < br /><br />The movie was distributed in Italy as " Seven Souls " . I was curious about the original title and , after some research , I found out that it refers to Shakespeare 's Merchant of Venice , where the usurer Shylock makes a terrible bond with the merchant Antonio , who will have to give him a " pound " of his flesh , in case he is not able to repay his debt . Whereas the Italian translation makes Ben 's plan something deeply human , characterized by human sympathy , the original one , though cultivated enough to remain unperceived by anyone , makes it , just in its reference to the flesh , something cold , rational , deep - rooted in the physical side of man . Unfortunately , I think that the real quality of Ben 's plan is revealed by the original title : it'a a cold machination , aimed at " donating " parts of his body , but lacking any authentic human empathy , at least the audience is not given the chance to see or perceive any pure relation of souls within the whole movie . The only exception is the love - story with the girl , which seems to be a sort of non - programmed incident , to which Ben yields , but incapable of conveying true emotional involvement . I really did n't like the idea at the core of the movie : the idea that a person , however devoured by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other people he himself has caused , takes the resolute decision to expiate his sense of guilt through suicide : besides being improbable , it makes no sense . I would have liked , and I think it would have been more positive if , in the end , Ben had decided to abandon the idea of committing suicide and go on living , thus helping those same people , and maybe many more , just standing near them , and helping them through his presence . He would n't have saved their lives miraculously , of course : this would have probably caused more suffering , but I think it could have been more constructive from a human , and moral point of view . There are many illogical and disturbing things : the initial reference to God 's creation in seven days ( which , by the way , according to the Bible , are six ! ) : what does it mean ? And what about a woman suffering from heart - disease which prevents her from running and even from singing without feeling bad , who can have normal sex with a man who , feeling , as it should be , destroyed by the death of his wife and having donated organs and pieces of his body , does n't seem to feel so much tried , both emotionally and physically , from his impaired condition ? The movie is saved by good acting , but all the rest is pure nonsense , not only from a logical point of view , but also from a human and emotional one .
0 What can I say about Seven Pounds ... well I watched on a flight from Seattle to Tokyo and as that flight was long and boring the movie definitely did n't help . Will Smith 's character Ben Thomas is almost completely unlikable even with his redemption in the end . The movie 's two hour plus run time wastes most of the screen time with random garbage that just strings the plot along as slow as possible . In the movies defense Rosario Dawson 's character adds a little life to the film although not much . I do n't understand how anyone could actually cry during this film when all I wanted to do was turn it off . Also Will Smith kills himself with a jellyfish at the ended proving that killing yourself with a jellyfish is the stupidest way to die .
0 Brides are dying at the altar , and their corpses are disappearing . Everybody is concerned , but nobody seems to be able to figure out why and how this is happening , nor can they prevent it from happening . Bear with me . Bela Lugosi is responsible for this , as he is extracting spinal fluid from these young women to transfuse his ancient wife and keep her alive . Continue to bear with me . Finally , the authorities figure out that somebody must be engineering the deaths and disappearances , but of course , they ca n't figure out the improbable motive . Let 's just ignore the ludicrous pseudoscience and move on ... If you can get through the first twenty minutes of this mess , you will be treated to Lugosi whipping his lab assistant for disrespecting one of the brides he has murdered , explaining that he finds sleeping in a coffin much more comfortable than a bed , and other vague parodies of real horror films ( the kind with budgets and plots ) . Anyhoo - a female journalist follows her nose to the culprit ( and remarkably the inept police are nowhere to be seen ! ) , and then the fun really starts.<br /><br />The cinematography and acting are OK . There are a lot of well dressed , very good looking people in this film . The directing is fair , and the script is a little better than the material deserved . Nevertheless , this film fails to sustain the interest of all but the most hardened b - film fan . The best thing about it .... It does eventually end , but not soon enough .
0 The Poverty Row horror pictures of the 1930s and ' 40s depress the hell out of me . God knows I have nothing against low - budget films , but the ones produced in that period have such a dreary , shabby look about them -- and , in the final analysis , just are n't very good . " The Corpse Vanishes " is slightly more entertaining than bottom - of - the - barrel dreck like " The Invisible Ghost " and " The Ape Man " , but it 's no classic . Bela Lugosi , long past his " Dracula " heyday , plays yet another mad doctor ; the unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife . They sleep in coffins because , as Lugosi explains to a doubtful young female reporter ( Luana Walters ) , a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed . Ho hum . Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal are also on hand , which might please hardcore fans of ' 30s and ' 40s films .
0 Only the glandular secretions -- and please do n't ask for any more details -- of young virgins can keep the rapidly deteriorating body and mind of the crazed old amateur horticulturalist 's wife fresh and youthful . Since , like most people except those taking part in medical trials , virgins seldom give up their secretions willingly , Dr. Lorenz ( Bela Lugosi ) arranges for them to be abducted and preserved . He 'll do the extracting himself . < br /><br />What a great cheese ball of a premise for a low budget horror movie . If The Corpse Vanishes turns out not to be the Havarti of horror , as a plain limburger it leaves an interesting aftertaste . < br /><br />Sure , the acting is almost awful except for the actors fortunate enough to be playing the crazed dwarf ( Angelo Rossitto , who later played The Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome ) ; his crazed brute of a brother , Angel ( Frank Moran ) , who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgins ' hair ; the crazed mother of the two ( Minerva Urecal ) ; the crazed wife ( Elizabeth Russell ) , who sleeps in a plush coffin and , of course , the crazed doctor ( Lugosi ) . < br /><br />An enterprising young reporter , Patricia Hunter ( Luana Walters ) tracks down the doctor because of a strange orchid with a peculiarly sweet odor that had been worn by the victims . When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay the night , a raging storm immediately breaks out . That clue tells us some raging violence is about to erupt inside . Since it 's well known that in Hollywood at this time all unmarried young women were virgins , Pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with . They include dark passages , a crusty laboratory where a near dead virgin is stored , a basement mausoleum and , later , a direct threat to Patricia 's own glandular secretions . If she survives , what a story she 'll have to give her editor . < br /><br />If you sample this moist slice of moldy Velveeta ( and why not ? Do n't be superior ) , do n't judge Bela Lugosi by the company he keeps here . He had a huge impact in Dracula ( 1931 ) , but my favorite movie of his is The Black Cat ( 1934 ) . As Dr. Vitas Werdegast he 's a sad , ironic man protective of his two young friends . When he finally takes a scalpel to Hjalmar Poelzig ( Boris Karloff ) and begins to flay the man alive , ah , well , it 's a great scene .
0 Just looking at the sets , staging and editing it is easy to tell this project lacked a proper budget . Maybe Bela Lugosi is meant to take your mind off of things like that . Young brides drop dead at the altar after saying " I do " . Their corpses are stolen by a renowned horticulturist Dr. Lorenz(Lugosi)and a couple of his freakish minions as his aging wife(Elizabeth Russell)needs injections of the glandular fluids of the young virgins to remain forever young ... forever beautiful . An eager local cub reporter(Luana Walters)realizes that each missing bride wore the same rare orchid to the altar ; an orchid in which Dr. Lorenz would be most knowledgeable . A typical horror movie storm brews making a visit to the Lorenz estate a bit spooky ; especially with a dwarf and a slobbering hunchback on the premises . Other players : Angelo Rossitto , Tristram Coffin , Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran .
0 Brides are dying at the altar and their corpses are vanishing . No one knows why or who , but an investigative reporter ( Luana Walters ) notes that each bride was wearing a strange orchid and she goes to interview its creator , Dr. Lorenz ( Bela Lugosi ) . Now Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits , including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife ( Elizabeth Russell ) with the fluid of young brides to keep her young.<br /><br />The Corpse Vanishes has an interesting premise and a short enough run time that it should n't be able to get boring . Unfortunately , while it starts off quite well , it does start to drag before the halfway point and gets rather boring with its clichés and predictable plot.<br /><br />There are some good things about it - Bela Lugosi is charming and evil and performs brilliantly ; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful , suave , aloof and very creepy countess ; and I 'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto . Luana Walters is also convincing as the reporter here.<br /><br />It maintains a bit of a Gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent.<br /><br />But overall , it just did n't manage to hold my interest through the whole picture , and for that , I have to rate it poorly .
0 Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful . To this end , he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies . I 'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies . I do n't remember it ever being fully explained . All I know is that he extracts something from them and injects it in his wife . ( I 'll just guess that it 's spinal fluid . Spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s . ) You can pretty much guess the rest from here.<br /><br />There are a couple ( well , really more than a couple , but I 'll only write about two ) of problems that I have with this movie . One is the way Bela is used . Sure , he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way ( BTW , the rest of the cast is simply abysmal ) . But , to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporter 's bedroom to do nothing is just silly . Also , why have him beat and/or kill every henchman he has ? Is it to make him look evil ? Well , someone who is kidnapping comatose brides does n't really need to be made to look more evil.<br /><br />The second problem I have is the idea of drugging brides . Why brides ? Would n't any female under the age of 20 do ? Watching Bela go through these gyrations to get his victims , I was reminded of the idiotic Fisherman in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer . In each case , there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control . ( BTW , an alternate title for this movie is The Case of the Missing Brides . I guess that partially explains the need for ' brides ' . )
0 " Bela Lugosi revels in his role as European horticulturalist ( sic ) Dr. Lorenz in this outlandish tale of horror and dementia . The good doctor 's aging wife needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins in order to retain her youth and beauty . What better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter , where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows ? Sedating them into a coma - like state , he brings them to his mansion to collect his tainted bounty , " according to the DVD sleeve 's synopsis . That brief description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the movie.<br /><br / > * * The Corpse Vanishes ( 1942 ) Wallace Fox ~ Bela Lugosi , Luana Walters , Elizabeth Russell
0 Now I love Bela Lugosi , don't get me wrong , he is one of the most interesting people to ever make a movie but he certainly did his share of clunkers . This is just another one of those.<br /><br />Lugosi plays Dr . Lorenz , a doctor who has had his medical license pulled for unexplained reasons . He is however doing experiments to keep his wife young and beautiful . It 's revealed that she is 70 - 80 years old yet Lugosi looks to be in his mid 50 's so why he is married to this old woman is never really explained.<br /><br />Anyway these treatments or experiments involved giving brides who are at the altar being married some sort of sweet smelling substance whereby they pass out but are thought to be dead . Then Lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body on its way to the morgue and take it back to his lab where it 's kept in some sort of suspended animation or catatonic state . Then the stolen brides have a needle rammed somewhere in their bodies , maybe the neck , and then the needle is rammed into the body of Lugosi 's wife to bring her back to youth and beauty . We never really see where Lugosi sticks the needle or what it is that he draws out of the brides but it somehow restores his wife .Apparently old age makes you scream with pain because Lugosi 's wife does a lot of screaming until she gets back to her younger state . Helping Lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this movie .... a weird old hag and her two deformed sons .... one son is a big lumpy looking slow acting fellow who likes to fondle the snoozing brides and the other son is a mean little dwarf .... little person , to be politically correct in today 's world . At night these three just sort of pile up and sleep in Lugosi 's dreary downstairs lab . Who these 3 are and how they came to be Lugosi 's scared assistants is , like a lot of stuff in this film , never explained.<br /><br />So anyway a female reporter is given the assignment by her gruff editor to find out where all the stolen brides are going to . She quickly figures out that the one common thing among all the stolen brides is a rare orchid that is found on them . So she asks around and is told that there is a world renowned orchid expert living nearby who just happens to be the one who developed this particular orchid . This expert turns out to be creepy Dr . Lorenz . She quickly tracks him down and upsets his little house of horrors . I'm not sure where the police were during all this but they came in to mop up after the reporter had done all the dirty work.<br /><br />It seems that Lugosi 's movies always had some sort of unnecessary silly plot line that just made the whole thing stink to high heavens . I mean a world famous orchid expert kidnaps brides by sending them a doped up orchid he himself is known to have developed ? D'OH!<br /><br />And then later it 's revealed that the young ladies do n't even have to be brides for the procedure to work so why would Lugosi keep kidnapping brides from heavily guarded churches for his experiments and create all the attention and newspaper headlines ? Why not just grab a prostitute off the street like a normal weirdo pervert would do ? This clunker reminded me a lot of another Lugosi stinker,"The Devil Bat" .... same silly plot lines and bad acting and same silly ' reporter gets bad guy ' deal.<br /><br />But Lugosi is always good -- he is creepy and sinister enough to keep you interested at least enough to keep watching him . The woman playing the reporter was just a terrible actor .... she had no emotion whatsoever , she just delivered her lines like a machine gun , spewing them out as quickly as she could . Everyone else pretty much blew too , when it came to being good actors.<br /><br />But this thing is watchable , if only for Bela Lugosi fans . Lugosi was always so intense even when the picture was a dog . He must have known he was doing terrible pictures but maybe he also knew that if he gave it everything he had a little of that intensity might shine through past all the bad plots and bad acting which surrounded him.<br /><br />And he was right----we horror fans will always have a love for Bela Lugosi . He gave it his all every time he was in front of the camera . We do give two f**ks for you , Bela .
0 Patricia Hunter : Oh , professor , do you also make a habit of collecting coffins ? Dr. Lorenz : Why , yes , in a manner of speaking . I find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed . < br /><br />Interesting Bela Lugosi ( Glen or Glenda , Dracula ) vehicle where he plays the mad scientist . I was especially creeped out when he appeared in the bedrooms of his guests when they were sleeping.<br /><br />Luana Walters ( Girls in Prison ) was really appealing as a sensual reporter , Patricia Hunter < who was to be a victim , but woman - power trumps evil scientist every time.<br /><br />2'11 " Angelo Rossitto and creepy Frank Moran , who liked to stoke the women 's hair added to the film.<br /><br />Interesting look at a 40s horror film .
0 A number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the altar , and later their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue . Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings . She discovers that right before each ceremony , the bride was given a rare orchid ( supposedly from the groom ) which contained a powerful drug that succumbed them . Patricia is told that the orchid was first grown by a Dr. Lorenz , who lives in a secluded estate , with his wife . In reality , Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes , by putting the brides in a suspended state , and using their gland fluid to keep his wife eternally young . Patricia , along with Dr. Foster ( who is working with Dr. Lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife ) try to force Dr. Lorenz 's hand by setting up a phony wedding , which eventually leads Patricia into the mad doctor 's clutches . This movie had a very good opening reel , but basically ended up with too many establishing shots and other weak scenes . The cast is decent , Walters and Coffin deserved better , but that 's life . Russell steals the show ( even out hamming Lugosi- who does not give one of his more memorable performances , even considering his Monograms ) as Countess Lorenz playing the role with the qualities of many of the stereotypical characteristics of many of today 's Hollywood prima donnas . Weak and contrived ending as well . Rating , based on B movies , 4 .
0 Bela Lugosi plays Dr. Lorenz who loves his wife so much that he will do anything to keep her young . This film starts off with a wedding as the bride is about to take her vows she suddenly collapses . She is pronounced dead and taken away by undertakers . Trouble is that these are not real undertakers but body snatchers . A wave of bride deaths at the altar and their body disappearing confounds the police . Enter reporter Patricia Hunter to solve the case . She does track down Dr. Lorenz but he also decides to use her youth to keep his wife young also .
0 Bela Lugosi is great as usual but the movie is nothing compared to Dracula . He is probably the only one that played a perfect part in this movie but not even a legend like Lugosi could save the badness of the idea of this movie and unlike most old unspenseful horror films this movie does n't set the mood very well . Even at its worst any of Bela 's movies is only mediocre though .
0 Bela Lugosi as creepy insane scientist who uses orchids to woo brides in order to steal life essence for aged wife . The midget in this film is hilarious ! ! A lot of freaks , plus a lot of padding and no plot makes watching this film a nightmare . I loved how all the pieces fell together in the end in typical Hollywood fashion . The story never gets interesting , and you feel helpless as you watch.<br /><br />Usually I 'd score bore flicks like this one low , but the midget added just enough creepiness and entertainent to gain a couple more points .
0 I bought this video at Walmart 's $ 1 bin . I think I over - paid ! ! ! In the 1940s , Bela Lugosi made a long string of 3rd - rate movies for small studios ( in this case , Monogram -- the ones who made most of the Bowry Boys films ) . While the wretchedness of most of these films does not approach the level of awfulness his last films achieved ( Ed Wood " classics " such as Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space ) , they are nonetheless poor films and should be avoided by all but the most die - hard fans.<br /><br />I am an old movie junkie , so I gave this a try . Besides , a few of these lesser films were actually pretty good -- just not this one.<br /><br />Lugosi is , what else , a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he concocts from young brides . They never really explained WHY it had to be brides or why it must be women or even what disease his wife had -- so you can see that the plot was never really hashed out at all.<br /><br />Anyways , a really annoying female reporter ( a Lois Lane type without Jimmy Olsen or Superman ) wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were STOLEN ! So , she follows some clues all the way to the doorstep of Lugosi . Lugosi 's home is complete with his crazed wife , a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistant 's sons ( an ugly hunchbacked sex fiend and a dwarf ) . Naturally this plucky reporter faints repeatedly throughout the film -- apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand ! Eventually , the maniacs ALL die -- mostly due to their own hands and all is well . At the conclusion , the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry . And , naturally , the reporter 's dumb cameraman faints when this occurs . If you have n't noticed , there 's a lot of fainting in this film . Or , maybe because it was such a slow and ponderous film they just fell asleep !
0 Bela Lugosi is an evil botanist who sends brides poisoned orchids on their wedding day , steals the body in his fake ambulance / hearse and takes it home for his midget assistant to extract the glandular juices in order to keep Bela 's wife eternally young . Some second rate actors playing detectives try to solve the terrible , terrible mystery . Bela Lugosi hams it up nicely , but you can tell he needed the money . < br /><br />This film is thoroughly awful , and most of the actors would have been better off sticking to waiting tables , but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous . Tell anyone what happens in it and they tend to laugh quite a lot and demand to see the film . I got the DVD in a discount store 2 for £ 1 , which I think is a pretty accurate valuation , anyone paying more for this would be out of their mind .
0 Ugh . This is a terrible film , full of disastrous comic relief , no scares , and scary leaps in story and plotline . The only creepy thing here is the leading lady 's hats . Lugosi was on his downhill slide and it shows . I give this a 1 , and this ai n't no fun .
0 Bernard Rapp passed away last year and was a very cultured journalist . Cinema was one of his biggest passions ( he penned a vast worldwide dictionary of films ) and so he was bound to wield a camera at least one time in his life . But the films he left garnered lukewarm reviews : " Tiré à Part " ( 1996 ) in spite of Terence Stamp 's sensational performance was very caricatured in the depiction of the characters , " une Affaire De Goût " ( 2000 ) was a slick affair even if Bernard Giraudeau delivered a perverse performance , " Pas Si Grave " ( 2003 ) was another let - down and " un Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence " is as underwhelming as its predecessors . Its comic potential is exploited in a flimsy way.<br /><br />And however , the starting idea let predict a twirling , spiritual comedy . A couple held by Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain who invited their friends is in full moving in a lascivious mansion . To play with their guests , they pretend to part company with each other . And things do n't go as planned because the announcement of their separation does n't surprise them . The two lovers start to ponder about the validity of their couple.<br /><br />In spite of lush scenery and the promising material he had at his disposal , Rapp 's undistinguished directing ca n't manage to give life to this game with unexpected consequences . The plot follows a well - worn pattern with characters who have specific well - known functions and masks that are unveiled about who they really are . Verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat . A bad editing fades a little more the film with this bad habit from Rapp to abruptly cut many sequences . Even the actors ' sincere input in the venture is debatable . They seem to be bored and to recite their texts than to live them , especially Sandrine Kiberlain . The audience is soon caught in a deep torpor.<br /><br />It 's regrettable to say it : Bernard Rapp 's films never lived up to his intentions as " un Petit Jeu sans Conséquence " bears witness .
0 You 'd think the first landing on the Moon would be dramatic enough without needing to make up stuff about it . However , this documentary seems to need to cast everything in the scariest possible light . It talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions Armstrong 's nearly fatal accident with the training vehicle , as if the trainer and the spacecraft had anything to do with each other . It makes the computer overload problem ( the 1202 and 1201 alarms ) encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a near - catastrophe when it was just an annoyance and not a risk to the crew at all . And it takes the " thirty seconds " call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before running out , when it 's actually thirty seconds before an abort is mandatory.<br /><br />If you want to see a documentary or dramatization of Apollo 11 , go for " From the Earth to the Moon " or one of the PBS documentaries , but skip this one .
0 WARNING : POSSIBLE SPOILERS ( Not that you should care . Also , sorry for the caps.)<br /><br />Starting with an unnecessarily dramatic voice that 's all the more annoying for talking nonsense , it goes on with nonsense and unnecessary drama . That 's badly but accurately put.<br /><br />We know space travel is a risky enterprise . There 's a complicated system with a lot of potential for malfunctions , radiation , stress - related symptoms etc , and unexpected things are bound to happen in largely unknown environments . They knew stuff could go wrong . In fact , stuff had gone wrong . It 's called learning . Granted , Appollo 11 was n't safe by today 's standards and there was immense political pressure , but the overall performance of the technology on the mission was impressive.<br /><br />Assorted mistakes / comments I had n't even to look up:<br /><br />1 ) Nixon prepared a speech in case something went wrong . Well duh . That 's what I would 've done . It was the apex of a propaganda war , after all.<br /><br />2 ) NASA gives green light despite the fact that Appollo 11 will probably blow up . ( This is " only " implicit , though . ) Yeah , that 's why they let people and press watch in almost - real - time.<br /><br />3 ) The capsule ejection would n't work . Like it did n't work the time a chimp was in it . The one that survived ? It was a test launch and the rocket exploded , the capsule accelerated away and landed with a parachute . There 's a video of it , you can probably find it on youtube or at least look it up somewhere.<br /><br />4 ) One interviewed guy says an explosion would have wiped out a fair part of Florida . I can only assume it was meant as a hyperbole , 'cause if not , I 'm just aghast how he could get it so wrong.<br /><br />5 ) The technology then was primitive compared to today 's standards . Actually , relatively primitive software and hardware is used even today , the reason being that it must not crash . It 's even worse for spacecraft , because their computers must be built of comparably large components that are n't that susceptible to radiation . ( And the craft itself must be pilotable manually anyway , so a complex steering system like the B2 's would n't do . ) What 's with the fact that they were using " TV screens " rather than " computer screens " ? It 's the same damn technology . Actually TV monitors were and are produced with a significantly higher definition.<br /><br />6 ) " If that object was n't part of the rocket , it could be only one thing . " We see where this is going . Apart from the fact that the statement is wrong , who says it was n't a rocket part ? At least an interviewee clears up that if a thing is flying and you do n't know what it is , it 's by definition an Unidentified Flying Object.<br /><br />7 ) The voice - over as well as some misquotes make it seem as though the lander 's radiation foil was actually its hull . Which would make it thinner than a space suit.<br /><br />8 ) Neil Armstrong 's near death during a practice flight is footage I can appreciate ; I had n't seen it before . As I said , any piece of manifest technology can go wrong , especially if it 's not been tested sufficiently on account of being , you know , unprecedented.<br /><br />9)The trajectory discrepancy of the descending lander ( due to irregularities in the Moon 's density ) was at no time acutely life - threatening . Neither was the " fifteen seconds of fuel left " , which was , in fact , " fifteen seconds of fuel left before having to abort the mission and returning to the command module".<br /><br />10 ) A " catastrophic chain of events " usually results in catastrophe . I really do n't know how to put it any simpler . This , however , is a prime example of the rhetoric used.<br /><br />11 ) There 's a short sequence of one of the astronauts walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid , followed by the voice - over telling us that the reason for this strange behavior " can now be revealed " . Turns out , he was walking and hopping around aimlessly like a gleeful kid . Hilarious stuff.<br /><br />12 ) It 's mentioned that during re - entry , all contact was lost . This is a perfectly natural phenomenon and it was as well known at the time as it 's impossible to circumvent with contemporary technology . Again , the gravity of this is implicit , but very purposely so.<br /><br />13 ) There was never a shuttle lost in space itself , while the voice - over presents this " fact " as evidence that Appollo 11 was a pile of crap . Appollo 13 was a near - loss , but the two real disasters happened during liftoff and re - entry , respectively . In any case , comparing shuttles to Saturn rockets is somehow ... well , okay , just plain stupid . Even ignoring that , the successful shuttle missions seem to not have been deemed of interest to the audience.<br /><br />14 ) What the hell 's up with the UFO ? Even in the context of the movie , it makes no sense . Unless you assume it was made for entertainment purposes , aimed at a specific audience ( which seems to include people with next to no understanding of either history , science , or rhetorics).<br /><br />Even the point of the movie is somewhat obscure . Catch - phrases like " covered up until now " , " publically revealed here for the first time " , come up , but the film does n't place any blame or offer a lesson or anything , which could be expected of a film so emotionally done . In the good old tradition of sensationalism , there are numerous interview shots and recording fragments that are often out of context or with people that we know nothing about except " NASA scientist " . Wow , so the astronauts were very nervous before the endeavor ? Fancy that . What does this have to do with the point of the movie again ? Oh yeah , which point.<br /><br />In summary , in addition to being either willfully or incompetently inaccurate , it 's not even good entertainment . And believe me , I 'm a guy who enjoys his crappy documentaries ; this film is n't funny , witty , quaint , it 's nothing .
0 I was hoping for some sort of in - depth background information on the Apollo 11 mission and what I got was some decent interview material with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and other people involved in the mission , linked by over - hyped disaster - predicting sensationalising voice - over in the worst tradition of TV production.<br /><br />If you could cut out the voice - over and change the spin of the program to a positive testament of how people can overcome setbacks to achieve a goal out of the ordinary then this could 've been great - but I feel I 've wasted about 45 minutes of my life whilst watching a 60 minute programme . I want those minutes back .
0 I was expecting a lot better from the Battlestar Galactica franchise . Very boring prequel to the main series . After the first 30 minutes , I was waiting for it to end . The characters do a lot of talking about religion , computers , programming , retribution , etc ... There are gangsters , mafia types , who carry out hits . However , Caprica does n't have the action of the original series to offset the slower parts.<br /><br />Let me give you some helpful advice when viewing movies : As a general rule , if there is a lot of excessive exploitive titillation , then you know the movie will be a dud . Caprica has lots of this . The director / writer usually attempts to compensate for his poor abilities by throwing in a few naked bodies . It never works and all it does is demean the ( very ) young actresses involved and I feel sorry for them . Directors / writers who do this should be banned from the business.<br /><br />If you want to be bored for an hour and a half , by all means , rent Caprica . There 's ( free ) porn on the ' Net if you really want to see naked bodies . Otherwise , move along , nothing to see here .
0 As a huge fan of only the first 2 seasons of BSG and the stand alone feature BSG Razor I was hoping that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days . Usually I have no problem with science fiction that is mostly dialog driven as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects . If the script is tight with some original ideas delivered by good actors one can create a profound film with little CGI money spent . This prequel has none of those aforementioned requirements going for it . The virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous & unbelievable . This scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to Restricted . Not that teens do n't love virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex & violence & heavy dance music . Its the part about those same teens having the intellectual depth & reason or political & religious passion as to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that perplexes me . These kids are definitely not from this planet . The movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being slightly interesting . The scene with Eric Stolz giving his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student firmware upgrade was amusing if not entertaining . But this old concept was far better portrayed & much more believable in the brilliant , classic original " Frankenstein " with Boris Karloff . Caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror film . No surprise there ! Overall this movie was bland & unoriginal & cheap looking , using recycled CGI of Caprica from BSG . I doubt I 'll be watching this space soap when it premieres on the Sci - Fi channel . Unless of course I happen to be suffering from a bad bout of insomnia at which time this show would definitely be the cure . Zzzzzzzz
0 Battlestar Gallactica was so great because it had tight writing , a great look , excellent actors , and interesting stories ... AND yeah , had hot men and women running around in and out of uniform.<br /><br />Caprica was just lazy . Lazy writing . Actors smoking up a storm to give them " character . " Outdoor sequences that ruin the feeling of being somewhere else ( yes , that is a Ford Focus sitting in the background ) . Lots and lots of teenage angst . LOTS of gyrating naked women ( but in the background . Which I 'm sure will be cut for the series ) and a token view of some men in towels . None of the actors except Polly Walker took my attention at all . At an hour and a half , I was still wondering when it was going to be over.<br /><br />So what exactly is it that 's supposed to bring me back ? The science fiction ? It 's awfully light on that . The actors ? Besides Polly Walker 's fine turn , there is n't much interesting being done here . There are n't even any " hotties " in the cast , except for maybe Esai , although for the younger set he 's pretty old , since he 's over 25.<br /><br />I loved BSG . I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica , and unfortunately , I think I 'm right . I predict a very short run for it as a series unless they really sharpen their pencils over at SciFi and get to work making this more than The OC on another planet .
0 I had to endure teen - aged , high school angst and family conflict for almost all of the show . I really do not care about high - school girls fretting about their relationships . I 've spent my time in Hell dealing with such issues and I care nothing about fictional teenies going through " lite " versions of the horrors I endured . I want science fiction . That 's the only reason I 'm here . There were a few seconds of science fiction late in the show . We FINALLY see a proto - Cylon . It was good but with one problem . Its red eye - dot would lock onto an object of interest . We all know that Cylon eyedots always scan back and forth , giving the machine a map of the world . The red eye - dot does not ever stop moving back and forth.<br /><br />I really hope the writers fix this abuse before the second episode .
0 If you like a syfi soap opera this show is for you , as fare as I am concerned it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes I just ca n't watch it anymore . It is boring and slow and for a show that the timeline is based around 100.000 + years ago if you base it on battlestar galactica 's timeline for arriving on earth they sure seem to have all the same stuff around like the 100.000 year old Chevy vans driving down the streets and people watching the 100.000 year old popular name brand LCD T.V. sets . It also goes the same with the rest of the sets as well on the show , there is just to much of today 's stuff involved in it to not overlook , I think they could have done a lot better of a job to get around these issues and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same issues but not nearly as bad . As fare as the rest of the show it is not nearly as good as BSG was and it is a poor pre sequel to it  .
0 Basically , " Caprica " is the Cylon origin story . The premise of the show is interesting . However , the writers follow so many story lines and clog it with too many POV characters that it bogs down the storytelling . The plot creeps at glacial speeds dissipating what tension it might have had . In any given episode , little or nothing happens.<br /><br />Daniel Graystone ( Eric Stolz ) is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip . Unfortunately , his only working prototype is driven by the AI version of his dead daughter Zoe , who died in a suicide bombing caused by Soldiers of the One ( STO ) , an underground monotheist extremist group.<br /><br />Meanwhile , Joseph Adama ( father of " Battlestar Galactica " 's Commander Adama ) is struggling to hold his family together while searching for the AI version of his daughter ( who also died in the bombing ) in a Machiavellian virtual version of Caprica ( which strongly resembles 1930s Chicago ) . < br /><br />In addition to the vapid writing , Caprica suffers from a similar problem as many origin stories . We already know how it ends ( i.e. the Cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity ) .
0 I remember watching the BSG pilot . I can describe that night exactly . I remember what chair I sat in . That show was magic . It came alive . I enjoyed the first two years of BSG . I enjoyed parts of the third year even , and I watched every episode of the fourth year , totally faithfully in great hopes that it would somehow turn around . Well , it didn't.<br /><br />I watched the Caprica pilot and was enthralled . There was hope for something good here . Then I started watching the regular episodes , and they are getting more and more boring.<br /><br />It 's too obvious , too predictable . It reminds me of the droll political correctness of his last failed show , Virtuality.<br /><br />Much of his line work on DS9 was good . When he focused on BSG in an organized way , it was good . This was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series . When they departed from that after meeting up with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus , it all went to pot . It was like he wrote the rest of the show without knowing where he was going.<br /><br />Maybe it will improve . Maybe it was just a few weak initial episodes . But I am very , very nervous .
0 I realize it 's not supposed to be BSG and I can handle slow - paced shows if they 're interesting but I find myself completely uninterested and bored with this series.<br /><br />The formula for BSG seemed to be : Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama < br /><br />the formula for Caprica seems to be : Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi < br /><br />Maybe it will get more interesting but as of episode 3 I can barely watch it . In fact , it 's at the bottom of my to - watch list for the week . This is a sad state of affairs . The Syfi channel really destroyed their Friday night lineup . Whatever happened to the glory days of SG1 , Stargate Atlantis , and BSG on Friday nights ? They had a good thing there .
0 Of course I was watching BG . I loved S1 , I liked season 2 , season 3 was OK , and loved the final one . Yay , there is a spin - off show ! I did n't know about this at all , one of my friends told me about this . I was really excited.<br /><br />I watched the first 3 episodes ... What a piece of rubbish ! Teenage girl drama fest . There is no science fiction ... well , hardly any . At the end of every episode we can catch a glimpse of a Cylon . That 's all . Who cares this ? Did they decide that the next show 's target audience will be females under 18 ? Boring religious nonsense talking , moaning , bitching ... and some more.<br /><br />It is just sad that there is nothing out there at the moment to watch . Stargate ruined , BG over ...
0 What an awful show . Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality . It shocks me that something exceptional like Firefly lasts one season , while garbage like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawns a spin off . This spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show . The acting is juvenile and uninspired . The characters are cardboard clichés of everything that has ever been in a bad Sci - Fi series . The story is bad . The dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera . The direction is shoddy and the sets are awful . Caprica is a waste of film , a waste of time and a waste of effort . This is one spin off that should have never been made .
0 Matt Saunders ( Luke Wilson ) thinks he has found the perfect woman in Jenny Johnson ( Uma Thurman ) , who seems like a quiet but pretty woman , though he soon learns that she 's needy and possessive , oh , and she 's also the superhero G - Girl , though you would n't know it from the things she does to Matt after he freaks out and breaks up with her.<br /><br />A promising premise is ruined by a mediocre execution . My Super Ex - Girlfriend is still an enjoyable comedy however it relies too much on cheap sex jokes and it ends up being a forgettable experience . What went wrong ? The cast and the director could not overcome the weakness of the script and I did n't like the way they played it out . I was expecting the guy to be a jerk and it could have been a female fantasy revenge film . However , they made the guy likable and they made the superhero a psycho . It just was n't very fresh and after about forty minutes , the film wore out it 's welcome . Sure , there were a few funny lines however the weak middle and horrible ending kept it from really breaking out.<br /><br />Director Ivan Reitman has lost his touch . After a successful run in the eighties and early nineties , he started making crap like Evolution and Father 's Day . I would n't say My Super Ex - Girlfriend is a complete bust but I do n't give him credit for any of the quality the movie holds , which is n't too much . Don Payne did an awful job with the screenplay . The majority of the jokes were lame and most of the supporting characters were just one - note . He also kept reusing a lot of the same jokes making the thing really tedious at times.<br /><br />A few of the actors were good enough to save the film . Uma Thurman was great as G - Girl and she had many funny lines . Luke Wilson was a bit pale and not very interesting . I do n't think he makes for an appealing leading man and he 's better in supporting roles like in The Family Stone . Anna Faris was just doing her " Scary Movie " routine and it 's getting a little old . She needs a challenge or at least some better scripts . Wanda Sykes is either hit or miss for me . She was great in Monster - In - Law and she was bad in Clerks 2 . Here , she is just annoying and does n't bring anything to the movie . Eddie Izzard was alright , nothing special . Rainn Wilson was just annoying and not funny . Overall , I was disappointed with the movie . It was n't awful yet it had so much potential and the final result was just so average . Rating 5/10
0 Ivan Reitman is something of a savior . The most tired plots ( Ghostbusters , Evolution ) come to life in his skilled hands . Even his occasional flop ( Six Days , Seven Nights ) show signs of life and humor that make it worth viewing . So I was disappointed that Reitman could not take a fairly original plot ( man dumps superhero , superhero gets superpower - fueled revenge ) , and shape it into something enjoyable . " Girlfriend " is an exercise in pointlessness . The one - trick pony plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes . The film ca n't decide whether to be romantic comedy or superhero drama . The result is a film the flip - flops between both , with neither aspect being very well done . Uma Thurman is tops , as usual , and Luke Wilson pulls off his role too , though his slacker antics quickly grow tired . What 's even more maddening is that , in certain scenes ( such as when a very turned on Uma knocks a headboard through a wall ) , you sense a witty , raucous Reitman opus practically screaming to get out . But seconds later , the magic is lost , gone as quick as the superheroine whose movies disappoints in almost every way .
0 This is one of the worst movies I have seen recently . When a man says that he wishes he had a super power of being able to orally pleasure himself I pretty much consider the movie to be in the realm of childish 14 year old male fantasies . The bed room scene was over the top and reduced an intimate moment into a farce of biological functions akin to passing gas in public . From the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they where getting , how long its been since they got some , when their next sexual liaison will be , and with whom it should be with . On top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced , not felt , and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes . This could have been really funny because the concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here . Please , do not even think about taking anyone under 16 if you have to go and see it .
0 if they gave me the option of negative numbers I 'd use it . This movie was truly god - awful . I went into the theaters expecting it to be horrible , and it somehow managed to exceed my expectations.<br /><br />The script was weak , the acting was painful . I wanted to walk out but my friend was driving and wanted to get her moneys worth , I think we were both disappointed.<br /><br />The growing of the breasts when the girls got their super power and changing of the hair color was just wrong . Eddie Izzard just seemed wrong for the part of super villain , he came off as oddly weak and silly . Jenny Johnsons ( Uma Thurman ) came off as psychotic and strange , as did Matt 's ( Luke Wilson ) friend Vaughn ( Rainn Wilson .
0 At what point exactly does a good movie go bad ? When does a movie go from " watchable " to " where 's that & ^@_+ # ! * OFF switch " ? Thank goodness for DVDs , like this one , that can be borrowed from the library - for free ! Likewise , thank goodness for the " fast forward " switch on the DVD player . I feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box office.<br /><br />At one point ( I 've forgotten exactly when because now it 's all just a blur ) , our " hero , " Luke Wilson starts running through traffic ; I think he was looking for a cab . It was at that point when I gave up , realizing I could n't care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck.<br /><br />The last time the movie was interesting was when Luke Wilson climbs out of the dumpster , hair dryer in hand , and first meets the " heroine , " Uma Thurman . That scene ended with the purse - snatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far , far above the departing Luke and Uma . That was the last time the movie was funny , and when was that scene ? Ten minutes into the flick?<br /><br />Every time the movie tried to become " funny , " it could n't . Every time the movie approached " excitement , " it fizzled out , heading in the opposite direction . When a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard , the sound track stayed empty and silent.<br /><br />The sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame ; the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish . When Uma turns into the crazy ex - girlfriend , I felt like I was watching " The 40 Year Old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction " ; that 's when I realized that there was no turning back because I thoroughly disliked " The 40 Year Old Virgin " and " Pulp Fiction." < br /><br />Luke Wilson 's sidekick , Rainn Wilson ( also seen in the dreary " The Last Mimzy " ) adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie . Rainn Wilson , the King of Television Boredom , should stay with that equally awful medium . Hey , Rainn Wilson ! Leave full - length motion pictures alone ! Every time Uma 's rival , Anna Faris , came on screen , I expected Jason or Freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery ; once you see Anna Faris in " Scary Movie , " that 's all you ever see , no matter the movie , no matter the medium . The character played by Wanda Sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick .
0 What a waste of time and money ! My hubby and I saw this movie - after seeing the previews and thinking it " might be funny " . WRONG ! This movie is about 90 minutes too long . The actors are trapped in a poorly written script and ca n't get out . The jokes are weak and tired , and not even seeing Wilson 's naked behind can redeem any part of this film . The special effects ..... aren't . I half expected to see the harness and wires holding up Uma in her flying scenes . And when the effects people apparently could not master the superhero 's faster - than - a - speeding - bullet flying or fight scenes , they covered over everything with a swirling vortex of blurred screen - which hid the awful effects quite nicely . Wilson 's sidekick was a lame excuse for a man and Wilson had no chemistry with either Uma or his office co - worker . The sex scenes were n't sexy and the funny scenes were n't funny . I guess I just expected too much from these actors . None of the characters were really sympathetic , so I ended up not caring a flying fig about any of them . The only memorable performances were the kids who played Bedlam and G - Girl as teenagers - at least THEY had some chemistry . Overall , a super stinko movie - I would n't even recommend it as a rental - it would still be a waste of money !
0 This movie is being shown over and over on cable lately , so .. <br /><br />There is no excuse for these 2 attractive women to fight over either Luke Wilson or the equally vapid ' villian ' in this movie . The female actresses are very cute , and that 's the only reason to watch this movie . I suppose it is ' funny ' that Luke 's even uglier / dorkier / stupider friend is around , but well , that is what we get.<br /><br />Neither of the female leads would ever , EVER talk to any of the males in this movie for more than 5 minutes . What we get is them sobbing and crying and fighting and so on over 2 guys that were best described in Friday the 13th 4 . Dead * @$ #
0 It 's easy to see how this below - average screenplay got by in the early sales - pitch meetings at Regency Films ( and later with Fox ) : cross the superhero genre with a comedic take on " Fatal Attraction" ... voilà ! I do n't know how on earth a talented director like Ivan Reitman got involved , unless the pay was just too tempting . A dateless employee at an architectural design firm in N.Y.C. meets a girl on the subway and asks her out ; despite the fact she 's distracted and unpleasant , he eventually gets her into bed -- only to find out later she 's the Big Apple 's resident superhero , G - Girl . This distaff Superman , with powers bestowed upon her by a fallen meteorite , is n't a fantasy heroine , however ... screenwriter Don Payne has conceived her as a needy , possessive , vindictive bitch ( he telegraphs this to us from miles away , though Uma Thurman still plays the role for sassy laughs ) . This is the kind of worthless movie that ca n't let an insult slip by . Our introduction to leading man Luke Wilson , talking with Rainn Wilson on the train , is accompanied by a sour dig at gays ( it prods at us to be assured these two buddies are strictly ladies ' men ) . After being approached by G - Girl 's nemesis , who wants to zap her powers , Wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman scorned ... and is n't that better after all ? Thurman 's early performances in films like " Henry & June " and " Jennifer 8 " showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise ; her films with Quentin Tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity , but that came at a price ( the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch ) . The picture is exceedingly well - produced and shot , with expensive - seeming special effects , yet nobody bothered to find the humor in this scenario . It 's pushy , leering , ugly , and badly - cast . Bloated , frozen - faced Wilson ca n't tell any of his co - workers that he 's dating G - Girl because she made him swear he 'd rather have a chainsaw stuck up his rectum . I wonder if writer Payne actually thought that was hilarious ... or , indeed , if anyone involved did ? * from * * * *
0 I 'm a huge fan of Ivan Reitman - I loved Evolution and who did n't like Ghostbusters ? From the trailer you already know that Uma 's character will get dumped by Luke's . So the build - up is obviously towards the moment when she unleashes her superpowers on him . But the pay - off is just not there . The shark tossing did manage to get a ( slight ) giggle but once again , it was all in the trailer.<br /><br />No one does breathless quite like Uma and Luke is diet Owen on his good days . If not for Riann Wilson you would sit there with a constipated smile until your cheeks start to cramp . This is a comedy , right ? < br /><br />It 's not awful - it just sits there like a stale cracker behind the fridge . This could have been such a brilliant send - up of Superhero movies and Feminism but fails on both counts . Let 's see if Jason Reitman can salvage the family name .
0 I went to see this film yesterday and although i did n't have high hopes for this film , I was still bitterly disappointed ! I actually ca nt believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this film ... it was THAT bad ! ! ! The storyline was disgraceful and the acting was terrible ( even though it had big names such as Uma Thurman in it ) . This film heavily relied on its special effects ... but they personally had no effect on me . I honestly wished i d never watched it and I strongly warn everyone against seeing this film . It is a total waste of money and you 'll only end up being disappointed afterwards . My advice is to save your money , go shopping , treat yourself , just do n't go and see this film ... You 'll live to regret it lol !
0 Needed an excuse to get out of the house while paint dried - left the movie after an hour to return and watch the paint dry.<br /><br />I do n't recall ever walking out on a movie before , but I really tried to stay . The script was not up to the cast and just kept " going and going " badly - come on ! Uma Thurman doing this stuff ? Fairly lame special effects . These were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20-something lives - just sort of annoying and wrong feeling.<br /><br />This review is base only on the first hour - it might have gotten better . I just had to get home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went on .
0 Well I must say this is probably the worst film I have seen this year ! The jokes were extremely crude ( was n't expecting it from as PG movie)(Rated PG in Canada ) and they were n't funny ! With this great cast I at least expected some good acting but I did n't even get that . I am a huge Rainn Wilson fan and this is the first time I was extremely disappointed by his performance . Neither Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman 's characters are the least bit likable and i really could have cared less what happened to either of them . I did n't expect this at all as in the past I have really liked other movies by this director ( Six Days , Seven Nights for example ) This movie was NOT worth the $ 10 it cost me and i strongly encourage you not to see this movie . I guarantee that you will be like me begging for this movie to be over .
0 I have to admit when I went to see this movie , I did n't really have high expectations . But even with my low expectations I was totally and utterly disappointed ... <br /><br />Basically Luke Wilson is a hot shot who tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends . There 's slight mention of a girl stalking him but that 's pretty much it for that character . Which i do n't quite mind cause it would probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie.<br /><br />So while on a subway Rainn Wilson ( who i actually liked before this movie ) convinces him to talk to a " hot " girl , Uma Thurman . This is strange to say the least , as everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman does not belong under the category of " hot".<br /><br />Rainn Wilson 's performance is also far from " hot " . Normally I 'm all for his acting , but even he could n't salvage this movie . His character was jumpy , unrealistic and rather annoying . You could never tell if the writers were trying to make him the comical token closet gay guy , or just desperate . It was almost painful.<br /><br />But anyway , someone steals her purse as she goes to leave the subway , and Luke Wilson being the charming savior he is runs after the robber . Now we all know that Uma Thurman is the superhero , or " G - Girl " as they like to call her in the movie . It still baffles me as to what the " G " stands for , but we 'll leave that for the message boards to debate.<br /><br />The sex scenes I assume are supposed to be funny , but I find myself asking who has sex like that ? They nearly throw the bed through the wall because of Uma Thurman 's " passion " let 's say . It makes my head hurt , but not in the " I 'm thinking really hard to understand this " way.<br /><br />When Uma insults Anna Faris , calling her a " whore " I had no debate with that . Apart from the fact that she ca n't choose movies properly , she ca n't act and relies souly on the fact that she 's blonde and typical.<br /><br />Overall I would 've walked out of the theater if i had n't paid $ 8.75 to see it . The characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry , especially Uma Thurman . Someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot does n't mean you 're acting.<br /><br />Also , the script and storyline could 've used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid . I actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors , and their dying careers . Overall , if you value your money , and your self respect do NOT waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie .
0 First off , I would like to point out that the reason why I gave this movie 1 star out of 10 is because there is no option to give it NO stars ! it really is that bad ! I was never eager to see this film after I saw the ads for it , I ended up seeing it only by chance because some friends of mine had tickets and had one spare so I tagged along . Before seeing it I had a fairly good idea that it would n't be genius - the premise seemed far too silly and stupid for anything good to come out of it , but at the back of my mind I was thinking " but there must be something good about it for UMA THURMAN and Luke Wilson do to the film ... " not that I think either of them are particularly terrific but they are big - named stars who would normally only do films that would enhance their reputations . However , about 10 - 20 minutes into the feature I realized that the movie was probably worse than I had at first anticipated . I was shocked at how terrible the script was . It really gave the actors NOTHING to work with , so much so that they really looked like they did n't know what they were doing ( especially Luke Wilson ) . The story was completely predictable - if you 've seen the ad then you 've pretty much seen the movie ! And there was nothing original about it - it pretty much borrows from every ' super - hero ' story that has ever been which would be acceptable had the film been set up as a satire of that genre , but alas it was n't . The direction seemed to be of realism . I got the feeling that the director wanted the film to feel completely realistic and not satire at all , and yet there were some moments in the film that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a satire . At one moment in the movie two of the characters seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like " Oh well , she 's dead ... time to move on " and he says it in such a droll voice that it completely did n't make any sense . I found myself checking my watch after about 40 minutes to see how much longer I would have to sit through it . And then it struck me ... I began to think " I wonder if the studio have made this picture as a test to see if they can make the worst possible movie ever made , and still pull a large audience ... " I could n't think of any other reason why this film would be made . For movies to be made these days , the script goes to a massive screening process and very very few scripts actually make it to the production stage ... I ca n't comprehend how this one got past the first draft stage ... By the end , and exceedingly , dumb - founding - Ly stupid climax , I was laughing heartily - just not at what the film - makers wanted me to laugh at , but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the movie was . Thank God I did n't have to pay money to see it ... because that would have really annoyed me ! ! ! Oh , and could I just add , that of the two Wilson brothers , I have always preferred Luke because I think he is a better , more versatile actor ... but if he wants to step even further into OWEN 's shadow then this is exactly the way to do it ... I doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of 2 hours ! ! ! and remember , it only got a generous 1/10 because I could n't select 0 !
0 Oh my god . oh my god , i ca nt get over this movie . It was god - awful . horrible , terrible ! Do n't even waste your money to buy it in the 99 cent bin . No , avoid it at all costs I 'm warning you!!!<br /><br />It was the worst movie I 've ever seen . In my life . In my life!!<br /><br />First of all , G - girl ? Are you kidding me . Get real that sounds like some kind of new Barbie doll .. Super Women ? Are you kidding me . It was so fake fake fake fake . The people of the town did n't even seem to care that there was a flying blonde just zooming her way around the town saving a fire .. Ohh big!<br /><br />Jesus , was it just me or did this movie seem offensive ? ? I guess what you need to be a super hero is a couple of double D 's , blonde flowing hair , no glasses and a leather skin tight suit?!<br /><br />If it was trying to be romantic ... than .. god , i do n't know . It was horrid , if love means taking some one to an art show and than having sex in a bed AND in the air .. than they totally had love!<br /><br />It was pathetic , everything went too fast . First that guy was single , than he was dating G - girl .. than they broke up than he dated that Hannah girl .. and .. it just goes on . < br /><br />I have to say this movie made me wonder .. How the hell did they get this in theaters??!!<br /><br />Avoid this movie at all costs .
0 I rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie . I figured that you really could n't go wrong with a concept of Ex Girlfriend with super powers . < br /><br / > ... but the movie was confused and pointless ... < br /><br />it seemed that at every turn the writer kept throwing junk in . Also the writer kept throwing in way too much toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could love.<br /><br />It seems that it could have been so simple to draw a story out of Fatal Attraction Super hero .. but I guess not . < br /><br />This is not a fun romantic comedy it was advertised to be . You could not take a child to see it and you would be embarrassed seeing it a date . < br /><br />If the writer could have done a basic story around the high concept and cleaned it up - the movie might have a fighting chance . < br /><br />A serious waste of time.<br /><br />B
0 I had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on Danish television yesterday . First of all , I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I was n't disappointed . She looked gorgeous . Second of all , through reading about the film I had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in Philippe de Broca 's films . On this account , however , I was sadly disappointed . I found the jokes predictable ( apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war ) and the characters completely one - dimensional . Also , the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion , with no sense of drama at all . I kept watching until the end , but I got bored very quickly and just sat there , waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida .
0 After too many bad memories , I took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the Season 2 sequence . I recently watched it again just to remind me why . I 've always considered this the worst ST : TNG episode ( with the exception of " Shades of Gray , " which barely counts as an episode at all).<br /><br />I keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red - penciled by the author 's Writing 101 teacher : " SHOW , DON'T TELL ! " From Deanna Troi 's pronouncement , and everyone else 's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming , dangerous rogue Okona is , to Guinan 's explanation about how funny her droid joke is ( it is n't ) , to the who - cares resolution to the conflict , there is n't a plot point that is n't highlighted and triple - underlined for our edification , and there ai n't a believable moment in any of it . Unfortunately , Bill Campbell , a charming actor in other circumstances , is too puppy - dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot . On the other hand , it could be that no one short of John Barrowman ( Jack Harkness from " Doctor Who " ) could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role.<br /><br />(Zero points , by the way , to the Data subplot . While I think Joe Piscopo stopped being funny decades ago , he and Brent Spiner had nothing to work with here . Although the Jerry Lewis bit was funny in a stupid way.)<br /><br />On a good day , you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser Original Series episode . Me , I 'd rather skip ahead to " Time Squared " or " Q Who . "
0 I went to go see this at the Esquire Theatre in Cincy , OH , and - I hate my life now.<br /><br />Christopher Reeves would have been a more believable boxer.<br /><br />As a film it was painful , but seeing Bret Carr in person was to see desperation at its pinnacle.<br /><br />My favorite part of the movie was seeing BC slammed in the face with what appeared to be a " C " battery . The jury is still out on this . It was from a dildo and it was in slow - mo . Yep.<br /><br />"Shoot the left side of the face only ... people become famous by demanding things ! " - Bret Carr B. Carr donned a Chicken Suit for a bit of reverse psychology , roaming the streets of Clifton bashing his own film . He should . This is correct to bash the film.<br /><br />My soul felt chafed after this movie.<br /><br />Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of a cult , or smart enough for that matter . That is the feeling you get from the What the Bleepesque trickle of brainwashed , impressionable neo - yuppies that came to see this Bret Carr Piece of Work.<br /><br />It 's an emotionally draining experience just thinking about writing about this film , so goodbye.<br /><br />-Anonymous
0 The Gospel of Lou was a major disappointment for me . I had received an E - Mail from the theater showing it that it was a great and inspirational movie . It was neither great nor inspirational . The cinematography was pretty iffy with the whole movie . A lot the scenes were flash backs that were done in a way that could n't tell at times what they were about . The voices were often distorted for no reason . Also many of the people in the movie were far fetched . The relationship he has with his ex & son is never made clear . Also the whole movie has most him one way , and then all of a sudden BAM , he is cured and inspiring people . The whole movie seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life , making him live his life the way that he is living it , but when he changes , he does n't leave boxing , he teaches others how to box . Thumbs Down .
0 Straight to the point : " The Groove Tube " is one of the most unfunny , unclever and downright horrible films ever made . This " comedy " is so void of anything remotely resembling a trace of wit that it 's almost incomprehensible that it was even made . I said almost because there are fans of everything after all.<br /><br />This film is n't even " good " bad or " enjoyable " bad . To put this movie on the same level of entertainment as " Plan 9 " or " Robot Monster " would be a crime to those films . Films like that you can actually watch and get a kick out of . But this film is SO bad , SO poorly made , acted and scripted and SO incredible stale , that there just is n't even a trace of " camp " or " schlock " to be found.<br /><br />Even though this was made before Saturday Night Live premiered , comparisons were probably inevitable . I 'm not a big fan of SNL , but this film is worse than the worst SNL skit you can find . And man , that 's BAD . Just to keep the men viewers from leaving , Shapiro throws in a pair of breasts every so often , but poorly - filmed breasts from 1974 are n't going to excite anyone these days . Truthfully this film is so poorly made and is such a sleep - inducing excursion , I doubt if they excited anyone in 1974 either.<br /><br />A man named Ken Shapiro made this film . I swear to God , any ten - year old with a video camera could have made something funnier and more clever . It 's just downright unreal - this is truly an unbelievable film . The " jokes " and " gags " are so infantile that even little boys who like to sneak dad 's porno mags out at night wo n't laugh.<br /><br />I will give this film one thing - the very last sequence , the " dancing man " sequence , where a guy ( Shapiro ) on the streets of NYC dances to a tune , is easily the best thing in this horrible film . Not that the " dancing man " sequence is that great either - it definitely has its moments of not being clever as Shapiro desperately tries to fill in the time for the entire song - but it actually was somewhat watchable . The part of this sequence where the cop starts dancing with the man is the one sole trace of cleverness in the entire film . No wonder Shapiro put this sequence last - again , while not so great itself , it easily beats anything else in this " film." < br /><br />Otherwise , this film is such a complete piece of crap , it 's unfathomable as to how an actual human being can be so downright cleverless . The name of this film should have been " Ken Shapiro 's Craparama . " It 's amazing that this was made , but many truly talented filmmakers ca n't get in . However , I will say that I bet the geniuses at NYU would love this movie . Total garbage .
0 After two long , long opening skits , one of which my brother saw the conclusion coming of and the other totally joke free , we start the fast - forward fest that it GROOVE TUBE proper . Naturally , uber - stupid frat boys who still mainline JACKASS or Tom Green will find the idea of fecal matter coming out of the some tube , SEX OLYMPICS(I really do n't need to give you details , do I ) , and a clown who basically does the " not very endearing clown " bit I think I 've seen approxiately ninety times now will eat this up like dung beetles : well , more power to you.<br /><br />I just want to express that , despite what you 've heard , this movie was in no way a model for the many infinitely funnier movies like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE or what not . The skit movie had already been done in AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT , EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX , and so on . And done way better .
0 Rented it last night . The opening(2001 ) ran WAAAAAAAAAY too long . The hitchiker scene served no purpose . Some skits were just retarded . I knew beforehand , Chevy Chase was on for less than 2 minutes . No problem . Here are the best parts:<br /><br />KOKO , URANUS , BABS COMMERCIAL , Curtis Mayfield song < br /><br />Total : 7 minutes of good material out of a 75 minute movie < br /><br />Everything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell.<br /><br />Let me give you some advice : If you want a crude movie spoofing TV and movies , rent " Kentucky Fried Movie " . If you want a less crude movie spoofing TV and movies , rent " AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON " or " UHF" < br /><br />Otherwise , do n't bother renting this movie . You 'll save 2 - 3 dollars.<br /><br />IMHO : Ken Shapiro 's best movie is STILL " Modern Problems "
0 Oh dear . While Chevy Chase and the gang at SNL set new highs with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level . Fortunately Chevy is barely in this at all and ca n't be blamed for this utter tripe . It seriously is very , very bad . While meant to be a political comment on USA at the time of it 's release ( 1974 ) it still remains neither funny or acutely observed . The sketches are all way too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as they 're all drawn out to the point of complete boredom . This is credited as Chevy 's movie debut and I 'm pleased to say that everything he did after this bettered it . Avoid even if curious .
0 Hearing about how hilarious this movie is , I finally rent it at < br /><br />the video store and for 75 minutes maybe I laughed 3 times . This < br /><br />movie , a collection of skits that make fun of television is an < br /><br />incoherrent mess . The jokes fall flat , the humor deals with < br /><br />issues from the 1970 's that just are n't relevant anymore , and < br /><br />the jokes go on way too long ( almost like the new SNL skits the < br /><br />past few years ) . Yeah , Chevy Chase is in this but maybe of all < br /><br />about 1 or 2 minutes . I liked the fact that this was very < br /><br />raunchy and had nudity galore but could n't it be funny ? Do < br /><br />yourself a favor and rent Kentucky Fried Movie which is a far < br /><br />superior film made in the
0 I read all the reviews here AFTER watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that somebody else did n't think that this appallingly unfunny montage WASN'T the acme of humour in the 70s or indeed in any other era ! If this is n't the least funny set of sketch * comedy * I 've ever seen it 'll do till it comes along . Half of the skits had already been done ( and infinitely better ) by acts such as Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I was to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film it would still not get close to summing up just how mindless and drivel - ridden this waste of 75 minutes is . Seminal comedy ? Only in the world where seminal really DOES mean semen . Scatological humour ? Only in a world where scat IS actually feces . Precursor jokes ? Only if by that we mean that this is a handbook of how NOT to do comedy . Tits and bums and the odd beaver . Nice ... if you are a pubescent boy with at least one hand free and have n't found out that Playboy exists . Give it a break because it was the early 70s ? No way . There had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior . The only way I could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at gunpoint . Retro ? Hardly . Sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be cutting edge in some circles ( and it could actually have been funny ) but it just comes off as really quite sad . What kept me going throughout the entire 75 minutes ? Sheer belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end . I gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients ... or perhaps people suffering from lockjaw ... their jaws would finally drop open in disbelief .
0 The only film I 've ever walked out on . Amazing , since I paid for myself and my date and I 'm really cheap . But my brain could n't stand any more of the dreck being piled on , particularly since I could have written funnier material while tie up and gagged.<br /><br />From the beginning to the end this film offends . Worse , it ai n't funny . It was n't funny then , and it sure ai n't funny now . But even worse , is that this film represents the beginning of the end of really smart , sophisticated comedy . It 's juvenile , really sophomoric script and ideas began an era ( which continues to this day ) where cheap laughs , and sexual innuendo dominate the culture of comedy in film.<br /><br />Sexual Olympics ? What High School kid has n't thought of that ? The beginning of the end .
0 A repressed housewife ( an annoying lisping Angie Dickinson , whose body double treats / horrifies us with an extreme closeup of her delicates ) is sexually bored by her husband and decides to branch - out . This directly results in a string of murders that soon involve a high - class prostitute ( Nancy Allen , clearly I am in the wrong business if SHE can bring home $ 600 a night ) and her psychologist ( Michael Caine ) . If you are going to watch De Palma rip off ( excuse me , " pay homage to " ) Hitchcock , watch " Sisters " instead of this . " Dressed to Kill , " while loaded with style and technical skill , is one of the tackiest thrillers I have had the displeasure of sitting through . The plot is absurd and tired . It does feature some surprisingly effective jump scares and nasty graphic murder sequences that should please any horror fan , as long as they can get past the silly story line , that must have been dated even in 1980 .
0 A call - girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer 's next target . Director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious roll here : his camera swoops around corners in a museum ( after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape ) , divvies up into split screen for arty purposes , practically gives away his plot with a sequence ( again in split screen ) where two characters are both watching a TV program about transsexuals , and stages his ( first ) finale during a thunderous rainstorm . " Dressed To Kill " is exhausting , primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial . Much of the acting ( with the exception of young Keith Gordon ) is mediocre and the ( second ) finale is a rip - off of De Palma 's own " Carrie "-- not to mention " Psycho " . The explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of Hitchcock , not an homage . Stylish in a steely cold way , the end results are distinctly half - baked . * * from * * * *
0 I can find very little that s good to say about this film . I am sure the idea and script looked good on paper but the filmography and acting I am afraid is not the standards I would expect from some very talented people . I would doubt that this features highly in their CV Filmography . Michael Caine appeared wooden at times in his role as the Doctor , and at no time no did I actually believe in his character . The plot was unbelievable especially with regard to the victims son . Some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films , that at times I wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller . The lighting at times was dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big named stars , wondering why I bothered to watch it at all .
0 Sorry to go against the flow but I thought this film was unrealistic , boring and way too long . I got tired of watching Gena Rowlands long arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing . Maybe the film has some cinematic value or represented an important step for the director but for pure entertainment value I wish I would have skipped it .
0 Anyone who loved the two classic novels by Edward Ormondroyd will be disappointed in this film . All the magic and romance have been modernized out of his original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady , and given " three " in return . Three what ? Not three wishes , but three rides into the 1800 's on a rickety elevator ... <br /><br />The first novel is Time at the Top . The second is All in Good Time .
0 There is absolutely NO reason to waste your time with this " film " . The original said it all and still holds up . Either read the book or do some research about the story , and you 'll realize this remake is ludicrous . Eric Roberts as Perry Smith ? His sister could have done a better job ! Having been to Holcomb & Edgerton , KS where the story takes place , the sets and locations looked NOTHING like Kansas . The original is riveting , from the location filming to the use of the actual participants , weapons and victims belongings . Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake . Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and cinematography by Conrad Hall ... The original is available on DVD in widescreen now . Let this turkey die a quick death .
0 In Cold Blood was one of several 60s films that created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood film industry . Capote coined the phrase " nonfiction novel " to describe the book on which this film is based , and the spirit of that form was carried over into the film script , which he co - wrote . Despite the fact that we were well into the era of color film , Richard Brooks elected to present this film in black and white to underscore both the starkness of the landscape and the bleakness of the story . This is the first problem with the TV remake --color changes the tone of the story . In addition , the confinement of shooting a film for TV makes reduces the options of how the shots are framed and focused . As a result , we lose the dramatic clash which makes the second part of the original film ( police interviews , trial , imprisonment , and execution ) so claustrophobic . On the small screen , it 's just another version of Law and Order spin - offs . < br /><br />Hollywood 's search for scripts continuously takes it back to movies that were successful in another age . Usually , that 's a mistake , and this is no exception.<br /><br />All of the actors are competent . The script is OK . The directing does n't get in the way . It 's just that the movie does n't work as well as the original precision instrument . It does n't hook the viewer into the ambivalence toward Smith and Hickock that the original film provokes . At the end of the TV version , we are left with the feeling : " Ho hum , who cares?" < br /><br />See the original first , on as large a screen as you can , then watch the TV version simply to understand why the first one was such an important film in 1967.<br /><br />Wouldn't hurt to also go on line and read a bit about Capote and the original book . It will help you to understand the extraordinary effort he put into the material , and also some of the controversy surrounding both the book and the movie.<br /><br />I actually only gave this a 4 because I save the bottom 3 rankings for true bombs -- the kind that enrage you about having been sucked into spending an
0 Why do they insist on making re - makes of great movies like " High Noon " " From Here to Eternity " and this one?<br /><br />Why do they think that color is more engrossing to a viewer than stark black and white?<br /><br />Why did Robert 's insist on wearing that dopey , broad - billed , baseball cap? ... it made him look like Jim Varney.<br /><br />Why would anyone spend four hours suffering through this?<br /><br />Watch the original . Then YOU wo n't have to ask yourself WHY .
0 This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film . Nothing new or original is added other than Perry 's backflashes , which are of marginal interest . It lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective . Also painfully missing is the sharp Quincy Jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film . I ca n't understand any high ratings for this at all . It 's quite bad . Why does anyone waste time or money making crap like this and why did I waste time watching it ?
0 As there was nothing wrong with the acting etc etc the writing for the episode is way off for this series phantom or no phantom . It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the martian man hunter . You have to know that in the middle of the 6th series no matter what happens it is not true what is going on and really brings nothing to the story of the series except meeting the martian man hunter again and to waste 30 minutes to do this is by far another case of bad writing in the soap opera of smallville . I really like the show but mainly due to the cast and the 3 or so good episodes each year but who ever is on the writing cast that works or used to work on the soaps needs to be canned . This was by far one of the worst . With in the first 4 minutes you know that what is going on is bogus and anything happening is a dream based on Clark 's infliction obviously caused by a phantom zone character and when he wakes up he will win and blah blah blah so the writers do n't have to really create a villain that will progress the story line any this week . May as well have added another villain to die in the last episode the martian man hunter was in and made him fly away again or come back and tell Clark he forgot his sunglasses to get a closer look like in this episode and call it a day .
0 Not that " a film by Ulli Lommel " filled me with hope , but I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations . There is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects , which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock . But many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid . The effect is never perfect , but it helps . Unfiltered digital video really only works for the " mockumentary " style , because it never looks like anything other than video . Therein lies the primary trouble with ZODIAC KILLER . Watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer . It does not feel like watching a movie . And what 's even more unforgivable is that the Lommel is NOT a young filmmaker . He ought to know better . He ought to know that it 's virtually impossible to generate horror ( or even suspense ! ) on video . For the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties ! He may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business . And lucky us , he wrote the script too ! So you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing , unjustified behavior , and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied . Please , please miss this film . You 'll thank me later .
0 At least I was able to enjoy mocking the movie which is surprising since I was barely able to sit through it . In all honesty , my guess is the cover to the DVD case cost more than the entire movie . And saying that it is the same director as The Boogeyman , when a new version of that just came out ... nice touch guys , it was misleading enough to rope me in . The only thing that frustrated me more than the insufferable acting of the copycat was his haircut . Usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it . The film looks like it was shot by a D+ grad student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes .... sometimes , less is more buddy . Through out I would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained . All this makes a bad movie but when the ending does n't even come close to pulling it together , well , that makes it an exceptionally bad movie . Without a doubt this is the worst movie I have ever seen , and that includes my friends ' french final video for senior year of high school , but hey maybe i 'm a bit biased , I mean I did get to play an extra . P.S. I do n't even think this deserves a star ... not even a half . NONE FOR YOU ! !
0 1 is being pretty generous here . I really enjoyed BOOGEYMAN , even though it is not really the BOOGEYMAN promoted on the DVD cover and we all know it ! It creeped me out . But this film , it is something else . For being directed by a guy who has been around a long time and directed a lot of movies , it looks like it was shot on a VHS camcorder by a 10 year old ! The story and acting are atrocious ! David Hess , you have let me down too . After playing one of the most menacing villains in film history , you have resorted to this ? The story and acting may have been able to be forgiven however , if anyone had taken the time to make the video look somewhat professional . There are a LOT of shot on video films out there that do n't look like it , or at least are n't so obvious that it detracts your attention from the film . I ca n't say it is the worst movie ever , because I could n't make it through the entire film , but it is certainly close .
0 Except people apparently buy into this garbage ! As shows like " Moral Orel " have shown , even if you tried to make the most outrageous , over - the - top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of , it would n't come close to the hilarity of this show . It 's hard to tell what 's even going on when you 're watching it . Is it a news show ? A talk show ? Who knows ! ? They start out by reporting on various international news stories , but at seemingly random points , the news is interrupted by this odd , troll - like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face , mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy.<br /><br />Pat Robertson does n't even seem like such a bad guy at first glance . He just seems like a senile , yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs ( like most of our grandparents ) . But this is a man who has called for an assassination , who has befriended and offered aid to not one , but TWO murderous dictators , who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines , who has SUPPORTED forced abortions in China , and who regularly implies that Caucasians ( straight American male Caucasians in particular ) are superior to all other races.<br /><br />Still , this would all be funny , except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later ( either that , or enough money to bribe some TV executives who do n't give a damn what they show ) . The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people , somewhere , must be watching it and hanging onto every word . Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is , people still listen to him . I do n't know if it 's funny or scary . I guess a healthy mixture of both .
0 Hear are some of the interesting things our combat hero faith healer Pat , his son Gordon ( T.V. ministry seems like a family business . ) and Terry Meeuwsen ( Won Miss America in 1973 by wearing a swimsuit and showing her legs . Oh my goodness gracious ! ) say when our poor viewers are sick and need help.<br /><br />1 . Someone with an " abscessed right tooth"has just now been healed.2 . Someone with " twisted intestines " has been healed.3.Then Terry said there was a person with a " strange condition",(You mean God does n't know ? ) a burning in the legs , who has just been healed.4 . Then Gordon said there 's a man(That narrows it down ! ) with swelling of the sinuses in his right cheek , with much pain behind the right eye , but he is now healed.5.Someone with a problematic right hip , limited mobility from a stroke , is now able to walk . 6 . Terry said she saw someone with severe with severe stiffness in the neck bone , but did n't know the exact ailment(God does n't know?)-that the person is now healed . 7 . Someone paralyzed on the right side , particularly(Not exactly ? ! ) the right side of the face has now been healed.8 . A man ( That narrows the world population down again . ) with a plate in his skull is having a continual problems , and the doctors just do n't know what to do . Terry said she saw the bone reforming around the plate(The funny bone?!)and the mans pain is gone , he was now healed.<br /><br />Hers how our war hero Pat helps our sick and poor people . 1 . There 's a woman in Kansas City ( Missouri or Kansas but that narrows it way down . ) who has a sinus the lord is drying it up now thank you Jesus . 2 . There 's a man with a financial need- I think a hundred thousand dollars.(I think their god needs to go to school or something ! ) That need is being met met right now , and within three days , the money will be supplied through the miraculous power of the holy spirit . Thank you Jesus . 3.There is a woman in Cincinnati with cancer of the lymph nodes . < br /><br />I do n't know whether its been diagnosed yet ( Ask your vengeful god Pat ! ) but you have n't been feeling well , and the lord is dissolving that cancer right now!(What?!)4 . There is a lady in Saskatoon(I assume Canada . ) in a wheelchair - curvature of the spine , The lord is straightening that our right now , and you can stand up and walk!(If you have this condition ignore Pat ! ) Just claim it and it 's yours . Thank you Jesus ! Amen , Amen!<br /><br />When Pat Robertson had prostate cancer did he go to Peter Popoff ? , Oral Roberts?,Benny Hinn?,Terry or Gordon ? No ! On February 17,2003 Pat went to a REAL DOCTOR to have his surgery ! ( You mean he does n't trust his faith healing friends , Terry or his own son Gordon?!)<br /><br />When LT Pat Robertson was in the Marines during the Korean war He was a liquor officer , responsible for keeping the officers supplied with liquor . He was known to drink himself and frequent prostitutes and he feared he contacted gonorrhea.(Should of asked a faith healer for help!)<br /><br />The reason Pat got out of combat was because his daddy Absalom Willis Robertson ( D Va from 1946 - 66 ) was Chairman of the Senate Military Appropriations Committee.<br /><br />Terrorist Attacks , September 11 , 2001 We have imagined ourselves invulnerable and been consumed by the pursuit of health , wealth,(Pats worth between 150 and 200 million dollars folks ! ) material pleasures(A mansion in Virginia beach Virginia with a helicopter launching pad ! ) and sexuality(He had had sex with his future wife before marriage which they had a son ! ) . It ( terrorism ) is happening because god is lifting his protection from us . ( Statement released on September 13 , 2001 . ) Pat Robertson reminds me of Burgermeister on Santa Claus Is Coming To Town and his evil vengeful god reminds me of Venger on Dungeons And Dragons.<br /><br />Spoiled brat Gordon does what daddy Pat tells him to and Terry is a paid yes woman who neither have minds of their own!<br /><br />This will really grab you ! The September 5 2005 edition of The 700 Club included a report Christian Broadcasting Network correspondent Gary Lane from outside New Orleans Convention Center which has housed mostly impoverished black disaster victims throughout the weekend."A number of possessions left behind suggest the mindset of some of the evacuees"Lane said"they include this voodoo cup with the saying"May the curse be with you . " A shot of a plastic cup souvenir cup from one of the New Orleans countless trinket shops appeared on the screen . " Also music CDs with the title Guerrilla Warfare and Thugs ' R ' Us . " Lane stated , pointing out a pile or rap CDs strewn on the ground . ( His bigoted daddy Absalom has taught Pat racism well!)<br /><br />If any of you good people ever think of donating to these sexist bigoted people please in the name of God do n't ! Sponsor a softball or basketball team , give to a food shelf , be a big brother or sister to a child but please do n't give to these people because they have been around for over 40 years and solved nothing.<br /><br />If you still do n't believe me type Pat Robertson overheard during commercial break on the web and hit search and once you hear what he s really like , I know for sure that you will not give one cent to these conning liars ! And by the way Terry once had a divorce and Pat has talked against divorce many times on his shows.<br /><br />I like to say hello to the folks in Dover Pennsylvania , Orlando Florida , and to the nice folks who got hit by hurricane Katrina and I hope its a pleasant day . Has Operation Blessing been helpful to New Orleans?(I doubt it ! ) Please let our readers know ! I do ! By the way folks if your sick , go to a real doctor and lets everybody laugh at these liars and someday Burgermeister Pat , Gordon and Terry can go someplace else and take their angry god Venger with them !
0 does anyone think that this show actually helps some people , or does it only anger the people who watch it ? when i am flipping through the channels and come upon this show i half to watch out of morbid curiosity . i understand that pat Roberson is not all together . what i do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listening to what he has to say . pat Roberson is of little consequence . he is an old man who thinks in an old way . fear of damnation no longer has the same affects as it once did ( thank god ) . now if someone will please answer my question i will be dodging lightning bolts for the rest of eternity .
0 " The 700 Club " has to be the single most bigoted television program in the history of television itself . To make matters worse , it 's been on the air since 1966 , implying that thousands if not millions of people are buying into its hate and lies . Headed by Pat Robertson , the unscrupulous , megalomaniacal founder and leader of the Christian Coalition , " The 700 Club " takes us from misinformation to misunderstanding , broadcasting " news " as they like to think of it and trying to convince its audience that all of the world 's problems are to blame on homosexuals , Wiccans , New Age spiritualists , Muslims , Jews , Hindus , non - Fundamentalist Christians , Democrats , single mothers , foreigners , feminists , evolutionists , environmentalists , NASA scientists , and anyone else who does n't share their fanatical religious views . It 's actually the best fake news since " The Daily Show " or the " Weekend Update " segment of " Saturday Night Live , " or since " FOX News , " for that matter . Of course , Pat 's always the one who makes each of the decisions , saying whatever comes to mind and not giving a damn who it offends or hurts . In the meantime , he continues his part in the struggle to transform the United States into a militarized police state by having the Religious Wrong stick their noses in everything they can and asking for one donation after another - no less than a measly $ 100 to become a member , by the way - to fund Pat 's African diamond mines and buy oil from companies reprimanded by the government in the past for their abuse of the environment . No , never mind that Pat was good friends with the genocidal dictators of Zaire and Zimbabwe in order to help him acquire such wealth ; it 's all for the greater glory of God , do n't you know ? And of course , the hosts of " The 700 Club " are always willing to read letters " written by viewers " as they like to put it , coincidentally each typed in the same format and all on the same color of paper by " viewers " supposedly healed of various afflictions by the said hosts ( they claim to have " words of knowledge " come to them ) but who NEVER APPEAR on the program to say what happened to them . Honestly , how can anyone take a show seriously when they 're using a poor applause recording ? It should make people wonder why there 's no studio audience.<br /><br />The sad thing that Pat 's cronies and viewers do n't realize or just do n't WANT to realize are the horrible things he 's done and said . This is a guy who agreed with Jerry Falwell that the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States were the result of God punishing us for our acceptance of homosexuality and feminism . Ironic , considering that Pat has twice publicly referred to the implementation of a nuclear weapon in the State Department ; I have little doubt it was his wealth that kept him from getting arrested for such statements . His rants against homosexuals , single mothers , and any number of sexual practices he considers " sinful " are interesting , considering he was known to frequent a number of brothels during the Korean War . As the Bible says , be fruitful and multiply , so congratulations , Pat - thanks to you , there 's probably a number of children born to single Korean mothers . Then , of course , there was the time he called for the assassination of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ( not that he 's a saint , but still ) . Oh , yes , and let 's not soon forget the time this " crusader for human life " supported forced abortions in China . Very " Christian " of him , would n't you say?<br /><br />And just in case Pat has forgotten , I have n't forgotten his little speech that evangelical Christians today are " being treated exactly as the Jews were in Nazi Germany . " Honestly , to compare his " plight " to the horrors of the Holocaust is almost unforgivable . Speaking of which , need I mention about how he blatantly lied that homosexuality ran rampant among the Nazi party in a pathetic attempt to discredit homosexuals ? Of course , history shows us that the Nazis acted toward homosexuals the same way they acted toward Jews . Pat Robertson is one of the biggest liars in history . If he was Pinocchio , his nose would encircle the Earth.<br /><br />Unfortunately , more and more people continue to believe him every day . This is your wake - up call , people ; " The 700 Club " is one of the most if not the single most vile program in television history . It 's evil masquerading as good ; it 's a wolf - in - sheep's - clothing . It 's bigoted filth that tries to look clean , pretty , and loving . It 's living proof that hateful , dangerous religious views are n't confined to certain groups in the Middle East . Even those who are not of the Christian faith know that it goes against everything Jesus taught , and if Jesus was to appear to this " club , " He would n't be emulating them . Instead , He 'd be chastising them as He did the Pharisees of His time and overturning the money bins of their telethons as He did in front of the synagogue in His time . All I can say is thank God that Pat had no chance of becoming President ; if he did , he 'd be the harbinger of Armageddon - and not on the side of the good guys .
0 Before I start ... let me say that I fully believe in God . I believe in Heaven and in Hell . Kay now that that s out of the way , I just wanna say that What in the world do these morons that call themselves " hosts " think they are doing ? ? The last time I checked a host does n't discriminate , spew hatred filled rants on TV , or try to shove their own beliefs down every unfortunate soul that ventures onto the channel . ALl of these that crazy , idiotic , conservitive , bible thumping , Fred Phelps lover Pat Robertson does daily . I am all for free speech , but since when does that cover a guy who pretty much says that if you venture off his ideal way of life you are right away sent to hell ? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of SOOOO many problems . One day in my class room we had a substitute teacher in so we decided to watch some TV since the teach did n't give us any work . And we ( against many of us 's will ) watched 700 's Club , and of course that jerk Pat was on ranting and raving about the bible , and he said Simon along the lines of " God says Homosexuality is a sin " and I actually heard a kid go " Hmm I guess he 's right . " WTF ? ? ? Seriously , if the host is trying to make people think that someone else 's sexual orientation is a huge sin , then they seriously need to take that host , duct tape them , and throw them off of a cruise liner in the middle of the arctic .
0 Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons dubiously claimed " relatively good track record " on predictions < br /><br />In his widely reported comments from the January 2 edition of the Christian Broadcasting Network 's The 700 Club , during which he predicted that there would be " very serious terrorist attacks " and " mass killing " in the United States in the " second half " of 2007 , host Pat Robertson boasted that he had " a relatively good track record " on earlier predictions . But a review of Robertson 's 2006 New Year 's predictions undermines that claim . He predicted , for example , that:<br /><br / > * " President Bush is going to strengthen . " WRONG < br /><br / > * " The fall elections will be inconclusive , but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the Republicans in charge . " WRONG < br /><br / > * " The war in Iraq is going to come to a successful conclusion . We 'll begin withdrawing troops before the end of this year . " WAY WRONG < br /><br />Further , as a January 3 Associated Press article reported , Robertson has a history of making dubious predictions:<br /><br />The broadcaster predicted in January 2004 that President Bush would easily win re - election . Bush won 51 % of the vote that fall , beating Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts . WRONG < br /><br />In 2005 , Robertson predicted that Bush would have victory after victory in his second term . He said Social Security reform proposals would be approved WRONG YET AGAIN ! < br /><br />He claims to speak directly with god ... If so god has quite the sense of humor watching Pat make a fool of himself again and again ..
0 I turn on 700 Club once in awhile and only agree with some of the statements made- I 'm one of many believers that is considered liberal by most Christians and conservative by most non - Christians . I vote my mind , and its usually not rep . or dem . - i do n't believe 700 club tells people what to believe , but that it represents many older christians that grew up in very conservative backgrounds . i think many folks misunderstand what is said on 700 club . it bums me out to hear name calling either direction . i think 700 club folks really do love Jesus but are so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively that they 've forgotten to show love to certain people and promote peace like Jesus did . Please do n't judge Jesus based on ignorant individuals that believe on Him and let 's also not be as ignorant with our comments about them . Why ARE people so mean to each other ?
0 " Back of Beyond " takes place at a dive diner / gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor ( Paul Mercurio ) , a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive . We get what , at first , confusingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister ( though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film ) are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle . Afterwards , he appears as a terribly quiet , and sometimes , moody character in the presence of the arrivals.<br /><br />We know one thing is for sure and that is McGregor 's sort of spiritual sense , his foresight of danger and such -- his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story , the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who 's car breaks down and who rely on Tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way . Of course , Tom falls for one of the thieves , a young woman named Charlie , and suddenly , it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other . But not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action . In fact , the whole movie all the while seems to want to build up to something significant , but really fails to do so . Even the ending , of which plays out like a trite campfire tale ( and one that really reveals a lot of narrative flaws ) , is almost just as ridiculous.<br /><br />It may be worth trying if you do n't mind the terribly slow pacing , but are in the mood , at least , for something a little different than the usual .
0 Pointless boring film with charismatic Mercurio completely wasted . Released for a minute on a Thursday in maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of Sydney except me and four others BACK OF BEYOND is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a fee . Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better ( well Polson has morphed into a Director of lame thrillers like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK ) and Terry Serio seems never to get a guernsey apart from thug roles . But Paul Mercurio should have become one of Australia 's greatest exports on screen . Roles like this are major disappointments and films like this are just a waste of talent and time .
0 Poor Paul Mercurio . After landing the role of Scott Hastings in Strictly Ballroom , the best film in history , he managed to find himself doing a lot of rubbish . None of the characters in this film is very unlikable , or even hateable , but Mercurio 's lead is the sort of person you prefer to ignore - completely unloveable and he wears OVERALLS . Big mistake in costume design , that one .
0 If this series supposed to be an improvement over Batman - The Animated Series , I , for one , think it failed terribly . The character drawing is lousy ... ( Catwoman , for instance , looks awful ... ) But what really annoyed me is that it made Batman look like a sort of wimp who just ca n't take care of himself in a battle , without the help of two , even three sidekicks . I mean , he 's Batman , for God 's sake ! I know the comic books , I know that Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be Batman 's allies , besides Robin , but still ... making Batman say that he needs help from them ... What , he ca n't handle a few punches ? In BTAS , he could face a dozen adversaries without any problem ... He 's getting old ? Come on ... <br /><br />And another thing : I really do n't think that Batman would allow a kid like Tim Drake to go into battle that soon , without years of hard training . One , it 's irresponsible ( and Batman is everything , but irresponsible ) , and two , it 's not what happened in the comics , if we are to remain faithful to them.<br /><br />Batman - The Animated Series made history , with its animation , its stories and its characters ... That really was a legend of Batman . The New Adventures series turned the legend into just another Batman flick .
0 First of all I must admit Batman : The animated series is the best batman series by far . We watched it when it used to be on TV . I did n't realize that there was a season four . Actually there was n't . BTAS ends with season 3 , and it should have stopped there.<br /><br />Why did they have to mess with a good thing . Catwoman and Poison ivy now have terrible grey faces . The Joker looks beyond scary , it seems that each time they revise his appearance he looks more and more creepier . He does n't seem to have pupils anymore , and now he does n't even look remotely human ( although he is).<br /><br />Bruce Wayne is voiced by Kevin Conroy who does the best batman . Although he now looks like superman . There is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same , Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes.<br /><br />Night Wing really needs a haircut , please ! Alfred just has pupils from eyes , looks more like a character from the 80's.<br /><br />I have watched three episodes from Disc 1 in the series and I already find that this version is more violent and graphic ( there is blood in every episode).<br /><br />If you are a fan of Batman : The animated series , there is no batman season 4 . They just included this series as season 4 for marketability . If they just released it as The New batman adventures I do n't think as many people would have bought it.<br /><br />Save yourself the disappointment and stick to seasons 1 - 3 .
0 On the 26th of September 1983 a short dumpy 60 year old woman stood trial for the attempted murder of Leonie Haddad , a lady whose husband had recently died and had agreed to take in a lodger who came via a housing authority for the elderly . Haddad was not made aware that her new lodger had , in fact , come fresh from The Patton State Mental Hospital where she had been incarcerated for an inexplicable knife attack on a married couple three years previously . Haddad soon realised that something was ' rotten in Denmark ' when the woman began to lock herself in the bathroom with a tape recorder reciting prophesies about ' seven Gods ' . Haddad 's fears were confirmed one night when she awoke to find her lodger sitting astride her chest holding a bread knife announcing that " God has inspired me to kill you " . Haddad managed to knock her assailant out with a telephone but not before she had lost a finger and suffered deep lacerations to her face and chest . It was a miracle she survived . The lodger was judged to be innocent by reason of insanity but sent , kicking and screaming , back to the laughing academy . Ten years later she was released and found that she was now a celebrity ; but not for the brutal attacks on her innocent victims , but for her incarnation of 25 years earlier when she was known as the ' Queen of the Curve 's , the ' Tennessee Tease ' and ' Miss Pin Up Girl of the World ' - the Notorious Bettie Page . < br /><br />Director Mary Harron , mainly known for ' American Psycho ' takes us back to the glory days of a legendary cheesecake and bondage model ( played solidly enough by Gretchen Mol ) who inadvertently wrote the blue print for fetish iconography and whose influence can be detected in everything from comic books to catwalks . T.N.B.P is day - glo fun ride through an evocative depiction of the 1950 's where Page , with the familial help of good intentioned boyfriends and photographers , becomes the number one star of pocket sized men 's glossies with titles like Wink , Tab and Parade . Her real dream of movie stardom evades her and a brush with the authorities over obscenity charges in 1957 is the inciting incident which leads her to retire from modelling and give herself to God . The overall style of the film is light and frothy and only darkens momentarily with an allusion to her father 's incestuous attentions and a sexual assault which inexplicably appears to have no discernible effect on her . Mol plays Page as she seems in her photographs , happy , carefree and fun - even the bondage shots betray little more than a good humoured incomprehensibility . The film ends on the upbeat with Page cheerfully handing out bibles in a park with no indication of the real life unhappy marriages , personal tragedy and decent into murderous insanity which lay before her ; avoiding what I think is the essential core of Page 's story - rebirth and resurrection . < br /><br />Having emerged from a decade of incarceration Page found that her cult had been in the ascendance since the mid 1980 's and that she had become a huge underground icon , during which , many were asking " whatever happened to Bettie Page " . Her ' mysterious ' disappearance fed the fires of any number of conspiracy theories only adding to the allure of her legend . When the world 's media finally caught up with her she gave no hint of her darker past and she was soon giving interviews for magazines , T.V and being photographed at Playboy parties with the likes of Pamela Anderson and the equally tragic Anna Nicole Smith . She found that she was now more famous than she ever was in her ' glory years ' but in the glare of this ' resurrection ' it was only a matter of time before the full story would come to light . < br /><br />The only notorious thing about The Notorious Bettie Page is they left out the part when she became truly notorious .
0 The ultimate goal of Big Brother , that we know what to think before we think it , has been realized . Is it some kind of miracle , or sinister joke , that people don mental straight jackets of their own volition , twist themselves into contorted shapes , and grin like apes ? Movies , art , no longer risk the unknown , but are forgone conclusions , drained of life.<br /><br />"The Notorious Bettie Page " is a bland case history , fit for a freshman college feminism course . Its lesson is schematic , right - angled and linear : " See how women are objectified , exploited , abused , then tossed on the trash heap , by a male - dominated society." < br /><br />Bettie Page , supposedly , was the " pin - up queen of the 1950 's , " the ass millions of men ejaculated to . ( All reviewers repeat that phrase , " pin - up queen of the 1950 's , " like a choir of monkeys . ) Her history as an American sex bomb is familiar : Southern , abused by her father , raped , etc . In this movie she is a naïf , an innocent unaware of the prurient interests she serves and shamelessly profits from . Although she believes in Jesus , she enjoys frolicking nude before a camera lens -- just the wholesome girl - next - door sex - slave American males supposedly fantasize.<br /><br />From the mouth of writer - director Mary Harron herself , Oxford - educated AND ex - punker ( do you smell the combined rot of privilege and " hipness " as I do ? ) : " I feel that without feminism , I would n't be doing this . ... I do n't make feminist films in the sense that I do n't make anything ideological . But I do find that women get my films better . " What a cozy clique.<br /><br />The movie merely goes through the motions of telling the story of a human life , it 's subject and purpose having been eulogized and interred well before the movie began . Ms. Page has a boyfriend , but we are shown next to nothing about their relationship . In fact , there are no intimate or detailed relationships in the film . < br /><br />One ca n't ignore its smug simplicity . In New York , where Ms. Page tries her best to fit into and appease a man 's world , letting herself be tied up in the ropes of bondage and tightly laced into the black leather boots and bodices of S & M , the movie is black and white . But down in Miami , where she goes to get away from it all , gleefully takes off her clothes , and is photographed by a " liberated " female , the movie turns into color.<br /><br />Like hell Harron does n't " make feminist films , " does n't " make anything ideological . " Ideology has become so internalized , so assumed , so programmed , that it 's almost invisible . Big Brother must be smiling .
0 Sadly , Marry Harron decided to do a fictional account of Bettie Page 's life to go along with her own issues with men . As typical in all her work , every major male character is portrayed as weak , bumbling , or twisted . To add to her fiction , she projects ideas and issues that are not true , according to Bettie Page herself . Bettie did not leave the biz because she thought it was morally wrong or had religious issues ( though she became a born - again later in life , through the influence of her 3rd husband- a minister ) . She left it , because she was in her late 30 's , her acting career had gone nowhere and she felt she was losing her looks . The hints of molestation and rape are unvalidated and denied in Bettie 's own words and are the director 's attempts to claim that any woman who did what Bettie did must have been victimized by men . Harron fails to point out that Bettie designed her own clothes in almost all her shoots ( not handed to her by " sick " fetishists ) . Harron also fails to make a point that Bunny Yeager , who did many famous photo shoots of Bettie , also did many " naughty " shoots with Bettie and was not the morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film.<br /><br />The only saving grace is Gretchen Mol looks very much like Bettie . Otherwise , there are other movies and documentaries more accurate and honest to her life and the people in it .
0 Who is Bettie Page ? I certainly did n't find out while watching this movie . From what I have gathered from other sources , Ms. Page was highly in demand in the post - world war II period as the queen of " naughty " pictures and that is exactly what this film depicts . I never did get to know Bettie , the woman , though . Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of an Evangelical Christian upbringing and a sordid home life which is only hinted at . The film glosses over her personal life and gets right down to the purpose of the film , the " naughty " pictures . Characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames but there is frame after frame of Bettie in her pointy bras , Bettie in her girdle and stockings , Bettie in bondage ... etc . The movie slides from black and white to color every time Ms. Page visits Miami Beach . Then back to her shades of gray life in New York we go . Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the most dimwitted young ladies you could ever meet . When Bettie confides to a friend that she missed being her High School valedictorian by getting an A- rather than an A one can only assume that there were only two students in her Senior class . The most interesting part of this movie is how quaint Ms. Page 's " naughty " photos seem in 2007 . It is truly sad that seeing a woman trussed up like a pig on a spit would n't even get a hit on My Space or You Tube . I 'm not sure if this movie was written poorly or if some crazed editor cut the thing to shreds . I would only recommend it as a source for persons studying the history of odd undergarments .
0 I have only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films ( Girl 6 , Donnie Brasco ) , and do n't really remember her , but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy.<br /><br />She really did n't think what she was doing was wrong , even when she left the business and found her religion again.<br /><br />The photos she made were certainly tame by today 's standards , and it is funny seeing men with cameras get all excited , and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography . David Strathairn ( Good Night , and Good Luck ) played a super part here.<br /><br />Mary Harron ( American Psycho ) wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever .
0 When setting out this film , director Mary Harron seemingly had the goal of clearly documenting the progress of Bettie Page 's career , from early modelling days to leaving modelling to go back home after the Senate Hearings on Juvenile Delinquency and her religious rediscovery in the 50s , and so intent is she to get all of these facts on screen in the time allowed she seems to have missed out on taking any time to explain anything in depth.<br /><br />When you think of someone who had Page 's career you 'd think that there would be plenty to discuss , her reasons , decisions , life event , personal traumas , but Harron avoids any kind of personal exploration of the character . In the first fifteen minutes or so of the film there are brief hints of child abuse , domestic violence and a gang rape , but these are all rushed past and then never referred to again . You get the impression that Harron and Guinevere Turner ( co - writer ) wanted to gloss over anything that was n't glamorous and flattering . You go into this film expecting to gain an insight into who the person behind the posters was , but all you are given is a list of things that she did and recreations of some of her most famous photo shoots.<br /><br />All in all the film really frustrates you as you watch , desperately waiting for some extra layer to reveal itself . How did she balance her religion with her job ? What made this young Tennessee girl move from modelling into bondage photography . The film simply shows her going to another modelling agency and putting on whatever she 's told , but surely it would have involved some shock and deliberation , this was after all the 50s.<br /><br />It seems to me that Harron is trying to make a point about how tame all this is by today 's standards ( Page never took any photos of explicit sexual actions ) and how the reaction some gave this kind of thing was really overzealous And although this is true , she never actually makes it seem sordid in the eyes of others . Today we look at a young girl posing topless and think nothing off it , but we should have got some sort of feeling about how shocking it would have been to a contemporary audience . This woman was a central part of a Senate hearing on Juvenile Delinquency , but no one is ever really shown as shocked.<br /><br />Basically I left this film just thinking how tame it was . Harron and Turner have managed to avoid anything that might be unpleasant to a viewer . They come across as two lifelong fans of Miss Page and are desperate to make sure that nothing , absolutely nothing , could possibly put a bad light on their heroine , and have therefore avoided any in depth probing into who she really was . ( Before and after her career there are reports of her violent nature and mental problems ) And all that 's left is the string of events that made up her career , without any substance whatsoever behind it .
0 Well that 's 90 minutes of my life I wo n't get back . This movie makes teen tv show " California Dreams " look like " Almost Famous " . The acting was horrid and storyline unrealistic . Do n't even get me started on the actual band at the forefront of this story , lame songs , look etc .. You had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country , and there is n't enough irony in the world to accept that one . The guitarist is seen to be a heroin user , not that I blame him , if I was around such a putrid band with stale songs and wooden acting I 'd be injecting the horse too.<br /><br />If you take music remotely seriously , avoid this at all costs .
0 Now , I wo n't deny that when I purchased this off eBay , I had high expectations . This was an incredible out - of - print work from the master of comedy that I so enjoy . However , I was soon to be disappointed . Apologies to those who enjoyed it , but I just found the Compleat Al to be very difficult to watch . I got a few smiles , sure , but the majority of the funny came from the music videos ( which I 've got on DVD ) and the rest was basically filler . You could tell that this was not Al 's greatest video achievement ( that honor goes to UHF ) . Honestly , I doubt if this will ever make the jump to DVD , so if you 're an ultra - hardcore Al fan and just HAVE to own everything , buy the tape off eBay . Just do n't pay too much for it .
0 And the Oscar for the most under - rated classic horror actor goes to - Dwight Frye . Seriously his name should be stated with the same awe as Karloff , Lugosi , and Price , and this movie proves it . His character Herman was one of the 2 reasons I can give to watch this movie . Dwight gave this somewhat more than slightly disturbed misfit a lovable yet creepy demeanor that led you hoping for a larger role the entire movie.<br /><br />The other reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne . Being in the medical profession myself I have to give kudos to the expert performance of a self - pity prone hypochondriac . Though other " medical mistakes " did give a brief chuckle especially when the good doctor samples his fellow physicians medication ... " Well continue giving it to her " Unfortunately these 2 outstanding performances could not keep me awake through 3 attempts of sitting through this unbearably slow movie . The plot is predictable with only few minor twists . The filming while pulling off a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive at making me yawn - yes you can use too much shadow.<br /><br />My recommendation - watch this once to see Frye and Eburne - but only when wide awake and with lots of caffeine .
0 " When a small Bavarian village is beset with a string of mysterious deaths , the local ( magistrate ) demands answers into ( sic ) the attacks . While the police detective refuses to believe the nonsense about vampires returning to the village , the local doctor treating the victims begins to suspect the truth about the crimes , " according to the DVD sleeve 's synopsis.<br /><br />An inappropriately titled , dramatically unsatisfying , vampire mystery.<br /><br />Curiously , the film 's second tier easily out - perform the film 's lackluster stars : stoic Lionel Atwill ( as Otto von Niemann ) , skeptical Melvyn Douglas ( as Karl Brettschneider ) , and pretty Fay Wray ( as Ruth Bertin ) . The much more enjoyable supporting cast includes bat - crazy Dwight Frye ( as Herman ) , hypochondriac Maude Eburne ( as Aunt Gussie Schnappmann ) , and suspicious George E. Stone ( as Kringen ) . Mr. Frye , Ms. Eburne , and Mr. Stone outperform admirably . Is there another movie ending with a mad rush to the bathroom ? < br /><br />Magnesium sulfate   Epsom salts   it 's a laxative ! < br /><br / > * * * * The Vampire Bat ( 1933 ) Frank Strayer ~ Dwight Frye , Melvyn Douglas , Maude Eburne
0 Think " stage play " . This is worth seeing once for the performances of Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye . COmpare the Melvyn DOuglas in " Ghost Story " with the Melvyn DOuglas of this film . Are there vampires at loose in this ' Bavarian ' village , or is there a more natural , albeit equally sinister , explanation ? Dwight Frye is Herman , a red herring , who is cast as an especially moronic character . It 's fun to look at his different facial expressions in what is really a stock character . NOt much happens for a long time , but then we discover that Atwill 's pipe smoking doctor is the real murderer . There is too much ' comic relief ' but that is par for the course for this era . Fay Wray looks really good .
0 It 's the nature of businesses to try to capitalize on others ' success . Here we have a movie taking elements from the earlier ' Dracula ' ( 1931 ) and ' Frankenstein ' ( 1931 ) -- in a Germanic town the village leaders believe that vampires ( in the shape of bats ) have been the cause of recent deaths of bloodless victims . Even though shot at Universal ( and at the Bronson caves ! ) it 's a Poverty Row feature ; it 's not fair to compare it with those earlier , more expensively made and superior films.<br /><br />From the familiar and exciting , chilling music of the main titles ( which must have been by Mischa Bakalienikoff ) , through the talky but well done opening sequence , we anticipate the arrival of Lionel Atwill , Fay Wray and Dwight Frye to give us a good 30s mystery film . Unfortunately , it does n't happen . That 's the disappointment.<br /><br />We get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing , low budget , not enough of Dwight Frye , the overdone presence of Maude Eburne ( Aunt Gussie ) , and the premise for Lionel Atwill ( Dr. von Niemann ) to require human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant Emil ( Robert Frazier ) never made very clear.<br /><br />Do not watch the technicolor ' Dr. X ' ( 1932 ) -- which also stars Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray but as father and daughter -- before watching this the way I did ; it 's an Oscar winner by comparison . So watch this one first . Structurally , ' The Vampire Bat ' still is n't that good . It plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief , without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainy.<br /><br />Besides ' Dr. X ' and ' Mystery of the Wax Museum ' ( both 1932 and co starring Fay Wray ) , Lionel Atwill 's most famous appearances are as the one armed gendarme in ' Son of Frankenstein ' ( 1939 ) and as Moriarity in ' Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon ' ( 1943 ) . Dwight Frye steals all his manic scenes in ' Dracula ' ( 1931 ) . As the ' young lovers , ' Melvin Douglas and Fay Wray have a nice kissing scene , but that 's about it . He can be seen in ' The Old Dark House ' ( 1932 ) , and Fay gets dragged around by Joel McCrea in ' The Most Dangerous Game ' ( 1930 ) . Then there 's her 1933 classic ' screamer . ' Too bad more time , money and rewrites were n't available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of Lionel Atwill , Fay Wray and Dwight Frye . Sadly , then , this drearily disappointing film only gets a 4 .
0 Boy what a dud this mess was . But it only lasts an hour and I only paid a buck for it so I 'll live .... unlike the entire cast of this 1933 clunker who are all dust by now.<br /><br />So anyway a small village starts having bodies turning up that have been drained of all their blood . The local yokels start talking about vampires , of course , and a little more loudly after each body is found . The town sheriff or constable or whatever he is , played by awesome actor Melvyn Douglas , tries to tell them otherwise . When he mentions the fact that the dead have one large hole on each side of the neck , instead of two holes close together , the locals simply then say it 's a giant vampire bat . The constable insists that vampires do not exist and it must be a human culprit doing the killings.<br /><br />But Melvyn does n't seem too bothered either way . He spends most of his time trying to get into the pantaloons of his sweetie , played by Faye Wray . Also in this mix is the town simpleton , played by Dwight Frye , who always seemed to have played the same role in every movie he did . He further freaks out the townspeople by catching bats and drinking his own blood . Lionel Atwill plays the town doctor who seemingly is trying to help the constable solve the crimes . And boy does he ever stink as an actor . Atwill is as close to cardboard in this role as he could get . And Lionel Barrymore is also in this thing .... lots of big names to be such a pile of guano.<br /><br />Other than the terrible mis - title this movie has , the alternate name,"The Blood Sucker " is much better , this movie is also dull and plodding and just silly.<br /><br />For me the high point of the movie is watching Frye , he nails the freaky town weirdo but other than him this movie did n't offer much . And then when you find out the reason for the strange deaths and see the special effect thing that required all this blood you 'll really be let down.<br /><br />Bela Lugosi did a lot of awful pictures but at least he was fun and interesting to watch . Think of this movie as a really bad Lugosi clunker WITHOUT Lugosi and you 'll get a feel for how miserably bad this mess was.<br /><br />If you ca n't make a good 1930 's horror film at least put Lugosi in it .
0 The Vampire Bat is set in the small German village of Klineschloss where Gustave Schoen ( Lionel Belmore ) the Burgermeister is holding a meeting with Inspector Karl Brettschneider ( Melvyn Douglas ) from the local constabulary about all the recent murders , six victims have been discovered in as many weeks all drained of blood & bearing the same two puncture wounds on their necks . Brettschneider does n't have a single clue but the superstitious elders of the village believe the deaths to be the work of a Vampire . Brettschneider is n't convinced but the scared villagers keep telling tales of seeing a large Bat , meanwhile the latest victim Martha Mueller ( Rita Carlyle ) has been found . Brettschneider comes under increasing pressure to solve the murders but can he really believe that a giant Vampire Bat is responsible & if it is how 's he going to stop it?<br /><br />Directed by Frank R. Strayer The Vampire Bat was a cheapie from Majestic Pictures to cash in on the success of it 's two stars Atwill & Wray & their success in the previous years Doctor X ( 1932 ) & is more of a murder mystery rather than a horror as the exploitative & enticing title may have lead you to believe & quite frankly it 's rather dull . The script by Edward T. Lowe Jr. takes itself rather seriously & sets up the basic story that something is killing local villagers & that something could possibly be a Vampire , then for most of it 's duration the film focuses on Brettschneider & his incompetent investigations which are , not to put too fine a point on it , boring . The Vampire Bat also has a bit of an identity crisis as it does n't quite know what it wants to be , the title would suggest a horror film while the majority of it could easily be described as a thriller with the final few minutes descending into silly sci - fi . There is no Vampire Bat , the attempts to fool you are pathetic , all the character 's are broad stereotypes & you can tell the villain of the piece straight away & as a whole there is nothing particularly exciting or entertaining about The Vampire Bat . I know it 's old but that 's not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933 & a bland , flat , dull , boring & misleading film such as The Vampire Bat just does n't cut it these days , just look at the original King Kong ( 1933 ) released the same year & how brilliantly that still holds up today . I did n't like it & I doubt many modern film - goers would either , it 's as simple & straight forward as that.<br /><br />Director Strayer does n't do anything special but this is a case in point where I can cut the film some slack because of it 's age , as a whole it 's pretty much point , shoot & hope for the best stuff . There is n't much in the way of atmosphere or scares although some of the sets which were already existing ones taken from The Old Dark House ( 1932 ) & Universal 's European set on their back - lot are nice & add a certain ambiance to things.<br /><br />Technically The Vampire Bat ca n't compare to anything even remotely modern , for the age of it it 's alright I suppose but again I draw your attention back to the original King Kong . Speaking of King Kong it 's star Fay Wray has a role in this as does horror icon Lionel Atwill , I 'll be kind & say the acting is OK.<br /><br />The Vampire Bat will I imagine fool a lot of people into thinking that it 's a horror film about Vampire Bats when in fact it is n't , personally I thought the whole thing was a bit of a bore . It 's short & it tells it 's story reasonably enough but I must admit I 'm not a fan .
0 ' The Vampire Bat ' is definitely of interest , being one of the early genre - setting horror films of the 1930 's , but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise.<br /><br />The film is set in a European village sometime in the 19th Century , where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals . There is a very similar feel to James Whale 's ' Frankenstein ' and this is compounded by the introduction of Lionel Atwill 's Dr Niemann character , complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement.<br /><br />The vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red - herring by having suspicion fall on bat - loving village simpleton Herman ( Dwight Frye ) , thus providing the excuse for a torch - wielding mob to go on the rampage - as if they needed one.<br /><br />This is one of a trio of early horror films in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray co - starred ( also ' Doctor X ' and ' The Mystery of the Wax Museum ' ) and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill - advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements . Taken in context though , ' The Vampire Bat ' is still weak and derivative.<br /><br />All we are left with is a poor - quality Frankenstein imitation , with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink Dracula fans . But for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director Frank Strayer was doing the ' Blondie ' films a few years later .
0 CLASS OF ' 61 < br /><br />Aspect ratio : 1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format : Stereo < br /><br />In 1861 , class members from the West Point Academy are torn apart by the outbreak of the Civil War.<br /><br />Gregory Hoblit 's OK historical drama makes an obvious point - virtuous men are rendered blind by conflict - though the production seems a little stilted , despite authentic period detail and a cast of talented newcomers ( Clive Owen , Christien Anholt , Josh Lucas , Andre Braugher , Laura Linney , etc . ) , toplined by Dan Futterman as a conscientious Southerner who takes up arms in defence of slavery , pitting him in direct conflict with his former Northern friends . The movie 's emphasis on such a misguided - though sympathetic - character is particularly brave , but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial , and Hoblit 's direction is efficient rather than inspired .
0 A remake of Alejandro Amenabar 's Abre los Ojos , but this time with a living , breathing mask as a lead . For the dubious advantage of an English sound track , we endure Tom Cruise 's soulless performance , as usual , with zero depth . Yes , the character is identified with his persona , but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest . His empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz.<br /><br />There is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means . Cruise 's masking only painfully emphasizes his inadequacy as an actor . Do see the 1997 original Amenabar Open Your Eyes !
0 Well , I hate hollywood , but love cinema so i have to watch these cruddy movies in theaters . And , I was hoping Vanilla Sky would be good . i was hoping that they would either keep the original " Open Your Eyes " exactly the same , or they would make it their own . Well , it happened to be a little bit of both , and it sucked.<br /><br />It started out good . I love Radiohead . I wish there was more of that . But by the end we are listening to Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys . Talk about a wide range of suck between . They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others , but why oh why did they have to blare GV during the climax . It was more annoying than confusing or blatant . Especially when it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT . At least put some meaning behind the songs . Kid A = primary . Whatever.<br /><br />He also did a bang up job with the club scene . That was cool . Otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance . As if audiences would get the movie . The ones that would get it read subtitles , and the rest wo n't . Its as simple as that . The motivations got all screwed up . I did n't comprehend the Diaz motivations ( had n't they done the Chicken Soup night before ? ) and some of the others . And I hate Kurt Russell . Stay overboard . Tom Cruise ca n't act ( especially in these types of movie [ i.e. Eyes Wide Shut ] ) . And the elevator . I get it . Anyways they tried improving the original with a crappy american rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film print and glossy processing and it would have helped if crowe had n't screwed it up.<br /><br />2/10 Major disappointment .
0 This was n't the major disaster that I was expecting , but that is about as positive as I can be in my description of the movie . I 'm not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie , but I suppose it 's all a matter of taste . Personally , I do n't find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television , but then again , I 'm not a fan of Jerry Springer 's pathetic daytime talk show . I did n't get too bored watching this , but I was definitely never enjoying it , either . If you 're in the mood to see a bad movie , but one that is n't too painful to sit through , this is a good choice .
0 I 'm not a regular viewer of Springer 's , but I do watch his show in glimpses and I think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time . So naturally , I 'm going to watch this movie expecting to see " Jerry Springer Uncensored . " First of all , Jerry appears in approximately twenty minutes of the film 's running time . The other hour and twenty minutes is spent building up this pseudo - farce about trailer - trash , jealousy , incest and deception . Jaime Pressley ( who looks hot as HELLLL ) is a trailer - trash slut who sleeps with her stepfather ( a very unusual - looking , chain - smoking , drunken Michael Dudikoff who finally strays from his action hero persona ) . The mom finds out about the affair , they get into a fight , they want to take it to the " Jerry " show ( that 's right , no Springer ) . And then we have a parallel story with an African - American couple . They take it to the " Jerry " show . The characters collide . Blah , blah , freakin ' blah ! Trash has rarely been this BORRRINGG ! ! ! ! I was wondering why the hell Springer has millions of fans , yet none of them checked out his movie . Well , now it 's TOTALLY obvious ! ! Whether you love him or hate him , you will hate this movie ! How can I explain ? It 's a total mess of a motion picture ( if that 's what you call it ) . It 's so badly edited , with scenes that just do n't connect , and after a period of time the plot virtually disappears and it 's simply all over the map ! Just imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce . With seldom laughs . < br /><br />My only positive note is a hot girl - girl scene . That 's as risque as it gets . Do n't get me wrong , the scene 's pretty risque , but if you look at the overall film comparing it to the material on Springer 's program -- this disastrous farce seems extremely sanitized.<br /><br />My score : 3 ( out of 10 )
0 Somebody could probably make a great documentary about the Jerry Springer Show , but this fictionalized version merely succeeds in draining anything authentic and interesting out of the trash - TV phenomenon . There are dozens of famously bad movies ( e.g. " Manos : The Hands of Fate " ) that show more creativity and spirit than this dreary , witless waste of film.<br /><br />Seriously , why not a documentary about the Jerry Springer Show , that would begin to answer some of the real questions like : Who are these people ? What happens to their lives after they appear on this show ? How did the mayor of Cincinatti find himself here?<br /><br />One good line : During an " orientation " session for guests : " People , I ca n't emphasize this enough : NO WEAPONS ! "
0 The only thing that kept me from vomiting after seeing this movie was the fact that these are just actors and not the freak show that usually appears on the TV show . This is also the main reason that fans of the TV show wo n't like the movie , but not the only reason . This movie has about as much entertainment value as getting a root canal . It approaches the abyssmal depths of bad movie making , and then gets even worse . I wo n't waste your time describing this movie in further detail ; suffice it to say that I pity the poor camera people who had to suffer through watching this c**p the first time .
0 Lets make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically have everything that happens on the show ! Well if that idea does n't intrigue you , which it should n't , stay away from ringmaster . I had the displeasure of seeing this in the theater and actually being able to sit through this mess of a movie . I guess jerry springer does n't play himself as it shows from the cheap props for his show ( yes it looks even cheaper than the real jerry springer show ) and he is only known as jerry in the film . The plot ( if you can call it that ) is about a daughter while living with her mother decides to start sleeping with the mother 's live in boyfriend . So the mother 's brilliant idea is to call the jerry springer show as well as getting it on with her daughter 's boyfriend . ( Is it any coincidence they live in a trailer park ) . Meanwhile somewhere else in america a woman finds her cheatin ' man with her friend in bed together . So of course call america 's therapist Jerry springer ! I 'd talk about the rest of the film but even thinking about the film now is giving me a headache . Jamie Pressly who plays the daughter looks totally unattractive in the movie . And remember Michael Dudikoff the kick ass karate master from the american ninja series ? Well take a look at him now as a white trash drunk . The thing is he really looks too horrible and out of shape to call it " getting in touch with his charecter " . But if your idea of fun is seeing Jerry Springer sing a country song about his own show or guys hooking up with transvestites ... well ... JUST WATCH THE SHOW INSTEAD ! ... at least steve was smart enough to stay out of this flick .
0 Meaning : if this movie got pitched , scripted , made , released , promoted as something halfway respectable given the constraints ( yeah , I know , Springer , sex , violence ) , where is He?<br /><br />Reminded me of porn movies I saw in college , plot and dialogue wise .... shoulda just done something for the scurrilous porno market , showed penetration and be done with it-- would have made more money , the ultimate point of this exercise ....
0 Please avoid this movie at all costs . This is without a doubt , the worst movie I 've ever seen . Most movies have at least one redeeming value . This has none . Totally horrible !
0 Ringmaster , Jerry Springer 's pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film . First of all , it was made . Second of all , people went to see it . Third , some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen . If a monkey could make a movie , i 'm 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good . Most crappy movies have their moments , ( even Godzilla had a few cool special effects ) this film 's moment was when I left the theater nauseated . The only thing that possibly could 've made this movie any worse would be if Jerry Springer was the star . If I want to stare at crap for an hour and a half , i 'll take a dump in a can . If anyone did n't utterly despise this movie , I pity you , and your children , and your children 's children 's children ; however , contrary to Springer 's beliefs , I clearly do n't condone children having sex .
0 I love watching Jerry as much as the rest of the world , but this poor excuse for a soft - core porno flick is needlessly offensive , lacks anything resembling wit , and serves merely as a vehicle of self - promotion for Springer . Even though it runs a quick 90 minutes , the film drags hideously , and I should have had the common sense to walk out . Simply atrocious .
0 To preface this review , I must say that I was , I suppose , a little curious about this movie .. However , I probably would not have seen it had I not had my arm slightly twisted.<br /><br />In my opinion , this movie shows just how depraved man can be . In my eyes , the worst thing about this whole Springer phenomenon is not that type of people on the " Jerry Springer Show " act as they do ( which in itself is eminently reproachable ) , but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them and hear about their lives ( yes , I suppose that includes me .. to whatever extent it is true ) . If not glorifying that kind of behavior ( as some might say ) at the very least we may be subtly corrupting our minds and/or desenstizing ourselves to this type of behavior.<br /><br />But enough soapbox ( sort of ) . Here 's the skinny : the movie has an R rating , and while it may deserve only that ( I did look away at some scenes , so I 'm not completely sure ) , I feel that an NC-17 ( tip of the hat to the other reviewer ) might be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content ( a cynic might comment that the movie was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen ) . The plot is very bizarre , tying together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks upset who will appear on different Springer shows . At the end , the movie leaves one with some resolvement- and Springer rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world ( evidently as seen through his show ) . I agree with him there- it is important to know how the world really is so that we can seek to effect positive change . Having said that , let me just tell you- the world 's pretty bad- glance in a newpaper or the news to see that , but let 's not shell out good money to support the kind of sensationalistic and perhaps formulaic titallition that Springer seeks to give us .
0 Ok , let me say that I did n't expect a film starring Jerry Springer to be cinematic gold , all I asked for was it to be cinematic ... and it was n't even that . It looked like someone 's bad home movies . Poorly acted , scripted , and filled to the brim with nudity of the most unnattractive people I 've ever seen.<br /><br />The film 's " plot " focuses on a low - class family who decide to go on the " Jerry Farrelly Show " to discuss multiple affairs between a mother , daughter , stepfather and the daughter 's fiancee . From there , the movie fizzles and develops into a unique experience : white - trash pornography . There 's redneck sex , interacial sex , even sex between Jerry and his wife ? ( Yuk ! ) This film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second circumcision . At least it was mercifully short . Disgusting and degrading . African - Americans and working class America should be offended . ( Howard Stern should be pleased however , he did n't squander his attempt for film stardom . His was smart , funny and entertaining)<br /><br />MY GRADE : F+ ( the daughter was hot )
0 I ca n't quite say that " Jerry Springer : Ringmaster " is the worst film I have ever seen . The film would be better off if it were , because at least the worst film I 've ever seen , ( Prom Night II ) interested me enough for me to hate it . My only reaction after leaving the theatre happened when I looked up at the clock and discovered that only 90 minutes had passed . It had seemed much more like years . It is an endless repetition of poor people , ( or what Jerry Springer seems to believe poor people are ) , screwing each other , hitting each other , insulting each other , and then repeating the process with the same attention to duty the rest of us use when shampooing . The plot , which covers how a group of stupid people mangle their lives badly enough to provide grist for the Jerry Springer mill , advances solely because of the idiocy of the characters . This makes it impossible to care what happens to them . It never mattered to me whether they got on the show , or what they said , or who slept with whom . Maybe I 'm not supposed to care about them . Maybe I 'm supposed to look at them as some kind of comic type-- to see their outrageous behavior as inherently funny . Too bad it is n't . The humor is not outrageous . It 's innocuous . It 's predictable . Humor has to have something behind it , some kind of painful irony or life experience , in order to function . Scatology is not wit . An example . A mother catches her daughter and her husband in bed . To take revenge she marches across the trailer park and gives oral sex to her daughter 's boyfriend . Since I was over the shock of Jerry Springer 's show a long time ago , I had the same reaction I had to Andrew Dice Clay 's obscene nursery rhymes ; not laughter , just yawning . Lastly , I found Springer 's pose as a populist tiresome and unconvincing . If he really were an advocate of the poor , he would bring on a single mom from Bed - Sty to talk about trying to raise her kids in New York City on $ 12,000 a year . Or , failing that , he would at least give the participants of his shows a cut of his profits . Jerry Springer gets millions for his shows , his movie , his book and videos . His guests just get round trip air fare , hotel accommodations , and a chance to humiliate themselves . If he liked poor people so much , he 'd give them at least some of the money they earn for him . It appears that Springer wanted to make this movie to grab some legitimacy for himself . Jeez , with all his fine work , you 'd think he 'd have earned our respect already . Anyway , the film is weak and boring . It does n't even succeed at being offensive . If you want to have a better evening , videotape a bug zapper for a night and then watch that .
0 THE RINGMASTER stars Jerry Springer as a TV talkshow host called Jerry , but it`s not THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW , his guests are trailer trash , but not the trailer trash you get on THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW , they attack one another , but not like on ..... What is the point of making a movie about THE JERRY SPRINGER show and pretending it`s not THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW ? And on top of that this is a very boring film
0 Oh Dear , Jerry may be the undisputed king of talkshow but the movies are a whole different ball game , and he 's way out of his league . The script for this film is so poor it has to be seen to be believed and its sad to see such vaguely familiar actors as Michael Dudikoff ( 80 's action B'movie king ) , Michael Jai White ( Last seen in the Sci Fi flop Spawn ' ) as well as Surviving the Games ' William MacNamara ( who is involved in the only half funny situation in the whole film ! ) stoop this low for employment . If you are a fan of Jerry then stick to his TV show as this is a total waste of and hour and a half . After I had finished sitting through this I managed to catch the last half an hour of Rocky 5 on TV , which looked like a cinematic masterpiece in comparison , I think that says more than enough!!!<br /><br / >
0 For the life of me , I can not get why they would want to make a movie about the " Jerry Springer Show " . It 's so incrediably trashy . Some ways , sadly it 's a guilty pleasure . We all have to admit that we 've seen at least one episode . It 's part of our pop culture . I saw this on USA recently . It 's pretty bad . I will admit that . Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he meant as acting . Or something like it . Jamie Pressley is in it . She 's playing herself basically . All she needed was her lover boy , Kid Rock . It would 've been perfect then . So , I would recommend skipping " Ringmaster " . Just watch the " Jerry Springer Show " . It 's more enjoyable than this.<br /><br />2/10
0 You do n't need to write a script for this trashed outrage ! You just sit back and watch a pair of moonshine women and guests duke each other out before a riotous audience exposure at " The Jerry Show " ! Violent and obnoxious , this cash - in on the real Jerry Springer program reveals everything that the over - rated hyped talk show does n't show to you on the air - - unless you have a collection of uncensored videos made by the producers of " Cops " . Even the outside world of Springerland reveals the most amateurish acting of the decade ! This goes to show you that THE GONG SHOW MOVIE had a central character in a motion picture turkey . Change the channel ! REJECTED < br /><br / >
0 I think that , deep down in the darkest , slimiest part of their heart , everyone likes Jerry Springer just a little bit . While his show is undeniably offensive and stupid , it also gives us a chance to see that , relatively speaking , most of us have it real good . When you look at the trailer park livin ' , dollar whiskey drinkin ' , incest lovin' people on the Springer show , it makes even your worst day seem like a walk in the park . Jerry is performing a public service , and we should be grateful . He ditched a political career to host the show , just for us.<br /><br />What we should not be grateful for in any way is the piece of garbage movie " Ringmaster " . " Ringmaster " shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show , or so they would like us to think . The movie follows the pre - requisite Springer story line : Love triangles . One triangle involves Connie , her daughter Angel , and her husband Rusty . The other involves Starletta , Vonda , and Demond . When the two hapless groups meet up in LA , their lives intertwine and collide head - on , all culminating in an explosive episode of the Springer show . It 's like what " Short Cuts " would be if Robert Altman had had a severe crack habit.<br /><br />"Ringmaster " is true to the show , as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish . It also makes me very glad that I do n't live in the squalor it 's characters do . But the movie has a problem . It 's billed as a comedy , but it just is n't very funny . What laughs there are to be had are few and far between . Maybe some people watch this and laugh non - stop . If you think blow jobs and rape are funny , well then I guess you 're one of those folks . Personally , I laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the movie in utter awe of the agonizing horrors of white - trash life.<br /><br />The Jerry Springer Show just is n't meant to make the leap from TV to the silver screen . What 's funny in an hour long show ( less , when you count commercials ) is n't necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie . Movies have to tell a story , and that 's something else " Ringmaster " has trouble with . The story is threadbare . There are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a cohesive narrative is quickly put asunder . And even if there were n't such problems , how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story ? Even the Hollywood formula could n't make this better . " Ringmaster : is so bad , it even screws up the best part of the Springer show : the Final Thought . Somehow , even the smartest and simplest aspect of the show wound up blowing harder than the slutty women the film is built around.<br /><br />The worst offender in all of this is Springer himself . He 's such a bad actor that he ca n't even play himself convincingly . Watching Springer play Springer is sad . It 's like he was going for a ' What if Woody Allen played Jerry Springer ' vibe , and he failed . Miserably . He went to the trouble of producing this disaster , the least he could do is try to make it just that much better.<br /><br />Not that I 'm saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance . Just the opposite . They all suck . Not so surprisingly , no one in this movie went on to greatness . The best any of them was did was Molly Hagan landing a job on a Nickelodeon sitcom . Apparently , Nickelodeon has no problem with hiring a woman who starred in the most vile film of the ' 90 's to star in a children 's program . It makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pasts.<br /><br />Here are my Final Thoughts : What we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn , who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience . Should we accept people who make movies that treat us like severely brain - damaged lumps of goo ? I say no . Somewhere out there , in this crazy , mixed up world , there is a perfect movie for each of us . We just have to keep looking for it . Until next time , take care of yourselves and your loved ones . And do n't ever watch " Ringmaster " .
0 I will admit that I have seen maybe five minutes of " Jerry Springer " . I do n't consider myself a snob , but I really think that I am above watching what 's on his show . You should try to elevate yourself above that too.<br /><br />I saw this movie as part of a social studies event I was conducting . I was told that this movie really had little to do with Springer himself , rather it centered on the lives of those who would appear on " Springer . " Handled better , this movie might have actually been a fascinating look at how pathetic these people 's lives actually are . I will admit , I felt a twinge of empathy for Connie ( Molly Hagan ) . This is all she has in life . How sad that she feels she must go on Jerry 's show in order to resolve this.<br /><br />I really feel sorry for Molly Hagan appearing in this . Have you noticed that after this movie , she has mainly been relegated to " B " roles on TV ? I will say this about Hagan . She is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman . I have no doubt that she is very earnest in her acting and she tries to play her roles with a lot of empathy . The problem is that Hagan ca n't carry a scene on her own . She just does n't have what it takes to do a lead role . Her best work will always be Angel on " Herman 's Head " ( a show that was not great , but its heart was in the right place ) and when she guested on " Seinfeld " as Sister Roberta .
0 Was this movie stupid ? Yup . Did this movie depth ? Nope . Character development ? Nope . Plot twists ? Nope . This was simply a movie about a highly - fictionalized Springer show . It shows the lengths that some people will go to get their mugs on TV . Molly Hagan did a great job as Jaime Pressly 's mom . Jaime is .... well ... GORGEOUS ! This flick was n't so much made to be a " breakthrough " movie , rather , it was intended to life in a trailer park ( I live in a trailer park and ours is nothing like the one in this movie ) where everyone sleeps with everyone else , all the girls get pregnant by different guys , and all the guys drive rusted - out ' 66 Ford pickups ( exaggeration , of course , but that 's the picture everyone sees when you mention " trailer park " ) . Some people over - analyze movies ( case - in - point : Star Trek freaks ) . I watch movies purely for the entertainment value ; not to point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene ( read the " Goofs " bit about Connie 's shirt . Could it have been better ? Sure . But it was funny as hell .
0 OK , people , honestly ... this got ta be one of the worst movies about show biz that 's ever been made , but I 've been laughing myself silly ( which may be why I enjoyed it ) . Basically , it 's all about sex , sex and a way to get your own personal 15 minutes of fame . Did I mention that sex was a major issue in this movie ? If you have a thing going for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment , watch this movie when you get the chance ( and do n't have something better to do ) . < br /><br />***Attention spoilers ! ! ! * * * The funniest thing on the movie was the guy who asked Jerry whether he could marry his goat ( ! ) on the show and flashing his wallet with his love 's pictures . A triple A for bad taste and fun !
0 To grasp where this 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN is coming from consider this : Its final number is sung by Barbra Streisand in a seven minute and forty second close - up , followed by another two - and - half - minute freeze frame of Ms. Streisand -- striking a Christ - like pose -- behind the closing credits . Over ten uninterrupted minutes of Barbra 's distinctive visage dead center , filling the big screen with uncompromising ego . That just might be some sort of cinematic record.<br /><br />Or think about this : The plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars , yet , while Streisand 's songs are performed in their entirety -- including the interminable finale -- her costar Kris Kristofferson is n't allowed to complete even one single song he performs . Nor , though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties , do they actually sing a duet.<br /><br />Or consider this : Streisand 's name appears in the credits at least six times , including taking credit for " musical concepts " and her wardrobe ( from her closet ) -- and she also allegedly wanted , but failed to get co - directing credit as well . One of her credits was as executive producer , with a producer credit going to her then - boyfriend and former hairdresser , Jon Peters . As such , Streisand controlled the final cut of the film , which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction . What it does n't explain is how come , given every opportunity to make The Great Diva look good , their efforts only make Streisand look bad . Even though this was one of Streisand 's greatest box office hits , it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance.<br /><br />Anyway , moving the melodrama from Hollywood to the world of sex - drugs - and - rock'n'roll , Streisand plays Esther Hoffman , a pop singer on the road to stardom , who shares the fast lane for a while with Kristofferson 's John Norman Howard , a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to Has - beenville . In the previous incarnations of the story , " Norman Maine " sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer " Vicky Lester " achieve her success . In the feminist seventies , Streisand & Co. want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man , so the trajectory is skewed ; she 'll succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one ; he 's a burden she must endure in the name of love . As such , there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher , but almost ruthless , while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit.<br /><br />Kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material ; making little attempt to give much of a performance , and oddly it serves his aimless , listless character well . Streisand , on the other hand , exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen . Everything she does seems , if not too rehearsed , at least too controlled . Even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical . The two have no chemistry , making the central love affair totally unbelievable . You might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence , though at age 34 , Streisand does n't seem particularly young or naive . The only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom . And , indeed , had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way , to make Streisand 's character openly play an exploitive villain , the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist.<br /><br />But I guess the filmmakers actually see Esther as a sympathetic victim ; they do n't seem to be aware just how cold - blooded and self absorbed she is . But sensitivity is not one of the film 's strong points : note the petty joke of giving Barbra two African American back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio The Oreos . And the film makes a big deal of pointing out that Esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of Hoffman , yet the filmmakers have changed the character 's name of the previous films from " Esther Blodgett " so that Streisand wo n't be burdened with a name that is too Jewish or too unattractive . So much for ethnic pride.<br /><br />The backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film 's release is near legendary , so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable . Nominal director Frank Pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie , with considerable help from ace cinematographer Robert Surtees . And the film did serve its purpose , producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes ( including the Oscar - winning " Evergreen " by Paul Williams and Streisand ) . But overall the film turned out to be the one thing Streisand reportedly claimed she did n't want it to be , a vanity project .
0 So I had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater . As I watched it for the first time I was expecting another romantic , tear - jerking Barbra Streisand film ; Something like The Way We Were . I was certainly wrong . The chemistry between the two main characters , Esther Hoffman and her John Howard , was nonexistent , making it impossible to get attached to the characters . There was n't anything romantic about it . Streisand 's character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who could n't sing a single note without making me want to hit the fast - forward button . At one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later . There 's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who ca n't seem to realize it until he actually dies . Parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on , and I kept asking myself when it was going to end.<br /><br />The death of John Howard was completely predictable . There was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie , and when he died I felt no emotion whatsoever . It was n't a tragic accident , it was him basically being an idiot . Not to mention throughout the movie I was distracted by his hideous beard.<br /><br />The only parts of this movie worth seeing are the Streisand songs . The ending of the movie when she sings " With One More Look At You / Watch Closely Now " was my reason for giving this film a whopping 3/10 . Those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie I actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger .
0 Really an amazing pile of pap ! < br /><br />A predictable , slow moving , soul destroying , mind numbing movie to which , slitting your own wrists with a rusty bread knife seems ... well , almost necessary.<br /><br />The acting is over done for the thin dialogue , every scene is at least twice as long as it needs to be , the intricate details of how this career is collapsing or that career is rising is just far too dreary and mundane for words . The music would be good if you did n't have to sit through the movie , but really , three good songs is not enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie.<br /><br />Watching this film I prayed to God for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me.<br /><br />Never , ever , ever again .
0 Rock star John Norman Howard ( Kris Kristofferson ) turns lounge singer Esther Hoffman ( Barbra Streisand ) into an overnight singing star . Esther 's star rises while John 's goes into decline , thanks to drugs and alcohol . After about two hours , John does the self - destructive - red - converible-160-MPH - crack - up - on - a - desert - highway thing . The best thing about this movie is the music , especially the song , " Evergreen . " Barbra Streisand sings well , but you ca n't take her seriously as an up - and - coming star , when she is * already * a star . The very first time she appears , singing in a back alley bar , she looks like an established singing star who is slumming for the night , not like a struggling unknown who is trying to launch her singing career . She is too confident , too professional . Her apartment looks like a page out of " Apartment Living , " not some hole - in - the - wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live.<br /><br />Kris Kristofferson handles the self - centered , out - of - control rock star role like ... well , like a singer who is trying to be an actor but does n't have much acting talent . The direction is tepid , the story is slow and dull.<br /><br />But the worst thing about this movie is not the acting , or the lame direction , or the slow story . It 's the hair ! After staring at Kristofferson 's and Streisand 's awful 70 's hairdos for 2 + hours , your eyes hurt .
0 This is a horrid disaster of a film . From beginning to end , it 's filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing . The only redeeming parts of the film are a few numbers by Streisand , because the Kristofferson parts are impossible to watch or listen to . The main problem of this film is that we never see Kristofferson 's character at his peak or Streisand 's character struggling . The first should be seen in decline and the second rising . The final Streisand number _ could have been _ one of the greatest finales in film , if it was directed and edited properly . The single framed shot of her face for the duration of the song was a terrible mistake . Had the band , audience and wide shots of the stage been shown , this number could have been dynamic and interesting . This film must have been directed and edited by an NYU film school dropout . The only thing worse may be the wretched screenplay . The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this film , and even that is botched completely by misguided technical decisions .
0 This film is a huge steaming pile . < br /><br />I have no idea why anyone felt that the Garland / Mason version needed to be redone , nor why Striesand would have been a first choice to star.<br /><br />For that matter , I have no idea why our people ( Gay Americans ) tend largely to regard Striesand as some kind of treasure . At least in my opinion , she had peaked professionally with with Funny Girl , and Bogdanovich 's What 's Up Doc . < br /><br />Do yourself a favor and rent the Judy classic , or even the original ( a fine film in its own right ) , but please , Please , PLEASE skip this stinkpot !
0 Kris Kristofferson , at his drugged - out peak in the mid-70s , finds himself barely able to squeeze on to the screen alongside La Streisand 's humongous ego and discount - store feminism.<br /><br />None of the characters are really likable ; I was _ so _ glad when Kristofferson 's Ferrari went over that hill and crashed.<br /><br />If you want to see a good movie about rock and roll stardom , try _ The Buddy Holly Story _ ( made only about a year and a half after this dreck ) .
0 I never saw the original 1954 version with Judy Garland , so have no means of comparison . Also , it 's been some years , but I found this tale neither gripping nor its romance captivating . The movie tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are headed in opposite directions . John Norman Howard is a worn out , disillusioned rock star on the decline , embarking upon a romance with a fresh , talented new singing sensation , Esther Hoffman . Her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline.<br /><br />The lead actors , Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand , are adequate in their roles , but neither their chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me . The film is noteworthy to me for only one aspect , Streisand 's beautiful rendition of the Oscar winning song ' Evergreen ' . She truly has a powerful and magnificent voice .
0 This movie is NOT the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason , and that is a shame because the 1954 version is , in my opinion , much better . I am not denying Barbra Streisand 's talent at all . She is a good actress and brilliant singer . I am not acquainted with Kris Kristofferson 's other work and therefore I ca n't pass judgment on it . However , this movie leaves much to be desired . It is paced slowly , it has gratuitous nudity and foul language , and can be very difficult to sit through.<br /><br />However , I am not a big fan of rock music , so it 's only natural that I would like the Judy Garland version better . See the 1976 film with Barbra and Kris , and judge for yourself .
0 There are two points I need to make clear right at the beginning . First of all we all know what this year 's Oscar 's were REALLY all about this year . It was the Academy 's way of showing people that they are no racist , and never have been . They wanted to clear all preconceived notions about themselves . Secondly , it 's kinda pointless to make remarks about the show , because really , what difference will it make ? But , it 's fun to write about it . This is the year I became fed - up with the Oscar 's ! I will never watch the show again . Every year they do something wrong . Before Crowe wins for " Gladaitor " when they real winner should of been Ralph Fiennes for " Sunshine " . If you have n't seen this movie yet , watch it and you 'll agree . " Eyes Wide Shut " when released receieved no nominations . And as far as this year goes , well , the bad choices were all over the place ! Baz Lurhmann gets no " Best Director " nomination ! Are you joking ! ! " A Beautiful Mind " is up for " Best Make - up " ? ? ? ? " Training Day " gets nominated ? ? The movie was awful , and it seemed like Washington did n't even turn in a performance , all he proved was , he knows how to use four letter words ! That 's what h won the award for ! Take away the language and I bet he was almost playing himself ! I liked " Gosford Park " , I really did , but why 7 nominations ? And how on Earth could they not give it too Altman ! I mean , c'mon , if there just giving the award to people to clear up any bad feelings , what about Altman ? The man has been in the public 's eye for 32 years now and no Oscar ! There were many , many things that bothered me about this year 's Oscar 's , but , I 'll live with it , as long as I never have to watch another show again ! The highpoint ( and the ONLY one ) of the show was when Woody Allen made his first appearance ever to the award show . That will go down as one of the greatest moments in he history of the show .
0 It does n't even merit a review , other than as a warning to potential viewers . It 's a somewhat generic ghost story about an actress haunting a studio during the filming of a WWII period drama . There 's no fear involved , no suspense whatsoever , nor any surprises . One shocking moment that looks a bit too silly to be shocking . The visual style is very flat and dull , although there is some really nice editing once in a while . The story never comes together , and the films is really just a total bust . 4/10 .
0 I caught this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival . I had n't heard much about it ; only that it was a tightly - paced thriller , shot digitally on a very low budget . I was hoping to catch the next big Brit - Flick . But I have to say , I was severely disappointed . " This Is Not A Love Song " follows two criminals , who , after accidentally shooting and killing a farmer 's young daughter , become embroiled in a deadly game of cat and mouse when the locals decide to take matters into their own hands and hunt them down.<br /><br />The real problem is that this is yet another example of style over substance in a British film . The camera angles and editing are completely at odds with the story , as are the over the top performances , and the appalling use of slow motion , which only serves to make the whole thing look like an expensive home video . There are repeated attempts to make the film look edgy and gritty , which instead come over as hilarious and over the top(Cue a pathetic , obligatory drug scene , and countless , pointless camera zooms ) . No amount of cliche 's such as this can disguise the fact that this is a pretty bad story.<br /><br />We've seen this kind of thing many times before , and made a hundred times better , particularly in John Boorman 's masterful " Deliverance . " But while in the latter film , we actually cared about the characters , in this film , I found myself just wanting them to be hunted down and killed as quickly as possible . Even this would n't have been so bad if their adversaries had been frightening or worthwhile , but instead , are merely a collection of stereotypical , inbred - looking countryfolk . Again , another offensive , overused cliche ' coming to the fore . Surely there are some nice people in the country , filmmakers?<br /><br />In its defense , " This Is Not A Love Song " does contain a couple of good , suspenseful moments , but it 's hard to see this film doing anything other than going straight to video , or , at a push , getting a very limited cinema release . It 's not a patch on last year 's Low - Budget hunted in the hills movie , " Dog soldiers " . Maybe British Cinema could actually get kick - started again if the right money stopped going to the wrong people .
0 I remember rather enjoying this a few years back but coming to it again , I wonder why . I guess it always looks good and the girls do rather well but the men do rather let the side down . Why oh why in so many English films about sex do we have to have such inept men along side the pretty girls ? What is more this begins predictably enough as a sex farce similar in vein to the Confessions films but about a third of the way through ( whilst we are beginning to enjoy the presence of the lovely Me Me Lai ) the film asks us to start taking it seriously . Not only that but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stilted . In short this is neither as innocently silly or as intelligently serious as it seems to intend . Richard O'Sullivan maybe , as such a central figure , could have helped but I reckon this to be one of his worst performances . Just worth it for the ladies .
0 The " saucy " misadventures of four au pairs who arrive in London on the same day in the early 1970s . There 's a Swedish girl , a Danish , a German and a Chinese . The story contrives to get the clothes off all of them , involve them in some Carry On - type humour and couple them with various misfits from the British film and TV culture of the time , including Man About the House star Richard O'Sullivan , future Coronation Street rogue Johnny Briggs and horror film stalwart Ferdy Mayne ( playing a sheik ) . There 's a pretty risqué amount of female nudity on display , for those who like that kind of thing ( but obviously nothing hardcore).<br /><br />Most of the film is pretty thin and inconsequential ; the girls are stereotypes , and German Anita especially suffers from some kind of infantalising disorder - she 's a moron obsessed with colour TV who acts like a kind of uninhibited child & dresses to deliberately show her private parts ; in another more serious film , she would be a psychiatric case . The most interesting section of the film involves the Swedish girl being taken to a club in London where some dodgy types are still trying to swing , being seduced by a middle - aged rocker , losing her virginity and realising that the scene is not for her . These sequences have some energy in them and point to a more intriguing film than we 've ended up with , in which promiscuity and the dregs of the music business and upper classes live soulless and seedy lives ( there 's a fine turn by John Standing as an impotent public school roué ) . The strangest of the stories has the Chinese girl ( future cannibal film veteran Me Me Lay ) getting off with her childish piano prodigy employer , falling mutually in love with and then leaving in the middle of the night for no good reason at all , except some orientalist notion that " Chinese birds are inscrutable , ai n't they ? ! " The film is pretty demeaning to its women characters and there 's a smattering of homophobia in the dialogue and one of the characterisations . The end is striking , as Mayne 's sheik for no earthly reason ( except they have to end the film somehow ) whisks all of the girls away to his Arab kingdom for what looks to all the world like a future in the white slave trade , which they are all delighted about.<br /><br />Stuff and nonsense for the most part then , but directed with a fair amount of skill by veteran Val Guest , which puts it as a piece of film - making a notch above most of the 70s Brit sexploitation flicks .
0 The plot has already been described by other reviewers , so I will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her undoubted glory.<br /><br />Miss Drake has to be one of the sexiest , prettiest examples of " posh totty " to have been committed to celluloid . Of her era and ilk , only the equally exquisite Jane Asher comes close . What was it about actresses with musical brothers ? ( Nick Drake and Peter Asher ) For those who like me have admired Gabrielle , her scenes in this movie will not disappoint . She has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here.<br /><br />As a whole , the movie is very poor and being of its time , very cheaply made . The song that covers the opening credits seems to go on forever and is appalling .
0 The video quality is awful . The sound quality is pathetic . The acting is horrific . The dialog is painful . The lighting is dismal . The editing is laughable . I could go on , but it would be pointless . Snitch'd is a third rate amateur video being passed off as a feature film . This one is best left to collect dust in the video store bargain bin .
0 I got this DVD from a friend , who got it from someone else ( and that probably keeps going on .. ) Even the cover of the DVD looks cheap , as is the entire movie . Gunshots and fist fights with delayed sound effects , some of the worst actors I´ve seen in my life , a very simple plot , it made me laugh ´ till my stomach hurt ! With very few financial resources , I must admit it looked pretty professional . Seen as a movie , it was one of the 13 in a dozen wannabe gangsta flicks nobody´s waiting for . So : if you´re tired and want a cheap laugh , see this movie . If not , throw it out of the window .
0 I do n't really know where to start . The acting in this movie was really terrible , I ca n't remember seeing so many ' actors ' in one film that were n't able to act . Not only the acting was bad , the characters were incredibly stupid as well.<br /><br />Then there 's the action . I believe that even children know that when someone gets shot , there 's blood involved . But when someone gets shot in Snitch'd for ten ( ! ! ) times , there 's no blood at all . Well , I guess that 's just me.<br /><br />To make a long story short ( because believe me , I can go on for hours about this film ) , this is without a doubt the worst film I ever saw . This film should be number 1 in the bottom 100 without a doubt .
0 I bought this movie and after I watched it I decided that I did not care for it . The acting was BAD . Was the principal a robot ? He had no personality and his facial expression did n't change through the whole movie . At times the voices did n't match up . People talking and their lips did n't even move .
0 I bought this DVD for £ 1 and now i realise why . The acting was the worst I 've seen in a long time . The lighting and sound are shoddy at best . The plot makes little sense even when sober ( WARNING : I do n't advise watching this film when sober . ) This film feels like you 're watching the home movie of someone who does n't get out much . It really is a shame that all the very little money spent on this project went to such a waste , I look forward to seeing if any of those envoled still have a career , other than eva longoria who is the only " star " of this film that was apparently not hit with the bad acting stick . I 'm sorry that none of this criticism seems constructive but I will say one thing to James Cahill , do n't try it again . In the words of squirlyem " Its severely lacking in the good department " .
0 WORST MOVIE EVER ! ! ! ! Ca n't believe I wasted 90min of my life watching this crap . The only reason I did n't turn it off was I wanted to see the Gangster dude on the cover and he was n't even in it talk about False advertising . The people that gave this movie a ten are either Dumb , Stupid or CAST MEMBERS or friends of CAST MEMBERS.<br /><br />I gave it a solid 2 because no one else did < br /><br />I have to write more and I do n't even want to . wasting my time talking about this rubbish . Please do n't watch it and if you did then vote so this movie can go where it belongs . bottom 100 movies . i ca n't even tell you how bad it really is . think the worst movie ever that you 've seen then times that be ten and that s this movie . It sucked ! ! If you just think I 'm being bitter then watch it I dare You ! ! This movie should be used to torture war criminals or Terriosts . If they Watch this even two times and they 'll be spilling the beans and begging for MERCY ! !
0 I watched this .... let me rephrase ... suffered through this because I 'm a fan of Eva 's . I do n't think this is a flick she 'll put on the back of her head shot photos . I like gangsta flix but this was n't even close . The budget could n't have been more than a few hundred dollars , and that money was probably spent on the caterer.<br /><br />The premise was interesting , but the first victim died before you get the chance to care about her or not.<br /><br />I wo n't bother saying who did what and how , because it is n't worth the effort . I 'm only glad that because of my monthly rental plan at the local video store that I did n't have to actually pay for this garbage.<br /><br />OH ! ! Before you flame on me , I love movies , I thought a lotta flix were good that some of you have jammed , so for me to jam this tells you all you need to know .
0 All I can say after watching Snitch'd is please stop Mr. Cahill . It is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about . If you insist on making movies about gangsters I urge you to do research . It 's comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak.<br /><br />I laughed at the part when Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion . This movie was tough as an after school special . Who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from ? . I suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang . That would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related . < br /><br />Snitch'd is the WORST gangbanger movie ever made .
0 If you want to see a retarded homosexual Karate expert beat up a bunch of try hard wannabe Mexican gangsters repeatedly for an hr , then this is the film for you . if not then choose another DVD from the 20c bin which is the only place this film belongs . the acting was so horrible that i had to force myself to watch it to the end . The cover makes it look so cool but its just another cheap , b grade gangster film along the lines of 2 g 's and a key , bloody streetz and menace . I would not buy or rent this film unless you are planing to get stoned and plot , editing and acting really do n't matter to you . it is truly the worst film in the history of humanity ! ! !
0 Maybe this is n't fair , because I only made it about halfway through the movie . One of the few movies I have actually not been able to watch due to lameness.<br /><br />The acting is terrible , the camera work is terrible , the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy . For example - during a coke deal , the coke is just kept loose in a briefcase - I 'm no expert , but I think people generally put it in a bag.<br /><br />They use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown ( it 's that over the top ' crunching ' sound " and they use toy guns with dubbed in sound effects.<br /><br />Worst movie ever .
0 This movie is weak , The box - cover says East LA 's toughest gang and it is really Santa Ana 's , James Cahill acts like a closet queen taking down all the tough guys in the tough Chlo gang . It is fake , boring , senseless and whack , I tried to get my money back from the video store this movie was so bad . It was also on the homo - erotic tip far from what the video - box proclaims . James Cahill should act in Gay Porno .James is in every scene , he can not act to save his life . The film features Eva Longoria who is hot but James ca n't even score with her ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I felt at times I was watching Gay Porn and was turned - off by the whole film . James clearly want 's to be with men but rather then submit to his gay desires he beats up gang members over and over and over again . His martial Arts skills are minimal at best , Some real gang members would take him and his weak skills and rip him a new one .
0 Every once in a while , someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and asks " What 's with SNITCH'D " ? I know immediately they have a case of barely - hidden amusement + horror . You see , I was the cinematographer on the film.<br /><br />Let me clarify some points regarding this " interesting life experience".<br /><br />Originally , SNITCH'D was called ONE HARD HIT . I met James Cahill in July of 1999 , a day after I wrapped TRIANGLE SQUARE , a great little 35 mm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades ... it fell eternal victim to the fine print of SAG 's notorious Experimental Feature contract . But I digress ... <br /><br />I though I was on a roll , and when James asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in 16 mm with a shooting budget of about $ 25,000 , not wanting to break pace , I took it . After all , CLERKS , EL MARIACHI ... I too believed the myth back then.<br /><br />Let 's just chalk it up as " film school " for many involved , myself included . SNITCH'D was shot over two weeks in August , 1999 , in Aliso Viejo and Santa Ana , CA . Cahill taught Drama at a High School in the latter city ( yes , he is a Drama and English teacher ... consider THAT while watching the film , or even observing the use of apostrophe in title ) , hence the locations and cast.<br /><br />Of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of L.A. 's Channel 2 Morning News weather girl Vera Jimenez , and of greater impact , the debut of Eva Longoria , who had just arrived in Hollywood and was as eager as I to get a film under her belt . I must say her professional dedication , focus and " let 's do this " attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom - yet - to - come . < br /><br />SNITCH'D suffered from poor optics , few lights or electricity , several boom operators du jour , and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication . None of that overshadows the actual content , which speaks for itself.<br /><br />Anyway , by 2003 , the film was sold to distributors ( at a net loss , I understand ) who inexplicably had no photos of Eva on the box ( by then she was a rising , working name ) but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic Latino gangster to lend credibility to SNITCH'D. Since Cahill 's other passion is antiquarian book dealing , it appears to confirm he believes you can , in fact , judge a book by it 's cover ... as so many have picked up this DVD based on it 's sleeve . ----------------- One year later , Eva , now on a soap , and I met James for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted , SPLIT SECOND , which I think has never seen any play despite festival intent . < br /><br />6 years later , I was hired to shoot another Cahill film titled JUAREZ , Mexico . I though he had worked out the process ; my participation was contingent on casting , script and crew control , and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies , for what it was ... a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in Juarez ; despite claims here and elsewhere , the film has NEVER appeared in any festival or venue , although Cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the DVD release of two studio pictures on the same subject , VIRGIN OF JUAREZ and BORDER TOWN .
0 DD films were damn corny , damn stupid and had a plot which seemed wafer thin but those days they was a plot at least < br /><br />This film is n't just a comedy but a mix of melodrama , romance everything < br /><br />Every drama scene is blown out of proportion < br /><br />The comedy is funny but corny too Yet the film keeps you entertained , those days Govinda films were loud , crass yet they had some funny moments people enjoyed < br /><br />David Dhawan does a okay job Music is okay < br /><br />Govinda acts well in comedy and drama Karisma is decent in parts and annoys in parts Kader is as usual Gulshan , Prem Chopra are typecast Shakti is hilarious
0 Honestly I ca n't understand why this movie rates so well here , nor why Bakshi himself thought it was his finest film . I 'm a huge fan of Bakshi 's earlier work - particularly ' Heavy Traffic ' and ' Wizards ' , but frankly ' Wizards ' ( 1977 ) was the last good film he made . After that he turned to the mainstream , beginning with the diabolical ' Lord of the Rings ' and then knuckling down with sword and sorcery heavyweight Frank Frazetta , for ' Fire and Ice'.<br /><br />What can I say ? The story is puerile , the animation is TV quality - I insist that it 's considerably worse than his 70 's stuff - and whereas ' Wizards ' had real imagination , quirkiness , some gorgeous background art , and an underground , adult sensibility , ' Fire and Ice ' is just designed for 14 year old boys , and has the intellectual clout of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.<br /><br />Yes , if you liked the Gor books , you might like this . In my view though , this was just another blip in the slide in quality after ' Wizards ' from which Bakshi never recovered ( though he 's done some decent TV stuff fairly recently)<br /><br />4.5 out of 10
0 I first saw this when I was around 7 . I remembered what I believed to be a vague outline of what took place . Turns out now , 15 years later , that I remembered everything with great accuracy because it seems the writers never got beyond making an outline to the story . There is no plot to this movie / cartoon . There is no character development , no back story , no character arcs , nothing . The good guys do things because they are good , while the bad guys do things solely because they are bad . One unintentionally hilarious part is when someone who you would think to be important dies and nobody cares in the least . They just shrug their shoulders and move on . There 's barely any dialogue either . If you cut out the fight scenes and the running scenes , you lose 70 % of the movie.<br /><br />Watch this because you want to see some good animation and for no other reason . Or if you like to look at scantily clad hot cartoon chicks ( or scantily clad hot cartoon dudes ) .
0 Trite , clichéd dialog and plotting ( the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies ) , hokey music , and a paint - by - numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans.<br /><br />What saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of Bakshi 's work , the rotoscoping , and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him . This is Frazetta ... in motion . The violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword & sorcery movie of the period.<br /><br />I like to watch this with the sound off , playing the soundtrack to the first Conan movie instead .
0 Carlo Verdone once managed to combine superb comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism.<br /><br />Then something happened , and he turned into just another dull " holier - than - thou " director.<br /><br />Il Mio Miglior Nemico can more or less be summarized in one line " working class = kind and warm , while upper - class = snob and devious . But love wins in the end".<br /><br />Such a trite clichè for such a smart director.<br /><br />There is n't really too much to talk about in the movie . Every character is a walking stereotype : the self - made - man who forgets his roots but who 'll become " good " again , the scorned wife , the rebellious rich girl who falls for the honest - but - poor guy ... Acting is barely average.<br /><br />Severely disappointing under every aspect .
0 I 'm sorry , but this may have been scary in 1978 when it came out , but in modern times it just does n't hold up . The only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where Michael kills his sister , Judith , wearing his Halloween mask . The most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter . The film goes downhill from there and does n't pick up until the last fifteen minutes , but by then it 's too late , we the audience have lost all interest in the story . There is barely any character development , and people always rave about Laurie being such an exceptional heroine , when there really is n't much to her . I 'm sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie , but if you want a great horror movie go watch The Shining or Rosemary 's Baby . Those are the two best horror films ever made . Halloween is certainly not in their ranks . I ca n't believe Roger Ebert gave it four stars , for there is no way this film could ever deserve such a high rating .
0 What the hell is in your minds ? This film sucks ! Each minute I was getting more and more bored . I strove to watch the end because I hope something at least would at last happen ! But instead of that , I got amazed how dull the end was treated ... What is this story about this bloody " bogeyman " ? How comes he does n't die ? He is a bloody human being for God 's sake ! A mere boy that killed his silly sister 15 years ago . Then what ? His stay on a psychiatric hospital made him immortal ? This film a fascinatingly stupid ... It 's a must of silliness . I 'm gon na resell it right now to some silly guy who will understand this silly film .
0 Perhaps one of the most overrated so - called horror classics ever made , Halloween does feature the memorable Michael Myers and some great acting by Jamie Lee Curtis.<br /><br />However , its rewatchability factor is very close to zero , as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on dullness / culmination to the actual events.<br /><br />This is the sort of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at all.<br /><br />How it spawned so many sequels , I will never comprehend.<br /><br />Thank God Rob Zombie is remaking this . And generally , I hate remakes.<br /><br />Surely he will more than compensate for all the random time - filling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacks.<br /><br />This is a movie we feel we have to like , much like the way we 're taught that we SHOULD enjoy Dickens.<br /><br />Don't assume this is a classic .
0 I do admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view , nearly 30 years after the making of this movie and at the time of its conception , it may have been a brilliant horror / thriller movie.<br /><br />Beginning on Halloween night 1968 , 6 year old Michael commits the brutal murder of his 18 year old sister . Michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his home town to murder again.<br /><br />From this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable . The beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way it will end whilst the music for each scene containing Michael ( the murderer ) is exactly the same throughout the movie , thus alerting the viewer to the likely events to follow.<br /><br />For the horror / thriller enthusiast , there is a severe lack of blood / gore compared to modern day films although I am not akin to the amount that is displayed in this day and age . A happier medium could have been found.<br /><br />From a half hour into the movie , not one scene is unexpected . The acting for a horror / thriller film is fairly typical of the era and thus lacks any punch for the modern day enthusiast.<br /><br />A positive for the film is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting which creates a frightening atmosphere . A second positive would be the character of Michael 's doctor , who provides clues to the probability of where the story may lead.<br /><br />However , it is clear that the star , in Jamie - Lee Curtis , is in the infancy stages of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victim.<br /><br />It is hard for me to rate this film as it was in its day , but from other horror / thriller films of indeed the 80s and to a lesser extent , the 90s , it falls far short of a truly great horror / thriller film.<br /><br />I suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s . Cheers !
0 As the faux - Russian scientist says two - thirds of the way into the movie , " I came for the science . " This pretty much sums up the reason I watched this movie - anything that involves a half - man , half - hammerhead shark definitely deserves a serious empirical investigation on the part of an impartial aspiring scientist . Or , as they say in the biz , my girlfriend 's brother had the remote and the rest is history . To say that the special effects were bad would be a disservice to the field of special effects . This is 2005 , it is not that hard to film a car scene without a cheesy bluescreen background . Yeah , this was charming and state of the art when Hitchcock was filming " The Birds " but in 2005 it just looks low budget . Spare me the cheap attempt at Sci - Fi and do me the service of actually making an attempt at the willing suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />However , having seriously defamed the overall concept of this film , let me tell you again that , as sad as it may sound , this is probably worth your time . If nothing else , it is a tour de force of bad Sci - Fi - worth the education for the new movie buff and certainly worthy of a refresher course for those who have seen a few movies in their day.<br /><br />The crazy hunchback mad scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it is a good idea to spoon canfuls of blood into the nearby water makes me question not only the intelligence of mankind , but also the ability of " B " movie writers to come up with remotely plausible plot lines.<br /><br />This film also pretty much fulfills one of my longtime bad movie contentions - bad guys always wear sunglasses.<br /><br />If this were n't 2005 , I would be deadset on the fact this film was some sort of insanely poor metaphor for the Cold War . I mean , you might as well have Khan on the bridge of a Klingon Bird of Prey inserting leaches into Chekhov 's ear.<br /><br />One of the most moving lines of the movie is when the chick without the bra insists that the Charlton Heston lookalike , " wait for Tom " as he is trying to lift the escape helicopter off the ground . The thing is , Tom is wasting the bad sunglass guys with his never - ending banana clip attached to his Kalashnikov , or AK-47 , in layman 's terms.<br /><br />As the mad scientist says near the end of the film , " my goal is to evolve the human species " - suffice it to say that this movie contributed only to a devolution of humankind . The faint Freudian references uttered by the mad scientist as he prepping the female protagonist to be mated with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder that even in the worst of science fiction we can all find something to laugh about .
0 I am a lover of B movies , give me a genetically mutated bat and I am in heaven . These movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world . Even a stupid B movie will usually make me laugh and I will still consider it a good thing . Then there was Hammerhead , which was so awful I had to register with IMDb so I could warn others . First there was the science of creating the shark - man , which the movie barely touched on . In order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes . During one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead ( what fabulous special effects ) . Back to the science , I thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue . Anyway this movie had poor plot development , terrible story , and I 'm sorry to say pretty bad acting . Not even William Forsythe , Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could save this stinker .
0 This is a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex who she loved so much was probably dead , but really his scientist dad had just put a spell on him to turn him into this really cute shark - guy . Kind of like in Beauty and the Beast . It could probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe some singing candlesticks , but there are some pretty gross plants instead . They make this one girl really itchy , so she lets herself get eaten by the shark - guy instead of scratching through the whole movie . The scientist guy is a good dad who tries to reunite his fishy shark son with the woman he was engaged to , he even arranges for them to have private time for s - e - x , but the woman in this is a really shallow snob and thinks the shark - guy is an ugly , icky monster and wants nothing to do with him . She gave up on love ! Just because he was a shark ! I thought it was pretty sad how all she had to do was kiss him and he 'd turn back to normal and they 'd live happily ever after , but it 's not that kind of movie .
0 this movie was n't absolutely atrocious , but it was pretty bad . the acting ACTUALLY was pretty good ! jeffrey combs did a pretty darn good job as the mad scientist , which is sort of his specialty if you do n't know such things : D. bill forsythe .. well , i 'm not EXACTLY sure why he was in this film . he 's way too good for this kinda stuff , and his role was n't exactly demanding . I rented this on the strength of those two leads , and I was n't really disappointed . I mean , heck , it 's a movie about a half man / half shark . It ai n't Shakespeare folks . Other than the plot , which is full of holes , and the poor dialogue , I would like to note that the cinematography also left many things to be desired . there were shots were they were trying to look " cool " , but it ended up obscuring the scene or just coming off plain cheezy . they also blew it many times when they had decent dialogue and cut away prematurely before the person could even deliver the line . it was pretty bad . but if you are a jeffrey combs fan , this one is worth checking out . he gives a great performance and does what he can with the character . forsythe ai n't bad either , and either is the female lead . heck if i can remember her name though . bottom line , i would n't otherwise waste your time .
0 Where the hell are all these uncharted islands where prehistoric monsters lurk , evil doctors perform their experiments , madmen hold the ultimate karate championship , and the uber - rich hunt humans for sport ? I had no idea there were still so many uncharted islands out there , but if you take into account the number of movies that utilize one of these mysterious islands as a location , you 'd have to assume that there are at least 50 of these suckers out there . It always winds up feeling so damned convenient and I immediately deduct points from any movie that uses this hackneyed device . Hammerhead is the story of a mad scientist who is conducting experiments on one of these uncharted islands , so the movie already had a lot to make up for before it even began.<br /><br />The island in this movie used to belong to Dr. Moreau , but has recently been purchased by the Re - Animator himself , Jeffrey Combs . Old Jeffrey is doing some kind of cutting edge stem cell research , which has led him to start working with sharks while searching for a cure for cancer . If that sounds familiar , that 's because this is roughly the same basic set - up as the smart shark facility in Deep Blue Sea , not to mention a host of other Nu Image movies . So apparently , Jeffrey 's son was dying of cancer which prompted our mad doctor to start experimenting on his progeny . He did some kind of super fancy gene splicing and so forth , turning his son into a shark - man.<br /><br />William Forsythe leads a crew of unknown actors to the island to look into the doctor 's experiments . If someone would have given him a sailor 's hat , William would have been a dead ringer for the Skipper from Gilligan 's Island . In typical Bond Villain fashion , the doctor decides that all of these intruders would make nice chum for his son . Not chums , like buddies ... chum , like shark food . So enter shark - boy who starts stalking the Skipper and his cohorts all over the island . They , of course , make half - hearted attempts to escape and are thwarted over and over again while being chased by a guy in a rubber shark - man suit . < br /><br />The movie did n't make up any of the points that it lost for taking place on one of those dastardly deserted islands . It 's funny that this movie is called Hammerhead , it made me think of an old joke . Why do you hit yourself in the head with a hammer ? Because it feels so good when you stop . That 's pretty much how this movie is . The only reason to watch it is because it feels so good when it 's over .
0 This low budget B horror 's plot comes with all the amenities - mad scientist complete with sidekick , malicious corporate greed of pharmaceutical industry , eccentric and extreme genetic engineering , and information technology .... can't leave that out.<br /><br />Start with strange sequence of hot looking nameless boaters that foolishly decide to take a dip in the waters near an uncharted island and end up chum for swarming hammerhead sharks ..... <br /><br />Cut to weak back story implying the stock decline of a generic pharma corporation which motivates its wicked Shakespeare quoting CEO to entertain an un - solicited offer made by a former employee / scientist that was jilted out of his job as head of research and who also happens to be a nut ... of course ( total Herbert West wannabe ) . He is offering up a new stem cell technology that could make tons o ' cash ... or so it seems ... This lures in several employees to his Moreau - ish island ( must have been quite an impressive exit package from the company when he was let go for him to afford an island ) to validate his scientific findings including the CEO and , co - incidentally , the ex - fiancé of the mad scientist 's son now morphed sharkuman ( how convenient) .... <br /><br />The plan , sort of , is to rekindle lost love between the former nuptials while exacting revenge on the former colleagues for his termination . ( Sheez , how can this guy be bitter ? He has his own friggen ' island after all ... ).<br /><br />Soon , everyone is on the run ( from endless supply of security guards toting heavy weaponry , from mutant plants  can there be an uncharted island without man - eating plants ? , from sharky son 's appetite for carnage , from quack daddy 's breeding plans , and from lack of a cell phone signal) ... and they all must learn to work together to get off the island alive ! < br /><br />Will anyone escape ? Will a new species be created ? Watch it and find out.<br /><br />There is some entertainment value in this movie , but do n't expect much ... for the true Combs fan , this is not to be missed . < br /><br />Don't say I did n't warn you .
0 Hahahaha!!!!!!Funny - that sums this movie up in one word . What the crap was this " thing",since It might kill me to use the word movie!?!?!I hope the director , writer , and producer did n't mean for this to turn out good , because it sure didn't!!!A scientist turning his son into a hammerhead shark , and the shark killing a bunch of people the scientist invited to the island!!!Oh my Gooooooodddd!!!!I hate this film so much that when I was watching it I laughed at all the serious parts , because they were so corny and unprofessional .... and they could n't have made the shark look more unrealistic , even though this " thing " had a bit larger budget than most low - budget movies . All I have to say is watch this movie expecting to laugh at all the bad acting , and stupid corny dialogue , because if you are expecting a good movie you 'll be highly disappointed .
0 This was a really funny movie.<br /><br />Every 1 in the movie was trying to be serious that is what made this movie so funny . I mean come on a shark 's head on a human body . Can it get any funnier . Good job Sci - Fi keep the comedy movies coming . I never thought movies could get anymore retarded . If they keep it up they will have to rename the sci fie channel the comedy sci fi channel or something like that.<br /><br />I ca nt wait 4 the next blockbuster movie from sci fi.<br /><br />Ill be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a case of beer or a bottle of liquor and Ill be ready to laugh it up again ! ! !
0 If you read my review of SyFy 's " Dinoshark " , you know that I can appreciate the low - budget schlock that these made - for - television movies can provide . They 're stupid ... they're silly ... but they 're still pretty fun in a " so bad , it 's good " kind of way . So , still smacking with guilt for liking ( and recommending ) the undeniably hokey " Dinoshark " , I sat down to watch " Hammerhead : Shark Frenzy " , a SyFy Original Movie about a half - man , half - hammerhead monster terrorizing people on an island . With the SyFy Channel 's sure - fire recipe for creating B - movie creature features and a cast that includes William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo , how could it possibly go wrong ? Well , to my surprise , it actually misses the mark ... not by much , but enough to make me not recommend it . Why ? Well , first of all , its titular monster , the dreaded hammerhead - human hybrid , takes a backseat to a bunch of faux - military thugs who really become the movie 's primary villain . Though the hammerhead does rack up the body count , he ( or it or whatever you call the thing ) only arrives just before someone is going to be munched upon and leaves directly after . The rest of the movie is filler , pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers . That , to me , is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat people ! < br /><br />Please Read The Full Review On My Blog : www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
0 Jeffrey Combs is an insane scientist whose stem cell research has morphed into a diabolical scheme to create a hybrid hammerhead shark humanoid life form , hoping to breed a brand new species using Hunter Tylo 's womb . It wo n't be easy for Tylo is a tough broad and her boyfriend , William Forsythe , is n't about to give her up without a fight.<br /><br />You see Tylo and Forsythe are two of business executive Arthur Roberts ' employees , brilliant minds who meet Combs( .. a scientist who once worked for Roberts , and whose vacated position went to Tylo)at his island fortress where he conducts his research and experiments . This island affords him the opportunity to recruit fresh victims for his work and " son " . They think it 's a professional affair in regards to a breakthrough in stem cell research which could lead to cures for a variety of diseases . Combs ' son was dying of kidney cancer when he decided to perform his mad science on him , creating this blood - thirsty , flesh - eating creature which can both swim and walk on dry land( .. although , at first the hammerhead could only remain outside for short time periods ) . Tylo was dating Combs ' son , hence the connection besides the two having worked for Roberts , who brings along his trophy wife , Mariya Ignatova . Also accompanying Tylo and Forsythe , Roberts and Ignatova , are their colleagues , Elise Muller and GR Johnson . Combs traps them in a conference room , but they are able to escape onto the island as he sends after them his well paid mercenaries and hammerhead shark son.<br /><br />Like similar sci - fi channel creature features of it 's type , Hammerhead : Shark Frenzy has some rather unappealing computer generated effects and the attacks( .. where the shark rips apart limbs)are shot in a quick - edit , frenzied camera format where you have a hard time ever seeing any of the ensuing gory carnage . You have this vague notion that a person is being eaten( .. ripped to shreds ) , but the attacks themselves are shot in a very erratic fashion which , truth be told , is rather infuriating . The monster itself is never seen in it 's entirety , just momentary glimpses of an eye or a body part being gnawed on as the victim screams out in horror . One thing 's for certain , you do see teeth . We do get cgi shots of the hammerhead shark swimming toward the screen , all menacing , ready to feast on flesh . A constant is while( .. and after)victims are attacked , we see a great deal of blood and bits of flesh bubbling to the water 's surface( .. this is really director Michael Oblowitz 's main cue as to inform the viewer that those being torn apart are goners).<br /><br />Combs does n't break new ground as the scientist , but he 's always had an ability to convey a quiet madness under this cold - blooded resolve . It 's fun seeing Forsythe in a rare clean - cut hero role , very against type as an electronics wiz( .. to his credit , he actually pulls it off)who must assume a leadership position when the group faces unprecedented peril . Tylo is also in a very different kind of role , a scientist who can defend herself quite well . Roberts can play the millionaire businessman roles in his sleep , and it 's kind of neat seeing him firing off a machine gun at Combs ' soldiers( .. although , his fate is not pleasant ) . Mentioning that , it was also really entertaining watching Forythe and Tylo downing Combs ' hired goons with confiscated automatic machine guns . As expected , the screenplay allows those who created the murderous fiend to put themselves in unnecessary danger just so that they can pay for their sins .. I mean , seriously , would these people knowingly leave themselves so vulnerable to attack after seeing just what damage to the human anatomy it could do ? Beautiful exotic setting is quite a nice backdrop .
0 Hammerhead is a combination between the mad scientist and killer shark movie genres . In a bit of type - casting , Jeffrey Combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a human / hammerhead shark creature . Bizarrely , this being is in fact his son , who he has turned into this monster to prevent him dying from cancer . Or something.<br /><br />A group of associates are invited to the scientist 's private island . They end up being used as shark bait or shark mate . For some unknown reason the head of IT has been brought along as part of this team . Who knows why ? Luckily , he turns out to be a resourceful , if somewhat overweight , Ramboesque hero . I 'm working on the assumption that he learnt how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day job working in 1st line support . A normal day for this IT man presumably involves fixing someone 's network connection followed by a call to gun down gun - toting evil - doers . Or perhaps a call to fix someone 's PC has to be scheduled between physical confrontations with land - based human - shark hybrids ? Anyway , he 's amazing and saves the day . He even get 's the girl.<br /><br />The shark - man is a slightly lame creation but OK , I guess , judging by the effects in general in this film . And the movie moves on at a decent pace . It 's complete hokum of course but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead and expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a land - based killer fish , then really you have no one to blame but yourself . As it is , there are guns , gore , girls and possibly even an exploding helicopter . It 's rubbish but not as bad as some might say .
0 A scientist on an island is in deep sorrow about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer . So he thinks : why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark . Well , who would n't ? It 's a little hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that 's killing everybody is constantly being called " Paul " . Also , William Forsythe 's cast as a MacGyver - kick - ass - savingtheday- kinda hero lacks credibility . On the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark Paul bites another one to death . As a matter of fact I find bad b - movies quite amusing . But for my taste it would have been a much better movie if it was made for say 1000000 bucks less . Then it might have been fun .
0 This type of plot really does have a lot of potential , but it was butchered here . Honestly , I sensed the cheese element in the beginning , but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing . Whoa , I was wrong ! So mad scientist makes a monster , wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them , but of course they escape . After that , it 's really bad . I should 've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage , but I most likely would have lost count.<br /><br />Pan down to the blood - dripping - from - severed - leg to show us how the shark - man finds the folks . I hate being spoon - fed every aspect of a horror film.<br /><br />Oh , and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark - man and trudging around a jungle - esqe island , there 's nothing more cheerful than a middle - aged man reciting Shakespeare ... <br /><br />This is one where you 'll find yourself rooting for the monster ... if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick .
0 I love sharks . And mutants . And explosions . Theoretically , with those parameters in mind , HAMMERHEAD : Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie ever.<br /><br />It is not.<br /><br />The monster looks like a villain from Power Rangers , and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement . This might be okay if the makers were n't quite as proud of its design as they seem to be . That is to say , for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action / scifi / horror flick that could benefit from some mystery , the shark gets a lot of screen time . Granted , it is usually shaky and erratic . I guess you 're supposed to assume that it 's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out.<br /><br />The camera goes to a person about to get eaten , the camera goes to the shark . The camera goes back to the person about to get eaten , only now they are screaming and armless . And so on.<br /><br />The costuming is bad , the acting is poor , and the special effects are sub - par , but the writing is by far the worst . Things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten , or so something can explode . Because LET ME TELL YOU , the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions = more better mindset . Characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion . They shoot helicopters , there is a massive explosion . Barrels , rocks , trees , WHATEVER , they all explode , so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end.<br /><br />Speaking of which , I do n't care how crazy a person is , I find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant half - person half - shark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea . That is , UNLESS that person is the mad scientist in this movie.<br /><br />The bad thing is , the movie is so random ( and at times , boring ) that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person 's prolonged interest . It might be a good one to MST3 K with your friends , but past that , if you happen to catch this bad boy on , do yourself a favor and change the channel .
0 Note to all mad scientists everywhere : if you 're going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster , you need to give him a scarier name than " Paul . " I do n't care if he 's a frightening hammerhead shark with a mouthful of dagger - sharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water as well as on dry land . Give the kid a more worthy name like , " Thor , " " Rock , " or " Tiburon . " Because even if he eats me up I will probably just sit there laughing , " Ha ! Get a load of this ! ! ! Paul the Monster is ripping me to shreds ! ! ! ! ! " That 's the worst part about this movie is , this shark - thing is referred to as " Paul " throughout the entire flick . It makes what could have been a decent , scary horror movie just seem silly . Not that there are n't other campy and contrived parts of " Hammerhead : Shark Frenzy . " The scientists spend the entire movie wandering along this island , and all of a sudden one of the girls starts itching madly from walking in the lush forest , and just HAS to pour water on her feet to relive the itching , which of course allows " Paul " to come out of the water and kill her . The one thing SciFI Channel did right in this movie was let the hottie live . But that 's a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie .
0 This movie makes me think the others I 've seen with Combs were an accident . The plot had more holes than I think I 've ever seen in a movie purporting to be something more than a " b " movie . The acting was so laughable that not even the memories of Combs ' past campy triumphs were enough to save it . Considering the script I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas . I am thoroughly upset that I paid Blockbuster prices for this trash . The fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this atrocity and frankly something that movies this poor should be required to warn you of . Avoid this movie no matter what .
0 Horror / Sci - Fi that is interesting as it is laughable . F / X pretty good ... for what you manage to see . A made for TV thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them . Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant although misguided scientist that tampers with stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with that of a hammerhead shark . The horrifying results give birth to one hell of a killing machine . A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment . Of course , after laughing and stammering in awe ... Coombs ' creation , by the way is his own son fused with a hammerhead , is let loose to hunt down one by one his father 's colleagues . Revenge is not always rewarding . Also in the cast : Elsie Muller , G.R. Johnson , Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev .
0 i love bad shark movies . i really do . i laugh hysterically at them . and the scifi channel was having a marathon of them , culminating in the premier of their new original picture , hammerhead : shark frenzy . based on the previews , it looked like it was going to be HIGHLY amusing . essentially a remake of benchley 's creature , really . it was prefaced by a showing of shark attack 3 : megalodon , which is shark movie hilarity at its best . i was in the mood ; i was ready to go . bring it on , hammerhead - mad - scientist - man ! oh , god , was that movie wrong.<br /><br />wrong , wrong , wrong.<br /><br />sick . twisted . MESSED UP.<br /><br />this is theoretical reproduction at its very worst , my friends . when a drugged - out girl is brought out of suspended animation and strapped to a table screaming her head off because the shark - human hybrid fetus the absolutely insane " scientist " deliberately implanted in her womb wants OUT ... Jesus monkeys . that 's what i call disturbing.<br /><br />that 's really how the plot works : hmmm , thought the mad scientist . my son died of cancer , but i brought him back to life by combining his dna with that of a hammerhead shark , because sharks do n't succumb to cancer and further hammerheads reproduce via placenta . oh , look ! a perfect amphibious being ! i 've created the next evolution of the human race ! I KNOW ! let 's make him reproduce ! but darned if all those shark genes have't made my son bloodthirsty ; instead of raping the hot babes i keep sending into his little jungle paradise , he keeps eating him . but check this out ! among the random people who have , by way of some unimportant plot twist , ended up on my research island , is the woman to whom my son was engaged before he died ! i bet he 'll do HER ! all this leads up to an extremely touching and heartfelt reunion : woman : you 're going to impregnate me ? mad scientist : no . he is . ( indicates thrashing shark - person in tank ) how sweet.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE . ever .
0 I caught " Sorrows Lost " at the New York Film and Video Festival and I guess I had some high hopes for this film . Sadly , this is just another Visual FX calling card . The story is pretty lame . The bad lighting and camera work , along with the less than great editing and music all make the film seem low quality.<br /><br />Is it really too much to ask that FX shorts have better stories and have the rest of the technical production be on par with the FX ! You ca n't just get away with cool FX in shorts anymore , it 's been 5 years since " 405 " made a big splash . At least that short quick , cool and was even a little funny ! None of that can be said about " Sorrows Lost . "
0 A scientist and his girl friend are out driving when his speeding causes a car crash . He escapes unharmed but she is decapitated . He saves her head , brings it to his house and keeps it alive ( ! ! ! ! ) . He then proceeds to search out models and strippers for the perfect body for the head . His crippled assistant watches over the head which starts talking and has a telepathic ( or telepathetic ) link to a deformed monster kept in the closet .... <br /><br />As you can see , this is pretty stupid stuff , but I had a certain fondness for it . When I grew up in the late 1970s , a local TV station showed this movie about 20 times each year ( no exaggeration ) . They showed it always on Saturday afternoon TV -- uncut . Seeing this on TV back then was great ! Explicit blood and gore along with a gruesome monster and sleazy sexploitation -- who cares if it was good ? Seeing it now I realize how lousy this really is.<br /><br />The acting is perfectly wretched , the production values are nonexistent , the script is pretty dumb and ( aside from the still pretty disgusting gore ) this is dull stuff . There 's also a mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly great monster at the end . Also add in an ending which leaves tons of loose ends . On one hand this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation film . On the other its utter trash . Either way , it 's not a good movie but is a must - see ( for one time only ) for horror and gore fans.<br /><br />Also the head 's laugh is pretty creepy . Note the end credits which gets the TITLE wrong ( calling it " The HEAD That Would n't Die " ) !
0 This one hearkens back to the days of the matinée , when kids with nowhere else to hang out took their dates to the balcony after dumping their younger siblings below . It did n't matter what was on the screen - the little kids would sit through it and the big kids would ignore it . The adults , of course , would never see it.<br /><br />But they put it on video , anyway , along with most of the other creaky , low - budget " B " horror flicks of the golden age ... of television . This film 's inherent and unintentional humor is derived from stale ideology ( the " bad girls " harvested to replace poor Jan 's crushed body - they had it comin ' ) , overused plot ( a mad scientist , trying to play God ) , violent yet conscientious monster ( whose presence in the heretofore - normal - seeming scientist 's rural lab is never fully explained ) , and acting that polarizes at wooden or over - the - top.<br /><br />This is a great party film , assuming your guests enjoy adding dialog and commentary to otherwise abominable cinematic exploits . In fact , should you or your guests prefer more passive entertainment , this film is also available on video in its " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " treatment , in which the host and puppets of the cult TV series make the necessary additions for you .
0 The Brain ( or head ) that Would n't Die is one of the more thoughtful low budget exploitation films of the early 1960s . It is very difficult to imagine how a script this repulsively sexist could have been written without the intention of self - parody . And the themes that are expressed repeatedly by the female lead , Ginny Leith - a detached head kept alive by machines , I - Vs and clamps - seem to confirm that the film was meant to simultaneously exploit and critique gender stereotypes . Shades of the under - rated Boxing Helena.<br /><br />The genderisms are plentiful , and about as irritating as an army of angry ants . The dialog is hyperbolic , over - dramatic and unbelievable , and the acting is merely OK ( but not consistent ) . Why have I given this film a 4 ? Because some thought clearly went into it . I am really not sure what point the film was really trying to make , but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw sort of horror ( without the blood and guts today 's audiences expect).<br /><br />Another unique and interesting aspect of the Brain is that there really are not any heroes in this film , and none of the characters are particularly likable.<br /><br />All considered , this is a fairly painful and disturbing look at early 1960s American pop sexuality , from the viewpoint of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been a fatal car crash . Her lover is threatening to sew a fresh , high quality , body onto her and force her to continue living with him . She is understandably non - plussed by all of this and forced to befriend a creature who is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend . Oh , there are also some vague references to the 1950s/60s cliché about the evils of science run amok.<br /><br />Recommended for B sci fi buffs and graduate students in gender studies . O / w not recommended .
0 The Brain That Would n't Die is one awful piece of film that stinks from the opening credits . It 's got all the classic signs of being bad : unbelieveable plotline , terrible acting , low - grade sets and lighting . The plotline goes like this : When a doctor and his fiancee get caught in an accident , she gets decapitated and he picks up her head and takes her to his lab , where he sets up her head in a pan with some special liquid that keeps it alive . I 'll bet Virgnina Leath , who played the head in a pan had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time wearing that pan around her neck and squatting under a table . Anyway , the doctor then tries to find her a new body , and hires two strippers so she can chose one to have her new body . Bad all the way through , so bad it was torn to pieces on Mystery Science Theater 3000 .
0 Neat premise . Very unrealistic . What I learned from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all . I loved how Bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all ! Unfortunately , the same ca n't be said for his gal . Oh , and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wreck.<br /><br />Lots of dragged out scenes including a plain stripper ( still have nightmares from that scene ) . Poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand . I admit I was intrigued to see what the mysterious " thing " was behind the door , but when it appeared , I just laughed . HA HA HA ! ! The girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived . Personally , I really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like that !
0 A demented scientist girlfriend is decapitated so he brings her head back to life . Honest this is the plot of the movie . He try 's to get her another body he searches through the sleaze area of town for that perfect body . For some reason he has ugly looking monster in a closet at his cabin . The sleaze style of the movie is laughable . No one in the movie can actually act including the head . The closet monster is a man with a mask tie on and you can really tell . The plot is slow , weak and the ending is so badly done . Watch the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this move . Believe me folks I would n't watch this movie on its own .
0 Another movie that relies upon the trite , worn - out cliché of the mad scientist gone madder . The movie centers around a surgeon whose life 's ambition is to bring the dead ... back to life . I know , I know ... you've never heard that one before ! Of course , as all of these movies go , the experiment goes very , very wrong and creates a maniacal , bloodthirsty creature . For this promising setup , you 'd think that it 'd be at least a bit suspenseful . Wrong . Like many movies of this era , the idea is nice , but the execution and the script is mediocre . Not the worst horror movie I 've seen ( no , Abominator : the Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but not one of the gems , either .
0 A doctor who is trying to complete the medical dream of transplantation is experimenting secretly on corpses from the hospital with varying success . His final best chance comes when he lovingly wraps his girlfriend 's head in his jacket as he rescues it from a burning vehicle.<br /><br />I was looking for cheese and with this premise I believed I found it . It has everything everything that bad movie hunters look for - chest and brain surgery with the surgeons leaving with pristine white scrubs , unique camera angles ( I always love watching the rear passenger wheels of cars ) , cheesy clarinet stripper music , and one of the longest death scenes in movie history . But unfortunately these so - bad - they - are - good moments ca n't overcome the too - bad - they - stink stretches.<br /><br />Jan in the Pan annoyed me , with her droning monologues in a hoarse whisper , the somewhat less than evil laughter , and the fact she was kept alive with some Columbian home brew coffee and 2 DD batteries.<br /><br />I could n't even entertain myself with Dr Bill 's horrid overacting and moral self righteousness . Usually such ham makes these movies a must see in my opinion , in this case I was bored with it.<br /><br />The best part of the movie in my opinion was the 1960 's version of " body shopping " and I even found myself nodding off during that.<br /><br />Don't spend money on this one - there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sick sense of humor .
0 * * Possible Spoilers Ahead**<br /><br / > 	 Jason ( a.k.a . Herb ) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who , along with wife Virginia Leith , is involved in the most lackluster onscreen car crash ever . Leith is decapitated and the doctor takes her severed noggin back to his mansion and rejuvenates the head in his lab . The mansion 's exterior was allegedly filmed at Tarrytown 's Lyndhurst estate ; the lab scenes were apparently shot in somebody 's basement . The bandaged head is kept alive on " lab equipment " that 's almost cheap - looking enough for Ed Wood . Some of the library musicthe movie 's high pointlater turned up in Andy Milligan 's THE BODY BENEATH . Leith 's head has some heavy metaphysical discourses with another of Ever 's misfires , a mutant chained in the closet . Meanwhile , the good doc prowls strip joints looking for a body worthy of his wife 's gabby noodle . The ending , in uncut prints , features some ahead - of - its - time splatter and dismemberment when the zucchini - headed monster comes out of the closet to bring the movie to a welcome close . This thing took three years to be released and then , audiences gave it the bad reception it richly deserved . Between this , PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and a few others , 1959 should have been declared The Year Of The Turkey .
0 This movie tells the tender tale of a demented scientist who , after his fiance is decapitated , goes around ogling strippers so that he can find a suitable body to attach her noggin to . Everyone in this movie exudes more slime than a snail , particularly our protagonist .
0 Following a car accident , a mad scientist(Jason Evers ) keeps the head of his fiancee(Virgina Leith)alive . He then goes on the prowl looking for the perfect body to make her whole again . Pretty lame all the way around , nothing redeeming here . Also in the cast are : Leslie Daniels , Bonnie Sharie and Bruce Brighton . Someone should have helped put this one out of its misery . Let it die .
0 I bought this film on DVD so I could get an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . Thankfully , Mike , Crow , and Tom Servo are watchable , because the film itself is not . Although there is a plot , a story one can follow , and a few actors that can act , there is n't anything else . The movie was so boring , I have firmly confirmed that I will never watch it again without Tom , Crow and Mike . As summarized above , however , it was better than the film featured in the MST3 K episode that preceded it ; Mitchell .
0 ... but it 'll make you wonder if we had any in the first place ! This movie is just as bad as any of today 's horrible horror . A man goes around ogling semi - clad ladies , trying to decide which one to kill so he can give his girlfriend a new body . One scene involves a man staggering around and spurting all over the set for a full three minutes , coating everything what what must be well over ten gallons of " blood . " The movie also attempts to create a sense that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature , but the movie is so badly done it 's impossible for the audience to dredge up any feeling of shock or outrage . Aimlessly dark and unimpressively sinister , this movie ca n't even get its own title straight-- the beginning credits say " The Brain That Would n't Die , " but the end credits list it as " The Head That Would n't Die . "
0 ... or an audience . A quick recap .... <br /><br />So you 've got this doctor who 's been experimenting with stolen body parts for some vague reason . He wants to perfect transplants , but feels he needs to do this in his basement . WTF ? ? ? And then suddenly , unfortunately , and conveniently , his fiancé gets her head cut off in a traffic accident that HE 'S responsible for . Agonized with grief , he preserves her head in a lasagna pan ( or is it strudel ? ) and pumps it full of " adreno - serum " ( sic ) to keep it alive . And then she awakes , talking her head off ( so to speak ) even though her neck was obviously severed at the vocal cords , and she has no lungs so she could n't speak even if she had 'em . Seems the ungrateful b*tch does n't appreciate all that her fiancé has done for her . Just like a woman ..... <br /><br />Then his grief turns to horniness as he sees the possibility of grafting his beloved 's head onto the body of the first sleazy bimbo he can pick up off the street . Meanwhile , the doctor 's assistant , a sort of dime - store Igor , gets into philosophical arguments with the head , who has struck up a telekinetic friendship with the " monster in the closet " ( every mad scientist has one ) . Eventually the screenwriter realizes that he ca n't keep inflicting his misogyny and fear of intimacy issues on the audience ad infinitum , so he kills everybody , then presumably goes to the bank to cash the check before the movie 's financial backers have a chance to stop payment on it . < br /><br />Have I mentioned that I think this is a bad movie?<br /><br />Someone should tell Turner Classic Movies to stop showing that edited version without the gory stuff . The sight of the assistant with his arm ripped off , pirouetting around the house without leaving much blood anywhere is just too precious .
0 This movie is a loose collection of unintelligible analogies and ill conceived plot devices.<br /><br />Movie history : The director of this film was a pervert who drove around town filming random women . When his wife discovered the film reels , he was forced to quickly contrive a story . He claimed he was making a movie called " The brain that would n't die . " Eventually , his wife demanded that he show her his " so called movie . " That night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and " The Brain that would n't Die " was born.<br /><br />I hate this movie ! Plot Synopsis : The main character 's fiancé is killed in a horrible car accident(that he caused by ignoring the clearly posted road signs ) . He grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it . After reanimating the head , he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers . That is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie . At the end , he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet . The monster appears with little to no explanation . However , the monster saves a hooker and I assume that they live happily ever after.<br /><br />Side notes : The end credit screen claims that the movie is called " The Head that would n't Die".<br /><br />I hate this movie !
0 This film was really bad whether you take it as a sci - fi movie , as a horror one or even as a comedy . The whole thing is ridiculous.<br /><br />The film looks ( and is ) definitely cheap , the actors have no idea of what acting is and the script shows clearly that it was being made along with the shooting . It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not scary at all -she was even pretty- and they thought they needed something more impressive ; they failed here too ( the make up is awful even for the late 50 's , rather funny).<br /><br />The film shows clearly why Director Joseph Green 's career as such and also as a writer never materialized ; he was really bad at both . Same goes to the actors , leading and supporting.<br /><br />"The Brain That Would n't Die " 's best achievement is its short running time .
0 I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart . After seeing it , I might just return to the store and try to get my money back ! The only reason I gave the movie a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has a few novel story elements , though it really never rises to the level of being interesting . This film has all the earmarks of being a made for the drive - in theaters market -- ultra - low budget , amateurish acting and a liberal dose of sex ( for an early 60s film ) . In fact , I wonder if perhaps the only reason the film was made was to make a fast buck AND because someone knew some strippers they could use as extras . The film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend 's severed head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor . Most of the potential donors are skanky strippers or a model -- whose only real purpose in the film is to titillate as they remove most of their clothes . However , they keep too much on to make the movie even worth watching for the naughty bits and the film is n't quite awful enough to merit watching by bad film buffs .
0 I saw this movie thinking that it would be one of those old B movies that are fun to watch . I was so wrong ! This movie was boring and obviously aimed at males who like looking at corpulent women . The story was so ridiculous and implausible that it lost my interest altogether . It seemed to be in the same genre as the Ed Wood films - bottom of the barrel .
0 Where to begin , there 's so much wrong and horrible about this movie I am not sure where to start . Okay , the two stooges who wrote this crapper . Joseph Green and Rex Carlton , first they could n't make up their so - called minds for a name . My guess they split the difference , that 's why the main title is BRAIN THAT WOULDN'T DIE , but the end screen says HEAD THAT WOULDN'T DIE . Neither one knows anything about the Medical profession . After all Doctors take oaths to " do no harm " . Killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered " harm " . Plus , a little thing called blood and tissue matching . Rejection would spell death for Jan in the pan . Plus who keeps a patch work monster . What medical school did Bill graduate from , FRANKENSTIEN UNIVERSITY ? Old FU , or MAD SCIENTIST TECH ? The monster had no name , that bugs the hell out of me . Plus , the brilliant surgeon Doctor Bill Cortner does n't know how to keep a patient sedated ? All and all a disaster of a movie , it 's incredibly stupid and unwatchable , except on MST3K. I give it THE THANKSGIVING TURKEY .
0 I just loved watching it though and having fun with it 's total badness of a film . I saw this film through the helpful sarcasm of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have the DVD . If you flip the to the other side of the DVD , they show the actual movie , so I gave it a chance . Seriously , folks this is grilled cheese.<br /><br />The acting , special effects , and plot in general is very cheesy and unrealistic . " Does n't she need lungs " said Crow noticing how the head can still talk while it does n't have a body , and Tom Servo just wistfully remarks " No , she 's got neck juice ! " . The ending is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K - Porn ! I loved the " cat fight " between the two strippers . That " Meow " after the fight or scene , whatever , was classic . So , in some ways this was a fun movie . I think for horror fans , you 'll probably enjoy it . For a good time , watch the MSTK3 version , you 'll get a great laugh.<br /><br />MST3 K version : 10/10 The Brain that would die : 1/10
0 I would have enjoyed this movie slightly more had not been for Jason ( Herb ) Evers constant harping on experiment . Many early reviewers of The Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of overacting . Yet , as more and more critics viewed that film they saw it as being purposefully done . Jason Evers is obviously not Toshiro Mifune , and his overacting is exactly that.<br /><br />Most of the actors in this B classic were rather good actors , minus Evers and the showgirls . If you watch this movie , you would have noticed Evers shouting almost every line , that is until he is smoking and blowing the smoke coolly out his nose . < br /><br />The special effects were par for the course in a B movie such as this one . In hindsight , there is n't much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie .
0 The first noticeable problem about this awkwardly titled film is its casting . Ann Nelson plays the grandma here . Three years after this , she would star in " Airplane ! " as the woman who hangs herself while listening to Robert Hays pine for Julie Hagerty . I could not get that image out of my head.<br /><br />Matt Boston is a fifteen year old with problems . He has headaches . His mother had a nervous breakdown . His grandfather had a massive heart attack . A chain smoking psychiatrist decides to find out what the devil is going on with this family . First she hypnotizes Grandma Nelson . Nelson tells a tale in flashback that fills the entire first half of the film.<br /><br />She and Grandpa bought an RV , cheap , and drive it around to all the tourist traps in desert California . The RV soon has a mind of its own , going off the road and such . Then , large boulders begin hurling themselves at it . The elderly couple are appropriately afraid , but stay in the vehicle in order to move the plot along.<br /><br />Eventually , Grandpa has a heart attack after being stranded on the RV roof when it goes for another unplanned ride.<br /><br />Boston 's mom begins talking to some Native American mummies she has lying around the house . She fancies herself an author , and makes copious notes about the musty corpses . The psychiatrist reads the detailed notes , and uses her imagination to fill in the blanks . We see the mother semi - flip out , but her mental breakdown occurs offscreen , much like Gramps ' heart attack.<br /><br />Finally , the patient de resistance , little Matt . Matt goes under the hypnosis gun and tells his own tale . He thinks mom is wigging out ( this was made in 1977 ) . Apparently , mom is making the astral bodies of the Native American mummies sort of fly through the air . One hits Matt like a bee hits a windshield , and Matt begins acting all crazy.<br /><br />The psychiatrist takes Grandma and Matt into the desert . Matt is inexplicably in a wheelchair now , and the trio confront the unseen ( and unexplained ) forces.<br /><br />Flocker has no sense of scene construction . The one pro here involves the RV stranded in a salt flat in the desert . In the distance , the couple notice some boulders rolling toward the RV . This is a pretty creepy little scene that is eventually overplayed . As the boulders begin hurling themselves toward the vehicle , the special effects become obvious.<br /><br />The scenes where the RV runs off the highway , then back on again , take forever . The scenes where Grandpa is trapped on the RV roof as it careens down a dirt road takes forever . Mom 's conversations with the mummy take forever . Matt 's out of body experiences take forever . This film takes forever.<br /><br />I was tempted to hit the fast forward button at least a dozen times . As scenes dragged on , it was obvious Flocker was padding . Cut the fat here , and this would have clocked in at an hour . The final " explanation , " that the mummies ' spirits were trying to kill those close to Matt never holds water . Did they inhabit the RV ? The film maker never brings up the fact that the spirits are no good at their murderous ways , they never kill anybody!<br /><br />As I kept thinking of Nelson in " Airplane ! , " I also thought of other movies . Anything to keep me from falling asleep during this one . Boston is terrible as the kid , playing a fifteen year old as a cute ten year old who has a smart alecky line for all these adults who fall over themselves loving him.<br /><br />In the end , Flocker has written and directed a mess . The title is just the beginning of this exercise in making the audience feel ill at ease . This is not scary , and like the ghosts , you too can still walk ... away from this tape at the video store.<br /><br />This is unrated , and contains some physical violence and mild profanity .
0 Perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia 's comedy is that every joke needs to be followed with an insult at the people in the crowd that are n't laughing . If there 's anybody who 's insecure , it 's a comedian who wo n't shut up about his audience.<br /><br />Then again , perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia 's comedy is that he does n't get off his free speech high horse . If you want to be funny , just make a joke , do n't explain all the reasons why you 're saving the American way with your failed attempts at generating laughter.<br /><br />Hmm ... actually ... the worst thing about Carlos Mencia 's comedy is that it substitues meanspirited jabs at ethnicities for legitimate humor . Avoid this like the plague .
0 As a Turkish man now living in Sweden I must confess I often watch Scandinavian movies . Most if them I never understand . I think actors from Scandinavia work best in Hollywood . Last week I watched a film called " The Polish Wedding " together with a polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched . Unfortunately I was wrong this movie " House of Angels " is even worse . None of the actors can act , absolutely not the female so called star Helen Bergstrom . The plot is so silly nobody can believe it . I think the whole thing is a mess from the start . lots of bad acting except from Selldal and Wollter . Ahmed Sellam
0 When I began watching The Muppets Take Manhattan , the choppy presentation and dialogue had me convinced I was watching something recent , so you can imagine my surprise when I came to the IMDb and read that it was made in 1984 . Jim Henson may have ended The Muppet Show when it was at its peak , but spin offs like this and Muppet Babies ( which apparently is based upon a very terrible sequence in this film ) are the absolute nadir of all things Muppet . I used to wonder why Muppets attracted such derision from such film reviewers as Mr. Cranky , so I am glad that The Muppets Take Manhattan ( henceforth : TMTM ) set me straight on that one . Of course , many series have had a massive drop off in quality when the third episode came around : Aliens , RoboCop , The Evil Dead , even Night Of The Living Dead . So while it is no surprise that TMTM is less than The Muppet Movie or The Great Muppet Caper , the surprise lies entirely in how much less than the awesome debut or its slightly lesser follow - up TMTM is . Not only is the music far less satisfying , the scenes that link it all together are utterly terrible.<br /><br />There are , of course , some redeeming and genuinely funny moments , but they are few and far between . The Swedish Chef is great in any scene he inhabits , so thank the spirit of small mercies that he appears in one sequence where his eccentricity is exploited to the fullest . The problem is that there are just no scenes that work . The story , such as it is , revolves around a Broadway musical Kermit is attempting to get produced . He goes through many trials and tribulations along the way , including the sneaking suspicion the viewer has that we have seen this all before . The biggest problem is that Kermit does not have a decent antagonist to work off this time . Charles Durning was cinematic gold as Doc Hopper , the proprietor of a fast food chain who wants to exploit Kermit for his business . Charles Grodin was dynamite as Nicky Holiday , a jewel thief the Muppets must fight in order to save Miss Piggy from a lifetime in prison . The saying is that a hero is only as good as his antagonist , and these two are at least half responsible for the greatness of the previous two films.<br /><br />Charles Grodin also highlights what is wrong with TMTM . Namely , the music sucks . The opening number of the Manhattan Melodies show that is at the centre of TMTM , to put it nicely , makes the drivel that now dominates the airwaves seem coordinated . I might just be letting my peculiar sensitivity to the sounds of words and phrases getting to me , but songs like The Rainbow Connection inspired tears of joy , not irritation . Grodin 's big solo during The Great Muppet Caper , while not having the same resonation , he lifts the tone of the film eight steps on his own . He is all class . And if there is one thing TMTM could use , it is rising eight steps in addition to attaining a semblance of class . TMTM also feels severely time - compressed , with the story leaping from scene to scene without any consideration for making sense or giving the story cohesion . Maddox himself pointed out that transition and cohesion make a film feel like a coherent whole rather than a mess of thrown - together pieces . See if you can find them in TMTM.<br /><br />While TMTM does have its guest stars , they are either poorly utilised ( Brooke Shields and John Landis ) , or totally out of their element ( Liza Minelli , Dabney Coleman ) . To call this a waste of time for puppeteer and actor alike is flattery . The absence of an end credits routine is especially sore here , after Animal 's " go home " postscript for The Muppet Movie in particular . Which highlights another problem . The characters are poorly written at best , with none of their individual quirks to be seen or heard . Animal shouts singular words at times , but they have nothing to do with the plot , or the conversation going on around him . Say what you will about set pieces designed to show off characters , but think of Animal 's moment after eating the instant growth pills , or his " sowwy " after the incident when he pulled the window down on top of his fellow Muppets . Now see if you can remember a single memorable moment with an individual Muppet other than Swedish Chef 's hilarious misunderstanding of three - dimensional film involving popcorn . Give up ? Then you have proved my point.<br /><br />Given that Labyrinth , one of the Henson company 's best and most timeless products outside of the Muppets , arrived some two years later , it makes TMTM all the more puzzling . Perhaps this misfire convinced Jim Henson to rethink his strategy regarding character development and usage . Or perhaps the misfire can be attributed to Frank Oz , who at the time had just finished working with George Lucas on what many would agree is the most childish episode in the original Star Wars saga . The writers were also involved with The Great Muppet Caper , so I will let them off the hook for this in spite of the fact that a script is one of the most essential pieces of a film . The production is also substantially improved here , with Muppets appearing capable of moving in ways that were previously beyond them . Had the story and script been better thought - out , TMTM might have been at least comparable to The Great Muppet Caper . As it stands now , it is a great answer to the question of whether Muppets write under the influence , or excrete.<br /><br />For that reason , I gave The Muppets Take Manhattan a three out of ten . Two to denote its actual quality , and a bonus for the Swedish Chef 's moments . Without him , this film would be unwatchable .
0 Scary .. Yes Scary ! ! Jam - packed with nudity ( from fat people to skinny people ) , Maslin Beach takes place on a nudist beach in S.A.<br /><br />I first saw this film two years ago - it 's safe to say it made a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day . This film was horrible ! Hardly a romantic comedy - just a showcase of nudity ! This movie hit its lowpoint with one of the new - age characters staring down between a girls legs.<br /><br />Girl : You 're not going to find God in there ! Guy : Nah , But I think I found heaven.<br /><br />Steer clear of this one , unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics such as farting , adultery and the process of superlguing one 's genitals together . AVOID !
0 The thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy , shaky , camera - work and the fast , confusing cutting . I am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh proof with most of their movies , but in this case there was WAY too much . It seems like the jump - cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over Mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable . The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end . For a movie that pretends to be violent , ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it 's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development . That is another disappointing aspect of the movie . If I want to watch an over the top action flick I do not need any justification , but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of Denzel Washington 's character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances . The first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clichés are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens . So the movie does not work either on the level of a believable drama / thriller , nor as a pure action movie . Of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years , but I absolutely can not understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool . For a video clip it is way too long and for a movie it has too little substance .
0 Do n't get me wrong , I love action and revenge flicks , I 've seen many of them since I was a kid , including Dolph Lundgren 's latest " The Mechanik " which is quite good . And Tony Scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing films.<br /><br />But with " Man on Fire " ( and even more then with " Domino " ) , Scott shows that rather than using his film - making " genius " skills intelligently , he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material does n't offer him . " Man of Fire " is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour less.<br /><br />The way Scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you ( the audience ) to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into it.<br /><br />At times where the MPAA and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings , violence and making PG-13 movies , I find also suspicious that a $ 70 million movie is made of a B - movie script with a character who cuts fingers , puts a bomb in a man 's ass and blows a guy 's hand with a shotgun , all this to avenge the death of a little girl who ISN'T even dead ! Go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or violence ... Thus said ...
0 Trust me , this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge Denzel Washington fan . The frustrating part is that it 's 1/3 of a GREAT film . The first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he 's paid to protect . The trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped . So , I 'm giving nothing away when I say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after she 's kidnapped . Whatever the director was trying to accomplish , all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally nauseous . Rapid , frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half - hour as Creasy tracks down the perpetrators . These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the story . I 'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in Creasy 's character and signified that a different movie was to follow . Well , he was right . The movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap . The result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie .
0 # # # Spoilers ! # # # < br /><br />What is this movie offering ? Out of control editing and cinematography that matches up with a terrible plot . It is sad to see Denzel Washington 's talents go wasted in trashes like this . We are certainly hinted how the Mexicans can not save themselves , outside forces needed , possibly militaristic , American ones . And we know the father is a shady character , he is a Mexican after all , unlike the wife who appreciates Creasey more because he is American . He killed all of them thinking she died . And did she ? Of course , she wo n't , she is a young kid and you are not supposed to hurt the sensibilities of the Hollywood fan . The trade off scene was the only thing that prevents me from rating it below the " implausibly successful"(as some critic pointed out)'Taken ' . The nausea of such movies will take time to go . It is in the rating of such movies that we have to doubt IMDb 's credulity.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for My Own Private Idaho . Go figure ! Mine will be in the range of 3.5 - 4.0
0 If this documentary had not been made by the famous French director , Louis Malle , I probably would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes , as it was an incredibly dull look at a very ordinary Midwestern American town in 1979 . This is not exactly my idea of a fun topic and the film footage closely resembled a collection of home movies . Considering I did n't know any of these people , it was even less interesting.<br /><br />Because it was a rather dull slice of life style documentary , I wondered while watching what was the message they were trying to convey ? Perhaps it was that values are n't as conservative as you might think -- this was an underlying message through many of the vignettes ( such as the Republicans whose son was a draft resister as well as the man and lady who thought sex outside of marriage was just fine ) . Or , perhaps the meaning was that there was a lot of bigotry underlying the nice home town -- as several ugly ideas such as blaming Jews for financial conspiracies , anti - Black bigotry and homophobia all were briefly explored.<br /><br />The small town of 1979 was explored in great depth and an idyllic sort of world was portrayed , but when the film makers returned six years later , the mood was depressed thanks to President Reagan . This seemed very disingenuous for several reasons . First , the 1979 portion was almost 90 % of the film and the final 10 % only consisted of a few interviews of people that blamed the president for just about everything but acne . What about the rest of the folks of this town ? Did they all see Reagan as evil or that their lives had become more negative ? With only a few updates , it seemed suspicious . Second , while it is true that the national debt doubled in the intervening years , so did the gross national product . And , while Malle shows 1979 as a very optimistic period , it was far from that , as the period from 1974 - 1980 featured many shortages ( gas , sugar , etc . ) , strikes , high inflation and general malaise . While I am not a huge fan of Reagan because government growth did NOT slow during his administration , the country , in general , was far more optimistic than it had been in the Ford and Carter years . While many in the media demonized Reagan ( a popular sport in the 80s ) , the economy improved significantly and the documentary seems very one - sided and agenda driven . Had the documentary given a more thorough coverage of 1985 and had n't seemed too negative to be believed ( after all , everyone did n't have their lives get worse -- this defies common sense ) , then I might have thought otherwise.<br /><br />Overall , not the wonderful documentary some have proclaimed it to be -- ranging from a dull film in 1979 to an extremely slanted look at 1985.<br /><br />By the way , is it just me , or does the film DROP DEAD GORGEOUS seem to have been inspired , at least in part , by this film ? Both are set in similar communities , but the latter film was a hilarious mockumentary without all the serious undertones .
0 I got this film from a private collector and was very curious about it . It had a 7,8 in IMDb ( 9 votes only ) and some external comments were pleasant . But I have to say that it is a very usual and uninteresting giallo . Yes , great cinematography , the film is well directed , but it never freaked me out . It starts well , but although it not bored me at all , the story is so ordinary and the things that occur so normal , that I did n't like it very much.<br /><br />You can make a few laughs . And you can see some little tits . But if you like the kind of giallos I like ( bizarre , surreal , nonsenseful , gory , atmospheric , brutal murders ... ) you wo n't appreciate much this film.<br /><br />I give it a 4 for the good directing and editing , and the final twists , that make the film entertaining . But it could be much better .
0 This movie does not really promote kids to be nicer and have better attitudes , as a family movie should , and this would n't be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children should n't be seeing . Not the best ABC Family film if you ask me . If there were less sexual themes in the movie , then maybe it would be better . Hollywood is n't doing anything to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations . There 's really no reason for them . At least this is a TV movie . I would n't want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it . If you have other things to do other than watch this movie , please proceed to them .
0 with this ABC family attempt of the hit blockbuster " cheaper by the dozen " comes an obnoxious amount of corny dialogue , shallow plot lines , and cheesy comebacks . With about two good actors among many wanna - be 's , this movie was a major disappointment . Its a Hollywood - wannabe ditto of an already bad plot . Then , because they needed a lot of actors , that meant that they 'd probably be more lenient . So the acting was n't five - star . The plot moved fairly fast , and the twists were bad and had horrible timing . The junction of characters and the " end relationships " were also too mushy and clichéd for me . Spare yourself and rent something better .
0 I usually comment only on movies that I like , figuring " everyone to his / her own taste , " but here I want to make an exception . The premise of this movie , which somehow seems to get lost in the shuffle , is that these two self - centered adults have a perfect right to go off to Las Vegas , get drunk , get married , and inflict incalculable suffering upon their respective broods of children . Even allowing for the culturally sanctioned inebriation , they have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and undo what they have set in motion . After all , " love " is all that 's important , is n't it ? To hell with everybody else . Whether or not things " work out in the end " is really not the point ; in fact it 's quite irrelevant . The point is that disrespect for others , especially if they are young persons , and especially if they are in a position of dependency , is made light of and thereby reinforced by this movie . There are far more innocuous behaviors these " parents " could have performed that would have brought down an army of social workers on their heads in a heartbeat .
0 I simply give this a three because it fulfilled what my buddies and I hoped it would do : entertain . < br /><br />I was n't stupid enough to rent this thinking it would be a zombie film up there with the likes of Romero or Fulci , but what I rented it for was a laugh . < br /><br />If you are looking for a film for amusement , or a film to make you shake your head in embarrassment , go for it . This is perfect for junior- " Mystery Science Theater " fans , but the only downside is that it is so bad , it makes fun of itself . < br /><br />I , personally , think it is a shame to relate this to any other Hollywood title that we may know , because when a film sucks like this , it has its own genre .
0 The first mistake you make in titling a film is to use " of the living dead " without really having a budget for real zombie FX . Sure , this was a low budget zombie flick - really low budget . I thought it was a film school project . Amateur actors and amateur effects.<br /><br />It was really not too bad considering the above , and it presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre . If you are going to get an " R " for violence , you might as well give us some good shots of the babes being attacked . The women were so little used in this film that it could almost be classified as " gay interest." < br /><br />And , I am staying out of Oakland . There was a heck of a lot of shooting going on and no cops in sight !
0 This was without a doubt the worst thing I have ever spent money on . I feel dirty for admitting that I rented this ' movie ' and actually paid money to see it . This does not even rate trash . No no . This is the juice that collects at the bottom of industrial dumpsters located in particularly foul neighborhoods after an extraordinarily humid summer . To call it trash would be to degrade trash everywhere . It was so bad I felt I had to register at IMDb and warn my fellow man . This luvahire character claims this movie is great . One has to question his grasp on reality . Let 's take some of his comments and analyze them.<br /><br />"The actor who played Ricky ( I forgot his name ) did a VERY good job." < br /><br />I see . Well , if the director envisioned his audience cringing and wincing at every sentence uttered by Ricky or alternately bursting into uncontrollable laughter at moments when most directors would want a more somber reaction from their viewers , then yes ; Ricky did an outstanding job.<br /><br />"I'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and I had to do a play where I had to cry and it 's not easy to be emotional in a scene so I give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off." < br /><br />Wow . I too must give props to actors who can pull off emotional scenes . Luvahire , you may want to look into another line of work there buddy if you think these chuckleheads pulled it off . Still , they can help you if you need to practice crying . Just watch the movie . ha . ha . ha . < br /><br />"BRING ON THE SEQUEL" < br /><br />If I was your theater teacher at school I 'd fail you based solely on this comment alone.<br /><br />I am too disgusted to continue . I shall now turn over the movie bashing to my associate , Mr. Bangla . < br /><br />Howdy ! If you 've continued to read this far , I take it for granted that you 've already seen the movie , and you 're now looking for one of two things in this comment : 1 ) Additional vitriolic debasement of what you agree was an exceptionally poor movie . 2 ) Additional vitriolic debasement of what you feel was a good cinematic effort which needs defending against such libelous scum as myself . Whether you want help articulating your disgust or ammunition for a stirring repartee , if I say anything good it 'll only disappoint you -- so let me assure you , there is little chance of such disappointment . < br /><br />The other negative comments here at IMDb have already enumerated the particular failings of the movie ( e.g. the acting , the soundtrack , the directing , the dialogue , the editing , etc . ) , however all of these faults can readily be forgiven , in and of themselves . Few people will rent a movie titled " Hood of the Living Dead " if they require these elements to be top - notch . The ultimate failure of " Hood " , however , is its failure to deliver on the abundant promise of its name . " Hood of the Living Dead " practically leaps off the shelf at the video store with its implications of corny one - liners and gruesomely creative kills . Here was a chance to mix the cheesy gore of the zombie movie with the realism of life in the ghetto , to have gangsta - thug zombies bombin ' on the innocent living while rockin ' do - rags , to have undead pimps drivin ' over all - too - mortal po - lice in their tricked - out rides . The mixture of the two genres could have been hilarious . Instead , the movie is more like watching middle school kids timidly deliver the lines to a play they are performing , but do n't understand . To avoid a feeling of betrayal on the part of their video - rental audience , I suggest that the Quiroz brothers re - release the movie with the following new title : " Hood of the Living Dead : A home - made horror video we shot on our camcorder with some friends over a weekend last summer because we were bored " . Or perhaps they could release it as a documentary . " The Day Creativity Died : An exploration of how a low budget movie can still be perfectly devoid of clever or original thought despite lacking ties to a major motion picture studio . " < br /><br />The potential renter whose interest has not been quelled , should find the following blurb on the back of the video case : " The Quiroz Brothers have proved once again that watching things which you can easily do yourself is not very interesting ."-- Mr . Bangla
0 2 stars , and I 'm being generous . ( minor spoilers ) Look , this is a low budget zombie movie set in gangland Oakland . As the plot goes , a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a drive - by.<br /><br />The main problem with this movie : what zombies ? ! All the " zombies " do is growl ( which does n't sound even remotely scary ) and drip fake red blood from their mouths ! No scary eyes , no decaying flesh , just a bunch of people growling pathetically and running around like idiots.<br /><br />The cover is also misleading . There are only about 6 zombies in the whole film , so it 's not like the whole " hood " is plagued with zombies or anything , it 's just a few , and is contained in no time.<br /><br />The acting actually is so bad it 's hilarious . No one can act at all in this movie ( except maybe one of the gang members ) and it really seems like a bunch of friends got together , decided to cast their family , and made a movie one weekend.<br /><br />Final note : since when do Doctors wear tracksuits ? ! Skip this one , please !
0 ... you know the rest . If you want a good zombie movie , DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE . If you want a documentary - esquire look at " hood life " you 're at the wrong place as well . If you 're looking for a laughable piece of film , this is a real winner ! The acting is as flat as a piece of paper . The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive - by . I can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the flat tone of his voice . If I could hear a cardboard box talk , it 'd probably sound like this guy . Oh yea , and the " zombies " did their best snake impression which is on par with their FANTASTIC acting overall ( note sarcasm ... HOW DID THIS NOT WIN AN Oscar FOR BEST MAKE - UP ) The Quiroz ...... did not do any sort of directing . I felt like I was watching an improvisational period piece ( the period is more like 1990 's LA ) The direction is however one - uped by the worst script I think to ever grace a movie . I have n't heard such lovely lines , like the epic one word beginning to the movie " F**k ! " , since Ice Grill which was another " urban " thriller . This only works of course in conjunction with the also - epic hip - hop soundtrack ! All 3 or so songs of it ! All in all , what the hell did you expect from a movie entitled " Hood of the Living Dead " ? I rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene , and boy it delivered and MORE ! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror ( yea right ... ) movie for the night . A memorable experience for sure !
0 I happened to spot this flick on the shelf under " new releases " and found the idea of a hip - hop zombie flick far too interesting to pass up . That 's how it was billed on the box , anyhow , and I thought to myself , " What a great idea ! " Plus there 's a " Welcome to Oakland " sign on the cover , too . How could I resist ? Unfortunately , the hip - hop part only lasted for as long as the opening theme . Neither hip - hop music nor hip - hop culture had much of a role in the movie . Having lived in Oakland myself , I know that there are many aspiring hip - hop artists there , so the low budget of this flick was no excuse not to have a fitting soundtrack . Any number of struggling artists would have jumped on the opportunity to contribute to this flick . Why the Quiroz Brothers did n't take advantage of this is beyond me.<br /><br />Once the film got rolling , it was a completely typical zombie movie with a cast that just so happened to be completely black and Latino . You might think that this would put an unusual slant on the movie ... but it did n't . Somehow , the Quiroz Brothers vision of " urban culture " boils down to drive - by shootings and dropping an F - bomb in every line in the movie . The rapid - fire use of the word " fuck " is probably this movie 's most distinguishing characteristics ; there were single lines that contained the word three or four times , and no line did n't contain it at least once . I 'm not at all squeamish about swearing in a movie , but the feeling here was that it was the result of a lack of ideas on the part of the writers ( also the Quiroz Brothers ) , and the script was generally very poor.<br /><br />The film was generally a disappointment . It would have been interesting to see a genuinely " urban culture " zombie flick , but " Hood of the Living Dead " does n't deliver on that count . The characters in the movie could just as easily have been white or eskimo or anything else . There was no distinct flavor to the movie . It 's just another run - of - the - mill low budget flick with bad acting , lousy writing , amateurish direction , bland cinematography , a cheap soundtrack , and nothing at all to recommend it .
0 * May Contain Spoilers * A few weeks after I had originally wrote my review for Hood of the Living Dead I realized that I may have been a bit too harsh on this movie . Which is why I decided I would do something I had never done before . Review the same movie again . Do n't get me wrong , I still do n't like the movie , I still think it 's dreck , and I still think the zombies do n't look all that zombie - ish . The story in the movie is still in my opinion , weak and rather lame . The story is about a guy named Rick , who works as a scientist ( that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells , in animals ) and his brother Germaine , the two are n't exactly on the best of terms ( my my , an original plot point ) and argue a lot . One day Germaine is shot in a drive - by shooting , and Rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate Germaine(whereas most people would 've called 911 , but whatever ) , naturally the serum fails and Germaine " dies " ( if that did n't happen there 'd have been no movie ) , after the police and the coroner ( until the end of time I will still think that maybe the paramedics should 've shown up ) leave the scene shows the coroner van ( which I still believe was just someone 's van with a " coroner " decal thrown on the side ) , and Germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics . I would talk more about the plot , but I feel that if I reveal more about the story you would n't want to watch it ( and we would n't want that now would we ? ) , but suffice to say that the story ( in my opinion at least ) meanders and is rather slow moving ( pun not intended ) . As I 've previously said in my review the zombies do n't look all that much like zombies , I still think they look like they 've been in a bar fight . That 's not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot , but still there should at least be bite marks on the victims . Also I still do n't like the fact that the director(s ) continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move . They could n't really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble ( as most zombie movies do ) , do n't get me wrong , I 'm all for running zombies but make up your minds people . In one scene the zombie runs toward the living , and in the other he just shambles to them . And sometimes they just do n't seem believable ( yes I know their fictitious creatures but still ) , I am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room , and I still do n't like the zombie who is lying on the ground , gets shot , then jerks like he was just shot . The sound in the movie also bothered me , mainly the music , which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much non - existent . Music in a movie is important folks . Especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick . The acting is still atrocious ( in my opinion ) and is on par with the American " actors " from the Japanese zombie movie Junk . The movie is still bad , almost House of the Dead bad , it 's better , no doubt about that , but then again that 's not saying much . It 's not the worst movie out there , and it is better than a lot of direct to video movies that are out there but at the end of the day was n't good . I also think the movie moves really really slow , despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes ( and yes , I still do n't like the opening song ) . This is the type of movie I think is well - suited to be premiered on the Sci - Fi network . Which is why I am obligated to give this debacle of a film a one out of ten . But think of it this way , at least it 's not a negative one .
0 This movie is yet another in the long line of no budget , no effort , no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video store.<br /><br />If you want to know what watching this movie is like , grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and " attacking " people . Congratulations , you 've just made " Hood of the Living Dead " ! Now see if a distribution company will buy it from you.<br /><br />I have seen some low budget , shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort , but this has neither . Avoid unless you are a true masochist or are amused by poorly made horror movies .
0 Hood of the living Dead is about a young scientist named Rick who lives with his brother in the town of Oklahoma where drug dealers and prostitutes fill the streets . Then one night , Rick 's brother gets shot by a gang driving down the street who fought with him earlier . Desperate , Rick calls his scientist partner to bring over the latest formula they 've been working on that brings sick blood cells to health . The formula has n't been tested on a human , or even a dead body but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life . He gives the body a double dose of the formula but nothing happens . So Rick calls 911 and the body is carted away only for it to come back to life and feast on human flesh . Now Rick must find his zombie brother before the whole hood is transformed into a neighborhood of the dead . Hood of the living Dead is one piece of trash . The plot is a direct rip off of Resident Evil , the acting is just horrible especially with Rick ' s fake crying for his brother , the guns are so fake because every time the weapon is fired it sends sparks out , and the make up is just lame . It 's only fake blood covered over the actors face . The zombies are also modified . They run , growl , and must be shot in the heart to die ! Zombies should only scuffle , moan , and must be shot in the brain to die ! This film is so horrible , the outtakes is the only true good moment of this film . Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10 , a little entertainment here and there but it only succeeds as a low budget cringe fest .
0 Hood of the Living Dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored ( lines are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing ) . I find that 95 % of amateur movies and 90 % of home video footage is better than this film ( although the similarities between them warrant the comparison ) . " Hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies ! " . Hopefully nobody ELSE was n't . My apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is somewhat harsh but i was the dope who read your fake reviews and purchased the movie .
0 It was a painful experience , the whole story is actually there so I wo n't go into that but the acting was horrible there is this part in the very beginning when the scientist brother goes to work he actually wears a white coat at home before leaving to work , I thought working with biohazard material meant that you should wear sterilized clothes in a controlled environment and the lab itself looks like a school lab there is this monitor on top a file cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene its just there to make the place look technical and a scientist is actually having breakfast in the lab and next to him is a biohazard labeled jar and his boss walks in on him and does n't even tell him anything about it ... not to mentioned bad acting very bad ca n't get any worst than that my advice do n't watch and I thought nothing could be worse than house of the dead apparently Uwi Boll 's movies look like classical Shakespeare compared to this !
0 This movie is about a young scientist who creates a serum that re - animates the dead . He first uses it on his brother when he is shot dead in a drive by . His brother then infects the other gang members . In some scenes the zombies are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast which makes little sense . The acting is mediocre but the story does n't help the film . The makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies . The budget for this film I 'm sure was very limited . I believe the film could have been better made had the story been more original and with a better budget . If you wan't to see a good zombie flick do n't see this one .
0 I watched this today , partially attracted to the all - star cast and partly because I have enjoyed so many other films of this ilk . However , this is one to avoid . There are dozens of badly cut scenes where the continuity just does not flow , the billiards challenge at the start , for example . The fighting scenes with the natives are about as good as you would remember in those old black and white Tarzan movies , you know where you see a spear fly through the air and camera cuts to a dead native lying motionless on the floor with it sticking from his thigh . Is that instantaneous death ? There are also several quite unnecessary scenes which have nothing to do with the plot , like the little girl being rescued while collecting flowers . The really badly animated clay toys are too painful to watch . If you do see this movie the crabs which inch forward at about 5kph are the highlight . Somehow one manages to creep up on David Mccullum and give him a nip . Its as if there was no time to get out of the way , like when the obelisk in the city falls over , the native has all the time in the world to take a 2 step to the left , but no he screams and it falls on him . I only give this a 2 because of Ekland . And why does Mccullums voice develop a stutter as the movie progresses ?
0 From the mind of Harry Alan Towers comes another piece of cinematic sludge . Supposedly based on the work of H. Rider Haggard , the only similarity it bears to anything Haggard actually wrote is that it takes place in Africa ( albeit an Africa that has dinosaurs - which our intrepid adventurers use to pull their canoes ! ) , and has some characters with the same names.<br /><br />Our heroes ( David McCallum , Patrick McNee and John Colico ) set out to seek treasure , armed only with a medallion , and end up precisely where the treasure is , purely by chance . On the way , they meet a motley assortment of extremely lame monsters , pick up a French chef , and McCallum has an affair with the Queen of Phoenicia.<br /><br />It 's so ridiculous , it 's a hoot . That 's the only reason I did n't give it a 1 .
0 This movie deserved a working over on Mystery Science Theater . Even though it has nothing whatever to do with King Solomon it 's worth a watch because it is an unintentional laugh - riot . Really ! It 's worse than " Destroy All Monsters . " Be sure to check out the following : the cheesy medallion ( looks like the Shriners have been here ) , the obviously polyester Norfolk jacket on " Allan Quatermain , " David MaCallum 's badly done stutter ( which does draw attention away from his even worse acting ) , the incredibly bad process work on all the " monsters , " the monsters themselves - the hand puppet which menaces the little girl , the giant snake that menaces Macallum while he sinks in oatmeal , the red - lighted eyes on the motorized crabs , the amazingly hilarious boat ( oh , brother ! ! ) which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a leftover from a Jr . Sr . prom ( " Voyage into the Future with the class of ' 71 " ) , the Phoenician city - where they wear Roman Imperial armor but which inexplicably has Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions -(the Phoenicians invented the alphabet - come on!),and worst of all , Macallum and Ekland ( with her fright wig ) playing smoochy - face -oh the horror ! The best parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic Frenchman , and the African guy -Snuffleupagus or whatever - evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in any more scenes .
0 Man , was I disappointed.<br /><br />1 ) Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller from ' Friends ' < br /><br />2 ) A great cast is wasted ( Kenneth Mars , Alan Arkin , Ed McMahon , Pat Morita , Louis Nye ) with this amateurish script.<br /><br />3 ) The movie suffers from horrible pacing . It jumps around through in a jumbled , confusing manner.<br /><br />4 ) The story does n't even make sense . Why does he want to break the football streak ? What about the stupid violin music ? None of it is explained.<br /><br />5 ) It 's not even funny . It 's like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv , saying " Lookit me ! Lookit me I 'm being funny ! " This was a bad attempt at making another " Love At First Bite".<br /><br />I like Larry Cohen movies , but man he failed here . I could n't wait for the credits to roll . Horribly disappointed .
0 Whack ! ! ! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it . I was disappointed to find out she was in like two short scenes towards the end . Other than that I was basically hitting the fast forward button the entire time . Some teenager goes on a trip to Romania with his Dad and gets bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if there 's a full moon . He kills his father and friends . About 30 years past but he does n't age a bit and enrolls in a high school . There he meets a shy teacher whom he ends up biting and then has kids with her . This movie sucked and I do n't recommend it to anyone . Read War and Peace instead . Only Ms. Hartman did a great job . Check out a very young Bob Saget in this one ! !
0 A surprising misfire from the usually reliable Larry Cohen ( God Told Me Too , Q , etc . ) , Full Moon High tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably , even with decent turns by Ed McMahon ( ! ) and Kenneth Mars . Alan Arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance and son Adam simply looks numb . This makes Teen Wolf look like a comedy classic .
0 I 've seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time , this one however , takes the cake . More comedy than horror , " Full Moon High " puts the " c " in cheese - fest . The star quality in this movie is not bad . Just the way it was made just sends in rolling downhill . Adam Arkin plays Tony , an all - American high school football player of the 50 's who ends up not aging due to a werewolf bite in Transylvania . The most annoying part of the movie was the violin player . He drove everyone batty ! Ed McMahon plays his ultra - conservative father who met his end of his own bullet . Adam 's father Alan plays a shrink who seems to be not top of his game . After all these years Tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack , and then he 'll get the chance to catch in his state . More laugh than blood shed , this movie is just a start in the 80 's , " Teen Wolf " was an improvement from this ! 1 out of 5 stars .
0 No , this was n't one of the ten worst films of the 1980 's , but it certainly skirts the bottom 100 somewhere . This movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981 . How else would you explain special effects pre - dating " An American Werewolf in London , " disco still being considered cool , and Ronald Reagan not being the 40th President of the United States ? While we 're at it , let 's not overlook those 1970 's hairstyles in the 1950 's and ' 60 's . I 've seen more of that here than in " Happy Days " & " Laverne & Shirley " combined.<br /><br />The one woman who elevates this movie to the " so bad , it 's good " category was the late , great Elizabeth Hartman , but just barely . Biff plays as Miss Montgomery , the mousey high school teacher who becomes a sexpot , a stereotype that 's been done to death and is still being churned out by Hollywood today , but even as a " hot chick " she retains her mousey qualities . Her call for help is evidence of this . She also looks much better as Miss Wimp . " Seven bucks at the beauty parlor , shot to hell . " She was n't kidding.<br /><br />This is n't to say that there are n't any good parts elsewhere , they 're just few and far between , and I 'm not just saying that because I like Hartman . Incidentally , " Teen Wolf " was better than this . " Teen Wolf Too " was better than this , and that was n't even so good.<br /><br / >
0 What is this ? ! Is it a comedy , a horror movie or just nothing ? ? This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen . Especially the scene in romania when he becomes the werewolf , that must be the worst scene that has ever been made . This movie is n't funny , it is n't scary and not entertaining at all . Please do yourself ( and me , i do n't think anyone should suffer through this movie ) a favour and DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE ! ! If you get is a present , just throw it away and chop it in to pieces .
0 Being a fan of movies like " Fire Sale " , " Where 's Poppa " , " Airplane " I saw this because it was mentioned favorably in the context of real comedies and satires like the aforementioned . Well , WRONG CONCLUSION!<br /><br />Not only is this not funny , it makes you angry because it is n't bad in a schlocky , likable way but in a really bad way . It 's bad - bad . The script does not contain a single funny line which is rather in the way when you 're trying to entertain your audience with humour.<br /><br />Adam Arkin 's speech impediment is probably the single most annoying thing in this movie . Still this cruelty of nature does n't prevent him from being smug throughout the movie and he has a hard time not looking into the camera . This amateur without charisma fits in nicely with the constant continuity errors and bumbling along of the story - if you can find one.<br /><br />Ed McMahon - I had to think of Jay Leno , another late night talk show person , who always refuses to call himself an actor . Well , I 've seen a few Leno movies and he 's Laurence Olivier compared to McMahon.<br /><br />Kenneth Mars is good , though . In the few lines that he 's given . I 'm not easily frightened by bad comedies so I kept watching and looking for all the quasi - jokes every 5 minutes or so.<br /><br />The movie actually becomes sort of a comedy as soon as Alan Arkin takes over - he literally does : Starting 75 minutes into the movie he 's in every scene . But it 's too little , too late.<br /><br />When movies try to fool you into believing their lack of professionalism is the reason you 're supposed to like them because they have the right intentions they remind me of pupils that have n't prepared for an exam . In those cases you have to remain strict and the grade has to be an ' F ' . ( But please do n't assume I 'm a teacher . That is a profession with a respectability somewhere between politician and child molester).<br /><br />If you actually look for a likable schlocky horror / scifi movie that is fun to watch and does contain jokes try " Man with the Screaming Brain " by Bruce Campbell . Or watch Sunshine / Core if you prefer modern loud shallow SciFi Schlock . Those are equally funny , albeit involuntarily .
0 Nicolas Roeg ? He directed the classic supernatural thriller DON`T LOOK NOW didn`t he ? Strangely the aforementioned movie was broadcast on BBC television at the weekend which did tonight`s screening of COLD HEAVEN no favours what so ever . < br /><br />You see it`s impossible not to compare COLD HEAVEN with DON`T LOOK NOW since they both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of COLD HEAVEN I thought they also had the same plot except a dead husband had been substituted instead of a dead child , in fact my mind was set on this movie revolving around a grief stricken widow seeing her late husband running around Venice wearing a red anorak . This doesn`t occur but about one third of the way through the running time there`s a massive plot twist and despite being an essential plot twist it`s not explained in any great depth . In fact very little is explained in COLD HEAVEN which ruins the movie < br /><br />People have mentioned the rather poor production values of COLD HEAVEN and it`s impossible not to notice them . If I didn`t no different I would have thought this was a TVM since it`s got a made for television feel to it right down to white capital letters in the title sequence . Roeg also tries to inject art house pretentions via spoken thought processes but again this doesn`t help the movie at all . One can`t help feeling Roeg should have put all his effort into the plot twists which are totally flat on screen < br /><br />Cheap production values , disinterested directing and a really bizarre premise and screenplay make for a bad movie
0 Just saw this movie on TV and I have to admit , I was a bit surprised it was even on . There were so many goofs , mess - ups , and bad editing that an old episode of Sesame Street would have been better to watch . The acting was OK , but please , you can really feel the " Straight to Video " feeling . The cast / crew made this movie a bad melodrama . Yes , there is a message in the movie , but just wait until ten minutes before the ending to hear it . Trust me , you would n't even tell the difference .
0 Could this be by the same director as Do n't Look Now or Bad Timing ? Poorly < br /><br />acted , clunkily edited . You only have to compare the various accident scenes in this with similar ones in Do n't Look Now to see how much Roeg has lost his < br /><br />touch.<br /><br />Even the generally reliable Teresa Russell ( looking a bit chunky these days , I 'm afraid to report ) can not save this one . The plot is pure pseudo - religious hokum , the acting is wooden and Roeg 's attempts at his trademark dislocation of time are pitiful.<br /><br />Avoid this one like the plague .
0 This movie was strange ... I watched it while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis ( mushrooms ) . It was really weird . I m pretty sure you are supposed to watch it high , but mushrooms were n't enough . I could n't stop laughing .. maybe lsd would work . The movie is a bunch of things morphing into other things , and dancing . Its really cheesy for todays standards but when it was released i m sure it was well ... one of a kind . I could see how some people would think this movie was good , but I did n't think it was very interesting , and I was on mushrooms at the time . If your having a party or something and everybodys pretty lit , pop it on you 'll get a few laughs .
0 I read Tom Robbins ' EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES as a teenager . I loved every word . It was sexy , funny , and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing . But when I saw the movie , I could not believe what a dull , sour , joyless piece of junk it was . How did this happen ? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under " GAY PRIDE -- WOMEN -- LESBIANS . " ( That 's the Library of Congress subject heading . ) Now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know it has NOTHING TO DO with real lesbians , any more than STAR WARS is about real space travel . The book was obviously -- and I do mean OBVIOUSLY --written by a heterosexual male who loves the IDEA of lesbians ( in the nude , all the time)but has never really met one.<br /><br />Still , someone in Hollywood said , " uh oh , better give this to a Gay director or Gay People will make trouble . " So they handed it to Gus Van Sant . Nothing against the man , but -- however Gay he may really be -- he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film . Gus Van Sant took a straight man 's playful fantasy of guilt - free girl / girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull , literal - minded Lesbian Power Recruiting Poster . It 's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy . Not pretty.<br /><br />The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting . His clout allowed him to hire the very best . His ignorance of the novel 's real subtext ( a straight man 's fantasy , not a gay pride recruiting poster)caused him to make choices that were not only bad , but bizarre.<br /><br />Let 's meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES.<br /><br />PAT MORITA as " THE CHINK " Okay , there are few name - recognition Asian actors . And Pat Morita , in HAPPY DAYS , was fairly funny . But casting him as THE CHINK was wrong , wrong , wrong . Pat Morita has no idea that the Chink is a very funny man . ( Gus did n't tell him . ) Pat also does n't seem to know that the Chink is . . . well , SEXY ! ! ! In the book he 's not wise old Mr. Miyagi . He 's more like Hugh Hefner ! He 's a randy old goat and he knows A LOT about pleasing the nubile and responsive Sissy AND Bonanza Jellybean . ( You see , in the book , they are n't REALLY lesbians . Do you get that this is a straight man 's fantasy yet ? ) < br /><br />JOHN HURT as " THE COUNTESS . " Okay , he 's a gay friendly man . But he is a SERIOUS , SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR ! ! ! ! You need someone who is fun , and camp , for this role . For John Hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the Countess is tragic and sad . I kept expecting Paul Scofield to wander in all dressed up as Thomas More , and sadly shake his head . " Now , Richard , you know you 've lost your soul entirely . For shame , my former student ! " And yes , John Hurt was funny ( and pretty gay ) as Caligula . But that was BLACK humor , not playful and breezy humor like the book.<br /><br />RAIN PHOENIX as " Bonanza Jellybean . " No talent , no training , no problem . Except that in the book Bonanza is funny , playful , cheerful , ( mostly ) heterosexual , and loving . In the movie she 's sullen , passive , expressionless , and dull . As for her taste for women , Robbins in the book puts it like this . " God knows I love women , but nothing can take the place of a man that fits . " Uh , Gus ? Did you read this book ? < br /><br />UMA THURMAN as " Sissy Hankshaw . " This is a tough role . In the book Sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine . Still , a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye , or a sway in her walk , to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures . Uma does n't pull it off , probably because Gus never told her Sissy is supposed to ENJOY being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs . Uma plays it more like she 's in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukemia . < br /><br />This movie is sour and dull . And I accuse YOU , Gus Van Sant !
0 We actually watched this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time . Maybe we 'd missed something ... nope , what 's missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction . I actually went back to Robbin 's novel to see if I could find the problem , and I discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzy - headed junk.<br /><br />So , the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all , and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there . Absolutely nothing works - not a blessed thing . Some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots . All of the actors look at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positively mortified - except for Rain Phoenix , who gives the impression that she is too unaware to realize how awful her performance really is . The dialog is one , long , unwavering cringe . Scenes do n't make sense from second to second , and the connections between them are nonexistent . And yet , the movie stumbles blindly on , convinced that it is saying something profound.<br /><br />This is too bad to even be funny ; it is simply excruciating . Gus Van Zant has done other good - to - great movies which I encourage you to see , and I 'm happy he survived ( and appears to have learned from ) this mess .
0 I love movies . I love independent efforts and major studio productions . I love films with stars and I love those featuring unknowns . I love dramas , comedies , action - adventures , science fiction , mysteries , westerns , any genre except horror . I love foreign films as well as those in English . I love good movies and I even love bad ones , because almost no film ever fails to entertain or amuse on some level . Except for " Even Cowgirls Get the Blues." < br /><br />When I attended a late - night showing of " Cowgirls , " I joined an audience of around 10 . Less than halfway into it , I alone remained . Soon not even I could tolerate the disturbing mess unfolding before my eyes , and I left as well . To this day " Cowgirls " remains the only movie I have ever walked out of.<br /><br />I do n't quite know how to describe this incoherent , vacuous , trashy , meaningless film , or how to adequately convey its lack of redeeming value . Suffice to say that it ranks as one of the worst major films of all time , preposterous and inexcusable on every level . It tries to be clever , but its conception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic . It tries to be funny , but its humor is coarse and cringe - worthy . This is one of the few films which manages to profane its own ethos , by depicting protagonists in so off - putting a manner that you revolt against them and their values . If you want to watch a movie , watch " Waterworld , " " Ishtar , " anything but this . Except for the new " Alexander . " If you 're choosing between that and this , read a book instead .
0 I absolutely love all of Tom Robbins books , so I was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of his books . I knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of Robbins ' magic , but after seeing the movie , it made me never want to read the book again . The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does n't include an eighth of the content in the book , and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else . Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie , I think that better actors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters . The only actors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins ' descriptions in the book were Julian 's friends , in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie . Those who have n't read the book might enjoy the movie , but as a huge Tom Robbins fan , this movie was nothing but a disappointment .
0 Uma Thurman plays Sissy , a young woman with a gypsy spirit ( and freakishly large thumbs ) who hitchhikes cross - country , eventually finding her true place amongst a group of peyote - enlightened cowgirls on a ranch devoted to preserving the Whooping Crane ; Rain(bow ) Phoenix is their lesbian leader , Bonanza Jellybean , who falls in love with Sissy , thumbs or not . Gus Van Sant directed and adapted Tom Robbins ' book , but his satire has no primary target and just skitters all over the map , like Sissy ( maybe that was his goal , but it 's not involving for an audience ) . Notorious box - office flop was n't so much panned as it was ignored , and one can see why : it 's a series of sketches in search of a plot , and the performances , directorial touches and cinematography are all variable . Thurman is a stitch posing alongside the highway trying to get a ride , but this pretty much put the kibosh on Phoenix 's career . Writer Buck Henry ( who did n't write this , but perhaps should have ) gives the most assured performance as the doctor who works on one of those thumbs.<br /><br />Two thumbs down .
0 No one should ever try to adapt a Tom Robbins book for screen . While the movie is fine and the performances are good , the dialogue , which works well reading it , is crap when spoken . Or , to put it another way , no one would be likely to suggest that hearing someone else 's name was like seeing it written in radium on a pearl.<br /><br />Overall , the movie feels like a badly - adapted Cliffs Notes to the book - most of the parts have been hacked down to a fifth of their size in the book , in terms of backstory and current story , and the ending is wildly ( and unpleasantly ) different from that of the book . Most of the plots from the book have gotten lost , including the one that makes everything make sense at the end , and there 's more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say " Huh ? " Not a worthy effort , unfortunately - the script should have been read , compared to the book , burned , and all the actors sent off to do something far better . I admire Gus Van Sant tremendously , but not even someone of his calibre could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries .
0 I could n't believe how lame & pointless this was . Basically there is nothing to laugh at in the movie , hardly any scenes to get you interested in the rest of the movie . This movie pulled in some huge stars but they were all wasted in my opinion . I think Keanu Reeves must 've taken some acting lessons a fews years after this movie before he stared in The Matrix . Uma Thurman looked very simple & humble . Luckily i got this movie for a very low price because its certainly not a movie to remember for any good reasons . I wo n't write anything about the story of the movie , but as you should know that she is meant to be the most famous hitchhiker across America because of her huge thumb . I would give this movie a 2 / 10 . Before I watched this movie I was wondering why this movie has only got a 4.0/10 , & now I know why . A very disappointing movie . Do n't buy it even if you see it for under $ 5 .
0 I missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look , so when I saw it on the shelves in DVD I thought " time to watch it " . Big mistake!<br /><br />A long list of stars can not save this turkey , surely one of the worst movies ever . An incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented . Perhaps it would have made more sense if I 'd read Robbins ' novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel , and with Robbins assisting in the screenplay I doubt it , the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well.<br /><br />I hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately DVD blanks , take for example Pat Morita . Even Thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times.<br /><br />Save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile , like trimming your toenails or sorting out your sock drawer . Even when you see it in the " under $ 5 " throw - away bin at your local store , resist the urge !
0 I watched this film because I 'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix . I thought I would give their sister a try , Rain Phoenix . I regret checking it out . She was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if that s what you want to call it . Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains , what s going on ? I have never been so unsatisfied in my life . It was just total rubbish . I ca n't believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film , money , time and space . Have Sissy being ' beautiful ' did nt get to me . I thought she was everything but that . Those thumbs were just stupid , and why do we care if she can hitchhike ? WHATS THE POINT ? ? ? 0 out of 10 , shame the poll does nt have a 0 , does nt even deserve a 1 . Hopefully , Rain is better in other films , I forgive her for this one performance , I mean I would nt do much better with that film .
0 Certainly one of the dozen or so worst movies ever released in any form , featuring a bizarrely abominable performance by Rain Joan of Arc Phoenix ( River 's sister , inevitably ) , as Bonanza Jellybean plus inconceivably awful voiceover narration by Tom Robbins , the author of the novel , which had / retains its peculiar sweet / loopy charms .
0 This is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime . Cool title , excellent director ( I saw " To Die For " and " Drugstore Cowboy " before this ) , and hey - Uma Thurman in the cast . How can you go wrong ? Well , that is a question that throbbed in my temples for hours after I watched this turkey.<br /><br />Disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat , this is a dead - zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs . Its critical lambasting was well deserved . You have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality . Zero out of * * * * .
0 There are movies like " Plan 9 " that are so bad they have a charm about them , there are some like " Waterworld " that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident , and there are some like " Desperate living " that you hate to admit you love . Cowgirls have none of these redemptions . The cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable , and from what I 've been told , the book is enjoyable.<br /><br />How then could this movie be so intolerably bad ? To begin with , it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings . Then tell them to do their best Kevin Costner imitations . Open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of America from being interesting in any way . Finally give the editing job to your brother - in - law , because the meat packing plant just laid him off . He does have twenty years of cutting experience.<br /><br />This movie now defines the basement for me . It is so bad , it is n't even good for being bad .
0 I´m not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is anything to go by . I expected something better from Uma Thurman , which was the reason I suffered my way through this experience in the first place . An awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality . It´s just a shame that we are incapable of giving 0 out of 10 in these reviews . This movie deserves it .
0 When it comes to movies , I am generally easily entertained and not very critical , but must say that this movie was one big flop from the start . I gave it 30 minutes and then rewound it . What a waste of some great talent ! I was very disappointed with this movie , as it was not what I expected .
0 i 'll admit . i think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and have made it a mission to see every movie she has been in ( unfortunately that includes the horrible films Batman and robin , The Avengers ) and this one.<br /><br />this has to rank as the worst movie i 've ever seen . ( yes it ranks even lower than The Avengers ) . everyone looks lost in it and it is incoherent beyond belief . < br /><br />even if you think Uma is a goddess like i do , PLEASE PLEASE do n't subject yourself to this movie . you 'll hate yourself the following morning for it .
0 Why would any legitimate actor having read the script participated in this piece of crap ? My god it is actually embarrassing to even watch it . I ca n't imagine the shame these people must feel for being a part of it . Also , there is apparently some controversy as to whether River Phoenix had a cameo in the movie . He was uncredited but his list of roles here ( IMDB ) does give him credit . BTW ... Rain is his sister for those who have were asking before . This film is proof that no matter how many big " names " you have . Sow 's ears do n't make silk purses . I love Lorraine Bracco but this was just sad , sad , sad ... Maybe somebody someday can explain to me the reason for this kind of film . It has no endearing , entertaining , or even comedic properties in comparison to it 's bad everything else .
0 This movie stinks . The stench resembles bad cowpies that sat in the sun too long . I ca n't believe that so many talented actors wasted their time making such a hopelessly awful film . Whew !
0 George Brent is a reporter sent to interview an heiress . She is supposedly the heir to a face cream fortune . He interviews her on her yacht . They fall for each other in bathing costumes.<br /><br />It turns out ( quite early ) that she is not an heiress . She part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream.<br /><br />The movie follows the ups and downs of their romance.<br /><br />The supporting cast does little to buoy it up . Davis and Brent carry the picture . Though it 's fairly predictable , it is also fairly entertaining . It 's far from her best . But , especially considering its obscurity in her oeuvre , it 's not one of her worst , either .
0 Freddy 's Dead : The Final Nightmare , the sixth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and once again another bad sequel . I think this is tied up with the last sequel of the Dream Child . I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series box DVD set for my birthday , so I got to see all the sequels . May I say that I 'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels , at least the past two , it just seems like Freddy lost his edge . It 's almost like the writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and they 're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story . This was a sequel that was n't needed , sorry to Robert Englund , but this was very much below what Freddy Krueger represents.<br /><br />Freddy is back , but he 's got something we do n't know about , a daughter . Maggie , she 's not aware that he is her father , but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help . She has to do her best to resist his powers , but it 's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father . Ironic , is n't it ? But Freddy is n't giving up without manipulating her into his ways.<br /><br />Freddy 's Dead : The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D , radical , huh ? Note the sarcasm . This is one of the worst sequels , it 's tied up with the fifth sequel of the Nightmare on Elm Street series , I 'd rather watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest . This just had bad acting , stupid editing , and just over all a bad idea for a story . I did n't like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who Freddy Krueger really is , the death master of nightmares , not Father Knows Best.<br /><br />2/10
0 Actually , they do n't , but they certainly did when trying to think of a singular line that adequately summarises how terrible this entry in the series really is . There were some moments that could have been good , but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities , and do n't get me started on the bad.<br /><br />The wasted opportunities are pretty obvious , but I will recap them here in case anyone cares . Anyone who has n't seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point . The first , and potentially the biggest , wasted opportunity , was the plot with Freddy 's long - lost child . Now , the extreme mental illness that Freddy appears to suffer ( and I might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people , leave alone to this extent ) is HEREDITARY , so why not a mystery - type slasher in which Lisa Zane 's character dreams of Freddy murdering the teens , only we later discover it 's actually her doing all the killing ? Sound like a good plot idea to you ? Obviously it was above the heads of Talalay and De Luca.<br /><br />Then there 's the trip to Springfield , where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out , and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis . Funnily enough , said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner , although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much . We are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond one 's comprehension and control . The essential problem with this plot element , however , is that the town is abandoned too quickly , and with no real answers . This collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say ... one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the Springfield fair looks like a horror show.<br /><br />Of course , horror films are never noted for their character development , unless they 're the kind of horror films John Carpenter used to direct , but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die ? At least Wes Craven took the time to set up his characters in the original , and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in . That , in a nutshell , is probably the biggest problem with Freddy 's Dead : it just does n't try at all , leave alone hard enough.<br /><br />On a related note , I feel kind of sorry for Robert Englund , now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the Freddy character . He has played far better characters in far better productions ( the science - fiction miniseries " V " , for example ) , and to be forever remembered as " the man who played Freddy " is selling him rather short . It seems he will never break the mold of horror films now . As for the rest of the cast , well , I think their performances here speak for themselves . They deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than B - grade horror props . Even Yaphet Kotto does n't escape this one unscathed , as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of B - films.<br /><br />All in all , Freddy 's Dead gets a 1 out of me . I 'd vote lower , but the IMDb does n't allow for that . FD is really a testament to how a writer 's inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film , but an entire franchise .
0 WARNING : REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS < br /><br />A couple of years back I managed to see the first five films in this franchise , and was planning to do an overview of the whole Elm St. series . However , just two years on and I find I ca n't remember enough about them in order to do it  I guess they could n't have made much of an impression . From what I do recall , some of the sequels  Dream Warriors in particular  were n't as bad as is often made out , though even the original was no classic . Generally , the predictability of the premise ( if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams ) does n't lend itself to narrative tension . But while I can not recall much of the first five films , I do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddy 's Dead.<br /><br />An indication of how sick of Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character 's demise . The fact that the movie 's conclusion is not even hidden , but in fact the entire purpose for the film 's being goes to illustrate how vacant , soulless and cynical this venture was.<br /><br />Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain , Robert Englund 's in - no - way - scary interpretation booms with laughter . I always thought Freddy 's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe . It 's like Englund 's crying out " we know this is garbage  but you 're paying to see it , so who 's the one laughing ? " And I 'm sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight . Was Freddy 's appearance in the films always so rudimentary ? All he gets to do here is a few " haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars " and that 's it . If this was the only Elm St. film you 'd ever seen you would n't get to know the character at all . Even as the character pre - death in a flashback Englund plays him as a boo - hiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic ( ie . overstated , misplaced and not at all funny ) irony.<br /><br />Acting is almost universally poor . Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language . Only Kananga himself , Yaphet Kotto , keeps his dignity . And when Roseanne , Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up , you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire . The script , too , is absolutely lousy , almost wholly without merit . Carlos ( Ricky Dean Logan ) opens a road map , upon which the Noel Coward - like Freddy has wittily written " you 're f**ked " . When prompted for the map , Carlos responds " well the map says we 're f**ked " . Who wrote the screenplay , Oscar Wilde?<br /><br />Or how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy , his hearing enhanced to painful levels ? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound , given that all sounds are magnified . Oddly , the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect . " Nice hearing from you , Carlos " , quips Freddy , hoping some better lines will come along . It 's also worth noting that dream sleep does n't occur instaneously , so being knocked unconscious would n't allow instant access into Freddy 's world . Though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-D finale plot logic is n't that high on the list of requirements.<br /><br />The teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious , dislikeable group in the whole series . Tracy ( Lezlie Deane ) is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with " shut the f**k up , man " and a kick in the scallops . And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients ? Freddy 's Dead . No laughs . No scares . No interest . No fun.<br /><br / >
0 Unimaginably stupid , redundant and humiliating closure to the " Nightmare on Elm Street "- series ! Part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like director Rachel Talalay intentionally wanted to turn Wes Craven 's initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke . This is n't just the worst entry in the " Elm Street " saga ; it 's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre ! The story is dumb , the character drawings are ridiculous , the structure is all murky and  most of all  the special and visual effects resemble those of a Tom & Jerry cartoon . The sequences in which Freddy Krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting . Were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into a video game - character and pogo - sticked him around the walls of a house ? The story takes us back to Springwood and it appears that Freddy all of a sudden has a middle - aged daughter . You 'd think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures , but no   There 's only one teenage - survivor in Springwood and Krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter . Another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure . The John Doe - boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults ! How about that : Freddy Krueger , who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers , eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing 3D - glasses ! Sort of like ruins the whole essence , does n't it ? As far as I 'm concerned , " Nightmare on Elm Street " has always been a dreadfully overrated series but , up until now , even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements . " Freddy 's Dead " , however , is simply unendurable and nobody should waste his / her precious time watching it .
0 I 'm not a huge Freddy Krueger fan , but that does n't mean that I do n't like Robert Englund and his other Nightmare on Elm Street movies . I think that Robert is a very good actor . Nobody plays a better Freddy Krueger than he does . But , no offense Robert , this movie sucked . The acting is terrible , the plot is really weak , and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that 's even worth watching . Sometimes sequels can be better than the first , such as the Friday the 13th franchise(I thought the remake was the best in the series.)But this is n't one of those movies . The original was good , the 2nd in my opinion was better , the 3rd was okay but I haven , t seen the others . Whatever you do , don , t make the same mistake I did by watching this piece of crap .
0 Freddy 's Dead : The Final Nightmare starts as dream demon Freddy Krueger ( Robert Englund ) leaves a teenager ( Shon Greenblatt ) on the outskirt 's of Springwood with no memory of himself , who he is or why he is there . The local police pick him up & take him to a youth centre where child psychiatrist Maggie Burroughs ( Lisa Zane ) interviews him , she finds a newspaper cutting in his pocket which leads the two to Elm Street in Springwood where they discover that no children live there & therefore no victims for Freddy kill anyone . It all turns out that it 's an elaborate plan by Freddy to find his daughter & use her to escape Springwood . When Maggie realises what Freddy is up to her & some kids decide they have to kill Freddy once & for all ... <br /><br />Directed by Rachel Talalay this was made with the intention of being the final A Nightmare on Elm Street film which by this time had reached five , of course as any horror film fan know 's if there 's still money to be made from a franchise or a character then there 's no way in hell Freddy 's Dead : The Final Nightmare was going to be the last one which , of course , it was n't . The A Nightmare on Elm Street series has been a franchise of diminishing returns as the films dropped in quality as the series progressed until we got here & Freddy 's Dead : The Final Nightmare which for my money is probably the worst out of the lot of them . The film moves at a reasonable pace & it 's rarely boring but it 's so silly , childish & feels like some sort of live - action cartoon with some awful set - piece horror scenes that seem a million miles from Wes Craven 's suspenseful & effective early 80 's original . The sequence where stoner Spencer is trapped inside a video game being played by Freddy is terrible on it 's own but then we are treated to shots of his body back in reality bouncing around the house from wall to wall & floor to ceiling which is quite the most ridiculous thing I 've seen in a while , or maybe the early scenes when the John Doe kid falls from a plane down to the ground just like the Coyote cartoon character in the Road Runner cartoons or the absurd sight of Freddy threatening the deaf Carlos with pins that he intends to drop to the floor to make a loud noise or when he eventually kills him by scraping his knives across a blackboard . You ca n't take this seriously & I was just sitting there not quite believing what I was seeing . When they do finally try to kill Freddy the hero is given a secret powerful special weapon , yeah that 's right a pair of cardboard 3-D glasses ! The character 's are poor , the dialogue is poor & the plot is confusing , it does n't really stick to the Elm Street continuity & overall the film is a bit of a mess , the best thing I can say about it is that it has quite a bit of unintentional humour & you can certainly laugh at it.<br /><br />The film has major tonal problems as it tries to be dark , scary & sinister yet it 's so silly & simply looks ridiculous at times that any attempt at being serious falls completely flat . There 's not much gore in this one , there 's some cut off fingers , some stabbings , someone falls on a bed of nails & that 's about it . The body count is extremely low here with only three death 's . The final twenty or so minutes of Freddy 's Dead : The Final Nightmare was in fact shot in 3-D although the version I saw presented this part as normal so I ca n't comment on how well this does or does n't work but you can definitely see shots which are meant to be seen in 3-D which take advantage of the process . The special effects vary , some are quite good actually while other 's are terrible & Freddy 's burnt make - up this time looks quite poor.<br /><br />This apparently had a budget of about $ 5,000,000 ( it had an opening weekend box - office take of $ 12,000,000 ) & the film has a few nice visual touches & gags which makes the thing feel even more cartoony than it already is . The acting is really poor from the main leads although there are a few odd cameos including Tom Arnold & Roseanne , Johnny Depp & rocker Alice Cooper.<br /><br />Freddy 's Dead : The Final Nightmare is probably the worst of the entire series & apart from some unintentional laugh value there 's not much here to recommend or enjoy . Fans of the series will probably like it & defend it but for me this is about as far from Wes Craven 's original classic shocker as it gets . Followed by New Nightmare ( 1994 ) which tried to take Freddy Krueger & the series in a new & different direction .
0 Sixth escapade for Freddy Krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in Springwood ; now he wants to broaden his horizons and ( * * SPOILER * * ) needs a family member in order to do it.<br /><br />A failure as a horror movie because it simply ai n't scary at all . Works better as a dark , macabre black comedy , to tell you the truth . Freddy Krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer . ( Too many wisecracks , that 's for sure . ) The actors are n't interesting ( save Robert Englund , as always , and an obviously slumming Yaphet Kotto ) and there are simply far too many visual effects . The finale is OK but does n't provide as many sparks as I think one might hope.<br /><br />In adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer 's story , it provides Englund the opportunity to do more non - makeup scenes than ever before.<br /><br />There are cameos worth noting : a joint cameo by then - couple Roseanne and Tom Arnold that is devoid of entertainment value , an appropriate appearance by veteran shock - rocker Alice Cooper , and a funny cameo by Johnny Depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become.<br /><br />Film debut of Breckin Meyer , who plays Spencer.<br /><br />One of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits.<br /><br />4/10
0 Okay this is stupid , they say their not making another Nightmare film , that this is the " last " one ... And what do they do?They go on making another one , not that the next one ( part7 ) was BAD , but why do they play us . Anyway this movie made no sense what - so ever , it was extremelly dull , the characters were highly one dimensional , Freddy was another joker , which is very stupid for such a good series . The plot is very , very bad , and this is even worse than part 2 and 5 . I did nt get the movie , its a stupid tale in 3-d , pointless!Id say . I hated this film so much i still rmember all the parts i did nt like which was basically the whole film . This is SO different than the prequels , it tries , and tries , but this one tried the hardest , and got slapped back on the face . Again there were hadly any death scenes , although they were different , they sucked bigtime . How can they have gone this far?Didnt they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts 2 and 5?Yet they make this?Its all bout the money , DO NOT SEE THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR A NIGHTMARE SERIES.<br /><br />I GAVE A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET SIX ( 6 ) 3 out of 10.<br /><br />GOOD POINTS OF MOVIE : Had potential with plot.<br /><br />BAD POINTS OF FILM : Terrible acting / lack of deaths / Too funny to be classified as horror / very confusing .
0 This movie had a good story , but was brought down because it did n't have enough horror film elements and violence . It was like watching a live action cartoon . It would of been better if this story is what they planned from the start of the first movie so they could of played seeds for where the series was going .
0 I am a fan of the Nightmare series but this one is horrible . The deaths are so trendy . If you were to watch this 20 years later the whole nintendo scene is outdated . I did like the flashbacks . I think they should have just made a prequel about when he was still alive . That would have been more interesting . This is a movie you can take or leave . Depends on how much spare time you have .
0 This movie is just bad . Bad . Bad . Bad . Now that I 've gotten that out of the way , I feel better . This movie is poor from beginning to end . The story is lame . The 3-D segment is really bad . Freddy is at his cartoon character worst . Thank God they killed him off . And who wants to see Roseanne and Tom Arnold cameos?<br /><br />The only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that we 're given on Freddy . We see he once had a family , and we get to see his abusive , alcoholic father ( Alice Cooper).<br /><br />Other than that , all bad . There are some quality actors in here ( Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto ) , and they do their best , but the end result is just so bad . The hour and a half I spent watching this movie is and hour and half I ca n't ever get back .
0 " Freddy 's Dead " did the smartest thing it could 've done after the disappointment of the fifth film . It started from scratch . Sure , this " final " film in the saga is silly but at least it 's original . Some of the visuals are even a bit breath - taking . And the story of Freddy 's kid ( Lisa Zane ) returning to town to face her evil father is unique.<br /><br />Overall , the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theater . It has a bunch of good actors ( Zane , Yaphet Kotto , and Lezlie Deane ) who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter . It 's one - sided , it 's a magic - trick , and , in the end , it 's nothing but goofy , childish entertainment.<br /><br / >
0 This movie was just terrible , the first movie was n't that great i mean it 's ridiculously stupid if they did n't have enough with the first 5 films you had to add another one , why just not make this into an ongoing series like James Bond , i 'll tell you exactly why because the bond films are actually very very good and these films just stink , i do n't understand , was this supposed to be a cross between to genres like horror and comedy for goodness sakes my 1 year old niece would n't be scared of such a ridiculous attempt at horror , a spit in the face of people who at least want to be scared at some point in a so called horror film . Please no more of these movies .
0 The first in the series was brilliant , easily one of the best Horror films of all time . This is the crappiest . When I sat down to watch this , I was actually thinking that how bad the fourth and fifth ones were , this would have to be good after the previous terrible ones . Boy was I wrong . Incredibly wrong.<br /><br />When I watched the first ten minutes of it , I was actually really tempted to turn it off , but I thought no , maybe it 'll improve . It didn't.<br /><br />Not only is this just a dire film by itself , it did n't need another sequel , because the last two ( fourth and fifth ) had already been terrible enough ! Also , how many times can you bring Freddy back ! ? The acting in it was TERRIBLE , the story - line was predictable and crap and it also had flaws in it as well . The way they made Springwood was just totally wrong . Pays no respect to the first one at - all . To add to this , the whole thing seemed really over - the - top.<br /><br />Some people are saying that this film was " funny " . This film is not " funny " at all . Since when is Freddy Krueger supposed to be " funny " ? I would call it funnily crap . This film is supposed to be a Horror film , not a comedy . If Freddy had a daughter , would n't that information have surfaced like in the first one ! ? The ending was also just plain stupid and cheesy , exactly like the rest of it . This one completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first one . Just shows itself up.<br /><br />Such a shame that Wes Craven created something so good in the beginning , yet it has to be dragged down because of this trash that belongs in the bin . They should n't have even bothered making this film . Nor any of the other sequels , except the third one . The third one 's the only decent one out of all the sequels.<br /><br />If this was a DVD by itself and not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD set that I got , I would have chucked it out when I got it.<br /><br />Summary : A pathetic and poor attempt at a sequel.<br /><br />- a complete MOCKERY of the first film < br /><br />So please , do n't waste your time on this worthless junk .
0 This movie is easily the worst of the series . Though New Line might just be looking at sales , they all know the only reason this one made more money than the one prior was due to its 3D ending . It was n't that the 3-D was good either , because it was 50 's 3D with the red and blue lenses(anaglyph . ) It was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like . Beyond that this movie was so poorly done ! Bad script , bad characters , bad acting , worse directing . This movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like a " Looney Tunes " episode.<br /><br />Seriously , not for horror audience , because it is corny and not scary , and not funny or amusing for comedy crowds . Just a total mess with some really bad cameos that are still trying to play this whole thing as camp and having it fall way short of what they probably wanted.<br /><br />I remember most of us who had been fans of this series were just praying that it would end at this point because of how bad it had gotten . This is one of the movies that helped take horror out of popularity and ride a fad of belief that audiences really wanted to laugh with some stupid comedy than see a good and scary horror film .
0 This is going to be the most useless comment I have ever put down , but yet I must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that " Freddy 's Dead " is . It is not only the very worst chapter of the Nightmare series , but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time ! It was boring , pointless , and nearly death free . The horrible 3-D ending and over - the - top CORNY kills are enough to drive this " film " into the ground . However , it does n't stop there , just add bad acting , a terrible script , and a number of cheesy cameos and you 've got yourself this heaping pile of guano ! It 's no wonder why Freddy , as always played by Robert Englund , has made two postmortem appearances . I would too if I went out like that . This is a strictly fans only movie , do n't stare at our shame .
0 It WAS supposed to be the last Freddy movie ( and it was for over 10 years)--you would think they would have tried to get a good movie done . But they turned out giving us the worst of the series ( and that 's saying a lot ) . The plot made no sense ( I seriously ca n't remember it ) , all the main characters were idiots ( you REALLY wanted them dead ) and Freddy 's wisecracks were even worse than usual . The only remotely good bit about this was a brief ( and funny ) cameo by Johnny Depp ( the first " Nightmare " movie was his first).<br /><br />Also I originally saw it in a theatre were the last section ( reaccounting Freddy 's childhood ) was in 3-D. Well -- the 3-D was lousy -- faded colors and the image going in and out of focus . Also the three flying skulls which were supposed to be scary ( I think ) had the opposite reaction from my audience . EVERYBODY broke down laughing . Looks even worse on TV in 2-D. Pointless and stupid -- very dull also . Skip this one and see " Freddy vs. Jason " again .
0 In the future of 2001 , Freddy is after the last surviving teenager of Elm Street . Forsaking ANY scares whatsoever for unfunny attempts at humor and needless celebrity cameos ( come on .. Roseanne ? ? ? Tom Arnold ? ? ! ! ? ? WTF ? ) , this is tied with part 2 is the worst the demon child rapist ever got . Wow was this a piece of crap . Not even the great legendary Alice Cooper could make the stench of this movie go away . And when they hell did Freddy ever have a daughter ? ? The whole film is severely retarded in ever single conceivable way , shape & form . Rachel Talalay , you stink to high heaven , babe.<br /><br />My Grade : D- < br /><br />DVD Extras : Cast and Crew Bios ; Jump to the 3D sequence and Jump to a Nightmare options ( more extras for the film can be found on the seventh disc of The Nightmare Collection DVD set ) < br /><br />DVD - Rom content : Trivia game ; Screenplay ; and web link
0 Let 's hope this is the final nightmare . This is the epitome of a good thing gone bad . Okay , there is still some enjoyment to be had , but only in the most mundane sense . Rachel Talalay had been there for the duration of this franchise , had been on the production staff and produced even . I do n't know what she was thinking , but this debacle comes complete with the human video game boy and a guest appearance by < br /><br />Tom and Roseanne Arnold ! I wish I had a clue what she was thinking when she wrote / directed this disappointing piece of garbage . She even tried to distract her audience from the fact that this movie was nothing more than an over - glorified popcorn movie instead of bearing any resemblance to horror , with the contrived use of a 3D ending . Are n't those glasses nifty ? And you get to KEEP them ! It 's the equivalent of , you just spent $ 9.00 making me rich . Here 's 10 cents . Now , do n't you feel special ! ? Sorry , but for me , it just did not make me feel special . < br /><br />And Freddy 's had yet another face - lift . This one was for the worst , I think . All the beautiful artistry that went into his " look " in the earlier films has been replaced by an obviously cheaper , less detailed set of prosthetics . He looks ... less like the burn victim he is supposed to be , and more like he has a skin disorder . Changing the lead 's makeup like that so far into a series is about on the same level as changing the lead actor . But wait ! They 've done that , and done that . So I guess it does n't matter . But it mattered to me . Freddy is no longer SCARY . He 's just ... another low - rent monster like the Leprechaun . < br /><br />It 's more ... a dark comedy than the horror classic this series promises ; riddled with what you can only hope the writers thought were witty one - liners and clever repartee ( sadly , it fell short on both accounts ) . < br /><br />So there 's nothing more to say than grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh , because there was not one scary or suspenseful moment in this entire film . < br /><br />It rates a 3.2/10 from ... <br /><br />the Fiend : .
0 The film was made in 1942 and with World War 11 around , the movie industry decided to capitalize on the fact that spies were around.<br /><br />The film is fun to watch due to the fabulous dancing of Eleanor Powell . The late Miss Powell was certainly a great hoofer in every sense of the word . She is again paired with a very young looking Red Skelton here . The two of them also starred in " I Dood It." < br /><br />Moroni Olsen , who 3 years later , was superb as the interrogating police officer in " Mildred Pierce " again appears as an officer asking Powell to deliver an item . Trouble is that Olsen and his rogues are really the Japanese spies.<br /><br />Bert Lahr is his usual brilliant self here and he gets ample support from Virginia O'Brien .
0 I 've almost forever been against the inclusion of songs in a movie . My belief was that the quality of the film would automatically be improved if only those extremely annoying songs would be axed . However , things have quickly changed after watching that horrible Black ( no songs ) & this movie , Page 3 ( plenty of songs ) . While Black was weak to an extreme , Page 3 delivers a gripping story with some strong acting & good direction . The songs were almost incidental & blended in almost seamlessly with the film . There certainly were n't any women getting sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources while gyrating wildly on the streets at night.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised with the bold and unabashed approach used by the director . There was no glossing over of anything and almost every scene was completely believable.<br /><br />I'd recommend this films for Hindi - speaking people with at least a slight understanding of Mumbai life . The former because the English subtitling was below par and contained many errors which , at times , completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement . The latter because you 'll definitely appreciate the accuracy of the depiction once you 've lived it yourself.<br /><br />I'd definitely rank this as a work worthy of international recognition . The scenes with the gossiping drivers was a nice touch and it served simultaneously as a source of genuine humour as well as another perspective on the whole mishmash . The movie does fall short in a few places though , where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things which detract from the overall direction of the film.<br /><br />I also thought that a couple of the sadder scenes were not done very well . It was a touch amusing to watch , rather than arouse any feelings of sadness & the whole scene tended to come across as a bit foolish . These are minor issues though , because the film , on the whole , is truly a rare treat to watch.<br /><br />Overall , it 's a cynical , pessimistic outlook and a refreshing one at that ! Actors , not ' heroes ' - that 's the key . A chance to glimpse believable human beings in an extraordinary setting - everyday life . A behind - the - scenes look at the extent of the depravity and a rare ray of hope for Indian cinema.<br /><br />8/10 .
0 I do not even want to call this thing a film - it is a movie that should not have won any awards . The acting was horrible as were the silly scenarios . This is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an NRI audience but is in fact loathed abroad for its awkwardness and the overwhelming sense of " trying " throughout the movie . < br /><br />I find it strange that so many actors conversant with the English language have such a hard time doing so convincingly in front of the camera . I 'm sure many readers know what I am talking about - all those token English phrases thrown into a movie , in Hindi and in regional cinema for cool points . There are few Indian movies in which the English seems completely genuine - Being Cyrus was a recent one . Although not a great film , it was a good film and the language did not seem " put on " . < br /><br />I feel ashamed that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005 . The only semi - enjoyable parts of this rubbish were Konkana and a somewhat catchy background score . Other than that , do not even waste your time with this film .
0 Madhur has given us a powerful movie Chandni Bar in the past . His next film Page 3 was one of the worst movies of all time . It apparently tells the story of some high class people in India . After seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to Star in a Movie . I felt like spitting and breaking the DVD . Coincidently i did . The reason why was the movie contains scenes of child pornography and molestation . I literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children . Very disturbing stuff , there was no need to show the children fully naked . One of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people , British men in this movie . I am shocked to know this film was a Hit in parts of India , otherwise Super Flop in UK , USA and Australia . I 'm from UK , and this kind of stuff makes me sick , should n't of been released in UK .
0 Crude , some times crass - to me that 's the summation of Madhur Bhandarkar 's latest work - Page 3 . He has no point of view - just shallow , funny digs at stereotypes . What is the movie about ? ? Is it about reporting a clan of people ( so called Page 3 types ) who are so busy socializing and progressing their profiles in life - that they have no time for anything else . And you are either in it or out of it . Is it that there is no press at all to report everyday incidents . Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and Page 3 is just a supplement ; perhaps an entertainer for checking out who 's who and what 's what . Do n't mix the two . And then there is power play - that would happen in every walk of life . So what have you told at the end of it all - nothing - just a few crude jokes strung together in an otherwise direction less movie .
0 I have no idea how anyone managed to stay awake during this show . The acting was ham - fisted and amateur , the story was old news , and plot development ( or lack thereof ) invariably had my eyelids sagging less than halfway through each episode . That 's about all there is to say of it , because it genuinely lacked substance of any kind.<br /><br />How can you people like crap like this ? It 's freaking stupid , it 's an insult to your intelligence . I do n't even know how to further explain it ... It 's as if some of you will stare mindlessly at junk like this solely because you like the way some of the actors look , or because , for whatever crazy reason , you have n't seen the same formulas in dozens of shows a million times before.<br /><br />I just .. forget it . This show sucked , and thankfully it 's gone forever . I wish they 'd get to work on demolishing The O.C. once and for all .
0 This show was laughably bad . The writing sucked , the dialog sucked . The guy who played Craig could n't act his way out of a paper sack . Being it was on Thursday night , this was definitely great to watch with some beers . Cool music , bad acting , poor writing , all came together for my entertainment.<br /><br />It was a drama / unintentional comedy . I do n't care what happened to any of the characters , they were all boring and stupid . The first five episodes were the worst , since they could n't reveal who the victim was , they had to write the dialog around it , which was terrible . I mean , the eulogy at the funeral was ridiculous . Actually , all the scenes that occurred in the present were utterly horrible.<br /><br />So , let 's review . Everything happening in present time sucked . The flashback scenes , only the writing , dialog and Craig 's acting sucked . The music ruled though .
0 There was a great film to be made about Steve Biko . Sadly this was n't it . Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of actors - is totally unable to convey the great charisma that Biko had . Attenborough 's big crowd scenes are laughable . The Soweto massacre was n't like this , three neat lines of children ( some doing cartwheels ! ) marching happily into the guns of the soldiers . With Biko dead the film rapidly descends into farce . If the struggle against Apartheid was anything it was a black people 's struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a white man and his family . I 'm sure Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important while he was n't . Penelope Wilton 's accent is pure Hampshire and she seems completely unaware that she is in South Africa at all . at all . The Wood 's family dog gets more lines than the black maid . As the family make their escape one the women I saw the film with - incidentally one of only about a dozen black people in a large , full cinema - whispered " This is like the sound of music . " She had a point.<br /><br />Overall this is a film by a well - intentioned if somewhat inept white liberal about a radical black people 's struggle . And really South Africa needs well - intentioned white liberals like it needs a hole in the head .
0 Ashley Judd , in an early role and I think her first starring role , shows her real - life rebellious nature in this slow - moving feminist soap opera . Wow , is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme Liberalism or what?<br /><br />Being a staunch feminist in real life , she must have cherished this script . No wonder Left Wing critic Roger Ebert loved this movie ; it 's right up his political alley , too.<br /><br />Unlike the reviewers here , I am glad Judd elevated herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in movies that entertained , not preached the heavy - handed Liberal agenda .
0 First , let me state that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd ; that 's why I was curious to check out this , her debut role . No argument that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent . I guess I can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story . However , I like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie fails.<br /><br />By the halfway point , I found myself thinking , " How much longer do we have to watch a bored shop girl , idly standing around a deserted souvenir shop , rearranging the merchandise ? " It seemed to go on forever!<br /><br />Then , I thought , maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to lull the audience into a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event . No such luck . The movie continues it 's bland , boring , uneventful story all the way to the end.<br /><br />I'm not saying this because I 'm an action - junkie . I like all kinds of movies , especially romantic - comedies . But I expect to be entertained.<br /><br />Add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor 's bad home movies . Depressing!<br /><br />I just do n't get how anyone could like this movie . Zero - entertainment value . The longest 114 minutes of my life.<br /><br / >
0 I saw this film for the first time not too long on TCM 's " Essentials " series . The eye of the beholder cliché was never more apropos . This beholder saw little of value in this one . I was puzzled by the infinite attraction that Lucy ( Lauren Bacall ) possessed . Granted , Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman , but in this film her character comes off more mousy than attractive . I would think men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would more likely ignore Lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her . In Bacall 's defense , this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart 's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health may have affected her performance . Of course part of this mousiness on the part of Lucy was to contrast her to slutty Marylee , played to the hilt and beyond by Dorothy Malone . The scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film . Malone 's performance outshines the rest , although Jasper Hadley 's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith . Generally , though , I would have to say that I 'm just not much of a fan of melodrama . The cartoonish behavior of the characters just makes for a story too implausible for my tastes .
0 I watched Written on The Wind starring Rock Hudson , Lauren Becall , Robert Stack & Dorothy Malone- Robert Stack was terrible- just bloody horrible- he was supposed to be a charming jet - setting millionaire- instead he came off like a jerk from the word go- the plot was stupid and overwrought and the 3 " romantic " leads had no chemistry . Somehow Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for best supporting actress- although her campy tramp character was boring- think the older sister from Splendour in The Grass filled with malice and bitterness and lacking charisma . Director Douglas Sirk has the entire cast overact their way through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes . Had a cameo by the actor that played the chief on Get Smart
0 To me this just comes off as a soap opera . I guess any depiction of profligate people can be considered " social commentary . " But in the final analysis , I simply do n't care how you characterize this film . None of the characters are very likable or engaging . I felt no chemistry between Hudson and Bacall . If there is a love story here , it is lost in the malaise . And despite the twist ending provided by a complete and immediate ( and therefore , incomprehensible ) reversal by Dorothy Maguire on the witness stand , the story is insufficient to hold my interest . No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology are throw in , this story is sleazy , melodramatic and trite.<br /><br />Rock Hudson is nobly wooden . This is Lauren Bacall 's least engaging role and one of her poorest performances . Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack deliver more inspired performances , but her character is vile , and his is pathetic . Robert Keith , as the loving , out - of - touch father of two miscreant adult children , is the most sympathetic character . Most interesting of all , however , is the severe - looking Robert Wilke in a small role as the bar owner . He is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless Westerns , but here he is an honest , likable fellow.<br /><br />I take my social commentary with an interesting , engaging story and a few likable characters , thank you .
0 What we have here is a classic case of TOO much patriotism . This is what happens when you live in a small country with very little ( next to none , even ) cinema history . Whenever somebody does come up with a slightly more ambitious film project  other than the usual dramas about struggling farmer families or long feature slapstick movies of local comedians  everybody feels obliged to love it and even responsible to spread favorable reviews across the countries ' borders . This is especially the case when the writer / director of this particular film is already a nation 's sweetheart , because he 's also the founder and lead singer of a popular rock band . " Any Way The Wind Blows " is by no means a bad film , but it 's definitely overrated ( if that is even possible within the boundaries of a small country ) and has absolutely nothing new or even remotely original to offer . This is basically the Flemish version of classic movies such as " Short Cuts " and " Magnolia " and illustrates a mosaic of characters whose daily lives initially appear to be unrelated but eventually come together in the end . The only thing that seems to unite the eight protagonists at first is the city of Antwerp , where they all live and work , but gradually the deeper relationships between them become transparent and near the climax they all gather for a party . The main problem with " Any Way The Wind Blows " , at least according to yours truly , lies with the characters . They really are random , uninteresting and honestly do n't experience anything that could be considered out of the ordinary . It was presumably writer / director Tom Barman 's intention to depict the average & regular inhabitant of Antwerp but then , seriously , what is the point ? One of the characters gets fired from his film projectionist job , another one is a failed novelist struggling with a marriage crisis , two siblings recently lost their father and the most " mysterious " one of them all is followed by the wind wherever he goes . There are a couple of more characters regularly walking through the screen , but they 're even less worth mentioning . These people simply drivel on and on about very random topics ( like life in the 80 's , dates and each other 's bowel motions ) and philosophy about matters nobody cares about . Some of the dialogs do evoke mild chuckles , especially the interactions between the two twenty - something guys from Ghent , but still nothing extraordinary or even memorable . The film actually works best as a touristy video to promote the city of Antwerp and as an extended & versatile music documentary . There are several stylish & nifty sightseeing images of Antwerp and there 's always beautiful music playing , whether really loud or subtly in the background . Generally speaking " Any Way The Wind Blows " is a competently made and stylish effort , but too mundane and slightly boring , and I honestly wonder most of its fans would even had bothered to watch if it were n't a Flemish production .
0 I do n't know what would be so great about this movie . Even worse , why should anyone bother seeing this one ? First of all there is no story . One could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling ( laughter , cry , fear , ... ) , but in my opinion this movie does not do that either.<br /><br />You are just watching images for + /- 2 hrs . There are more useful things to do.<br /><br />I guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it lacks all the above . But is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 EUR of your money ? For me the answer is : no .
0 Okay ... it seems like so far , only the Barman fans have commented on this film - time for a counterpoint . Beware , this writeup is * LONG*.<br /><br />For those not in the knowing ( mostly the non - Belgians ) : Tom Barman , director of this film , is the frontman of dEUS , one of the better known rock bands of the late 90 's here in Belgium . Basically , they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly rose to fame on the national scale . Then , egos started hurting and the band basically fell apart , with Barman and a couple of others remaining to go on making albums under the dEUS - monicker . The way it always happens in such cases , the post - breakdown dEUS was a lot tamer and less interesting than the original . They tried to go for an international breakthrough with their album " The Ideal Crash " in 1999 , presenting a much diluted form of their earlier style of songwriting . They did n't quite make it . However , egos were still pretty big it seems : big enough for Barman to consider himself enough of an artist to try on movies.<br /><br />More often than not this sort of thing is a VERY big mistake , and this film does not make the exception . And Barman clearly went for * art * on this one , another very big mistake . For one thing , he 's a musician , not a movie director . For another , dEUS at it 's best made fun and provoking music , but never anything close to what I would consider * art*. It shows.<br /><br />So , what 's this movie about ? Basically , it tells the story of a bunch of completely uninteresting people , doing equally uninteresting things over the course of a totally uninteresting friday in Antwerp , as even more uninteresting stuff happens to them in the act of being uninteresting . The characters are shallow , the plot totally pointless and the film just does n't have any other redeeming qualities to make up for these shortcomings . Humor ? The whole film made me smile ( slightly ) about 3 times , and actually managed to provoke a single 5-second laugh ( not quite loud ) . Mood ? The film just does n't seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling at all . Mystery ? Well , ( * MINOR SPOILER*)the idea of the " wind - man " , inspiring the name of the film , is as enthralling as a banana pepper pizza - not very , and has been done a thousand times before ( anyone remember Johny Destiny - one of Tarantino 's worst appearances on film to date)(*END MINOR SPOILER * ) . And well , its * artistic * , so do n't expect any kind of real action to make up for all the previous . In other words , except for the few smiles , it bored me out of my shorts.<br /><br />So what remains ? Well , the soundtrack is pretty good , though it suffers from some of the same problems that other OST 's have shown lately : first , it makes the movie seem like nothing more than a commercial for the CD . Second , it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the content quality of the songs , which simply does n't work . In the end , it makes the film look like nothing more than an illustration to the songs . And sadly , it 's Barmans own contribution to the soundtrack which gets the most attention , though it is the weakest part of the whole soundtrack as far as I 'm concerned . All in all , it just stands to show that Barman knows more about music than movies . Camera work is okay as well , though not anything that would make you scream out with joy.<br /><br />The only thing about this movie that kept me watching was the sight - seeing factor . Since I originate from Antwerp , it was fun to play a kind of " guess - the - location " game . I would hardly consider this as a quality though.<br /><br />All in all , another chance lost for Flemmish film . I keep on noticing that lately , the best Belgian movies have been coming from the French part of the country . This is mostly because at least , they have something to tell and manage to tell it in way that is both sharp and emotional ( the brothers Daerden come to mind ) . Maybe the Flemmish art - house filmmakers should try that too .
0 The story is about the life of common people from Antwerp , living their lives . So I said it , and there is nothing more actually to tell about the story . The movie is fast , like an MTV - flick , and well photographed and we feel that the director is talented and should do more films . So let 's forget about this one and hope for the best with the next Deus - Barman picture .
0 This whirling movie looks more like a combination of music - clips at MTV than as a real movie . There is no real story and as the movie goes on you ask yourself : " What is going to happen ? " ; but nothing happens . The story around Eric Cloeck , the frustrated writer , is the only good thing . The other persons seem to have nothing in common : then why bring them together in a movie . With music you can make watchable the worst movie . When I open the tap and there comes water out with the music of Bach then most people will like to look at it but this is not a movie . The director should learn how to write a script for a movie of 100 minutes or more before starting to direct a movie .
0 How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better Flemish movie " Congo Express ( 1986 ) " ? There are also some characters in congo Express put together without having really a relation to each other : Jean , ( de Congolees ) , the workman , the two taxi - drivers , the street - singer , Roger , Guy , Lucienne and Gilbert . Of course , Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels was n't . That should not be a reason to pardon the flaws in the script ( if there is a script ) of Anyway the wind blows . The joke ( the only one ! ) at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is taken from that great Flemish movie " De Witte ( 1934 ) " where De Witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes . Some accidents happen in the movie but there comes no explanation after . Tom Barman delivers us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch at the television than a movie for the theatres . Another missed chance for Flemish Cinema .
0 I dunno what the hype around this is ... This is really a bad movie ... it did nothing to me , the only descent scene is where everyone comes together at the party , and a nice song is playing , uplifting beat and nice cinematic shots that make you move .... that was the best part of the movie ... Otherwise this film lacks everything to suck the viewer in There 's no story , there 's nothing to think about like some people say , there 's no cohesion between the different stories ... it was more of an attempt to re - do Anderson 's ' Magnolia ' which was brilliant , but it fails blatantly ... Okay it 's light and easy to watch , but that are movieclips too . Maybe first write a story before you make a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian movies I 've seen
0 I read some gushing reviews here on IMDb and thought I would give this movie a look . Disappointed . On the plus side the male leads are good , and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince . Seems to be full of its ' own self indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess.<br /><br />It is one of those films classified as a film noir which can be defined as follows:<br /><br />"A film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism , fatalism , menace and cynical characters".<br /><br />Well that is the story here : 3 losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems that include mental illness , alcoholism , laziness , indebtedness etc and together they conspire to kidnap a child and outwit each other.<br /><br />Would have been a much better movie if the story was confined more to the kidnap instead of the character failings of the kidnappers . I thought the female lead was way out of her depth and came across as an amateur actress.<br /><br />Whilst some good moments , I finished up feeling I had wasted my time.<br /><br />4/10 .
0 A film so insecure the creaters perhaps hoped to milk an original film noir classic title , " Farewell My Lovely " , thinking the gullible would assume it a remake . The characters are so foul and unappealing that it deserved its cold reception when first released . Time only adds to it its absurdity . Having none of the guile , cinematography , desperation or despair of classic noir it relied instead on a convoluted and senseless crime plot that would have easily resulted in several arrests within hours . As if that were n't enough it threw in an utterly sexless attempt at erotica in which at least one of the participants had n't bothered to bathe in several days . This only made this mess all the more painful to watch . Find a good classic forties or fifties film noir instead of wasting two hours on this failure .
0 This had high intellectual pretensions . The main lead intends to give a " deep " " meaningful " rendering(with voice over for his frames of mind naturally ) and he was certainly influenced by the fifties / sixties " method " -which , when the script and the direction were worthwhile did give stunning results ( see Clift , Newman , Winters).But here the story is abysmal . Besides it moves too slow , you could edit at least 20 minutes -including pointless flashbacks - and the plot line would not be changed .At times , it 's very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his " Uncle " character and his portraying often verges on parody . An interesting side is only skimmed over : the relationship young boy / hero -if we admit that the hero is himself some kind of child- When he says to the young kid that he would let nobody do harm to him , some welcome tenderness emerges . But it 's botched and only the final scene returns to it.<br /><br />Word to the wise : Take Foley 's " at close range " instead : it has two great actors ( Christopher Walken and Sean Penn together!),it 's also an offbeat movie , but it 's gripping , suspenseful . Here my hitchcockometer points sullenly towards zero throughout .
0 A dreary , hopelessly predictable film set in a most unpleasant setting ( lower Coachella Valley ) . Acting is as amateurish as any I 've seen . Looks like a screenwriting 101 script . However , it does function as a great sedative .
0 What was the purpose of this film ? I suggest it was to make a handful of actors and their producers and director a big payday for doing nothing . Even my favorite actor , Bruce Dern , could n't keep my interest in this boring movie . A braindead ex - pugilist falls in with a weird woman and her relatives . He starts out as a fix - it man for the woman , and winds up beating a man and getting caught up in a kidnapping scheme . It was so confusing I ca n't even write a decent critique . If you see this one , my sweet , make sure it is after dark so you can go right to sleep .
0 I would n't rent this one even on dollar rental night .
0 I liked how this started out , featuring some decent special - effects especially for a film 50 years old . There was some pretty impressive scenery . However , the film bogs down fairly early on with some very dumb dialog as the males all try to flirt with Anne Francis " Altaira Morbius.")<br /><br />Viewing this in the ' 90s after a long absence , it was fun to see Francis again , an actress who has done mostly television shows since this film was released .... and is still acting . It also was interesting to see a young - looking Leslie Nielsen ( " Dr . John J. Adams " ) , who I would n't have recognized had it not been for this voice < br /><br />I watched half of this movie before the boredom came almost overwhelming and I had a strong desire to go to sleep . I appreciated them re - doing this VHS tape in stereo . but it was a weak effort . This is one those overrated film where " elites " think is so " heavy " and " thought - provoking . " That 's nonsense . It only appeared " intelligent " because the rest of the ' 50s sci - fi films were so stupid!!<br /><br />Some if the early scenes would have looked great on wideescreen , which I did n't have at the time of this writing . Perhaps another look - this time on the 2.35:1 widescreen transfer would make me change this review .
0 When they killed off John Amos 's character they killed the show . He was the vital part of the info structure . You had a story of an inner city family 's struggling to make it the best way they knew how . They were poor , they were black , and they were living proof that if you have Jesus and your family that nothing is too hard . Sure James would lose jobs and JJ would fail in school but the family always managed to find a way . < br /><br />James was the strong male role model that earned the income and disciplined the children . Florida was the strong lady that would everyone including James when he needed a shoulder to cry on or hug to make it . The kids had personalities and input which made them important as a family unit . Their neighbor Willona was also a key element because she represented not only a friend but some dear enough to be family . Things were bright , gritty , funny , and honest until they changed the course of the program . James dies and JJ took over the show . < br /><br />Flo was still mom , Thelma was blossoming into a lady and Michael was still the militant midget but JJ was the show . We were expected to believe that the family with no father or prominent bread winner was going to be able to stay in the apartment . I guess James 's paycheck did n't do much for the family . They were only threatened with eviction because they said they were moving and not because no one in the house was working . I know that JJ , Flo , Thelma and even Michael eventually got jobs but come on here be for real . James worked so much that you could feel for him but the others were n't realistic at all and that 's a shame.<br /><br />JJ was the comic relief but I felt the show need substance . It 's OK to be funny but they had a chance to show a real family and what it took to survive in the real world and they threw it all away on a few laughs . Michael 's character almost disappeared while the rest of the cast slipped into the shadows of the JJ Evan 's show . I mean really , here was a guy that was failing in school , he kept getting laid off , and he painted for money in about two episodes . James had always been there to encourage his talent but Flo and the rest of the family did n't seem to care.<br /><br />Why did it take him so long to understand that painting was what he was meant to do ? He could have sold painting 's on the street or worked for people that print billboards and cards . ( He did but something went wrong with that . ) Why did he not make it and why did the others give up on their dreams ? I 'll tell you why , it was because they did n't have a father in their life to care and to cheer them on and their mother stopped being their to support their dreams . The show stopped teaching us about growing , building and learning and started teaching us about gimmicks and catch phrases . They should have kept James . If any show needed a father it was that one .
0 I saw this recently and I must say , I was moved by the factual basis of the story . However , " Holly " as a movie did not quite work . I am however , looking forward to watching the documentary which the producers who organised this project had made because I think that would be a much more compelling work than this film.<br /><br />The international cast was composed of B - class actors but their acting was appropriate , and I must give a special mention for the young actress who played Holly . This was her first movie role and she did a very nice job , considering hers is the most challenging part . < br /><br />Ron Livingston was adequate but bland as Patrick , the American whose quest is to " save " Holly , but Chris Penn was good in this , his final role . Unfortunately , despite my mostly favourable opinion of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier , both of these actors were very much forgettable and did not do their best work in this film.<br /><br />I believe in the film 's message and intention , but I have to be fair , so I rate " Holly " 3 stars based on its shortcomings as a movie . But I think the subject matter deserves serious consideration and I am pleased that the people behind this movie have made a documentary as well which I hope will have its debut on BBC and other TV networks .
0 This motion picture comes straight out of the dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment . This production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90 's by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies . The most famous disasters in their ouvre are " Subspecies " , " Seedpeople " and " Trancers " . None of these are recommended and neither is Doctor Mordrid , actually . Hyperactive director Charles Band did come to the right company for his film . Doctor Mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless . I only saw it because it stars Jeffrey Combs . I learned that it can have several disadvantages if you 're a fan of him . For every good movie , it seems like he has made 5 inferior ones . Anyways , the story is about the battle between 2 ancient sorcerers . One good one who 's here since 150 years to protect the humans ( Jeffrey as Dr . Mordrid ) and one wicked one called Kabal . He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason I already forgot . Combs gets his instructions from mentor . That " guy " only exists of a pair of eyes in space . Very very cheesy , that is ! Every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen but that 's about the only form of Special effects this movie has got . The whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other , it 's over before you know it ... I would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little , but nooooooo .... In some scenes , you really can detect some originality and creativity ( like for example Jeffrey 's lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals ) and if you really pay attention , you might even find some very small but nice aspects ( like the raven which is called Edgar Allen ) but overall , it 's a terrible waste of time and energy . I 'm a big fan of Jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes ... but he sure does n't have to put on a stupid maillot for that .
0 Dr Mordrid is terrifying . I would not recommend any adult or child see this unless they are rampaging murderers already . There is so much filth in this movie it hurts my yes . Speaking of eyes , there are eyes in the sky , against a backdrop of stars . Only the devil himself could have imagined such a wicked thing . I rented out every copy i could from local video stores and crushed them with a 5 pound crucifix . That movie should remain locked in a cellar behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting beasts of hell . That is where this movie belongs . I suggest if you want some scandalous entertainment , go and rent All Dogs Go To Heaven , or Angels In The Outfield . Those movies are worth seeing . If you want to commit a sin and love terrible movies , you need to see Dr. Mordrid .
0 the first Scanners may not have been a great movie , but at least it was original.there is no such novelty to this one.the acting is worse , in my opinion , and the story is slower and nothing special.i also did n't like the dialogue.and the special effects are no better than in the original.this is movie is inferior to the first one in all ways.the only thing different about it , is that it is loud and chaotic at times.but that does n't make a good movie.if they had done something better with the story and made it interesting , this could have been a decent movie.i actually could n't get through it all without fast forwarding through it.to me , this is a forgettable movie , and not much more.despite all that , there are worse movies.being in a generous mood , i'll give Scanners 2 a 4/10 .
0 I agree with other users comments in that the two main roles were well acted , that being the guy that played Gary Gillmore and Giovanni 's role . Too bad the story was so boring . Not hearing about the story I knew nothing of Gary Gillmore before the movie so I did n't know what to expect . I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walking or The Chamber but how wrong I was . The whole movie was just talking , talking and talking about their mom and dad . The only cool scenes were the flashbacks where the dad would lose his temper . That was the only interest I got from this borefest .
0 Jim Belushi is having a mid life crisis , nothing is going right , when his car goes out on him .. he goes into an empty bar where Michael Caine shows him what life would ve been like if one event in high school had come out differently .. A good premise with some moments .. but mostly flat and uninteresting . on a scale of one to ten .. 3
0 i searched video store everywhere to find this movie , being the huge elvis fan that i am , and i found it to be a huge disappointment . kurt russel had most of the " elvis moves " down and the voice imitation was great , but the dubbed in singing voice of elvis just did nt work for me . the voice did nt always match up with russels mouth , and it was hard for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was noticeable . also , there were so many freaking discrepancies in the film , people who do nt know much about elvis would probably think them to be facts . songs are sung by him earlier than he recorded them in real life , the time when he got his first guitar is wrong , i m pretty sure his brother jesse garron was buried in an unmarked grave , not one with a huge headstone reading JESSE GARRON . i know it was just a tv movie , but they skipped over important events , like the come - back - special , and dragged some scenes out for way too long . if you want to see a good movie that shows elvis in his prime rent THATS THE WAY IT IS , or another elvis concert . hearing and seeing the real elvis preform is the only way to truly see his talent . ( brilliant statement i know , but still ... go out and rent a good elvis flic . )
0 I ca n't believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10 . I could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons , but what would possess anyone to continue to rate it high after that ? I was a huge fan the 1st season . I was hooked - all the mystery , suspense , unexplained events . You never knew what was going to happen next . By season 2 , I was still watching faithfully , but was getting a little frustrated that some basic things had yet to be explained . And instead of giving you more answers , it just seemed like more questions . I LOVE suspense , but you have to throw people a bone every now and then to keep them watching.<br /><br />Now , I ca n't even remember what finally turned me off , but somewhere in season 2 , I had enough . I 'm not a big fan of appointment viewing - and you clearly ca n't miss an episode to stay up on what 's happening . So , it was no longer worth the effort to me.<br /><br />It 's a shame that they could n't have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans . I agree with some of the posters that it appears ABC just got greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show out . Do n't they realize that in the end , they are going to lose more fans than they could possibly gain .
0 this movie is made for Asian / Chinese market , targeting particularly fans of Jay Chou , one of the biggest music star in Asian.<br /><br />Jay Chou is a very talented song writer / singer . He is mediocre as an actor , although he did appear in several big - budget productions ( " initial D " , " Curse of the Golden Flower ") . Amazingly , he won both golden horse ( taiwan ) and Hong Kong film awards for " initial D".<br /><br />The supporting cast are very well chosen , which appeals basically everyone from China . The cast including many famous movie / TV actors , singers , even sport commentator ( Huang Jianxiang from China ) . However , they were not given enough time to show their talents.<br /><br />The biggest mistake is that Chu took over both director and writer position . He has a reputation of making shallow and brainless movies based off non - coherent scripts . With his poor directing and lam story , the whole talented cast , fancy vision effects and tones of production money was wasted.<br /><br />However , the terrible movie successfully cashed in over 10 million dollars , maybe even more in Asian , which made this one of the biggest box office success in Asian.<br /><br />The bottom line is : you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are wasted , or if you are simply accompanying your kids who are fans of Jay Chou .
0 Lot of silly plot holes in the film . First we see him watching his master practice kung - fu , and die in the midst of his practice . That 's fine with me . And then at the end of the film , we see him use the kung - fu that he learned just by watching his master when he was still a kid . Is that even possible ? I do n't think so.<br /><br />This show is purely for Jay Chou fans , and the film lacks a depth in terms of character development , cinematography styles and unfolding of plot.<br /><br />Anybody notice that the captain of the basket team ( forgot his name ) and the idolized player Li Xiao look so similar to each other , to the extent that you 'd think they were the one and same person ? Long hair , sunshine - boy look , tall and strong . The two of them looked like they came out from a mass production factory designed to churn out products that makes teenage girls scream wild in orgasm . Not that those two actors had anything of value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the movie industry at all.<br /><br />The jokes were lame and not funny at all.<br /><br />The scene with regards to the 4 masters of Jay Chou coming back to help him out in the basketball court , degenerated into a pointless plot when they started bashing their opponents ala Royal Rumble style . Worse of all , when the 4 masters won the fight , the crowd began cheering , and the match continued . It was truly a WTF ? moment.<br /><br />At the end of the show , when they win the match , all thanks to Jay Chou 's excellent kung fu skills . How he acquired those kung - fu skills is a mystery , because the show somehow shows him acquiring the skills just by observing his master.<br /><br />And then his long - lost father comes out of the woodwork to acknowledge Jay Chou as his long - lost son seemed just a tad too quick of the director to wrap up the film.<br /><br />In short , this is a Jay Chou - flick ( instead of the usual " chick flick " ) . Watch it only if Jay Chou is your fan . If you are one of those whose tastes in movies coincide greatly with those in the list of IMDb 's top 250 films of all time , then this film is not for you .
0 Kid found as a baby in the garbage and raised at a martial arts academy has a knack for sinking baskets . With the help of the man who found him he gets in to college and is promoted to the championship as he searches for his real parents . Infinitely better in pieces action comedy is a real mess as a whole . It seems to be striving for a hipper basketball version of Shaolin Soccer , but the comedy is scatter shot , its focus wanders more than a Chihuahua with ADD on quadruple espresso . I kept asking " What am I watching " . I watched it from start to finish and I still do n't know what the hell happened . Its a shame since there are some great action scenes , some amusing jokes and the occasional moment , but nothing , none of it ever comes together , I 'd take a pass .
0 The direction had clearly stated that this film 's idea and plot is totally original .... however , as to those who have read ' slam dunk ' comic , we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes ... <br /><br />Another note is Jay Chow himself DO NOT know Kung Fu , it just wo n't impress anyone if he tries to act like he can , many people today can see the differences .. Luckily the movie do not contain much of KunG Fu fighting and much are enchanced by stunners and visual effects ... <br /><br />I think that Jay 's acting is still a pain to watch , especially when almost everyone else in the film is so much better . The only reason I think why Jay is the main actor is simply is for his popularity.<br /><br />Despite how hard I wish to stop anyone from watching this thus making this " orginal " movie getting what it should n't have , it has became one of the best budget films in China for this year .
0 Having read during many years about how great this film was , how it established Ruiz among the french critics ( specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd ) , when I finally watched it about a year ago , I found it pretty disappointing ( but then , I guess my expectations were sky - high ) . Shot in saturated black and white , this deliberately cerebral film ( made for TV , and mercifully , only an hour long ) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off - screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings ( which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants ) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime . ( The awful Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument ) . Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie , but I would say almost any Borges story is more interesting than this film .
0 Years have gone by since Don Wilson used his martial arts expertise to take down a robot who was programmed to destroy him , he 's also married to the blonde reporter ( Stacie Foster ) who led the rebellion in the first film , now a new conspiracy is in the works , one that involves look - alike droids who frame our two heroes , and a corporation looking to rule the world ( There is no plot to back any of this up ) and Cyber Tracker 2 becomes a virtual replay of the first movie . I admit that I have bought DVDs from the bargain bin that were made by PM , PM was a company that specialized in cheap - jack action flicks ( like this ) which had tons of explosions , little story and overall nothing but mean edged action . Some of these titles have been ( mildly ) enjoyable ( Last Man Standing and The Sweeper ) however Cyber Tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma - less Don Wilson . When comparing the protagonists of similar PM efforts both Jeff Wincott and C. Thomas Howell are Oscar nominees when compared to Don Wilson . Another telling sign is that this was directed by Richard Pepin who has none of the flair Joseph Merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets . Then again though both C. Thomas and Wincott are probably more expensive to obtain . Cyber Tracker 2 is a rip off with a capitol R , there are so many steals from better movies ( Robocop , Terminator , Universal Soldier to even Halloween III ! ) that it 's almost as if Richard Pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action , Cyber Tracker 2 falls flat . There is literally no good idea that is n't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact . The only exception comes from Tony Burton who is miles better than the material . Also Stacie Foster looks like she could be better with far better material . However Cyber Tracker 2 comes off mainly as noisy , bland and lackluster as its leading man , however with no real martial arts sequences to fall back on , all there is , is lots of cars tipping over and that alone is no substitute for the bankruptcy of ambition expressed here.<br /><br />*1/2 out of 4-(Poor )
0 Plot Synopsis : When his wife , a news reporter , is kidnapped & replaced with an android double , Secret Service agent Eric Phillips tracks her down & uncovers a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders.<br /><br />I was n't expecting much when I first saw this sequel to Richard Pepin 's low - budget sci - fi / action hybrid " Cyber Tracker " . That film was nothing special , not to mention a blatant rip - off of both " The Terminator " & " RoboCop " . This sequel is the same as before , with an all - out action sequence opening the film . There are plenty of explosions , heavy gunfire & a huge bodycount , as well as some martial - arts moves courtesy of the film 's star , Don " The Dragon " Wilson . The whole film seems like a series of action scenes strung together with minimal plot . On the acting front , Wilson is a bad actor . He really needs a personality transplant .
0 Shintarô Katsu gained tons of fame playing the wonderful character , Zatoichi . The Zatoichi films had a weird and unbelievable concept -- a blind guy is the greatest swordsman in Japan and spends each movie righting wrongs and exacting retribution on evil doers . He 's a heck of a nice guy and the films are exciting and addictive ( I 've actually seen every movie ) . It is because of this I saw this final installment of the Hanzo the Razor series , as I assumed it would be very similar .... and boy was I wrong ! It turns out that the Hanzo films are extremely sexual in nature and they also promote the rape of " women who deserve it " . You see , Hanzo is a policeman from the Meiji period and he regularly takes evil women into custody and interrogates them by violently raping them with his " penis of steel " . How he made his member so strong is something you have to see to believe , but it certainly is NOT for the squeamish.<br /><br />Overall , I just ca n't recommend anyone sees these violent and misogynistic films . However , from looking at the other reviews , I can see that they are still very popular ... and that is pretty scary . Despite some decent acting and amazing fight scenes , the films just are like brain pollution -- and I 'd hate to imagine how the films might have contributed to violence towards women .
0 This is one of those movies where I wish I had just stayed in the bar.<br /><br />The film is quite frankly boring . What story there is is very flimsy and you pretty much have to guess at it . The film indulges itself with pretentious camera techniques that seem intent on causing migraines and makes it look like a student film . Did I say it was boring already ? If all the characters had suddenly died at the end of the movie I would not have cared less as I had no emotional attachment to any of them.<br /><br />There are about 4 good minutes in this movie , but that was about it . This is the first time I have ever considered walking out of a cinema during a performance , but I held on believing that it had to get better . I was wrong.<br /><br />The sort of film you could threaten naughty children with .
0 The acting may be okay , the more u watch this movie , the more u wish you were n't , this movie is so horrible , that if I could get a hold of every copy , I would burn them all and not look back , this movie is terrible ! !
0 This was a truly insipid film . The performances are third rate , and the dialogue is so stilted that at times it seemed to have just rolled over and died . My reason for renting this was simple : Find a movie with scriptwriting . I needed a visual aid for my presentation , so I figured why not use a clip ? Boy was I wrong . After searching my local video store , I came upon this , where it was suspiciously titled " Starstruck " . I thought , " What the hey " , and decided to give it a try . Well , I was very unhappy with my results . There was maybe one scene I could use , and meanwhile , I was practically falling asleep because of the sheer banality of the flick . So ..... I took this back and picked up Ed Wood . There 's a movie I can use as an example . Then again , anything would be presentable compared to the drivel that is " Starfucker " .
0 I have a high tolerance for the weird , but frankly some movies go way , way beyond weird -- so far that they make your brain hurt . This is such a film . Trying to understand it or even explain it is impossible and I think the film is best understood while taking drugs -- it 's that incomprehensible.<br /><br />The film begins with some very cute Japanese animation involving a cat . However , out of the blue , tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things occur -- making me wonder if I am losing something in the translation . However , even if this is so , why did we need to be treated to images of a magic trick involving dismembering a lady with a clever , defecation , puking , lighting animals on fire , etc .. All this really seemed random and pretty awful . Oddly , and I do n't know why , some see this as a work of genius . I just do n't get that .
0 OK , the box looks promising . Whoopi Goldberg standing next to Danny Glover parodying the famous farmer and his wife painting . Then you pop this baby in the DVD player and all hope is lost in less then five minutes . Supposed to be a comedy . And I must admit I did laugh once about ten minutes before the ending . This movie has the following elements : A battered and abused next door neighbor , a boring legal trial , racisim , talk of lynchings , and death and arson . Hilarious , huh ? No , please , if you never listen to anyone 's reviews , please do here . You can not even force yourself to watch this crap . CRAP ! I said it , CRAP ! Whoever put there name on this should indeed sue .
0 I was true to my regard for Mr. Glover and Ms. Goldberg . I watched the entire film with my family and some friends . I have no idea what the movie was about . After much discussion , we all agreed that this was not one of their better efforts.<br /><br />It does n't hang together very well . It is too choppy , and there is little comedy . I am disappointed . It could have been much better.<br /><br />I waited months to see this film based on the liner notes.<br /><br />Don't waste your money unless you are a completist and just want to see all of Mr. Glover 's and Ms. Goldberg 's films.<br /><br />It was a poor way to spend an evening .
0 I find myself wondering what the people who gave this a 10 saw in it that I did n't . This movie has a VERY hard time following and/or staying to a plot . If someone tells you it 's a comedy , do n't be fooled , it 's about 98 % percent odd - drama and 2 % comedy . All actors turn in a great performance , that can not be denied , however it seems like it really lost something somewhere . Do n't know if the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what . This had potential , and instead it was really a flop . I would really like the hour and a half I invested in this movie back , but the video rental place does n't do returns on time . Save your money and see something else .
0 This movie made me feel as if I had missed some important scenes from the very beginning . There were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started . I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover , in addition to that have always trusted & respected Danny Glovers taste in his choice of roles , " Grand Canyon " for example . I just could not finish this movie , after what seemed an eternity , but was probably just a little over an hour ; we had to turn it off . There was no comedy , there was nothing about the characters to make you empathize or sympathize with them , there was no evoking of emotion at all regarding this movie and the clips of their past were poorly edited , confusing , and unnecessary . What could have been a great idea for a movie , even as a drama & not a comedy ( although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better , because I love to watch white people freak out & start acting like complete idiots , it makes me laugh ) became a waste of my $ 1 credit at the video store .
0 I do n't believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the United States as The 700 Club . They are today 's equivalent to the Ku Klux Klan of the 20th century . Their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand . Their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of Americans , as well as billions of humans the world over , who do n't happen to share their bigoted , cruel , monstrous , and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen . The lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth , such as the idea of " life after death " or " god " or " sin " or " the devil " is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill , so lost are they in their fantasy . Sane people know that religion is a drug and should n't let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy . However , The 700 Club is in a class by itself . They are truly a cult . While I believe in freedom of speech , they way they spread hatred , lies , disinformation , and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits . I hope that one day the American Psychiatric Association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way , people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all . Treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country , as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion . The 700 Club though , is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of ' cult ' but due to The 700 Club 's vast wealth ( conned daily from the millions of Americans locked in their deceitful grip ) they are above the law in this country . For those of you who have seen the movie " The Matrix " you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth : the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes , and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them.<br /><br />In less civil times , the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with The 700 Club out of town with torches and pitchforks . But in today 's world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them , we have no way to rid ourselves of the 700 Club plague . < br /><br />The television ratings system and the " V " chip on TV 's should also have a rating called " R " for religion , so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape , such as presented by The 700 Club every day all over our country , from themselves and their children .
0 Well this just maybe the worst movie ever at least the worst movie i have ever seen . They have tried out these 666 child of Satan the anti Christ kinda movies about 1000 times and none of them is good and this just maybe the worst of them . They think that it 's going to be better movie as more they use that fake blood . This movie does n't have any idea in it , actors and filming is just terrible . Ca nt even make out that 10 line minium of this movie . Really nothing to tell about but that it 's just horrible . How they can make movies like that in their right mind just ca n't understand that . This ca nt be a Hollywood movie , is it ? Just do n't go watch this use your money more wisely .
0 I was supposed to review this for a website , and I watched this with optimism that perhaps it would at least be a cheesy yet entertaining rip off , and it did n't even do that well enough.<br /><br />"666 : The Child " is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I 've ever seen ( Even worse than " Godsend " ) with scenes that rip from " The Omen " without shame . The ending is even very similar to the way " The Omen " ends . < br /><br />Not to mention that the acting , writing , and story are all just hackneyed . If these movies make money , I 'm sad to see where Asylum is headed . It 's embarrassing .
0 I actually like Asylum movies . I 've made it a habit to see as many as possible . Even the rip - offs they 've done have been cool like EXORCISM And WHEN A KILLER CALLS . This is just plain lame . I ca n't believe that the same people who made DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA 'S CURSE actually made this movie too ! ! ! It 's not even laughably bad like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION ( which , by the way are pretty bad ) . This is just BAD ! I mean , I can appreciate and/or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an Asylum movie , but this film takes itself way too seriously . I really hope that SNAKES ON A TRAIN is better . Now that 's a movie I ca n't wait to see .
0 Well , it 's all been said about this movie and I hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said what 's to be said . But the thing is , I have seen zillions of movies and I am working on writing reviews on all the movies that I 've seen . So , I have to write something.<br /><br />The acting is stupid . It 's truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash . The nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child . the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be . Do n't they realize that even rip - offs can still be scary . We do n't see how the granpa is killed . The dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die , you just do n't sympathize with them . And uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better . We just hear him scream and we see nothing !
0 This movie is quite possibly one of the most horrible horror flicks I 've seen . The length was n't nearly long enough to include a good storyline . Also , the way the foster parents died was just plain ridiculous . The mother suddenly dies from falling through a shower after tripping over an action figure , and the dad is shot by a police officer ? I can see where some originality might have been what they were going for , but it could have been better . Also , the cheesiness of it all made me want to press stop before it was over . After hearing all of Lucy 's name and figuring out it was ' Lucifer ' , I wanted to gag . Yes , it 's interesting that Lucifer was a woman , but look at the name . It 's a male 's name . It should be given to a male character . All in all , the movie was a bore , and could have used a better plot .
0 Honestly I am not even joking when I say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! This film dosen't have a single ounce of originality in its flimsy dialog or its blatantly plagiarized story line . I can not even begin to count the number of things in this film that are obviously ripped off from " The Omen " and other movies like it . For example the nanny " Lucy " in this film is actually one of the devil 's minions sent to guide and protect the spawn of Satan ..... does this sound a lot like Mrs. Baylock to anyone else . Another thing is that the orphanage were they first got the child burned to the ground just a few months after he was adopted , just like in " The Omen " . However luckily one priest survived the blaze and escaped with sever burns all over his body .... yet another coincidence ? ? ? ? ? ? And to top it all off the burned priest is staying in a hospital room with pictures of Jesus all over the walls , much like the priest in " The Omen " having pages of the Bible plastered on the walls like wall - paper . Please do n't even get me started drawing comparisons between the ending of this movie and " The Omen " for you because as I 've stated above there are far too many to mention here .
0 Bad . Bad . Bad . Bad . Bad . What else can I say . Kate Jackson must have been desperate to direct . May be she should go back to acting ... on second thought she was a bad actress to . Who would put money in to producing something this bad . I like anti - Christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the odd scare but this one is just Bad Bad Bad . The acting by the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera . The special effects , if you can call them that , where laughable . I would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion you would see the tubes the blood shoots out of . We had to turn the disc off after only 30 minutes . This so called movies original prints should be destroyed , all disc ' and tapes destroyed and all the people associated with the making of the movie have to pay back money to the people that rented the movie . Then those people should never be allowed to act , direct or film any thing but their own home movies .
0 This is listed as a documentary , it 's not , it 's filmed sort of like a documentary but that I suspect was just because then they get away with a shaky camera and dodgy filming . This has just been released in the UK on DVD as an " American Pie style comedy " it 's not that either.<br /><br />Basically it follows around a group of teens on spring break as they go to Mexico for cheap booze and with the quest being to get there virgin friend finally laid . Throw is a couple of dwarfs , also on the same sort of quest and you have a non - hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls.<br /><br />Considering the 18 Rating this has very little nudity , and practically zero sex scenes , mainly I guess the rating is for swearing of which there is plenty.<br /><br />If you like crude Jackass behaviour without the humour , then this may be your thing , if you have any brain cells left then I would probably avoid this !
0 Mislead by the terrible lie on the cover , " fun as American Pie " , my girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV waiting for a comedy ... and this is definitely not one . You probably wo n't laugh one time if you 're not one of those Jackass - like ever - teeny minds . It 's not even an erotic movie , which would at least been something , given that it 's about sex ... <br /><br />So , what is this ? The erratic plot deals with a guy who wants to lose virginity ( zero in originality , I remember " Losing it " for one ) and his gang of friends . The rest of the characters ( i.e. the girls ) just come and go for no credible reason . Come on , there are even Dwarfs ( so simple : " dwarves are fun ho ho " ... ) The acting is very TV - like ( as is the video look throughout the movie ) and definitely amateur in the case of most of the girls ... <br /><br />Awful movie . Amateurish , badly produced , and over all NOT FUNNY . Kids and teens will love to watch it with friends because of the swearing and sex jokes . Other than that , do n't even think of renting this movie .
0 It was the tag - line " in the tradition of American Pie " that fooled me into renting this movie . What I got was a piece of junk in the style of Jackass , with the major difference that compared to this Jackass the Movie seems like a Citizen Kane.<br /><br />This movie made me regret that I rewarded other movies with 1 out of 10 , because now I ca n't go beneath that . This one makes quite some bad movies look like cinematic feats.<br /><br />I actually turned it off after 45 minutes , and that 's something I very rarely do . But it was just too plain boring , stupid , uninteresting and unnecessary.<br /><br />Can't believe some people actually reward this with 10 out of 10 . What did your parents do ? Drop you on the head when you were just a child ? Or was it the very first movie you ever saw , so you got nothing to compare it to ? Are you still a virgin and are breasts all you ever think off ? Something must be wrong , at least.<br /><br />My advice : stay clear of this one . Even if your in the mood for a simple movie that does n't require thinking , choose something else , or you 'll regret it for sure .
0 my friend bought the movie for 5 ( its is not even 1 cent worth ) , because they wrote it was like American pie . but we would soon find out that there is a long way from American pie to that piece of crap . it is not even a comedy , its more like a really really really bad documentary . not only the story is bad , the picture and sound also sucks to . they put in some alcohol , chicks , dwarfs and drunken teens . and the result is a disaster . if you see this movie do n't buy it , rather spend your money on something else , and better . if you are gon na torture yourself , then do n't invite your friend / s , unless you hate really much and you want to get rid of them .
0 The fact that this movie made it all the way to the rentalrack in Norway is bizarre . This movie is just awful . This image quality is just one teeny bit better than you get of a mobile phone and the plot is soooo bad . The main character is just plain annoying and the rest just suck . Every person affiliated with this movie should be ashamed . The fact that the people that made this movie put their name on this is extraordinary . And the distributors ; did they even see it ! ? This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen . To label this a comedy is an insult to mankind . I urge you not to support this movie by buying or renting it .
0 I have n't seen it in over twenty years . OJ was the bus driver , Arte Johnson was the tour guide , Lorenzo was the kidnapper.<br /><br />Yea , Lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain , a natural . I think I watched it back then most for OJ , who I had seen Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing , but also to see Arte Johnson.<br /><br />I was a little bored that Johnson was so serious.<br /><br />And yes , it shifted plots . In reading other posts , I remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl , but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue.<br /><br />I was going , a stamp ? If it came on as a late movie , I would probably record it to check it out again , but I would n't be nostalgic over it . Not yet anyway.<br /><br />There are better movies from the seventies like this to check out .
0 This movie is an idiotic attempt at some kind of action thriller . A tour bus on its way to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white trash hijackers driving dune buggies . They drive them out into the desert and then steal all of their valuables . The plot changes constantly . One minute they are looking to kidnap a rich ranchers daughter , the next they are looking for a collectible stamp worth 90,000 dollars . The dialogue is horrible.<br /><br />Please do n't watch this movie .
0 There are laughs in this film , that is for sure . Michael Keaton is a talent and he used to be funny ( before he decided he was a serious actor ) . However , what bothers me so much about this film , is how unlikable practically all of the characters are . Other than the main two leads , everybody is a jerk . I mean , these small town losers are about as uncouth as you can get . You just watch and think , man , these losers should be unemployed . Moreover , the American factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob . It made me wonder if this film was made by Japanese nationalists . Oh sure , in the end they all come together as one , but I just did not enjoy the trip to get there .
0 Gung Ho was a good idea , however it is to much to ask Americans viewers to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition . In this movie the main character Hunt Stevenson(Michael Keaton ) goes to Japan and convinces a Japanese auto company to come to America and help his dying Pennslyvania town . Two things come at you . First why would a Japanese company come to America to make cars when they do so , and so well at that ? Secondly can anyone understand that American companies of all types go to third world nations to have their products made to escape American labor costs ? It makes the film 's premise then that the Number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its ' top competitors(aside from Germany)and put a plant there as unrealistic . Keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time . But he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but Director Ron Howard ca n't keep this from becoming a TV movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of Japanese and American relations not withstanding . Gung Ho has a Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley feel to it as the producers of both TV shows made the film and then made the TV version of this movie as well which gives the film its ' lightweight feel . The Japanese manager gets to love his American workers and feels he and other Japanese people can learnfrom Americans . His No.2 man Saito who supposedly does n't like Americans all that much does n't think so . I would have prefered all the Japanese characters been like Saito than the soft goofball characters they made the Japanese out to be . It would have made the film more interesting .
0 talk about your waste of money .. i m just wondering why Michael would star in such a turkey of a movie .. Michael is a Great actor especially in the movie where he plays a man dying of cancer .. that was wonderful . as he tapes himself for his son to see it once he grows up .. Michael is such a talented actor .. so what made him do this one ? ? ? i watched it and thought it was really dumb .. i guess at one time in their career they have the crappy movies .. especially " The Squeeze " i did nt understand that one At all , and i feel his best performance was in " Pacific Heights " , his character really creeped me out .. and i really enjoyed " Multiplicity " . .that one was so Hilarious ! ! ! and he was just Perfect for the role of " Batman " .. and i kind of liked " Night Shift " and i love " Johnny Dangerously " too .. just too bad some of them end up doing lousy movies .. like this one was ...
0 ... not that all Disney films are garbage.<br /><br />Anyway , I saw " Legend of Boggy Creek " first and absolutely loved the film . When I heard it had 2 sequels , I was ecstatic . I finally found a copy of this and watched it one night . I do n't see how they can make a G - rated sequel to a horror film . The original is a movie / documentary about the Fauke Monster , and can scare anyone . " Return " is for kids and should not be watched by anyone . I do n't remember the plot too well , as it 's been quite some time since I watched it and I will not watch it again , but ... It 's about these hunters coming to town and they go looking to kill Bigfoot . Three little kids sneek out of the house to stop them . A big monsoon comes through . The hunters get hurt , are saved by the kids . Then they all hide out in a boat with a big piece of tarp on top and try to wait out the storm . Then all of a sudden , Bigfoot comes and does something really sick . I do n't wanna ruin the ending for any of yas , but it 's not scary . Well ....
0 Never saw the original movie in the series ... I only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980 's as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified . This movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now . Anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie . It was , however , a movie that would make some Walt Disney movies look dark . Really , this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen . The only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm , other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid . The story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water . Not really worth watching I would however like to see the original , granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80 's , but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70 's " The Town the Dreaded Sundown " .
0 I thought I had seen this movie , twice in fact . Then I read all the other reviews , and they did n't quite match up . A man and three young students , two girls and a boy , go to this town to study alleged bigfoot sightings . I still feel pretty confident that this is the movie I saw , despite the discrepancies in the reviews . Therefore I 'm putting my review back : If you like the occasional ' B ' movie , as I do , then Return to Boggy Creek is the movie for you ! Whether it 's setting the sleep timer , and nodding off to your favorite movie - bomb , or just hanging out with friends . Boggy Creek , the mute button , and you 've got a fun night of improv . Look out ! Is the legend true ? I think we just might find out , along with a not - so - stellar cast . Will there be any equipment malfunctions at particularly key moments in the film ? Does our blonde , manly , young hero have any chest hair ? Will the exceptionally high - tech Technicolor last the entire film ? You 'll have to watch to find out for yourself .
0 Has to be one of the worst wastes of 35 mm movie film ever unleashed on the public , the sequel to the at least entertaining pseudo - documentary original film " The Legend of Boggy Creek " . Bad script , worse acting , etc . , etc . , Dawn Wells had to be hoping that Gilligan would come rescue her and take her back to the island just to escape from this piece of clap - trap .
0 Between 1937 and 1939 , Twentieth Century - Fox made a ton of Mr. Moto films . However , towards the end of the series , it was obvious that the studio had " jumped the shark " , so to speak . This phrase indicates that a TV show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to invigorate the show by fundamentally changing the formula . For example , with " The Brady Bunch " they introduced the annoying ' Cousin Oliver ' and with " Family Ties " they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season ! With the Moto films , they 'd jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be re - tooled . In the previous film , Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler . And , in this film the character Archibald Featherstone appears . Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever , as you kept hoping someone ( preferably Moto ) would kill him just to shut him up ! ! Although he 's supposed to work for the famed Scotland Yard , he shows all the intelligence and acumen of a brain damaged turnip . Again and again , his scenes were boorish and unnecessary and Peter Lorre just looks pained as he stands there and watches this buffoon " act " . It 's so bad that it truly destroys what COULD have been one of the better Moto films due to its clever plot.<br /><br />As for the plot , the crown of the Queen of Sheba is discovered in the opening scene . Moto , now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was , is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen . In a great twist , several thieves all try to steal the crown independently of each other.<br /><br />Overall , the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that the Moto series should have ended here . With WWII approaching , the films could n't have survived much longer anyway , as having a sympathetic Japanese leading character simply would n't have been accepted in the US or in allied countries .
0 After eight Moto films the series had run its course , as this last entry demonstrates . Peter Lorre was clearly weary of trying to pump some sort of human interest and entertainment value into the wispy character of Moto , and the dreadful idea of pairing him with a " funny " British sidekick utterly defeats all his efforts here .
0 My wife and I just finished watching Bûsu AKA The Booth . She fell asleep during some parts of the movie . I really wish I had taken a snooze with her , but the unfortunate fact is that the main character 's voice is so loud and grating that it was impossible for me to sleep . When our protagonist speaks , it makes me want to hear Regis Philbin and William Shatner sing karaoke . He also has no redeeming qualities . I was hoping he 'd get hit by a bus five minutes into the film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong , I love Asian horror cinema , but The Booth is extremely irritating and full of scenes that really make no damned sense at all . If you want some good Asian cinema , check out A Tale of Two Sisters or Into The Mirror . Avoid The Booth like the plague , especially if you suffer from frequent migraines .
0 Just like last years event WWE New Years Revolution 2006 was headlined by an Elimination Chamber match . The difference between last years and this years match however was the entertainment value . In reality only three people stood a chance of walking out of the Pepsi Arena in Albany , New York with the WWE Championship . Those men were current champion John Cena , Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels . There was no way Vinnie Mac would put the belt on any of the rookies ; Carlito or Chris Masters . And Kane ? Kane last held the WWE Championship in June 1998 , and that was only for one night . It was obvious he was n't going to be the one either . Last years match was a thrilling affair with six of the best WWE had to offer . 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair but still the match of the night by far.<br /><br />The only surprise of the evening came after the bell had run on the main event . Out strolled Vince McMahon himself and demanded they lift the chamber . It was then announced that Edge was cashing in his money in the bank championship match right then and there . With no time to prepare and just off the back of winning the Elimination Chamber match John Cena did not stand a chance and dropped the title after a spear to one of the most entertaining heels in WWE . This was the only entertaining piece of action that happened all night.<br /><br />The undercard , like last year , was truly atrocious . Triple H and The Big Show put on a snore fest that had me struggling to stay away . HHH picked up the win but that was never in any real doubt was it ? Any pay - per - view that has both Jerry Lawler and Viscera wrestling on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success really does it . The King pinned Helms ( who books this stuff ? ) and Big Vis tasted defeat against the wasted Shelton Benjamin with a little help from his Mama.<br /><br />The women of the WWE also had a busy night . There was the usual Diva nonsense with a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match which was won by Ashley and the Woman 's Championship was also on the line . In a match , I thought would have been left to brew till WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good match . Trish won the contest but it was evident that this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />The opening contest of the night pitted soon to be WWE Champion Edge against Intercontinental Champion , Ric Flair . This could have been better but it was a battered and bloody Flair that retained after a disqualification finish . Edge obviously had bigger fish to fry.<br /><br />So New Years Revolution kicked off the 2006 pay - per - view calendar in disastrous fashion . The only good thing from that is knowing that for the WWE the only way is up . They do n't get much worse than this .
0 * Some spoilers * < br /><br />This movie is sometimes subtitled " Life Everlasting . " That 's often taken as reference to the final scene , but more accurately describes how dead and buried this once - estimable series is after this sloppy and illogical send - off.<br /><br />There 's a " hey kids , let 's put on a show air " about this telemovie , which can be endearing in spots . Some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances . Co - writer , co - producer Tom Fontana and his pals pack the goings - on with friends and favorites from other shows , as well as real Baltimore personages.<br /><br />That 's on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the television 's show varied casts , your old favorites as well as later non - favorites.<br /><br />There was always a tug - of - war pitting quality - conscious executive producer Barry Levinson , Fontana , James Yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budget - conscious NBC execs , who simply wanted a another moronic police procedural like " Nash Bridges , " which regularly beat " Homicide " in the ratings . The pressure told as the show bounced between riveting realism that transcended its form , and sleazy sensationalism that demeaned it.<br /><br />Unfortunately for this movie , Fontana , co - writers Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and director Jean de Segonzac simply threw in the towel . They took the most ludicrous story are from the series , topped it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new plot line , and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast members.<br /><br />Briefly , some time has passed since the last episode of the show . The former heart of Baltimore 's homicide unit , Yaphet Kotto as Lt . Al Giardello , is now a Kurt Schmoke - like candidate for mayor , and Schmoke himself makes a cameo appearance . But this promising start immediately and improbably takes a tragic turn.<br /><br />The spotlight shifts to Giancarlo Esposito as Giardello 's son Mike . A handsome man who has done good work elsewhere , Esposito was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly enliven the TV series . But the question for viewers always was : is Mike that uncomfortable as Gee 's son , or is Esposito that uncomfortable in the role?<br /><br />To be fair , Esposito does n't get a chance to play out the main story without interruption . That 's because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that spat on the intelligence of the show 's loyal voters.<br /><br />An apparent snuff streaming video was promoted , and then seemed to actually take place , on the Internet . After some red herrings , the detectives arrested a repellent suspect . But Zaljko Ivanek 's harassed and overworked Deputy States Attorney forgot to file motions in time , and the suspect was released , only to be murdered later.<br /><br />Let 's summarize : he forgot to file the paperwork because it was n't the most sensational case of his career , because the mayor , the attorney general , the governor , the entire Maryland Legislature , the U.S. Attorney General , NBC , Court TV , the BBC , AP , Reuters , People , The Sun , the Washington Post , the New York Times , the LA Times , Time Magazine , The Times of London , The Economist , The Johannesburg Mail and Guardian , L'Osservatore Romano , Le Figaro , Paris Match , L'Equipe and Computer World were n't calling every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case.<br /><br />Nevertheless , the old gang of detectives and associates flocks back to Baltimore to help out . There 's quite an array of talent on display . Unfortunately , with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out , some of them are merely on display.<br /><br />Two of the strongest actors , Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo , are criminally underused , while time wasted on Jon Seda and Michael Michelle could be better spent on commercials . The writers do seem to satirize this , presenting Jason Priestley as the latest big - deal detective . On the other hand , they give easy - come , easy - go Michelle Forbes a very affecting scene.<br /><br />There 's some other sly casting , with actual Lt . Gary D'Addario , the center of the book that gave rise to the show , playing another detective . Guests drop in from other shows , like Whitney Allen doing her deadpan and clueless " Miss Sally " from the children 's show beloved by the inmates on Fontana 's " Oz . " Dina Napoli of WBAL TV turns up as herself . < br /><br />Even when entertaining , though , these guests can be distracting . Ed Begley Jr. actually advances the story in his brief appearance , playing Dr. Victor Ehrlich from Fontana 's " St. Elsewhere . " He 's still a vivid character , and fits in a hospital setting . Then you remember , did n't St. Elegius turn out to be an autistic boy 's fantasy?<br /><br />The most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy . This movie was made when Court TV bought re - run rights to the series . That network contributed legal waif Helen Lucaitis , who had interviewed the Homicide team and later appeared on " Oz . " The TV correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news , that is , plot points for latecomers.<br /><br />Although she 's so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways , Lucaitis also adeptly handles a bit of physical comedy with Esposito . He shows more juice in his scenes with Lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues . Perhaps those two should have done a spin - off.<br /><br />As the movie winds down , the cream of the cast rises to the top . Although they are saddled with a loser script , Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor overcome it . Their performances remind viewers what made Homicide , for considerable stretches , the best show on the air and one of the best television productions ever.<br /><br />It 's fun to watch top pros do their stuff ; it 's just a shame this movie does n't give them more of a chance . Die - hard fans may want to see this movie anyway , but you can live without it .
0 I agree with most if not all of the previous commenter 's Tom ( bighouseaz@yahoo.com ) . The Zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement.<br /><br />I have seen Zatoichi 1 - 13,15,16 ; I believe 14 has not been released on Zone 1 ( usa ) . Zatoichi the Outlaw was disappointing . The story line was complicated , and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous Zatoichi story lines . At one point , I was wondering if I was not seeing a remake of a previous Zatoichi film.<br /><br />This film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects ( a head rolling , limbs severed , blood ) and less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character . All the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action , and won a great following without having to resort to effects.<br /><br />I am just hoping that the remaining Zatoichi films do NOT follow the same trend . This is the first Zatoichi film from his studio . I highly recommend all the previous Zatoichi films -- and recommend them .
0 The cult of personality has elevated the status of Roger Corman , Sam Arkoff , Lloyd Kaufman etc . as kings of the B 's . Because the folks at Crown International were so key , they have n't been elevated to the status they richly deserve . A film like THE VAN may now seem like a disposable piece of Drive - in esoteria , but it was a sizable hit when it was released ( not to mention subsequent re - releases as a double feature with other Crown hits).<br /><br />THE VAN was a perfect example of Crown 's hit strategy of seizing upon the mood of movie - goers at the time of a film 's release . Here , it was sex , drugs , rock ' n roll and the brief " Custom Van " fad . As others have noted , it is ironic that the " hit " song in the film refers to a Chevy when the title vehicle is a Dodge in the film itself . I had a town Selectman where I was at the time even declare these vans to be " dens of sin on wheels ! " A perfect ad line for the film!<br /><br />There are the usual assortment of " good " and " bad " girls , muscle - heads and low - brow hijinks ( including a supporting bit by Danny DeVito ) . In many ways this is n't much different from the old Beach Party movies of the 60 's , but now spiced up with Nudity and Drug use . Obviously done on a limited budget and a limited schedule , the film coasts along pleasantly enough with a breezy charm that compensates for some , by today 's standards certainly , un - PC views of women.<br /><br />The classic touch is a Toaster for Bobby 's den of sin on wheels . Yes , a Toaster ! Hey , you got ta have something hot for those munchies!<br /><br />Grindhouse Fest .
0 The title song for this movie ........... is the greatest free spirited ballad ever written ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! < br /><br />I first saw this movie back in 1978 - 79 when I first subscribed to cable . In 1979 cable was just starting to become common place in homes . ( or at least that when it was becoming common here in Missouri).<br /><br />This might very well be the first movie I ever watched on the pay channel called " The Movie Channel " - which was called " The Star Channel " back then , they changed the name to " The Movie Channel " in the early 1980's ........ I received a free month of " The Star Channel " with my new cable subscription . " The Van " was one of the movies that was in heavy rotation on that network at that time.<br /><br />I remember watching this movie back then , and thinking it was a typical teen flick(along the same lines as other medium budget teen flicks ) ... the ones where the plot revolves around nudity and parties.<br /><br />I totally forgot that this movie even existed until I recently seen this movie again after having not seeing it for decades ( I found a copy of it on DVD for sale in cheap bin ) I recognized it , and bought it for a mere $ 4.99.<br /><br />Seems like I had remembered this film being much better that it was(is ) . However watching it back then was a different experience than watching now(30 + years later).<br /><br />It was fun to see the kids listing to rock n roll music , smoking weed , and having sex in the back a fancy van(often all at the same time ) . This is what a good teen party movie should be.<br /><br />There is n't much of a plot other than the fact that the main character fantasizes about having sex with his arch rivals good looking girlfriend ... he blows all of his college savings money to purchase a tricked out Dodge Van(with shag carpet walls . mirrored ceiling and a water bed in it)to get her attention , and he eventually gets to have sex with her . But his arch rival finds out and comes looking for him ( so that the two of them can settle their differences by drag racing their vans) .... he and his arch rival end up wrecking both of their vans , and instead of stealing away his arch rivals girlfriend , he wins over the heart of a preppy(lesser attractive ) girl that he half / ass dates through most of the movie and he decides he is happier / better off and the movie ends.<br /><br />the movie does have it 's funny moments . But watching this movie 30 + years later , it becomes more of a trip down memory lane . Because I still can remember Pizza parlors , pinball arcades , It also brought back memories of cruising around a small town while we smoked pot as we would yell at good looking girls and hoping to get laid ( sometimes I 'd get lucky and get some decent looking girl to share a joint with me and we 'd screw in the backseat afterwords , I also remember many of the songs in this move(when they were new) ...... this movie serves as a perfect time capsule for that era in those regards ( brought back lots of memories)<br /><br />the one thing that is depicted in this movie that I honestly can not remember is .... I never remember a time when full sized vans were as popular as this film depicts them as being . I remember that era very well , and I do n't young men going around wishing they had a van . Instead I remember young men in the 70 's ( self included ) wanting a Pontiac Trans Am , Chevy Camaro or a hot rod Ford Mustang , but never a van . This movie makes it appear as if vans were most popular item going and that every young man wanted one(which just was n't true of that era )
0 This film was abysmal . and not in the good way as some have claimed . First off the main character is a very unattractive gingerman . Second - WTF is going on with this van love . The plot , basically , is : boy wants sex so buys a van ( which , in fairness is quite cool ) . Unbelievably given that he looks like a newt he scores with lots of chicks ! And he fails with some . Then he scores with a really hot chick and realises he loves this dowdy bird who played hard to get . Then he drag races with the hot chicks boyfriend . And he tips his van . At which point danny devito saves the day . Although he did n't need to because in tipping the van the ginger kid crossed the line first . I gave this 2 * 's as i 'm willing to assume that there 's some sort of 70 's Vanning subculture i 'm not getting and also because there 's some 70 's boobage too .
0 Bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex . So he buys a van to aid in this quest . The acting is lame , the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clichés and cheap thrills . The makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time , but fell a long way short . They even resort to Bobby slipping on a banana skin , because this will supposedly add comedic value.<br /><br />I'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film . If you like DeVito , this is another classic DeVito kind of role - but he 's only a supporting actor and there for cliché value .
0 The Van is a feelgood movie about a guy who tries to lure girls into his new van , in order to seduce them . The only thing this movie does n't fail at is precisely depicting the van fad in the US in the late 70s . It looks like it was totally made by amateurs . It 's trash , but I loved it ! I have to admit I am a fan of 70s trash ! Hope this one makes it to the IMDB bottom 100!<br /><br />2
0 This movie was packed pull of endless surprises ! Just when you thought it could n't get worse , they added more joints and more pink fuzzy - lined vans with raunchy sex scenes . As you can guess , I was a victim of the original version . We were tricked into watching it thinking it was Supervan , the host box which promised lasars , jail breaks , and much more . Who would have thought a Dollar Store Christmas present could have been so much fun !
0 I disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed " masterpiece " of the German New Wave : < br /><br />1 ) There are major flaws in simple exposition , in the basic communication of critical plot points , as relating to Maria 's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband . How many viewers understood that the husband agreed , in exchange for substantial financial remuneration , not to return to and reclaim his wife until Oswald was dead?<br /><br />2 ) The ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental . The original screenplay called for Maria to commit suicide after the reading of Oswald 's will , on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald . In the final version , however , Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide . Maria is then summarily blown up , rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self - delusion and moral compromise.<br /><br />3 ) Fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private , the political on the personal . Contrary to what the critics and " experts " assert , I do n't think it works . Merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama . < br /><br />The selfish ambition of Maria 's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so - called economic miracle of postwar Germany . Maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place , but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific . Women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self - advancement for ages . < br /><br />4 ) Lastly , there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness -- Fassbinder 's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect . Unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen ; music is clumsily intrusive in places ; and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting.<br /><br />Strangely , for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust , it itself never mentions it once .
0 This movie was , as Homer Simpson would have put it , " more boring than church . " Maybe I do n't understand it well enough , and I thought it started out pretty well , but after ( START OF SPOILER ) Hermann Braun is sent to jail and Maria starts working / sleeping with her boss it just started to drag , and I struggled to keep awake . Again , maybe it symbolizes something , but the explosion at the end seemed very forced and out of place . ( END OF SPOILER ) . In the end , I fail to see why others think it 's so great , as I found it extremely boring . By the way , I did not watch this movie by my own free will , as I was required to see it for a Film class .
0 Title : Robot Jox ( 1990 ) < br /><br />Director : Stuart Gordon < br /><br />Cast : Gary Graham , Anne Marie Johnson , Paul Koslo < br /><br />Review : Stuart Gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as Re - Animator , From Beyond , Dagon and Castle Freak , took a small detour here and did a little sci - fi flick . I stress the word " little " since this is a very low budget flick , and there in lies its main weakness.<br /><br />The story takes place in the future . A world in which the great superpowers ( that according to this movie are the United States and Russia ) duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war ... but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots . Our hero Achilles must go up against the evil Russian robot fighter called Alexander . Lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues.<br /><br />Well , the idea is awesome I guess . The great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots ? Interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available . Unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director.<br /><br />I as a kid loved this movie , and I guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie , you 'll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it . I showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like " what the hell is this piece of crap franco ? " And I 'm like well this movie is a sci - fi by one of my favorite directors Stuart Gordon ? " But as the movie progressed into corny territory I almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture . I could go through it , cause I loved this film as a kid , and there 's still a little nostalgia attached to watching it . But everyone else was just not going to get it.<br /><br />And I myself realized that the movie is n't really that good . First off . The movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other . And in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you 'd have to use some damn good special effects to make it work , expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief . But unfortunately this being a small scale movie , from a small scale company ( Empire Pictures , which went bankrupt after making this film!)the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them . Heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed.<br /><br />OK granted , once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other . There are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool , and made me go " that s why I liked thid movie ! " But every know and them , some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in . And boom , your right back into realizing this film just does n't live up to its premise.<br /><br />And heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie . This movie is basically a movie for kids . You know , giant robots duking it out ? Stop motion animation ? Hello ? But this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody . So I kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not ? After a while I just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities , which really is n't a good mix.<br /><br />So for those of you who do n't feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you do n't have a nostalgic connection to this movie ( like I do ) well I d suggest you steer clear away from this one . Gordons a great director , but this movie he made , just did n't do it for me . Well , at least not now that I 'm a full grown adult.<br /><br />Rating : 2 out of 5
0 R O B O T J O X.<br /><br />Burn the master.<br /><br />Grotesquely horrible.<br /><br />No ending ; no closure.<br /><br />Completely and utterly the worst movie ever made.<br /><br />Replaces " The Adventures of Pluto Nash " as the worst movie of all time.<br /><br />I hate this utterly unacted , unedited , unscripted , undirected , unproduced mess of a thing called " Robot Jox " - and I just found out - THEY MADE A SECOND ONE ! ? ! ? I apologize to Adma Sandler ( Zohar the Beauticin ) and Eddie Murphy ( Pluto Nash ) for hating their movies . This mess of a thing makes those movies only bad - not terrible horrible and grotesque like this thing . This is the only movie for which I have ever said this - REMOVE IT FROM NETFLIX - NOW ! ! ! 10,000 out of 10 people found this comment helpful .
0 What an awful movie ! The Idea of robots fighting each other is cool , but the storyline is ridiculous , real human action laughable , acting non - existent and special effects ( on which , this type of movie must depend ) are archaic . I thought it must have been made around ' 80-'84 and was amazed to see it was from 1990 . That 's 5 years after Aliens ! OK , lots of people said it was good considering the low budget , but I just think ' what 's the point ? ' . it looks totally unbelievable . I would n't mind seeing a remake with modern special effects and a completely re - written story because I still like the idea of huge robots beating crap out of each other .
0 There are a number of problems with this movie , but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little . The base story is quite good , but the money just was n't there to do the story justice . The non - existent budget really killed this movie . Stuart Gordon ( the writer / director ) has writing credit on ' Honey , I Shrunk the Kids ' , which was a box office smash . However , that movie had some serious cash backing from Disney . Honestly , this is a good example of when to not make a movie . Had he waited a few more years , technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects . ( not to mention he could have found a company with money . )
0 OK this movie had a terrible premise . Be serious according to the movie they had just been through an apocalyptic war yet they have money to buy huge robots and pit them against each other . Each country decides instead of investing into rebuilding their country they would rather fight with robots no one could afford . Here 's a better idea , lets rely on our most inept resource , jocks , to fight our battles . < br /><br />Everyone says what about the director , what about him . He makes a good movie , he makes a bad movie . There is no reason to give this movie some credit just because of the director , maybe he was asleep ? I thoroughly enjoyed this movie , because it was so cheesy and ridiculous I had to laugh . I actually had a good time watching it , well except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be an assassin(trust me no one would see this guy as an assassin , so it is a surprise , however lame ) What kind of training exercise is a jungle jim anyway . I was sad to see Mst3k had not done this one . I am giving a two star rating however because nothing could be as bad as " manos the hands of fate." < br /><br />The budget does not matter either , I have seen plenty of reasonable movies that had nothing for budgets like cube . The storyline was not even plausible and I have seen better acting in school plays . Surly they could have afforded an eleven year old from any middle school play.<br /><br />Anyway pick it up , it is a fun movie to watch .
0 I actually paid to see this movie in the theater.<br /><br />It would get a 1-rating , but the fight scenes between the robots are okay , and there 's a surprise.<br /><br />I realize that some movies have larger budgets than others . I do n't have a problem with that . Unfortunately , science fiction movies probably suffer the most on a small budget for obvious reasons . But , one way this movie fails is that just about every piece of each set looked cheesy and cheap . I mean , could n't they even make it " look " good?<br /><br />The other major reason this movie is horrible is the acting If I watched the movie now and knew what to expect , I might just enjoy it for the cheese - factor , but at the time , I was expecting a good movie and had no clue as to how horrible it would actually end up being.<br /><br />Thankfully , the experience was over in only 85 minutes .
0 Think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as " Power Rangers " and you have this film from 1990 , " Robot Jox " . A movie where you fight with giant robots , two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins . The robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good , it is n't all bad to watch . There are as I recall two robot fights in this one , one that ends badly and the final showdown . There is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed , but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done . The fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage , but still somewhat fun to watch . This movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament . So it is worth checking out once , but probably not more than that .
0 This movie is the perfect illustration of how NOT to make a sci fi movie . The worst tendency in sci - fi is to make your theme an awful , sophomoric , pseudo - Orwellian / Huxleyan / whateverian " vision " of " the human future." < br /><br />Science fiction filmmakers ( and authors ) , as geeks , take themselves very seriously given the high crap - to - good - stuff ratio of their genre . I think other genres with a high CTGSR ( yes , I just made it up , relax ) , like horror or action or even romantic comedy , seem to have a little better grasp of the fact that they are not changing the world with some profound " message." < br /><br />Sci fi can certainly be successful on a serious level , as numerous great filmmakers have proven . But there is an immense downside to the whole concept , which is represented by " Robot Jox , " with its low - rent construction of " the future " ( lone good design element : the bizarre , slick - looking billboard ads all over the place that encourage women to have more babies ) and its painfully heavy - handed " Iliad " parallels ( He 's NAMED ACHILLES FOR GOD 'S SAKE ! I actually did n't pick up on this until I saw the film for like the tenth time , but I went to public school , so the filmmakers are not exonerated.)<br /><br />Of course , if you 're a crazy movie freak like me , this downside has a great upside . I absolutely LOVE movies like this , because bad movies are quite often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones . It 's kind of a Lester Bangs approach to movie viewing , I guess.<br /><br />Note : The lead in this movie ( Gary Graham ? Is that his name ? I refuse to go check . ) is really not that bad . He makes a go of it . He 's kind of cool , especially when he 's drunk / hung over .
0 Sadly I do n't remember the book anymore , but I do recall that I was captivated by the stories of Edgar Wallace . This Film represents a typical German Production of low quality . It does not hold my attention - although the story itself is good , it is just badly adabted . At the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances . Even the well known and liked German Actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Are n't can not rescue this poor spectacle . However there 's hope ... I 've been told that the films following this one are getting better and better . So in conclusion I must say that this film does n't deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon .
0 This movie is an abomination , and its making should have been considered a capital crime.<br /><br />One of the great mysteries of film - making is why nobody ever has made a faithful movie adaptation of this wonderful mystery . It is a tale of a really gripping mystery , nice old - fashioned romance , and dry English humor . Why did the makers have to change Richard Gordon from a Scotland Yard policeman to an amateur detective , introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his English servant , change the part of the main storyline about the murder charge and circumstances of Gordon 's struggle to save the accused , etc . , etc . ? These producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book should write the original script themselves and not to rape another person 's product .
0 I loved Dewaere in Series Noir . His talent is trivialized in " The Waltzers " aka " Going Places " . Okay , it 's a couple of guys flaunting convention in the most absurd and irredeemable ways ; many folks find such behavior amusing . This was a boring , pointless exercise designed to shock . I find the smirk on Blier 's face , the face behind the camera , annoying . Series Noir was a valid expression of personal liberty and licentious behavior . From the first moment when we see Patric Dewaere prancing in the abandoned lot we get an idea of the bewilderingly beautiful anti - hero we 'll be spending time with for the next couple of hours . When we see him chasing the hapless middle aged female with his buddy Depardieu in " Going Places " we have fair warning that two hours spent with these chaps will be soul - draining . I have trouble eking even a " 3 " for this annoying distraction .
0 When I first saw this film , I thought it should have come from the children 's section - It 's very fun and at times humorous , and is actually quite a good story , but it severely lacks the " romantic chemistry " that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are capable of delivering . I must note that Walter Matthau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein , and his performance is extraordinary , but that 's the sole exception . This film appears a bit forced , the directing lacks substance , and oh yeah ... the music is ridiculously awful , it did n't put me in a very good mood . But if you are not expecting a smart , well - crafted comedy / romance tale , then this certainly can be entertaining , like I said .. it should be in the children 's section . Einstein and his buddies are a good relief from Tim Robbins ' boring , almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryan 's heart . A very conflicting film , but as long as it 's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie .
0 Tim Robbins is oddly benign here , cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s New Jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein 's niece ! Although he 's on - screen much of the time , Robbins cancels out the inner - workings of his intense persona and fades into the background ( it 's easy to forget he 's even in the picture ! ) . Lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick , that being Walter Matthau playing Einstein ( who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character ) . Otherwise , it 's sugary and sunny , directed rather drowsily by Fred Schepisi , who shows heart but no wit or brains . Meg Ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and Robbins is charming , like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother . * * from * * * *
0 Director Fred Schepisi(Roxanne ) directs this well intentioned , but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein(Matthau ) trying to hook his scientific niece(Ryan ) up with ordinary guy Tim Robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950 's . To get Ryan to like Robbins , Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist . The idea is cute , but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue . Tim Robbins , Meg Ryan , and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat , but are unable to rescue the film . Its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie . I would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of Meg Ryan .
0 This TV film tells the story of extrovert Frannie suddenly returning to Silk Hope to visit friends and family , but unaware of her mother 's death . Her sister runs the family home , but is intending to sell it and move away with her new husband . Frannie strongly objects to the idea , and vows to keep the family heirloom as it were , by getting a job and maintaining responsibility.<br /><br />In comes handsome Ruben and the two soon fall in love ( as you do ) , and it 's from this point that I sort of lost interest .... <br /><br />There is more to Farrah Fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks , she can portray a character extremely convincingly when she puts her mind to it - and it is certainly proved here as well as some of her previous efforts like Extremities and Small Sacrificies - a great performance from the legendary Charlie 's Angel.<br /><br />Silk Hope is the type of film that never shies away from its cheap and cheerful TV image , and you know there was a limit to the budget , but it 's not the worst film ever made . The positive aspects are there ; you just have to find them .
0 Just in time to capitalize on the long - awaited movie version of " Dreamgirls " is the DVD release of this semi - forgotten 1976 musical melodrama that also takes the rise of the Supremes as its inspiration . Released five years before the Broadway opening of " Dreamgirls " and partially set in the same period , it has a predominantly black cast and a story revolving around an up - and - coming girl group , and that 's where the resemblance basically ends . Written by Joel Schumacher well before he became a big - league director of mainstream studio product ( " Batman Forever " , " The Phantom of the Opera " ) , this movie seems grittier on the surface . True to form , however , Schumacher weakens the storyline and character development by injecting an abundance of clichés and eye - rolling one - liners . With little affinity for staging musical numbers , Sam O'Steen , a highly regarded film editor but neophyte director , helms the production like a low - budget TV - movie with a frustratingly episodic structure.<br /><br />The story follows three Harlem sisters - sexy Sister , self - righteous Delores and sweet Sparkle - as they sing in the church choir , meet smooth - talking but well - intentioned boys Stix and Levi , and then find their first taste of success as a singing group - first as a sweater - wearing quintet called the Hearts and then as a glitzy trio known as Sister and the Sisters . But naturally there are problems beyond the silly name for the group - Sister gets involved with nasty drug dealer Satin Struthers who beats her and turns her into a cocaine junkie ; Levi goes to prison for getting caught in a drug pick - up for Satin ; Stix gets frustrated by failure and unwisely turns to some Jewish mobsters for financial help ; Delores just gets plain fed up ; and poor little Sparkle has to decide what kind of future she wants . A big plus is that R&B great Curtis Mayfield wrote the atmospheric songs , some catchy and one , " Look Into Your Heart " , a real winner.<br /><br />The solid cast does its best under the contrived circumstances . Lonette McKee 's valiant attempt to make Sister a tragic figure is undercut by some of the ham - fisted plot turns , including a sad Billie Holliday - like turn at the mike . Before they hit it big on primetime TV , Philip Michael Thomas and Dorian Harewood portray Stix and Levi with boyish vitality if not much credibility . The best work comes from Mary Alice in a relatively silent turn as the girls ' patient mother and a pre-"Fame " Irene Cara who effortlessly exudes sincerity in the title role ( though her costumer and hair stylist should be shot for the hideous look she achieves in the final scene ) . The DVD just comes with the original theatrical trailer complete with an unctuous voice - over by DJ Casey Kasem and a bonus CD of five of the film 's songs performed not by the original cast but by Aretha Franklin off her 1976 recording of the soundtrack . It 's not a terrible movie , just an interesting if lacking curio that happens to cover the same ground as " Dreamgirls " .
0 About time they released this movie on DVD . I know some say WB rush the release of this movie because of The Dreamgirls movie . But , how can you rush the release of a movie that 's been in you catalog since 1976.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed with the DVD release of this movie , no special feature , no 5.1 DD sound . come on WB , you can do much better then this . The audio and picture quality on this movie needs some serious help.<br /><br />Seem WB did n't place as much time and attention to this movie because it is a black movie and my have okay sales . They could have kept the CD which by the way dose not have all the songs the original CD has . < br /><br />Would I recommend this DVD for purchase . Yes , because it is a classic film . But WB need to go add some more special feature . Take notes from other group movies , The Five Heatbeats , or The Temptation were you may view just the performance , and the sound on both are much , much , much better than this DVD .
0 This is not a good movie . It 's disjointed , all the acting is bad , and has a lame story you 've seen a thousand times done much better else where . Not to mention you can see every plot point coming from a mile away . Worst of all , no one bothered to tell Lonette Mckee she ca n't sing . But who cares , she 's sooooo damn good looking . But I digress , nothing new here . Bottom - line , hot girl group gets taken advantage of , some one gets hooked on drugs , someone gets hooked on a guy , some one gets the hell out , and then the horrible stuff happens . Surprise , surprise . Welcome to the music business . I ca n't believe so many people out there think this is a good movie . So many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to grading Black Movies . I do n't play that ! If you want to support these films by going to see them - great ! If you enjoyed it - super ! To each his own . But do n't try to tell me it was good . Pleeeease ! I wish colored folks would not fawn over these kind of movies just because they feature black actors . Wanna see a good African - American movie ? See Love Jones . Ray . Or The Color Purple . Those would be great movies no matter what the color of the actors skin . Why ? Because they told compelling stories with great acting , that made you feel something long after you left the theater . Just because it 's our experience does not automatically make it a good film . It 's only good -- when it 's good . Period .
0 I know that the real story of Little Richard is a lot more thrilling than this maudlin and thoroughly average biopic . But then producer Little Richard was probably too reluctant to bring to light any sordid details of his life and just gave us a forgettable facsimile of his career highlights from the 50s and 60s .
0 I 've seen enough of both Little Richard in interviews and in performances and enough of poor Leon pigeonholed into these 50s/60s musical bio pics to know that Leon was not the right actor for this role . Leon was so right as David Ruffin in The Temptations , but fails utterly to capture the essence of Little Richard in this film . < br /><br />Actor Miguel Núñez who played Little Richard in " Why Do Fools Fall in Love ? " was a much more suitable choice , having pulled off the musician 's powerful but effeminate persona . < br /><br />If the performances are unconvincing then the film will be as well . And this is what has happened here . Glossed over or missed entirely are LR 's forays into homosexuality and voyeurism . What " The Temptations " did so well in capturing the rise of the group , warts and all , this film misses by a wide mark.<br /><br />What is going on with director Robert Townsend who started off so well with " The Hollywood Shuffle " ? He 's a talented , funny guy but has n't delivered anything near that first effort .
0 Having the In - Laws over for the weekend ? Then this is the film to hasten their departure , failing that it will induce a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from constant nagging.<br /><br />The film is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise ship , which is more superannuated car ferry ; the plot has more holes than the average colander and a cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity D list . An interesting piece of added amusement is playing " Spot the Villain " as passengers join the ship . You wo n't be wrong ! ! ! ! With a script that sinks faster than a brick , clichéd set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of thriller , action movie and gore - fest and simultaneously fails to fulfil any of them.<br /><br />A must watch film , if only to laugh at how bad it is .
0 What a poor excuse for New Zealnd Movie making . I 'm ashamed to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV ( Aug 2006 ) . The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars . The ship , in real life , is one of the inter - island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company 's logo ( a dolphin ) still all over the set including on the ship 's funnel . The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship / ferry between the USA and Mexico . It has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the place yet is supposed to be a luxury ship on it 's maiden voyage . One of the scenes shows the snow capped peaks of New Zealand 's South island in the background for God 's sake ! Must have been a very cold time on the USA / Mexico area ! The story is weak , the acting is weaker and the new Zealand / American accents just do n't work . I expect the New Zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a waste of money better spent on a real production . I know high school kids in New Zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones . Goof : There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck , presumably to make it look like it was American . But some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you 'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it . I 'd love to go on but it just is n't worth the trouble in any way .
0 Yet another Die Hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villains   How many more of these god awful cheaply ( and badly ) made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late 1980 's and early 1990 's are there still lurking out there ? For the record ( not that you will care really ) this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of Die Hard , Under Siege and Speed 2 complete with a full complement of clichés and predictability.<br /><br />The non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses , the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son.<br /><br />The supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in New Zealand ! The acting is as wooden as the deck , the script woeful , the one liners predictable , the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat through.<br /><br />There seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the DVD bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere ( although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a DVD release yet but give it time ! ) Is there any chance of something at least half decently made , semi believable and most important ORIGINAL ? ! ? No , I thought not  ..
0 I saw this on TV the other night   or rather I flicked over to another channel every so often to watch infomercials when I could n't stand watching it any longer . It was bad . Really , really bad . Not " so bad it 's good " just flat out bad . How did it get funded ? Who thought this was a good idea ? An actor friend of mine auditioned and was told he was n't good enough to play a bad guy but I think what they meant was " save yourself and runaway from this steaming pile of @#$% . " I bet the rest of the cast had been given the option . To be fair the acting was hard to judge because of the appalling fake American ascents . The shooting was dullllllllllll . The action was awkward and stilted . The dialog was inane . By far the saddest thing was ship . In real life the Interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on film it does n't scrub up well . Instead of trying very unsuccessfully to make it look like a new crews liner with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusting polls , I kid you not , they could have change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness . Dumb , Dumb , Dumb . Do n't watch this movie , not even as a joke .
0 Van Dien must cringe with embarrassment at the memory of this ludicrously poor film , as indeed must every single individual involved . To be honest I am rather embarrassed to admit I watched it from start to finish . Production values are somewhere between the original series of ' Crossroads ' and ' Prisoner Cell Block H ' . Most five year olds would be able to come up with more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot . As for the acting performances , if you can imagine the most rubbish porno you have ever seen - one of those ones where the action is padded out with some interminable ' story ' to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde boiler has come to be getting spit - roasted by a couple of blokes with moustaches - you will have some idea of the standard of acting in ' Maiden Voyage ' . Worse still , you ca n't even fast forward to the sex scenes , because there are n't any . An appallingly dreadful film .
0 The cast of this film contain some of New Zealander 's better actors , many of who I have seen in fabulous roles , this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them . The fake American accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong . As another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry , decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot . Most of the cast appear to be from the ( great ) long running New Zealand soap Shortland Street . It 's as if this movie was dreamt up at a Shortland Street cast Christmas party , the result of too many gins , and possibly a bit of salmonella . Imagine " Under Siege " meets " The Love Boat " , staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea.<br /><br />If you are an actor , I recommend you see this film , as a study on how to destroy your carer .
0 Forgive me for stating the obvious , but some films are good and some films are bad . Of course , there are extremes within those two broad categories . Films such as The Godfather , Saving Private Ryan , and Star Wars slot comfortably into the good category . At the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply do n't deserve to be mentioned by name . Occasionally however , someone produces a truly woeful film . A film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be . A film that is more than bad . Such a film is Maiden Voyage.<br /><br />Briefly , Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil , scheming ship 's owner . Of course , there is an all American hero on board , complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest , who saves the day.<br /><br />This is a production that plumbs new depths . Everything about it is bad . The acting , the direction and the so - called plot are breath - takingly poor . In short , it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer . Even an American viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomings.<br /><br />Yes , it 's that bad.<br /><br />I will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this film . However , its dumber - than - dumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what I mean.<br /><br />Imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea . You are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb . Said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard . What would you do ? I do n't know about you , but I would throw the bomb as far as I possibly could into the sea . Not this guy . He watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate ( for him ) results . Enough said . Such a demise would merit a mention in the Darwin Awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production team 's lives .
0 There is only one problem with this website , you ca n't give a negative rating . Additionally a mate rated this as a D grade movie . I say he was being too nice . A piece of wood could show more emotion that the actors in this movie , and the money used to produce this movie would have been better used to start a fire . This is absolutely terrible , 2 hours of life that anyone who endures this untalented bloodbath will never get back . After watching 5 minutes , myself and the boys wondered if sinking bulk heavies would make this anymore entertaining . Half a carto and a bottle of 151 later I finally found some of this G grade acting remotely funny . It 's an insult upon this entire planet that the director thought anyone could find anything beneficial from this more , he should go and buy a rope . And to the actors in this flick , I hope you got paid well to be in this joke because I doubt you will ever work again . In summary I fine everyone in this movie 100 grand and 12 demerit points off your acting licence .
0 I would list this film under the horror film genre . I did this because I am not aware of a genre called horrible . Since the genre horror comes the nearest to horrible I have decided to put it in this category . The acting was amateurish . You know who the villains would be at the first scene . The heroine is as ugly as the movie . Students of movie making should take this movie as an example for the lesson what not to do in a movie . It is that bad . Man the word bad is an understatement . The villains hijack an ocean liner and want 10 million dollars . They want the money to be delivered on an inhabited Rose Island in the middle of the pacific . They would be sitting ducks after they got the money . Is there no getaway plan . How dumb . The female Cruise Director is a former cop , navy seal , kung fu I am scared . The hilarious part is the way the defuses the time bomb . He says he knows what he is doing and he keeps pulling all the wires one by one . He then puts it in his pocket and according to the movie with all the connections in place . Is he mad ? As mad us who watched this RIDICULOUS . If you have a M - i - L whom you do not like . To annoy her rent this movie and pretend you enjoy it . I assure you she will definitely tell your spouse that you have such bad taste and that her son / daughter has married a person below her family standard .
0 Problem with these type of movies is that literally dozens of them are being made each year . Luckily for use only a handful are given a theatrical release , while the others are being pushed straight to video or TV , such as this movie.<br /><br />The foremost problem of this movie is really its originality . It 's one of those movies which uses the " Die Hard " formula of a tough but troubled guy being at the wrong place at the wrong time . In this case it 's a character played by Casper Van Dien , who works for a security agency that thoroughly test safety procedures for companies and individuals . In this case he 's being send to a cruise ship , which of course gets hijacked . You can see this movie as a sort of mix of " Die Hard " and " Air Force One " and the movie does n't even try to conceal that those two movies were probably its biggest source of ' inspiration ' . So really , you ca n't regard this movie as an original one at all . It uses all of the clichés out of the book and this movie really does n't offer any surprises or anything that remotely resembles anything original.<br /><br />Like you can expect from a movie such as this , it has a very weak script . Or rather said , it features some very lazy writing . Like I said before , the movie features nothing original but also the actual story itself features some elements which are far from likely and are just plain ridicules truthfully . I mean , hijacking an huge cruise ship with only about 8 guys , of which halve only carry some small guns and then ask for a ransom of ' only ' 10 million dollars , for a ship that is about worth 10 times that amount is itself already quite ridicules . How do they even intend to split that money afterward ? Every person gets just over a million or something ? That 's hardly profitable for such a big and risky undertaking . And then there is the case of taking the passengers hostage . Somehow they manage to take all passengers on the huge ship hostage and they manage to put them inside one room , with only one guy with his pistol , which he ca n't even seem to be able to hold right , watching them . You never see more than like 30 hostages however , as if they were all the people who were aboard at the time . Also when the Van Dien character goes looking for his son and vice versa , no matter which room they walk in through on the huge cruise ship , they always bump into each other instantly . Just some examples of the lazy writing within the movie.<br /><br />But it of course is an action flick , so the story of course becomes secondary . But then again , it 's not as if this movie features any good action at all . Halve of the actors look as if they had never hold a weapon before and the movie is filled with some ridicules slow - motion . It really becomes laughable at points.<br /><br />Of course the movie also does n't feature the best actors , though I must say that Casper Van Dien really is n't a bad ' action hero ' and actor , as far as the genre and B - movie circuit is concerned . He just however also suffers from the same problem as Tom Cruise ; no matter how old he is , he just never looks convincing enough to play the father of a teenager . Van Dien once started out as a promising new young actor but starring in movies like this really does n't help his career much . He 's probably capable of something better , though he is never really given the right opportunity to show it . All of the other actors also do a fair enough job but their characters are just so formulaic that they never truly become interesting.<br /><br />Oh well , it 's not the worst genre movie I have ever seen but it also ai n't exactly the most original or memorable one either.<br /><br />4/10
0 What a joke . I am watching it on Channel 1 and I think watching paint dry is much more entertaining . What happened to Caspar Van Dien that got him roped into this nightmare . Terrible acting , very boring plot and terrible direction . It so terrible , it 's funny . It 's suppose to be full of suspense , but it more a comedy . If you want to see terrible acting , ridiculous script writing and sub - par plot , check this movie out . If I was Van Dien , I would not only ask for my 10 % from my agent , but fire the bastard in the process . What a turkey . It 's not even fit to be on MST 3 K ! ! It would be a good movie to cure you insomnia . I especially love the part where Van Dien is throw overboard and then makes it back in just a few minutes ! I can only image that this was written by non - union writers taking advantage of the writer 's strike . What a horrible movie ! ! !
0 A truly dreadful film . I did not know initially that this was a Kiwi effort - but very soon I started to realize that all the characters were speaking with hardly disguised kiwi accents under the fake American ones . Why did it need to be set n America anyway ? - it could have been set in NZ and then the actors could have used their normal voices . Surely someone in the production team could hear the dreadful attempts at speaking with American accents ? A bad bad film . I am surprised it has lasted this long - how did it make it out of the can ? It just seemed like a very poor attempt at a Segal / Willis type action man flick . A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY ! If there was any TAXPAYER money in this piece of trash , I would be leading a revolution to have all the money put back into the Treasury . I am still reeling ( get it ? pun , reeling ! ) at the absolute garbage I have just seen . Why did I continue to watch ? Well , I am a movie fanatic and ca nt help , myself !
0 I think I 've seen worse films , so I 'm giving this a 3 , but it 's a struggle to remember what they could have been ! ! Possibly Xtro ( nasty & dull ) or possibly Creep ( just plain dull ) , but it is a struggle to think of something worse . It 's difficult to know where to start . Let 's just say it 's a poor man 's Under Siege , starring an even poorer man 's Jean Claude Van Damme . The only redeeming feature was seeing Casper Van Dien - I always wondered what happened to him after Starship Troopers . Yes , he was Johnny Rico , if you really want to know.<br /><br />Judging from this site , he 's been stuck in TV movie hell .... Casper , be more selective .... please ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Arghhhhh , I 've just turned over and there 's a half decent film on called Criminal Law ...... now I 'm beginning to get really resentful about the last 1.5hrs ! ! !
