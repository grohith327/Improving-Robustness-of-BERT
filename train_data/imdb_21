0 To be honest I knew what to expect before I watched this film , and I 've got to say it has the worst acting I 've ever seen . It does have its moments , and on a comedy level its very entertaining , but i 'm afraid its not scary , and stupidity is taken to a new level . There 's a lot of unnecessary gore , and the plot is all over the place . I have no idea why the aliens were evil , and why they even came to this remote part of wales , ( i mean who 'd go there anyway ? ) but I did n't care at that point , because I was amused by the costumes , and the bad CGI . As far as B - movies go , this deserves the title of ' being so bad , its good ' , and kudos to the film - makers , because they probably knew what they were doing . Long may these films continue .....
0 This program did n't do it for me , although I 'm a fan of the genre . The major factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene which was not dominated by the main character . This made it a bit two - dimensional and I gave up before the program was over.<br /><br />I was hoping to leave my critique there as I 'm no movie critic , however , the guidelines on IMDb state that you must put in 10 lines of commentary . It did remind me of Hudson Hawk in the way the main character is in every single scene , and I would hope that the writers of this program could employ some more diversity to engage with the viewers . I do n't doubt the talent of any of the cast and crew , it 's just that after watching things like " the wire " , I 've come to expect great things from cop drama .
0 My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle - a strong willed Southern lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the LAPD . The first season was must - see TV for us . Unfortunately , the stories of her personal life in the second season became so tedious and unworthy of the strong character that we stopped watching.<br /><br />My husband and I were troubled by the episode where she tries to hide from her mother the fact that she is shacked up . But the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss . Why would a strong , middle aged woman do those things ? The answer is she would n't . Additionally , my husband and I pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy . It is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the murder scene or in an idealized family . Ca n't the script writers do something original from time to time ? As I mentioned , we are no longer viewers . We prefer shows that do n't betray the characters and insult our intelligence .
0 This show seemed to be kinda good . Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actress and I like police series , but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong . < br /><br />First of all , the writers should have more suspects than one , you know who did it EVERY TIME ! ! ! ! ! That makes it boring . The main character is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way . I know they wanted her to be tough , but she s mean , stupid and a bad chief . The crimes are uninteresting and bland , and its just lame all the way . As stated above , I hate it .... < br /><br />All in all , this was a big disappointment and very bad indeed ...
0 Though I 'd heard that " Cama de Gato " was the worst Brazilian movie of the decade , I watched it giving it a chance ; after all , first - time director / producer / writer Alexandre Stockler managed to make his debut feature ( shot in video ) for just US$ 4,000 and -- though it looks even cheaper -- I ca n't begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it ( then as I watched it I realized why ) . But whatever chances you 're ready to give to " Cama de Gato " , they shrink to zero within 10 minutes : it 's an unbelievably preposterous , verbose , ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian upper - middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo - Nazis hooked on bad sex , drugs and violence ( and they 're made to look like closeted gays too ) , made with no visible trace of talent , imagination , expertise or notion of structure . Visually and aurally , it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube -- only here it lasts NINETY TWO ( count'em ) minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness , and it 's not even funny - bad.<br /><br />We've all seen the story before : bored young guys want to have fun , go partying , take drugs and everything goes wrong -- there 's gang - rape , spanking , murder , the accidental death ( falling down the staircase ! ! ) of the mother of one of the boys , culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill . Moral and literal garbage , get it ? The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark ( especially " Kids " and " Bully " ) , but Clark 's films -- though also moralist and sexploitative -- are high - class masterworks compared to this crap.<br /><br />I do n't think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience 's throat : Stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non - stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion -- you DO get numb - minded with so much babbling , yelling , inept direction , shaky camera and terrible acting going on . Stockler does n't care a bit about technique ( the quality of the images , framing , sound recording , soundtrack songs , dialog , sets , editing , etc is uniformly appalling ) , but he 's a narcissistic control - freak : he anticipates the criticisms he 's bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie / cutie comments , and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far - fetched and phony it all is ( I could relate to THAT ) . < br /><br />Despite his megalomaniac ambitions , Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure -- he ca n't even decide if he wants gritty realism ( hand - held video camera etc ) or stylization ( repetition of scenes , use of alternate takes , etc ) . Damn , he ca n't even decide WHERE to put his camera ( there 's use of subjective camera for the THREE leads ) ! The dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever ; the plot exists simply to justify the director 's profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for . All you see is a filmmaker being hateful , preachy , condemning , moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent ( or technique ) to go with it.<br /><br />It 's very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess . Certainly one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil , with his sleepy - eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineo 's , Blat can be highly effective under good direction ( as in " Carandiru " , " Lavoura Arcaica " , " Proibido Proibir " ) . Here , he 's told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under - equipped " actors " in recent memory . He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes ( so goddawful they look rather like web - cam porn).<br /><br />The film opens and ends with real interviews with " typical " ( ? ) middle - class youth -- Stockler wants us to take those interviews as " proof " of what he 's trying to preach in fiction . But he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees , selecting a highlight of abject , racist , sexist , stupid statements ( which only shows assholes exist everywhere ) . Stockler wants to prove that Brazilian middle - class youths are ALL present or future fascists BECAUSE they 're middle - class and enjoy recreational drugs ( is he saying all neo - fascists are on drugs ? ? Or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior ? ? I could n't tell ) . < br /><br />With its dogmatic self - righteousness , headache - inducing technique and mind - bending boredom , " Cama de Gato " is bad for a 1,000 reasons but , above all , it 's harmful in a very insidious manner : it gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument . " Cama de Gato " is best unwatched , unmentioned , buried and forgotten .
0 In São Paulo , the upper middle class teenagers Cristiano , Chico and Gabriel have just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class , they go to a party with drugs and booze . On the next day , after their classes , the date of Cristiano in the previous night comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl . The girl dies , they panic and decide to get rid off the body , but Cristiano 's mother arrives , startles with Gabriel and rolls the staircase , breaking her neck . The trio decides to dump and burn the corpses in a garbage landfill , but along the night other tragedies happen.<br /><br />The polemic and shameful " Cama de Gato " is an overrated pretentious crap about alienation of the youth , and is certainly the worst Brazilian movie that I have seen along many years . The shallow , tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste . The screenplay is not funny , with stupid lines and dialogs , and boring , manipulative and silly footages with interviews with morons teenagers in the beginning and in the end . The acting is terrible , apparently with many improvisations , but no talent , and I was disappointed with presence of the promising Caio Blat in this trash . The camera , framing , cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality . The sound is awful and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are speaking ( probably it is a plus , since this flick sucks ) . The gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sex - exploitation . My vote is one ( awful).<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Cama de Gato " ( " Bed of the Cat " )
0 The script for this TV soap opera is so bad that even A. Hopkins at some point had to play like an undergrad drama - student so as to bring some life in his script - dead character . I do not know whether this was the purpose of the director , but Hopkins ' Ciano reeked nothing but vanity , fear and lack of self - esteem . The real Ciano possibly was all that but then , why make a movie about him ? Mussolini was a bit more convincing , and his long way down was as if closer to the truth . Edda Mussolini was plain ridiculous ( not because of Sarandon , but because of the impotent script ) , while she had to be the central character of this alleged familial drama . Watch it only if you enjoy Venezuelan soap opera .
0 Probably the only thing that got the movie up to a four for me is the fact that I love Peter Falk . One of the world 's great portrayers of bumbling incompetence . . . and yet he is one of the only anchors that prevents this from being a chaotic disaster . As Pops Romano , he provides a respectable mix of gangster charm and straight man to Chris Kattan 's manic foolishness . Respectable performances are also offered by Richard Roundtree as the harried boss , Vinessa Shaw as a talented female FBI agent bouncing her head off a glass ceiling and Fred Ward as Falk 's advisor and Benedict Arnold.<br /><br />The plot concept actually has some wonderful possibilities and , in the hands of a young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase , could have proved a great comedic vehicle . Kattan , who seems to idolize Ernest or Pee Wee Herman , just provides a muddled mess . Sadly , Peter Berg and Chris Penn , who portray his misfit brothers , both fall far short of their proven capability.<br /><br />There are some very funny scenes , but they are far too few and separated by way too many boring ones . What I truly miss here is what always attracted me to the Leslie Neilsen movies . There is no ' second level ' of wit riding over the slapstick . No cultural references that only the adults get . . no double entendre . . it is just silly.<br /><br />And , by the way , this does n't all mean that I am recommending it for your 9-year - old , because hopefully they have better taste and less fascination with some of their body parts and their functions .
0 Why is this film so bad ? Well , if being so stupidly annoying and unfunny is a reason , then this film is it . The character of Corky Romano is unlikable at best and downright infuriating at worst . The gags are predictable but that is n't what makes it bad . They are the lame sort of predictable jokes that your unfunny friend would say.<br /><br />Corky Romano is about a mild mannered vet that tries to do right but is so clumsy . His quiet life is thrown for a loop when the family that once spurned him now needs him to infiltrate the FBI to destroy any trace of the family 's crime history . However , it is n't that easy for Corky because the FBI believes him to be a super agent and pegs him with the duty of spying on his very own family . Mishaps and mayhem ensue but it really does n't feel like any comic hijixn are there . Corky ends up in love with his beautiful FBI partner and has to set the record straight with both the FBI and his family if he is to settle down to the quiet life again.<br /><br />I think what makes this film irritating is both the lead actor and the supposed jokes . Chris Kattan reveals his alarming limitations as and actor here as his one note slapstick routine falls flat about 10 minutes into the film . It is okay to have a full movie based solely off of dumb , slap stick humor . Will Ferrel , Kattan 's SNL partner , seems to have made a full career out of it . The only difference between Kattan and Ferrel is that Ferrel knows when to tone it down and rely on other ways of telling a joke . There is absolutely no diversity in Kattan 's routine . It 's hard to hear the same joke twice , but for a whole movie that is just pure torture.<br /><br />The other problem with the movie was the lack of truly original and FUNNY jokes . The gay mafia brother , the awkward guy sch - tick , and plenty of other forgettable jokes appear none as funny as the first time you barely laughed at it . It seems as if the screenwriters had more of a fun time writing this than any one had watching it . Even with a cast that has some comedic talent ( Chris Penn , Peter Falk ) the jokes that commence are tired . There is no chemistry too . This film was obviously one for the pocketbooks for the actors . No body seemed to care about it , or even try . Sad thing is , no body told Chris Kattan that .
0 Wow . Some movies just leave me speechless . This was undeniably one of those movies . When I left the theatre , not a single word came to my mouth . All I had was an incredible urge to slam my head against the theatre wall to help me forget about the last hour and a half . Unfortunately , it did n't work . Honestly , this movie has nothing to recommend . The humor was at the first grade level , at best , the acting was overly silly , and the plot was astronomically far - fetched . I hearby pledge never to see an other movie starring Chris Kattan or any other cast - member of SNL .
0 I could only get through about 25 mins of it . Not one laugh in the 25 minutes I gave it , one of the most painful films I 've ever had to endure . Chris Kattan is so nervous on screen that it made me nervous to watch him . Just a horrible movie .
0 I did not watch the entire movie . I could not watch the entire movie . I stopped the DVD after watching for half an hour and I suggest anyone thinking of watching themselves it stop themselves before taking the disc out of the case.<br /><br />I like Mafia movies both tragic and comic but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy.<br /><br />The problem is Corky Romano simply tries too hard to get the audience to laugh , the plot seems to be an excuse for moving Chris Kattan ( Corky ) from one scene to another . Corky himself is completely overplayed and lacks subtlety or credulity - all his strange mannerisms come across as contrived - Chris Kattan is clearly ' acting ' rather than taking a role - it bounces you right out of the story . Each scene is utterly predictable , the ' comedic event ' that will occur on the set is obvious as soon as each scene is introduced . In comedies such as Mr. Bean the disasters caused by the title character are funny because you can empathise with the characters motivations and initial event and the situation the character ends up in is not telegraphed . Corky however gives the feeling that he is deliberately screwing up in a desperate attempt to draw a laugh from the audience.<br /><br />If Chris had not played such an alien character ( who never really connects with the other characters in the movie ) and whose behaviour is entirely inexplicable ( except for trying to draw laughs ) and the comedy scenes were n't so predictable and stereotyped - all the jokes seemed far too familiar ) this movie could have been watchable . But it is n't . Do n't watch it .
0 I vowed a long time ago to NEVER , EVER watch a movie that has ANYONE who EVER was a regular cast member of " Saturday Night Live " . I did n't rent " Corky Romano " but I was forced by my unfailing good manners to watch it for half an hour . Then my good manners failed . Stupid , not funny . Tedious , not hilarious . Bad , not good . That in a nutshell is all I can say for this video .
0 Direction must be the problem here . I recently heard John Cleese speaking of working a skit for Fawlty Towers . He was supposed to attack his car with a branch . The first branch was too flimsy and not funny . The second branch was too stiff to be funny . The third was just flimsy enough to be funny . This sort of attention to detail is missing from " Corky Romano " . No matter how embarrassingly unfunny a comic bit was , it was n't fixed , and was n't left on the cutting room floor . The one value I can find in this movie is as a study of a very flawed movie which somehow escaped into distribution without being repaired.<br /><br />I've scanned dozens of other reviews here . The number of reviews praising this absolute waste of time bolsters my suspicion that some people are getting paid to promote titles . I ca n't fathom how anyone over the age of 9 could rate this title more than a 4 , MAX . I mean , come on , 5 is average . I ca n't imagine anyone , even those making money off of this , rating it even as much as average.<br /><br />This makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time . And , hey , I actually LIKE the Three Stooges and can even tolerate Ed Wood !
0 * * * SPOILERS * * * * * * SPOILERS * * * From its very opening credits this fantastic movie sets the record straight : it 's an instant classic . It does n't take long to realize that this movie is big , bigger than ` Kindergarten Cop ' or ` Police Academy 7 . ' The sheer greatness of it left me speechless as I walked out of the movie theater and proceeded right back to the ticket counter to purchase myself another dozen of tickets.<br /><br />This is a movie that simply requires multiple viewings . The first watching will surely leave you with that strange ` Huh ? ' feeling , but do n't feel embarrassed - it happens to the best of us . The story is so diabolically clever that one has to wonder about the mortality of its authors . What seems to be a simple story of an idiot infiltrating the FBI , turns out to be an allegorical story that works on several levels and teaches us all about the really important things in life . The complexity of the plot structure will baffle you on your first viewing , but do n't give up ! Not until my sixth or seventh viewing did I only begin to unravel some of the hidden mysteries of ` Corky Romano . ' And watch out for the unexpected twist at the end , otherwise you might be caught completely off guard when it is revealed that FBI agent Brick Davis is FBI 's most - wanted criminal , Corky is not a real FBI agent , Pops Romano is innocent , Peter Romano admits he 's illiterate and Paulie Romano comes out of the closet as a homosexual . Surprised the hell out of me , I can tell you that much.<br /><br />Chris Kattan 's comedic talents are unmatched as he leads his character Corky Romano through a maze of totally unpredictable situations . Reminiscent of John Reynolds ' performance in ` Manos , the Hands of Fate , ' Kattan takes on innumerable multiple personalities and tackles all scenes with perfect comedic timing . However , Kattan is not just about comedy . He is a master of drama as well , as he controls the audience 's feelings with the slightest moves of his face . His facial expressions reflect life itself , in a way . For example , in the scene in which he farts into his brothers ' faces , you can see the expression of social injustice and alienation clearly reflected on his anguished face . At a moment like that , it 's hard to find a dry eye in the house.<br /><br />Screenwriters David Garret and Jason Ward are the real heroes of ` Corky Romano . ' With a story of such proportions , it 's easy to understand why two experienced writers had to be employed to complete this ambitious project . Their skillful storytelling and unorthodox structuring makes ` Pulp Fiction ' look like a mediocre Saturday Night Live skit . Garret and Ward 's story is so compelling and alluring that it grips you by your hair , swallows you entirely , shakes you around and spits you right out . At the end of the out - of - this - world experience known as ` Corky Romano ' you find yourself a different person with different worldviews and different ideas , and with only one question on your mind:<br /><br />Why , God ? Why ? ! ?
0 Corky Romano has to be one of the most jaw dropping and horrific " comedy 's " ever made.<br /><br />While the sometimes amusing Chris Kattan who pulled off a very funny performance in the hilarious ' Undercover Brother ' his character in Corky is so stupid and so unfunny - which is a shame since the premise is a wonderful idea . To bad they ran out of them when they got to page 3 on the script .
0 please save your money and go see something else . this movie was such piece of crap . i did nt want to go , but i had to so i thought i 'd laugh at least once , NOPE . not a single laugh , it was that horrible ! chris kattan will never get a good comedy role after this and " a night at the roxbury . " this movie is completely obvious , has no smart humor at all , and just repeats itself over and over again . listen to me , and stray as far away from this movie as you possibly can !
0 Admittedly , I did n't have high expectations of " Corky Romano . " But then again , who did ? However , I felt it deserved the benefit of the doubt . I had no high hopes of " Joe Dirt " either -- another recent comedy starring an SNL cast member -- and I ended up being pleasantly surprised . But this film is just as bad as it looks in the previews . Chris Kattan is actually a talented comic actor -- contrary to what you might think after watching this movie -- with great energy . He 's been in many hilarious SNL skits , and I think he 's one of the most talented cast members on SNL as of now . In this case , he 's given a lame , pointless script and he tries to remedy each scene with his incessant mugging . Throughout each scene , he attempts a lame Jerry Lewis act and fails miserably . Jerry Lewis knew how to pull off this type of physical comedy , not to mention he worked with much better writing . Kattan simply looks like some ignorant fool with ADHD who had one too many Cafe Lattes . He does n't even wait for the punchline ; he assumes we 'll all laugh once he starts jumping around like an ape on crack . In one scene , he ends up in a tugging match with a dog who has a package of cocaine in his mouth . The package explodes and the cocaine splashes all over him . He comes back to the job , strung out on coke . Now , how are we supposed to laugh at the fact that he 's acting hyper and on - edge , when he 's doing the same thing throughout the whole film ? < br /><br />As for the rest of the cast members ... Vanessa Shaw is really hot , Peter Berg is wasted in a thankless role and so is Chris Penn . Peter Falk is also wasted , though he has a few funny lines that I 'm pretty sure he improvised . I hope Falk gets a decent movie someday soon . That 's too much talent too waste on a clunker like " Corky Romano . " I did n't like Falk 's last movie " Made " all that much either , but at least he had a decent role . < br /><br />I chuckled a few times , but I could not get a single laugh . Each gag is performed with no sense of timing or delivery . And it 's made worse by Kattan 's hammy acting . And there are certain gags that are streneously dragged out . For example , when Kattan is about to fart in his two brothers ' faces . He stands there for 2 or 3 minutes , trying to get out a fart and when he finally he does it 's a little tiny one . It 's bad enough when you have a gag that 's funny and drag it out , but when you have a lame gag and you drag it out it 's a hell of a lot worse . And another example of this is when he tries to translate what those two Asian men are saying during a drug bust . I can go on and on about what 's wrong with this so - called comedy , but I 'm not gon na waste my time . Like I said earlier , if you predicted bad things from the trailers -- you predicted right . < br /><br />My score : 3 ( out of 10 )
0 Chris Kattan is a great sketch actor on Saturday Night Live ... but he should probably leave the movie industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control . He plays an annoyingly peppy character who basically comes off as mildly retarded and on speed . Wanna know the only funny parts ? The stuff they showed in the previews . Yes , his rendition of take on me is funny . Nothing else is . ESPECIALLY when you can tell he 's trying very hard to be a physical comedian , which he should n't have to try at because he is one . And yet , his ' demolishing the vet 's office ' bit comes off as cringingly bad . This movie made me develop an eye twitch . Avoid it at all costs , and keep watching SNL .
0 This may not be the worst comedy of all time , but it 's close . The producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life , and I want it back!<br /><br />Chris Kattan is funny for about 10 minutes . His high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old , and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse . He falls into a long line of former SNL - ers that have attempted movies . Some have been brilliant , some have failed miserably . There 's not much middle ground in this category . Although Chris Farley was brilliant , and then okay , and then not so funny , and then dead ... so I suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one career.<br /><br />Avoid this movie like the plague.<br /><br />c
0 I did n't mind the film that much , but it was incredibly dull and boring . A few laughs here and there but nothing to go crazy for.<br /><br / > You should give it a go if you like silly , stupid humour because this is the film for you .
0 I like the cast pretty much however the story sort of unfolds rather slowly . Danny Glover does a good job making you wonder if he 's the bad guy . Meanwhile , the other characters are just part of the story . Dennis Quaid did n't have as much room in the story as he could have had . I thought the first scene was a bit over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded . I 'd watch it again though . I rated it a 5 ( wish I could rate it a 5.5 )
0 Wonderful actors . < br /><br />Lousy script and not too great direction either . My main problem was I simply did n't CARE about any of these people . Not the killer not the victims . The settings were pretty drab . Dennis Quaid 's character was so poorly written in , I did n't even care when the end came . He got his kid back . Big deal ! I wanted my money back .
0 For me , this movie just seemed to fall on its face . The main problem for me was the casting of Glover as a serial killer . I do n't know whether this grows out of type - casting or simply his demeanor , but I doubt Glover could ever portray a convincing villain . He 's a good guy , and that 's always obvious in his performances . Other than that the film is your run of the mill serial killer story . Nothing very innovative .
0 Sorry , not good.<br /><br />It starts out interesting , but looses its way a few minutes into the movie.<br /><br />It does not help a lot that none of the normally great actors ( Quaid , Glover , Ermey , Leto etc . ) delivers a really good performance . < br /><br />It might be owed to the fact that I saw a dubbed version ( german ) , but Dennis Quaid 's character was especially wooden and annoying , and Danny Glover does not really make for a believable villain . Moreover , Jared Leto 's character does not really contribute to the story whatsoever ( except saving one main character 's life at one point , but that scene is as necessary as a windshield wiper on a submarine in the first place ; -)<br /><br />Speaking of unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is really the tangled and cliché - ridden storyline : The detective ( of course ! ) has to settle a personal matter with the villain and is ( of course ! ) suspended from his official duties courtesy of his personal entanglement . The killer ( of course ! ) * wants * to be tracked down and plays a cat - and - mouse game with his opponent for years ... I do n't know how many movies build on a similar plot - most of them better , however.<br /><br />The plot has got holes galore and many completely unbelievable and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to or work well with the storyline at all ( e.g. the truck stop scene or the car at the cliff 's edge etc.)<br /><br />To top it off , the ending tries to be original and exciting , but fails completely in these regards . We 've seen * much * better finales with a similar kind of ultimate - battle - on - a - train - in - a - forlorn - winter - landscape setup ... In the end there is the supposedly moving reunion of parent and child ... hokey , at the least .
0 I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago , and one thing surprised me so negatively that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies : Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin , while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks . Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy , but - again - most viewers ' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role . Also , Jared Leto was not believable as the former medicine student . The tension was just not there , since the killer was known very early . The finale was , again , neither dramatic nor tense : nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next . All we could wait for was the end of the movie . All in all , a disappointing evening spent at the cinema .
0 Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone . Too many missing characters , no romantic scenes , changes in story line , too short , appeared low budget . Hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you 're not familiar with the novel . In some scenes it looks like Lorna has a cold sore on her upper lip . I 'm sure make - up did it 's best to hide it . I guess they did n't want to halt filming until it healed up , pity . Most likely why this movie lacked kissing scenes . Only one disappointing kissing scene at the very end . Lorna Doone is a great epic tale and should be told true . The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long , more romantic , much more enjoyable and more true to the book .
0 I watched this film version of R.D. Blackmore 's classic novel as a substitute until the 2001 A&E version was released on video . And what a poor substitution it proved to be!!!!<br /><br />This version does not have the authentic , I - feel - like - I'm - there aspect of the A&E movie . The actors are , for the most part , wooden ( with Sean Bean the exception ) and the " romance " seems forced and contrived . In fact , there is no kissing until the end of the movie ! ! ! ! The triangle between John Ridd , Lorna Doone ( or Lady Lorna Dugal , whichever you prefer)and the evil Carver Doone is n't mentioned or expanded upon . We do n't get much insight into Carver here , or as to why he has some ( if any ) romantic feelings for Lorna . This movie cuts out many of the key and interesting characters of the novel , such as Counsellor Doone , and John 's sharp - tongued youngest sister Lizzie which were crucial to the plot . The screenplay itself is lacking in conviction . The political intrigue also does n't figure in the script . The way Lorna came into being with the Doones is n't true to the original story . Now , do n't get me wrong , Clive Owen is a handsome and talented actor ( watch Gosford Park and King Arthur for confirmation ) but he comes across as bland and stoic throughout , and long hair ( it may have been a bad wig ) just does n't suit him ! ! ! ! Polly Walker is a lovely and accomplished actress ( see Enchanted April and Patriot Games , in which she also costarred with Sean Bean ) , but she appears colorless and lackluster . She has a cold sore on her lip that make - up ca n't hide , and the costumes do n't seem authentic . The late Robert Stephens does a respectable turn as Sir Ensor Doone , although he only refers to Lorna as his favorite rather than his granddaughter , which she was reputed to be in the book . Also , it seems to me that Owen and Walker are too old for their roles ( maybe it 's the make - up ) and the scenery is brown , cold , gray and barren , without so much of a hint of a sunny sky . I understand that it is set in Southwest England , but it is green there and they do get their sunshine ! ! ! The portrayal of Tom Faggus ' character and his " death " , which does n't happen in the novel , depresses the film even more . The one positive note is Sean Bean 's performance as Carver . Although it does n't even come close to matching Aidan Gillen 's portrayal in the A&E movie , Bean does make one mean villain . In short , watch this only if you 've got a few hours to kill , but do n't expect anything exciting or for it to be true to the novel . See any other version ( but I highly recommend A&E 's film ) over this tired adaptation .
0 I first read " Lorna Doone " about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it ! It is a classic historical romance set in the 1600s when the west country was several days ' journey from London and law and order was much harder to enforce . Sadly , this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion . The acting and production values are OK but the way the story was messed about with was dreadful . Why do television adaptations do this ? Why would they think that the thousands of fans of a book would want them to change the story ? ? ? One of life 's great mysteries ! ! ! The BBC made an excellent version which was televised at Christmas in the early 1990s which I am still trying to track down a copy of ! Take my advice , read the book and do n't bother with this paltry version !
0 I have 2 words for you . Sean Bean . He is the only worthwhile presence in this film . But even so , do n't see this movie . Even though he is good as the main villain , you do n't want to waste your time . < br /><br />I did n't care about the characters ( except the little boy ) and in fact , I did n't really care if the star crossed lovers ended up together or died . The movie did not make me care or BELIEVE that these people cared about each other at all . I have read a lot of " classic " novels after seeing the movies and this movie made me not even want to read the book . The story seems so boring . But I may go ahead and read it to try to redeem the story in my head . < br /><br />Stay away from Lorna Doone . The actress who played Lorna was also in Sense and Sensibility and she was much better in that . Watch Sharpe , Horatio Hornblower , A & E has great movies of novels like Pride and Prejudice . Or miniseries like the Forsyte Saga . Check them out , do n't bother with Lorna Doone .
0 Extremely dull drama starring a very young Roddy McDowall , who trains a wild horse , the Flicka of the title , and is the only reason for watching the movie in the first place . Coated in blaring , overbearing music and weighed down by schmaltzy dialogue , this is one of those interminable films that bores you to the point of a gnawing headache . The naffly - titled sequel , ' Thunderhead , Son of Flicka ' , in which McDowall trains the next generation of nag , is marginally better than the original but the pace remains slow and the score continues to pummel you into submission , although there are at least one or two scenes that do n't induce a coma .
0 Unless you are petrified of Russian people or boars , this movie is a snorefest . Actually , I fell asleep about 40 minutes in & had to fight the urge to just leave the theater . I wish I had . A waste of a perfectly lovely Saturday evening.<br /><br />Even " Silent Hill " was scarier . Heck , even " Pan 's Labyrinth " was scarier . I 'm still unclear on what was supposed to be scary in this flick.<br /><br />To begin with , I 'm very leery of movies that use " pidgin Russian " like this one did in the opening credits . It 's embarrassing to me since I brought a group of my Russian friends & we all cringed . Oh my god.<br /><br />Hmm . Well , luckily for me ( & probably you , too ) this movie has already escaped my brain & I just stepped out of it an hour ago . So I have no specifics , just murky visuals that go nowhere & some languishing - now - dead hope that anything would happen.<br /><br />Perhaps I saw a completely mutilated version of this film because I ca n't believe it got such great reviews here ( which is why I saw it ) & ended up being so completely devoid of not only Horror or Suspense but Overall Entertainment Value as well.<br /><br />I give it a 2 because , yes , I fell asleep & wanted to leave after 40 minutes but I woke up & did n't leave .
0 There were some scary scenes , which I 've always liked more than straight out gore , but otherwise this movie was rather weak . THere were too many questions left unanswered , and when they tried to explain anything in the movie , it was still rather unclear . After watching this movie I still seemed lost in a lot of ways . It sort of reminded me of Silent Hill a few years back . That movie was also unsatisfying , but still better than this because it did try to work and the story did actually make sense . This one , not so much.<br /><br />The acting for the most part in the Abandoned was decent , but the movie dragged on an on , and never really gave any type of satisfying conclusion . Like I said above , there were some creepy scenes , but otherwise , this movie was a mess . Sorry , I ca n't recommend it .
0 Sorry this movie did not scare me it just annoyed me . It was just so frustrating when I saw the potential and that , all that , fell by the wayside . The children ! The father ! The premonition ! Had so much potential and ziltch ! zero , nada ! I have heard it all before . Scary ! No ! I can scare myself alone , here where I sit , than they could in the movie . Are there men writing that figure that women should be so annoying ? Huh ? This movie was quite atmospheric . Or at least it could have been , had the director / writer bothered to work it . We could have had some good music that would have added to the tension too , if someone had made the effort . What I really want to know is why do they get the money ? Just give it to me and save all that hassle . Abandoned ? ... No we where betrayed
0 To quote the film , " It 's better not to know . Better still to forget . Best of all to be abandoned . " Oh , the irony.<br /><br />A ghost story with all the technical refinements of a Hollywood horror film , but horrifyingly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the film , and you feel like you 're being preached to from the start.<br /><br />It 's as if the writers ' cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by bad cop TV and a Jerry Springer show . Fitting , maybe , for a film like The Hitcher , not a Russia - set horror film . The result is that a potentially great setting and some potentially great gore scenes go to waste and become just silly , not scary or meaningful .
0 I 'm going to go on the record as the second person who has , after years of using the IMDb to look up movies , been motivated by Nacho 's film , The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment . This was hands down the worst movie I 've ever seen in my entire life . The plot was on the verge of non - existence , and none of the " puzzle - pieces " added up in any way whatsoever . The acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing . How this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me . The only saving grace I could find was Anastasia Hille 's cunning and repetitive use of the f word . ( and brilliant sound design ) If I were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores I would be up against a difficult decision . I 'm disappointed that I am unable to give it 0 stars .
0 A different look at horror . The styling differences between American and Russian films is interesting . However from my American perspective this movie just was n't that good . The protagonist , Marie played by Anastasia Hille was n't a pleasant character and I had a hard time identifying with her . She was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left . Also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film . Then a long time passed before any real suspense built up . Once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else . The concept was more original than most Direct - to - video movies and they did n't use sex to make up for a thin plot . All in all I 'd recommend it for renting , but not for theater goers .
0 This movie is an utter waste of time , the plot is awful , the dialogue is awful.<br /><br />The acting is OK , but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with . The photography and some of the special effects are OK , too , but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch . There is no logical progression to the story , the story line is utter nonsense . It is n't even scary . For a movie to be scary , there has to be at least a small element of believability . This movie has no believability at all.<br /><br />There are only three characters in the movie . Each character is shallow and has no personality . < br /><br />Most of the special effects and make up work are both badly done , or at most mediocre.<br /><br />I hope you read this and do not waste time on this movie unless you are curious to see an entirely awful movie .
0 This movie is simply not worth the time or money spent . Full of clichés and a plot that makes absolutely no sense ! I ca nt believe that so many people have given this awful movie a 10 . My guess is they are stooges of the movie maker . < br /><br />If I could give this movie a zero , I would . Too bad IMDb does n't allow that . < br /><br />The only reason I watched it because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it . What s sad is that I never had great expectations from this movie to begin with and yet I felt short changed . Take my word , do n't waste your $ 8 on this piece of trash . The only entertainment I got out of the movie was making fun of the directors name . In all , highly NOT RECOMMENDED !
0 This movie is a waste of time and money . Throughout the entire hour and a half , I continued to wait for it to get better and it never did . It was slow moving , the plot jumped around , it was n't scary or interesting , and really never amounted to anything . The credits during the introduction were long and drawn out , which was basically like the rest of the movie ( long and drawn out ) . Numerous parts of the plot made no sense . Several times during the movie I had thought that maybe I had " zoned out " because the incongruity of the plot , however , my companion had the same issue and assured me I did not " zone out " from boredom , but it was indeed the movie . I 've actually never posted on here about a movie before and have been actively looking up movies on IMDb for numerous years . So the fact that I 'm actually taking the time to write something should speak volumes of how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money on it .
0 This film ( along with Rinne ) are minor gems amongst the retread homage pics that have passed for horror movies so far at the 8FTDF " HorrorFest . " And , yes , that 's faint praise indeed . 'Cause there 's not much worse in filmdom than would - be auteurs who think atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot.<br /><br />And that 's all you get with The Abandoned . This is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head . Sure , it would have been nice if he 'd transfered it to film , but this happened instead . It 's a very pretty film with a few genuine scares , but the last reel is strictly for the latte slurping cineaste crowd .
0 If this is based on the true - life relationship , as purported , between Ms. Curtin and Mr. Levinson , I 'm thrilled I do not know them personally . This is painfully slow , and both characters take stupid pills liberally throughout the movie while the theme song gets played into the ground . Many stupid scenes with people acting stupid does not make for a comedy .
0 I have to be completely honest in saying first that I fell asleep somewhere in the middle , so I can not give a full opinion about the film until I see it in full . Basically , a group of thieves , including Sid Carter ( Sid James ) and Ernie Bragg ( Bernard Bresslaw ) , plan to make a fortune stealing a shipment of contraceptive pills from Finisham maternity hospital . This is where title character Matron ( Hattie Jacques ) works , along with staff members Sir Bernard Cutting ( Kenneth Williams ) , Dr. Francis Goode ( Charles Hawtrey ) , Dr. Prodd ( Terry Scott ) and Nurse Susan Ball ( Barbara Windsor ) . Patients and their visitors are around too , including pregnant Mrs. Tidey ( Joan Sims ) and her nervous dad - to - be husband Mr. Tidey ( Kenneth Connor ) . Also starring Bill Maynard as Freddy and EastEnders ' Wendy Richard as Miss Willing . This plan by the way is not working out by the way , because all the staff are getting in the way . That 's pretty much all can say about the film until I see it again in full . Okay !
0 One of the weaker Carry On adventures sees Sid James as the head of a crime gang stealing contraceptive pills . The fourth of the series to be hospital - based , it 's possibly the least of the genre . There 's a curiously flat feel throughout , with all seemingly squandered on below - par material . This is far from the late-70s nadir , but Williams , James , Bresslaw , Maynard et al . are all class performers yet not given the backing of a script equal to their ability.<br /><br />Most of the gags are onrunning , rather than episodic as Carry Ons usually are . So that instead of the traditional hit and miss ratio , if you do n't find the joke funny in the first place you 're stuck with it for most of the film . These continuous plot strands include Williams  for no good reason  worrying that he 's changing sex , and Kenneth Cope in drag . Like the stagy physical pratt falls , the whole thing feels more contrived than in other movies , and lacking in cast interest . Continuing this theme , Matron lacks the customary pun and innuendo format , largely opting for characterisation and consequence to provide the humour . In fact , the somewhat puerile series of laboured misunderstandings and forced circumstance reminds one more of Terry and June ... so it 's appropriate that Terry Scott is present , mugging futilely throughout.<br /><br />Some dialogue exchanges have a bit of the old magic , such as this between Scott and Cope : " What about a little drink ? " " Oh , no , no , I never touch it . " " Oh . Cigarette then ? " " No , I never touch them . " " That leaves only one thing to offer you . " " I never touch that either . " That said , while a funny man in his own right ( livening up the duller episodes of Randall and Hopkirk ( Deceased ) no end ) , you do feel that Cope is n't quite tapped in to the self - parodying Carry On idealology and that Bernard Bresslaw dressed as a nurse would be far funnier . This does actually happen , in part , though only for the last fifteen minutes.<br /><br />Williams attempting to seduce Hattie Jacques while Charles Hawtrey is hiding in a cupboard is pure drawer room farce , but lacks the irony to carry it off . That said , Williams 's description of premarital relations is priceless : " You do n't just go into the shop and buy enough for the whole room , you tear yourself off a little strip and try it first ! " " That may be so , " counters Jacques , " but you 're not going to stick me up against a wall . " Williams really comes to life in his scenes with Hattie , and you can never get bored of hearing a tin whistle whenever someone accidentally flashes their knickers.<br /><br />Carry On Matron is not a bad film by any means , just a crushingly bog - standard one .
0 CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it 's becoming clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best entries like CLEO , UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING being from the mid to late 60s < br /><br />In itself MATRON is by no means bad it 's just that we 've seen it all before with a thin plot ( A bunch of spivs trying to break into a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills which they plan to sell to third world countries ) surrounded by gags of a slightly amusing though unsophisticated nature . I think that 's where the problem lies - The gags are n't all that amusing with the unsophisticated nature starting to show its age . Did we need another movie that uses a man dressed up as a woman in order to drive the plot ? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is that I saw CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon , less that twelve hours ago and I have a problem in trying to remember a very funny line . That 's a serious problem for a comedy
0 It 's interesting to see what shape Pierce Brosnan 's career was in before Bond arrived on the scene . In this " tense " thriller , Pierce Brosnan plays the gentle Patrick , who works leading ghetto kids on " confidence courses " . He romances a woman , who has a bog - standard mop - top mid-90s kid called Eric . The woman 's drunken ex - husband soon arrives on the scene and begins to mess with Pierce.<br /><br />At one stage Pierce is innocently making " vegeburgers " . The husband enters . Pierce resumes making vegeburgers . The husband then assaults Pierce . Little chunks of half - eaten vegeburger call fall from Pierce 's mouth . The fight abruptly ends without showing the outcome . This is as good as the film gets.<br /><br / >
0 Who me ? No , I 'm not kidding . That 's what it really says on the video case.<br /><br />Plot ; short version : Pretty woman stands around smiling . This , for some reason , makes all men kill each other.<br /><br />"Find Ariel ... Where 's Ariel ... Can't Find Ariel ... " She 's right behind you , you idiot ... <br /><br />Most of what can be said about this horrendous little Space Opera has already been said , looks like.<br /><br />A bunch of corny actors playing mostly convicts come in after the first selection of actors is knocked off very quickly . Then they get knocked off in the same way . Every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance . Perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger pay check . The alien virus / hologram / VR witch / glitch seems physically powerless and does n't do a thing . Why ca n't she just stay in the computer instead of doing her " teleporting vampire " routine ? ( Actually , it would 've been more interesting if she had been a vampire , or doing more than just standing around looking at people , which is all she ever does . This is enough to make all the men kill each other . Go figure ... )<br /><br />This is n't really a space flick . There are far more shots of the old western trail , 1950 's Easy Rider trail , Film noir 's night club scene , even a jog on the beach in fantasy - land , none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense . The night club scene is in black and white , of course . Worked with " The Wizard of Oz " . Does n't work so well , here . This is probably a good thing , as those few shots they DO show of space are depressingly silly . You will probably cry during those moments , especially upon seeing that swirling " space ship " , which looks about three inches long.<br /><br />Nothing is felt for any of the characters , not because they are convicts or have no personality , but because they are in serious need of acting lessons , except for Billy Dee Williams who really does look depressed and at a loss , probably by being in this work ... <br /><br />This is one of those movies that , when viewed with friends , is going to cause some extremely " loud " silences , especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic one - liners ( including the line about French - kissing a meteor ... ? Did I hear that right ? Perhaps not ... )<br /><br />The original virtual reality girls get " killed " , which means nothing , as they are not even real to begin with . Well , the other " characters " are n't , either , but that 's beside the point . Haha.<br /><br />What 's kind of funny is that the scene that graces the video case is some sort of skull - horror - alien looking thing ( green filter added on top of that , to give it more of a ... uh ... green look ) , which is actually the android after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else afoot.<br /><br />Another odd deal I noticed . Whenever there is an explosion ( at least on my cheap DVD copy ) , everything becomes highly pixelated . I do n't mean a LITTLE pixelated , I mean HUGE blocks about 1/16th the size of the screen . Wow .
0 As usual , on IMDb , going by the majority vote instead of the " weighted average " is far more indicative of the movie 's entertainment value . In this case , the majority gives it a " one " . How right they are ! To start my review , I 'll first admit that I am completely clueless as to why this movie is titled " Alien Intruder " . It does involve space and even an " alien " ( I suppose ) , but there 's no rhyme or reason ( at all ) for anything in the long run , at least , no actual plot basis or resolution that I can make out anywhere.<br /><br />There are quite a few scenes that are so atrocious ( with regard to both the lines , the timing , and how they are spoken ) , that it far exceeds the weird feeling you get when watching similar really bad movies . I have no idea about that part near the beginning where an electronic Bugs Bunny seems to be ranting about something.<br /><br />The " plot " solely involves an area of space known as the G - Spot , sorry , make that G - Sector ... and a virtual reality program infected with some sort of alien ( ? ) virus . I think it is alien since the image of the otherwise normal Ariel appears as a photographic negative.<br /><br />For most of the movie , we see people getting shot with space weapons , falling out of lofts , and seemingly endless , pointless close shots of " Where 's Ariel ? " , " Ca n't find Ariel " ( pointless because most of the other shots INCLUDE interaction with Ariel , anyway - whatever ) on a computer monitor . Commander Skyler ( Billy Dee ) , sits and watches each fantasy of the convict 's VR programs hoping to find this Alien virus and become one with it ... ? ? ? Or maybe I missed something ... <br /><br />Billy Dee Williams took a few courses on " how to act in despair " prior to the filming of this . We know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers down over his face and looking mournful.<br /><br />The docking scene with the nose of one ship going into the rear of the other was semi - hilarious at least , and provided for a laugh in addition to the early scenes where we see several shots of the ship as it is just spinning in a circle , looking much like a Lego experiment gone awry.<br /><br />It seems everyone dies in this movie , so why bother ? Even the VR females get killed , as if that is supposed to mean anything ( especially since everyone else dies anyway) ... outrageous.<br /><br />Because of the money I save on groceries , I wo n't rant about wanting my money back that I paid for the DVD of this . The dollar that I saved on that bag of vanilla wafers paid for this reviewer 's time.<br /><br />I'll just add that the story itself , at least as a novel , and with far more detail added , could probably be quite interesting with the right author.<br /><br />1/10
0 When a friend gave me a boxed set of " 12 Amazing Scifi / Horror Movies ! " I was understandably a little cautious . But , since the item was a gift , I really did n't truly pay my common sense much heed . After all .... movies for free ! So what if they are a little ropey . After much consideration , Alien Intruder was the first of those movies . Ironically , it was first choice because it looked the best of the bunch . All I can say is , if this is the best of them , I shudder to think what the rest are like.<br /><br />On the surface , it had some good things going for it . Four ( count ' em ! ) actors that I was familiar with . Billy Dee Williams , Tracy Scoggins , Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway . I told myself ... "Billy and Tracy have been in some good scifi ( Star Wars and Babylon 5 , respectively ) so they would n't sign up for a turkey . Max is a veteran soap actor who never really managed to break into film .... but not too shoddy an actor . An Jeff .... well ... he 's done the good and the bad as far as films and TV go . " I was soon to discover that Jeff had decided to add " the ugly " to his repertoire of movies.<br /><br />The first clue was in the opening scenes . Jeff mugs his way with gusto through an " I 'm mad " scene before finally killing himself . An amusing cameo performance , really . Unfortunately this is , without much exaggeration , the highlight of the film . It goes downhill from there.<br /><br />Next up we have the commander of the mission ( Williams ) who is being sent out to see what happened to Jeff and his crew busy picking his new shipmates from among the ranks of the criminal element . But this assortment are n't so much the Dirty Dozen - more like the Unconvincing Foursome . Plus , one of the crims , a computer hacker , is shown in his cell working away on a laptop computer . Is n't that a bit like letting a murderer run a gun shop in the slammer ? Pretty lame prison , if you ask me.<br /><br />When they finally take off the effects are truly horrible . It looks like the spaceship model was knocked up in an afternoon by some bored 8 year old who had parts left over from his Airfix kits.<br /><br />But the horror does n't stop there . Whilst on route to the area where Jeff 's ship vanished , the criminal crew are rewarded for their good behaviour by being given weekends of virtual reality , in which they indulge their male fantasies . All well and good , and the use of scenes from their fantasies serves as an introduction to the " Alien Menace " which begins to appear there . But did they have to drag it out for quite sooooo loooooong ? Alien Intruder ? Alien Boring , more like.<br /><br />Finally they make it to G - Sector and the alien presence makes them fight against each other for her affections until only good old Max is left . The ending , in truly optimistic rubbish film vein , hints at a sequel - as if ! Also making an appearance in this movie is a character I 'll nickname the " Sweatdroid " . He 's supposed to be an android , but apparently that fact was lost on the make - up crew , who provided him with sweaty features at any opportunity . But do n't worry , he 's just there to make up the body count numbers at the end.<br /><br />Williams and Scoggins , to be truthful , do very little in the film . They only just barely stay awake , let alone act . And , as I mentioned earlier , Jeff gets an early trip to the showers , so his manicness is n't allowed to enlighten much of the film . Max tries his best , as do a couple of the other cast members , but the movie is just direly atrocious , to be honest.<br /><br />The one , and only , half - way imaginative thing this movie offers is the ship naming convention . They are all named after musicians - Holly , Presley , Joplin . The rest of the film is bland and uninspired.<br /><br />Made in 1992 , I had thought , on initial viewing , it was one of those 80 's straight - to - video jobs . Looks like they still made crap movies well into the 90 's , it seems.<br /><br />It 's best avoided . Even as a beer n chips movie this film is a stinker , but at least you can fast forward it , I suppose .
0 I could n't believe it . I had to rub my eyes a few times . Was it true ? < br /><br />Yes , there were Billy Dee Williams , Jeff Conaway , Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - all of them have some manner of talent but here they all were in what basically adds up to a Cinemax - style skin flick set on board a spaceship!<br /><br />Sad as it is , " Alien Intruder " tries to be unique , with a computer virus / alien demon / harpy / whatever else you want to call her named Ariel ( Scoggins ) infiltrating this sort - of high - tech virtual reality station on board a spaceship where four men are allowed to live out their fantasies as the system is over - seen by their captain ( Williams).<br /><br />Interesting ? Maybe , but here everything just plays out like a well - padded episode of " Red Shoe Diaries " . Williams out - classes everything right and left , and looks like he 'd rather be doing anything else , ANYWHERE else . Ah , the things people do for money .... <br /><br />The FX are pretty static , maybe even less than what you 'd expect for a straight - to - video cheapie like this . Unfortunately , even the female nudity is less than you 'd expect . SEXUAL INNUENDO is the real star here and , of course , it gets ALL the best scenes.<br /><br />If you like a movie that 's all tease and no brains , check out " Alien Intruder " . Of course , you 'll probably have to look no further than Cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning.<br /><br />No stars , not even for what star power this flick can muster.<br /><br />Leave this one lost in space .
0 This tiresome , plodding Las Vegas casino heist movie in almost impossible to watch and get involved in . It 's something you ' look at ' if you have absolutely nothing else better to do . The only two decent things in this movie are both attached to gorgeous Stella Stevens and one spends the entire program hoping she 'll fall out of one of those skimpy tops she wears . Many great shots of mid-70s Las Vegas ( when it was still a cool place to visit ) and the fashions of the day are good for a giggle as well . Otherwise , one big yawn . The Rhino dvd has a very good widescreen transfer but even at under 10 bucks it still ai n't worth it in my humble opinion .
0 Very , very humdrum movie fare here with Stella Stevens taking directions from someone in disguise(it did n't take me long to guess who it was ) in Old Nevada Town outside Vegas for a money heist in the Circus Circus Hotel in Las Vegas . Stevens leads her girl gang of three , and they find out that they must act much quicker than had been anticipated . Despite some neat looks at Las Vegas in the 70 's , very average yet credible acting from most involved , and a plot line with potential , Las Vegas Lady lays one big boring egg . It seems forever for the film to kick into gear , and when it does it just sputters here and there and never really speeds up . I was somewhat disappointed with this film . Sure , I was n't expecting anything great , but I at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the 70 's or something like it . Not even close . No one dies . There is a lame gunfight between creaky Stuart Whitman and officious George DiCenzo , one year prior to his grand performance as the prosecuting attorney Bugliosa in Helter Skelter . The gunfight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall . There is one punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument . Beyond that nothing in terms of action . And as for the girls , do n't expect much there either . Stella and her girls(both very mediocre yet pretty talents , get in a sauna and a bath . What do we see ? Nothing but a fleeting side profile . Stella wears these nice open blouses accentuating her real talents , but I wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance . That way I could write one thing that would recommend the film . Alas , it was not to be , and I have little to say in this film 's favor . It is n't a horrible film in any way , it just has nothing going for it either . YAWN .
0 Snow White , which just came out in Locarno , where I had the chance to see it , of course refers to the world famous fairy tale . And it also refers to coke . In the end , real snow of the Swiss Alps plays its part as well.<br /><br />Thus all three aspects of the title are addressed in this film . There is a lot of dope on scene , and there is also a pale , dark haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all kind of trouble to come to her rescue.<br /><br />But : It 's not a fairy tale . It 's supposed to be a realistic drama located in Zurich , Switzerland ( according to the Tagline).<br /><br />Technically the movie is close to perfect . Unfortunately a weak plot , foreseeable dialogs , a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed acting do n't add up to create authenticity . Thus as a spectator I remained untouched.<br /><br />And then there were the clichés , which drove me crazy one by one : Snow White is a rich and spoiled upper class daughter - of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them , because they were so busy all the time . Her best girlfriend , on the other hand , has loving and caring parents . They ( a steelworker and a housewife ) live in a tiny flat , poor and happy - and ignorant of the desperate situation their daughter is in . The good guy (= prince ) is a musician ( ! ) from the French speaking part of Switzerland ( which is considered to be the economically less successful but emotionally fitter fraction of the country ) . He has problems with his parents . They are migrants from Spain , who do n't seem to accept his wild way of living - until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed.<br /><br />And so it goes on : Naturally , the drug dealer is brutal , the bankers are heartless , the club owner is a playboy and the photographer , although a woman ( ! ) , has only her career in mind when she exposes Snow White in artsy pornographic pictures at a show.<br /><br />This review does n't need a spoiler in order to let you add these pieces to an obvious plot . As I like other films by Samir , e.g. " Forget Baghdad " , I was quite disappointed . Let 's hope for the next one .
0 This is a badly made , poor remake of Bimalda 's classic Parineeta . The story is based on Sarat Chandra 's book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original . Well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham creativity . The acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham . Shekar 's father 's choice of words in abusing Lolita ( Balan ) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story . Again the scene where Shekhar ( Saif ) slaps Lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters , is quite jarring to the senses , and could have been easily avoided . Similarly the sex scene between Saif and Balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience . When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys it 's spirit , the work falls apart . The song " piyu bole " is quite OK . Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where Saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father . This is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit . On these counts this movie deserves 3 stars . The song and dance by Rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on . The song is tuneful but I remember having heard it somewhere before and if Iam not mistaken the tune appears to have been plagiarized . < br /><br />Well , agreed the times have changed from then to now . But then this movie is not even reflective of the modern times.<br /><br />This is what happens when the modern Bollywood film makers get increasingly obsessed with impressing the NRIs and grabbing the lucrative NRI entertainment market . Such movies end up neither belonging to India nor to any other part of the world .
0 I stopped watching lost at this episode because I thought Ana - Lucia and Libby 's deaths were unnecessary and really depressing . Then I found out that they kept Libby around just to die in the next episode ! Gah ! I ca n't handle it.<br /><br />I liked this show for the first season , but it definitely declined in the second season , I found Jack and Locke 's little religious feud to be annoying . The deaths of Rodriguez & Watros ' characters was the final straw ! < br /><br />I give this episode a 4/10 , for being the end to my viewing of this formerly great series created by Alias legend J.J. Abrams . I hope his series in the future will improve on this one .
0 I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark . It was so bad , I could hardly believe what I was seeing . There are no characters , just a few stereotypes wandering around and getting killed . The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation , and that 's about it . There was no real plot , and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation . In fact , many action scenes just began on their own , coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track . While I was watching this movie I kept asking " Where is this happening ? What 's going on ? " The acting was high school drama quality , with stiff wooden delivery , as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines . Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design . ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room . The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks , looking almost robotic in their movements . So , these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios , often without even the benefit of transition scenes . They were here , now they 're there . This was happening , now that 's happening . Random scenes with little rhyme or reason . I had a lot of fun watching it . Definitely not worth nine bucks though .
0 Can it ever be said that there are some movies that have no redeeming features whatsoever ? Answer : Yes , and this is one of them . After helming the appalling ' House of the Dead ' director Uwe Boll has now cast his less - than - talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation . Do n't these guys get it ? To anyone who ca n't understand , here it is in block capitals for you : VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE FOR GOOD MOVIES ! The acting here is , at best , sub - standard . The set design and special effects are poor . Unlike the video game ( which did have its scary moments ) the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom , no sense of danger or menace . Pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper . The main culprit is the director . Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush . Hackneyed zooms , swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored . Why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets . Avoid at all costs .
0 True , there are many movies much worse then this movie . This movie was no Manos : The Hands of Fate , or Troll 2 ( yes , I have seen them both .. twice ) but at the same time this movie is No Alien , Predator or even Alien Vs . Predator ( Yes , even that movie surpassed this ) . Movies like this make Battlefield Earth look like a Star Wars it is so bad . Razzie awards lookout , your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters . This film I 'm talking about is of course Alone in the Dark . I 'll try to take you though a step by step process on why this film was so bad.<br /><br />Acting- I 'll first start off with what perhaps was the best component of this film ( next to the ending credits , which played ' Wish I had An Angel ' , the acting . Christian Slater must be proud of himself , he successfully proved that it is possible to act decent in a film worse then drinking antifreeze . Though all his awful dialog he had to speak , it made me wonder why he just did n't walk off the set halfway . Perhaps it was because of Stephen Dorff being in the film as well ( somebody he wishes he could be but fails at it ) . Tara Reid is a bad actress but good looking and that 's all that really matters in films like these . That is not to say the acting was perfect though , it was average , not good , and perhaps the only thing in the film not good.<br /><br />The Soundtrack- Except for ' Wish I had An Angel ' , the soundtrack is pointless and bad heavy medal being pumped into the viewers ears , perhaps to disguise the awful story ( something I will get to soon ) . A long and very expensive 2 CD soundtrack is now up for sale for those musically challenged.<br /><br />The Directing- Directed by Hollywoods favorite director Uwe Ball who brought us the classic House of the Dead . Telling us " Yes , movies can get this utterly bad and that 's just the beginning to my deadly saga of awful movies " . At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Ball . Without being told I would have guessed a monkey was kidnapped from the Congo , brought here and forced to make opinions on how to make the movie under penalty of being shocked . The director of photography was probably a camcorder taped onto a skateboard and pushed forward until it hits a wall . On the scenes where the camera should stay still it is constantly moving , not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should be moving in action , the camera stops for some reason.<br /><br />The Producing- Who on earth is stupid enough to put money towards this bomb ? I pity the fool ... sometimes . Sometimes I 'm glad he or she was taught such a lesson to never put money towards garbage worse then dog dung tied up in a bag.<br /><br />The Writing / Storyboard- Trying to Analise the story is more painful then jamming an ice pick under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as I possibly could with it right after but I will still attempt it.<br /><br />Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children where to go under science experiments . He escapes and hides in an electrical outlet where he is electrocuted ( this is the point where it got so bad i started to laugh out loud ) . Then it fast - forwards many years later where he 's a paranoia detective . He get 's attacked by some zombie that ca n't be shot to death , kills it and moves on with life . Later on he gets attacked by some crazy looking monster and he discovers secrets that nobody else knows.<br /><br />Yeah , the plot is bad , really really bad . The film beings with expecting us to read approximately 10 minutes , which felt like 100 , of random text about an untrue civilization called the Abskani . The film goes not to have one twist after another , more then the audience can handle , more then the audience wants to handle , more then the audience could ever care about . This storyline is rock bottom bad that even Double Dragon does better.<br /><br />Overall , miss out on this movie . I gave it a 1 out of 10 but that is because there is no 0 .
0 I do n't know where to begin . Tara Reid needs to be stopped before she 's put in another movie . Stephen Dorff looks like he got his character 's motivation from Val Kilmer in " Top Gun " . Slater sleepwalks through this dreck . The direction , editing , sound ( do we really need a heavy - metal video in the middle of a gunfight ? ) , costumes ( bulletproof vests with muscles on them ) , and hey , there 's no discernible plot either . It amazes me that no one attached to the project stopped and said , " hey guys , this just does n't make any sense , let 's start over " . Hopefully Slater 's career can rebound from this disaster.<br /><br />Hands down the worst film I 've ever seen .
0 Obviously a lot of talented behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie , so do n't even look at the credits at the end , you 'll only hold it against them . Nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie , only 3 were in the theater ; two passed out after 10 minutes , and they were the lucky ones . The ' monsters ' were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2 , The Wrath of Khan , and rejected designs for the space creatures in Alien . The creators of the movie obviously did n't want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters , so they hired forth rate actors who apparently did n't get to memorize their lines , or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began . Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening , if anything is . If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing , and you do n't pass out , you 'll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film . The implausibility of several scenes will just stun you , and Stephen Dorff 's regular spewing of the ' Queen Mary of curse words ' conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this . If you must see this movie , do yourself a favor and wait until it 's in the bargain bin at the video store . If there 's any justice in the film industry , one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you .
0 The movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes . It gives the basic summary of what is going on . This could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect . Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about , keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them . The plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie . Not only does the plot change , but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie . I have never played the video game , but know people who have . From my understanding whether you 've played the game or not this movie does not get any better . Save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters .
0 Well where do I begin my story ? ? I went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the Actors that were in it , and that it was supposed to be a horror movie.<br /><br />Well I figured out within the first 20 minutes , what a poor decision I had made going out seeing this movie . The Plot was crap , and so was the script . The lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically.<br /><br />The cast could n't have been more plastic looking . Even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker ... like they dragged on for no particular reason . Very poor editing.<br /><br />All in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money . Boo .
0 This movie succeeds at being one of the most unique movies you 've seen . However this comes from the fact that you ca n't make heads or tails of this mess . It almost seems as a series of challenges set up to determine whether or not you are willing to walk out of the movie and give up the money you just paid . If you do n't want to feel slighted you 'll sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved , they 've all seen better days , but then you realize they actually got paid quite a bit of money to do this and you 'll lose pity for them just like you 've already done for the film . I ca n't go on enough about this horrible movie , its almost something that Ed Wood would have made and in that case it surely would have been his masterpiece.<br /><br />To start you are forced to sit through an opening dialogue the likes of which you 've never seen / heard , this thing has got to be five minutes long . On top of that it is narrated , as to suggest that you the viewer can not read . Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets underway , it is as if he is operating solely to get lines on to the movie poster tag line . Soon we meet Stephen Dorff , who I typically enjoy ) and he does his best not to drown in this but ultimately he does . Then comes the ultimate insult , Tara Reid playing an intelligent role , oh help us ! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and somehow she continually gets roles in movies , in my opinion though she should stick to movies of the American pie type . < br /><br />All in all you just may want to see this for yourself when it comes out on video , I know that I got a kick out of it , I mean lets all be honest here , sometimes its comforting to revel in the shortcomings of others .
0 The minute the forward started , I knew we were in for trouble ! The premise is laughable at best . The story line was even worse , if that is possible.<br /><br />The acting was stiff and the actors gave off a sense of inexperience . You expect more from the likes of Slater , Reid and Dorff . Lines were delivered as if from a robot . And I 'm sorry , I like Reid but she was VERY unbelievable as an archaeologist . Slater and Dorff picked a lousy film to try and stage their comebacks . < br /><br />The continuity was off through out the entire film . The creatures were n't bad , but they really were n't good either . < br /><br />Bottom line , I want that ninety minutes of my life back . They can keep the money , but give me the time ! What a waste .
0 The definition of an abomination as defined by Webster 's Dictioary is " a cause of abhorrence or disgust . " If someone can think of a more appropriate word or definition than this for Alone in the Dark , please let me know because this is the best I can come up with . However , I do no feel that in anyway this word describes how truly awful this film is.<br /><br />I went to see this film with two of my roommates . One has very similar tastes to me , the other is an action / adventure flick guru . This latter guy usually does n't care about the size of the plot holes , as long as the movie contains lots of explosions he will walk away satisfied.<br /><br />That being said we entered the theater for the Friday viewing of Alone in the Dark . Little to my surprise we were the only people in the theater . When it started I knew why immediately.<br /><br />It begins with the worst opening scene of any movie , and unfortunately I have to admit it only gets worse from there . The opening scene is a 5 minute scroll text that is narrated . Yet , I understand why it was narrated . The director must have understood that only illiterate people would even ascertain the thought of PAYING to see this movie . Yet , not only is this first scene the longest scroll text in the history of cinema , but it also makes no sense . It seems as if in the same sequence we are hearing about to completely separate movies . One is about an ancient civilization and its tampering with a portal , the other is about a crazy scientist and his experiments on orphans . If you are reading this and are confused , you are not alone.<br /><br />Then the awful storyline , acting , effects , and camera work begin . Tara Reid is horrendous as an actress . She does nothing to even for one second make you think that she is a museum curator . Slater is just bad , not convincing , and has no chemistry with Reid.<br /><br />The plot is probably the worst thing ever created by man . The entire time myself and the roommate with similar tastes are asking questions like : What is this ? And what is going on ? Other than this scrolling garbage we have a few narrated sequences by Slater himself . Are they good ? NO . Do they explain anything ? NO . Do we at any point as an audience have the slightest inkling as to why we should care what happens ? Once again , NO.<br /><br />Then we have a random sex scene . We are told that Slater and Reid are together , yet at no time do they act as though they even care about on another . But then BAM ... sex scene . Once again I do n't know.<br /><br />A good , oh i do n't know , 30 seconds after that woeful scene ends we have a gunfight with 20 or so military and a similar number of alien things . This is set to a heavy - metal track and causes more brain hemorrhaging than one ever thought possible.<br /><br />And if that was n't enough ... <br /><br />There exists no main villain . There is the scientist and there are the " alien " things . At one point the scientist controls the alien things and stands on a hill commanding them to attack the military outpost . Why ? How did he become the supreme commander of these things ? Why do they listen to him ? Once again I have no idea.<br /><br />The movie ends with Slater and Reid walking in an evacuated city . Why was the city evacuated ? Did the alien things break through ? Did the military tell them ? Who knows ... and by this point who cares ? I did n't and you won't.<br /><br />But to top it off , Slater and Reid are attacked by an alien thing . Even though it was stated that alien things will be killed by exposure to sunlight . And that s right , you guessed it , it the middle of the * & % $ ing day and it 's bright as can be . Maybe the alien thing bought a pair of sunglasses , I do n't know and I do n't care.<br /><br />Now after the movie ended I ran outside the theater , all 6 foot 6 inches of me , waving my arms and shaking my afro telling everyone not to go see this movie . Even my gung - ho action / adventure roommate ( who would consider a movie that just cut and pasted 2 hours of explosion into 1 film to be the greatest thing ever created ) admitted that plot holes were very evident in this film.<br /><br />To sum up this CRAP - FEST i give it a 0.0/10 and would give it lower if I could.<br /><br />Unequivocally , the worst movie ever made . I would n't wish this movie on my worst enemy .
0 I usually start by relaying the premise of the film , but before anyone makes any hasty judgments about my review , let me preface it by saying that I 'm someone who likes most films ( just check my other reviews ) . Alone in the Dark is a film by director Uwe Boll , whose film right before this one was House of the Dead ( 2003 ) . Like Alone in the Dark , it was also a film adaptation of a video game . Almost everyone hated it . Well , I loved it . I even gave it a 10 out of 10 ! My point in stating this ( which will surely turn some readers off immediately ) is that if even I hated Alone in the Dark , there must be something wrong with it.<br /><br />The Premise : Who am I kidding ? Attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the United States ' budget , but here it goes anyway . Some archaeologists discovered evidence of some lost American Indian tribe . The Indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of broaching the " second world " , which was evil in nature . The bad stuff wiped them out , but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key . Later , some scientist / government researcher who had been experimenting with the paranormal , and specifically this tribe , decided to experiment on some kids , to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world . ( Believe it or not -- everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film -- it 's just white text scrolling across a black screen with a voice - over also reading it to us ) . Then , there was something about the kids being in an orphanage , but the government takes them back out , and then a bunch of people are searching for archaeological relics , and there are super humans roaming around , and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on.<br /><br />In fact , the exposition never really stops . It 's like a neverending backstory from hell . There are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films , maybe 25 . But not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film . In addition to the mystical lost Indian tribe and the superhumans , we also get monsters that resemble a cross between Alien and a werewolf , worms that invade your body and turn into snake - like aliens , tunneling worms underground , zombies , Starship Trooper - like wars , evil scientists , underground lairs , gold mines , spooky warehouses , impalements , big mostly unused museums , government conspiracies , golden trunks pulled out of the sea , nuns , explosions , complex backstabbing plots , a very ambiguous romance , car chases , home invasions , kitchen sinks . . . wait , I ca n't remember if that last one was in the film . Even more amazingly ( amusingly ? ) , in Fangoria # 240 , producer Shawn Williamson was quoted as saying , " We 're spending much more time on story , being very meticulous about that " . Tara Reid called Alone in the Dark " a smarter film".<br /><br />Let me not mislead anyone . A lot of that stuff above might sound yummy to the potential audience for this film , but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else . I usually had no idea what any setting 's relation was to any other setting , why we were there , or what anyone was doing ( at least when each scene began ) . It 's just a random mishmash of settings and clichés , as if director Uwe Boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like lottery numbers . Then when he was done , he and editor Richard Schwadel decided to cut the film by using dice , then reassembled it by throwing the I Ching . Sometimes the film plays like an extended director 's reel ( which is a combination of short , varied , unrelated scenes that directors circulate to try to get work ) , but perhaps that 's being too generous . I 'm not sure Boll would get work if this were his reel . < br /><br />Just as I tend to at least like most films , I tend to like most actors and most performances . It 's very rare that I say that a performance was bad . Well , Tara Reid was bad here -- and I 'm someone who usually likes Reid . I do n't know what happened . For a large percentage of the film , they just move her around the set like a prop . They might as well have just bought a blow - up doll . That would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings . Maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of driftwood after they saw the dailies of her mumbling nonsense dialogue in a monotone that 's usually reserved for entertaining mother - in - laws.<br /><br />And speaking of that dialogue , a lot of Alone in the Dark plays like a Godzilla film without Godzilla . By that , I mean that it 's a lot of pseudo - scientific gobbledy - gook . At least in Godzilla films , there 's a campiness to it , because they know how ridiculous it is , and there 's a big payoff in that we get to see Godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant gnat with radioactive death beams shooting from its eyes or something.<br /><br />Just what Stephen Dorff and Christian Slater are doing here , besides overacting and filing lawsuits against their agents , is difficult to say . I ca n't say that I thought anyone in the film had a decent performance , although maybe Slater at least saw the cigar . I think that 's unprecedented for me.<br /><br />Still , I did n't give this film a 1 . There was some competent cinematography , even if Boll and Schwadel made mincemeat out of it , and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good . Heck , even the novelette prologue was n't so bad . I actually thought the film had promise at that point . But this may just be the worst film I 've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more .
0 Honestly , I ca n't be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is simply too short . What I will say is that , Alone In The Dark succeeds in only three things : 1 . It will make you laugh , but for all the wrong reasons . 2 . It manages to throw several useless plots into the air but dropping all of them.<br /><br />and < br /><br />3 . It utterly disgraces the classic PC game on which it is supposedly based by being a complete failure in all aspects of film - making.<br /><br />Doctor Boll , if that is indeed what you are ( I 'm thinking proctology here ) , what on Earth are you doing in a director 's chair ?
0 Spoilers ahead , but does it really matter ? Have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions ? Could this be it ? Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world ? Why is this question never answered ? Why was the opening text crawl incoherent ? Why would a nun ( she sure seemed nice ! ) hand over 20 orphans to a madman ? Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver ? Why does one of the gold mine 's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage ? Why does Tara Reid 's character suddenly show up at Christian Slater 's apartment for sex ? ( Or did I just answer my own question ? ) Why would even a non - archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer ? Why would modern computers still display green pre - Tron - era grid outlines of objects , complete with little " bleeps " ? And must all movie explosive timers have digital displays ? Why does n't ANYTHING in this movie make any sense ?
0 Tara Reid as an intellectual , Christian Slater(usually great ) as a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as ... well it 's STEPHEN DORFF FOR Christ SAKE ! ! ! ! I personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort . You guys are on . Heres an idea , just my humble lowly opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous choices , a movie about the most brilliant neuro - physicist in history invent one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this , heres the clincher they have to be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton . I knew you guys would love that . Seriously though you owe me $ 7.50 .
0 This should be my kind of movie . Even if it sucked , it still should have been right up my alley ; hell , I like " Congo , " and " Allan Quatermaine " movies . I have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien / demon / adventure movies . Let 's go over why I decided to watch this in the first place.<br /><br />1 . Horror / Sci - fi almost always intrigues me 2 . I 'm a big fan of archaeology , and this movie does involve a rare treasure . 3 . Super - natural enemies with quality FX . 4 . Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy . 5 . Tara Reid is hot.<br /><br />So this movie had potential , at least in the cheese - horror section of the video store , but boy did it suck ass . The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf , and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I do ... I mean , let 's face it , both are melodramatic . But now on to some of the many faults.<br /><br />Tara Reid . Even though the movie as a whole is worse , Reid 's performance is truly awful . We 're not just talking bad , I 'm talking about nominating Tara Reid for worst performance of the year . I do n't know if she is capable of acting , but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league ... completely . Watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist was n't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn . I mean this is n't just bad , it is laughably bad . Oh , and for those of you curious , she does n't get naked , only down to a bra in a silly , totally unnecessary love scene.<br /><br />Even with Reid 's performance , perhaps the movie could have worked , but the plot is what dominates , and the plot seems written by a 10 year old . I had n't realized this was a video game adaptation until AFTER watching the DVD , otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in real - time . < br /><br />The storyline jumps back and forth from Slater 's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened , he has amnesia , of course . In his adult life Slater was recruited by some Unit 713 , a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something . Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious , I guess , you never really know unless it was in one of those voice - overs I zoned out during . The movie starts with Slater hunting artifacts , obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a " Chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities . " I may have the exact quote wrong , but you get the idea.<br /><br />There is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth ( no reason given ) , experiments on children , super demon / alien - human hybrids , " photonic " bullets ( the demon things ca n't stand sunlight ) and , of course , Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone.<br /><br />Jesus , I ca n't even being to wade through the clichéd elements . The script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide SOME depth . I mean , why is this evil scientist so damn evil ? Oh right , humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race . I guess he 's infected ? How did that happen ? Oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself . How the hell did that happen ? Why and where did he get the super slugs ( oh yes , they use the old sci - fi stand by of parasitic aliens / demons which " fuse " with the spine of their host)Of course , Slater is , like Blade , half super - slug powered , but his slug " did n't fully fuse due to an electrical shock , " thank god . Oh , and the people with these " fused " spines , have no idea they 're half - alien / demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies . Yeah we get zombies.<br /><br />So lots of crap that could be entertaining , but none of it is.<br /><br />Also , the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place ... at least nothing a little dynamite ca n't handle.<br /><br />Not the very worst thing you 'll see , but a truly bad movie .
0 The title of worse film of all time is one that gets handed out quickly and often . Most of the time it is exaggeration of the fact but I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the short list of real candidates : Plan 9 from Outer Space , Battlefield Earth , and the Adventures of Pluto Nash.<br /><br />As I watched the 90 minute bore I found it difficult to even stay awake even while I was trying so hard to laugh at the film . But alas I felt alone in the dark ( I was gon na try to avoid the pun but I could n't resist ) as I looked around hoping to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends . Alas my friends and I had to provide comedy throughout the film.<br /><br />So ... about the film itself . Lets talk about the action and effects since that should be the only positive part of the film . The film contains evil creatures that are a cross between the Xenos in Aliens ( they even call them Xenos ) , and the creatures in Pitch Black . The can turn invisible at random ( and I assure you it is random ) and get hurt by light . Also present are small centipede creatures used to control humans that transform them into something resembling a zombie . All of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997 . The action scenes are chaotic and are impossible to follow . People shooting randomly on a blue screen stage or an empty set at monsters who were inserted in post . Light quickly flashes on a dark screen making your pupils burn from overwork while bad rock music blares in the background.<br /><br />And those were the high points . The story revolving around a paranormal investigator ( Slater ) whose idea of looking tough is wearing a black wife beater Tshirt with a trench - coat and not shaving for 2 days . An archaeologist ( Reid ) who is rather inept . And a government agent(Dorff ) whose lines involve barking order . All three should be ashamed at their performances ( not that they have really ever done a good a job before ) and the casting director should be ashamed . Reid and Slater are supposed to be lovers in the film I guess . The film contains the single most awkward love scene I have ever seen on film between the two.<br /><br />Then comes the plot . Quiet frankly the parts that make sense are not interesting at all . The rest is illogical at best . The plot holes could contain the collective egos of all three stars . The film begins with text and a voice explaining the back - story . This opening lasts for over a minute and already the viewer knows they are in for something terrible . This opening narration is later repeated adnausem in the awkward dialog in a very clumsy and heavy handed fashion through the rest of the film . And the ending did not make one ounce of sense . Not only did it not make sense in the world of the film , it simply did not make sense.<br /><br />Finally the direction of one Uwe Boll . Disgrace , that s all that can be said . His use of shaking the camera to simulate suspense . His lack of direction with the actors . Just watch Reid in scenes in which she is not center focus of the shot . The complete waste of special effects money for bullet time effects . And finally choosing to use voice over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to the viewers.<br /><br />I payed a $ 1.50 to see this show at a second run theater . And while the laughs me and my friends provided made it worth every quarter I would advise people to avoid paying any more for this film . Grab about 3 friends and split the rental cost and tear this movie a new one.<br /><br />Shame on you Uwe Boll . Shame on you Tara Reid . Shame on you Christian Slater . Shame on you Stephen Dorff . Shame on anyone who was associated with this film .
0 0 * 's Christian Slater , Tara Reid , Stephen Dorff , Frank C. Turner , Mathew Walker , Will Sanderson . Directed by Uwe Boll.<br /><br />Based on the video game director Uwe Boll attempts to recreate the game into an action - packed nail biter sadly he does n't succeed . Instead he makes one of the worst movies ever MADE ! Even though he gets minor celebrity such as Christian Slater , Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good such as a story line , and some basic relativity of what 's going on in the dark and the light . The movie bounces all around and Uwe Boll has no creative control . And not to mention the bad CGI used on making the monsters . Even though they did look cool and the feedings were well , a little lame . Honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made . My final rating 0/10 .
0 Alone In The Dark is one BAD movie and tied with Deuce Bigalow for worst movie of the year . I wish that was ALL I had to say but of course the IMDb stipulates a word count and all that.<br /><br />I'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie . A low budget dreck like Red Zone Cuba , Monster A Go Go and Manos . Or a huge budget disgrace like Gigli , Superbabies or this guff . You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos happen because the director has n't a clue . Movies like this happen because the director is a stupid , money grabbing idiot who simply does n't care about his audience.<br /><br />It 's more shocking when you consider that Uwe Boll ( The mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real garbage under his belt ) has created something that only happens once in a blue moon . The really terribly bad horror film . Everything about it is a mess . Cheesy CGI , bad plot , insane random camera cuts and appalling soundtrack.<br /><br />Alone In The Dark is a dreadful movie that should be watched by absolutely nobody . Woo hoo ! Review over . Give me a bud , roll on 2006 and may I NEVER speak of this again.<br /><br />Don't watch this film .
0 Alone in the Dark is Uwe Boll 's kick in the nuts to Hollywood after House of the Dead 's punch in the face.<br /><br />If anything it proves just how much of a master manipulator Boll is . After forcing Artisan out of business over the flop that was House of the Dead , one can only assume the normally credible Lion 's Gate Films only released AITD under contractual obligation after acquiring Artisan 's assets . Because AITD is an even bigger example of complete lack of coherent film - making ability , plot exposition and just plain stealing poorly from other movies because it was supposed to look cool instead of because it fitted within the movie 's framework.<br /><br />But then that 's the point , is n't it . Boll is n't trying to make a coherent film because he is n't trying to direct Alone in the Dark . He 's just trying to manipulate Hollywood.<br /><br />Alone in the Dark , like House of the Dead , Dungeon Siege , Far Cry , Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are " announced " or in " pre - production".<br /><br />These are n't movies to be directed , but investment portfolios . Every single one of them rushed into production under the pretence that the tax law Boll and his investors are exploiting may be closed within the next 2 to 3 years . The more bomb projects he can release within that time - frame , the more money he and his investors can gain . Why bother making a good movie when a bad movie 's making you a mint anyway ? The result is movies like the awfulness of Alone in the Dark.<br /><br />Alone in the Dark , like all his other movies are just a cynical exploitation of Hollywood 's current trend for lazy film - making.<br /><br />And to those who support Boll by calling him misunderstood or the next Ed Wood , congratulations , by making a cult figure out of the man , you 're just making it easier for him to get investors but giving him notoriety.<br /><br />For more information , read here : http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid=21699 As an aside , just do n't ask me how he 's getting his cast - lists together . Unless the actors are in on the investment - scam somehow , that mystery has still to be uncovered .
0 There should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like Resident Evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game , not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible . RE was a survival horror game , and a damn effective one at that , yet Paul WS Anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along . Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as Resident Evil , so of course , there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie . Instead , Alone in the Dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies.<br /><br />The plot , despite the fact that it obviously is n't supposed to matter , is the largest of many problems with the movie . The movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important , as after a minute passes , the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them . Then there 's something about an orphanage , some artefacts , an ancient tribe , some bureaucracy and some demons , all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really ca n't follow with what is going on . Characters move in and out of the plot like candy , some having huge build - ups for meaningless deaths . Basically , what I can understand is that some demons got released , and Edward Carnby ( Slater ) has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him . He finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an ex - girlfriend anthropologist ( Reid ) , who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason . Then , out of nowhere , all hell breaks loose , and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander ( Dorff ) , who apparently has a mutual hatred for Carnby.<br /><br />It 's all ridiculous , and the reason I do n't really understand it is n't just because it 's complicated and jumbled , but it leaves no room for anyone to really care . Instead , I highly recommend that , if you must see this film , bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion.<br /><br />The action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little , right ? Too bad , this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made , with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens . Considering that this is based on a horror game , not an action game , it is especially annoying.<br /><br />The first action scene involving a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is among the worst I have ever had to witness , and the rest is n't all that great either . The demons look somewhat cool , though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect . Scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict . It 's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night.<br /><br />The acting is what I like to call taking actors and making them do nothing . Slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie , though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on . The same is true of Dorff , who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent ( something that has happened to him a lot ) . Reid is pretty much exactly what she should be , background sex appeal , as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster ( as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning).<br /><br />In all , this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies . If they keep ruining the spirit like this , it 's only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing Middle - Easterns with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens . Unlike Resident Evil , however , this one does n't deserve a second chance , as I do n't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is . It 's bland , uninteresting and unexciting . This is the movie equivalent of diarrhea ; it 's all thrown together , nothing really fits and , in the end , you 're just glad it 's over.<br /><br />TOTAL : 4 %
0 Alone in The Dark is one of my favorite role - playing - games of all time . I remember spending whole nights facing the PC screen , trying to escape that mansion and actually being startled at times when monsters came surprisingly charging in . Now , mind you - I am weary of " computer - game - generated " movies . I do n't remember a single success story in this new Hollywood genre , although some are entertaining enough to be watchable . And yet , I am such a big fan of the game that I could n't resist . My rationale was that if the movie had a plot that so much as resembled the game 's , it would be OK . < br /><br />Man , those were 90 minutes ( which seemed like 300 ) of my life that I 'll never get back . If I had that chance , I would have gladly spent them rearranging my sock drawer instead . This is n't even in the " so bad it 's funny " category . You would think even Christian Slater had a bit more sense than joining this stink bomb . Now , Tara Reid ... I 'm not complaining about her presence . However , if the purpose of putting this chick in a starring role is to have a sex scene , - which I totally understand and support ( hey , I 'm a guy ! ) - I 've seen more of her body on press conferences.<br /><br />There is no plot to speak of . Wo n't waste your time pitching it to you . The credibility of the story sinks below ' I did not have sex with Ms. Lewinski ' . The acting is but a few notches above ' Street Fighter ' , which , by the way , being one of the worst movies I 've seen , I would recommend OVER this one.<br /><br />Kids , I recommend the Video Game . It has far better story , acting and much more thrills . As for the movie , here 's a spoiler - it STINKS ! Wait for the porno version .
0 We should all congratulate Uwe Boll . He 's done the unthinkable . He may be the only director to have two movies in the bottom 100 on IMDb ! He 's like some kind of cinematic cockroach . No matter how little talent he has , and no matter how bad these movies are , he manages to keep making them . I know , he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre German fund , but even so , his ability to keep making movies despite absolute , complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe.<br /><br />It would n't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy . I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games . Even the latest one , the New Nightmare , was good for a few hours of game play . There was a good movie to be made out of Edward Carnby 's adventures , but this is not it . Now Uwe Boll has gotten his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter : the Reckoning . What 's next , Silent Hill ? Doom ? I can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game - to - movie adaptations if he 's not stopped . Someone needs to take away his line of credit , or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise , no one is interested in that title any more.<br /><br />Think about it , is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title anymore ? No way . A new House of the Dead game comes out for X - Box and nobody 's gon na care . The title is dead , and all because of Uwe Boll . So if any of you out there work for a game publisher , or know a game publisher , or have access to a game publisher ... please warn them . < br /><br />This movie itself is not even worth reviewing . I ca n't separate what I did n't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it . Literally , everything about it sucks . The writing , the acting , the music , the CG effects , the editing . I thought that if I waited until it came out on DVD and then rented it with low expectations , I would n't be disappointed . Boy , was I wrong . Never underestimate Uwe 's ability to turn out a big , steaming pile of BOLL sh*t .
0 I remember reading all the horrible , horrible reviews for this film when it came out . I meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theaters in three weeks . The only other movie to manage that is Gigli . < br /><br />When the movie came out on DVD , I bought it to see how awful it was . I could n't think of the sheer horrible attention that this film was getting was possible . After seeing it , I can understand . < br /><br />First off , let me say that this film is not without some cool shots . There 's a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun , which I thought was neat . And the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at ; but it gets old after the first time you see it . < br /><br />Let me start with the worst thing in this movie : Tara Reid . If bad acting was a sin , then Hell would 've chucked Tara Reid right out since she 's so unbelievably awful in this movie it 's unthinkable . And of all the roles , she plays a curator . Now if she played a dumb , empty- headed sex toy then maybe I might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character . Apparently , Uwe Boll did n't realize that , although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie , people would see it . He just did n't realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad . And is that a Mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping ? I could n't tell . < br /><br />Which brings me to my next complaint : Uwe Boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you 'll ever see in a movie . I mean , I 'd give House of the Dead an F ( and I only do that for very few movies ) but HotD would score at least a B compared to this screwed up piece of junk . The movie starts off with a very , very long narration that causes immediate confusion ( and read by a horrible narrator ) and from there , the cuts are really , really dumb . There 's this one point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building that 's been destroyed and the screen blackens out . When it comes back , Slater and Reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly , an entire army has joined them . Huh ? < br /><br />And someone did NOT bother checking the mistakes in this movie . At one point , a team breaks through glass , but the glass breaks before they touch it . Tara Reid 's earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater walks away from a dead comrade , you can see her begin to get up . < br /><br />As for the story ... I was really lost . Something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone " opens the path " or something and all the evil monsters pop out . It 's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes ( the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film ) that get , quite simply , BORING . < br /><br />I bought this movie hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was . I did n't laugh , but I still think it 's stupid . Very , very , very stupid .
0 First off I 'd like to say that if I had to honestly rate this movie from a 1 to a 10 , then I 'd give it a -4 . It 's not that I 'm a tough critic , it 's just that this movie is THAT bad . Everything from the story , to the directing , to the editing is awful . The story is not even halfway decent to begin with ( you ca n't expect much since it is based on a video game , something I was not aware of going into the movie ) but the directing and editing made it even worse . The movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones ; some , like a quick sex scene in the middle , do n't even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters do n't show any feelings toward each other . You could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you 'd still be disappointed . Honestly , if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money , and if you do n't pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life . So do yourself a favor and do n't watch it .
0 In 1967 , mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named Abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness . When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago , something evil slipped through before the gate was closed . Twenty - two years ago , the Government Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens ( Matthew Walker ) , who performed experiments with orphan children . On the present days , one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby ( Christian Slater ) , who has just gotten an Abkani artifact in South America , and is chased by a man with abilities . When an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night , he discloses that demons are coming back to Earth . With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac ( Tara Reid ) and the leader of the Bureau 713 , Cmdr . Richard Burke ( Stephen Dorff ) , and his squad , they battle against the evil creatures.<br /><br />In spite of having a charismatic good cast , leaded by Christian Slater , Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff , " Alone in the Dark " never works and is a complete mess , without development of characters or plot . The reason may be explained by the " brilliant " interview of director Uwe Boll in the Extras of the DVD , where he says that " videogames are the bestsellers of the younger generations that are not driven by books anymore " . Further , his target audience would be people aged between twelve and twenty - five years old . Sorry , but I find both assertions disrespectful with the younger generations . I have a daughter and a son , and I know many of their friends and they are not that type of stupid stereotype the director says . Further , IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Boll is absolutely wrong . My vote is three.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Alone in the Dark  O Despertar do Mal " ( " Alone in the Dark  The Awakening of the Evil " )
0 It should come as no shock to you when I say that Alone in the Dark is a crappy movie . To put it bluntly , it 's as if a dung monster defecated , ate the result , and then vomited . The final product would still outshine this movie.<br /><br />Seemingly based on an ancient ( ! ) Atari video game , the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth , the unleashing of demons , and ancient civilizations . Something about there being two worlds , that of darkness and that of light . ( Guess which one 's ours . ) Oh , and 10,000 years ago a really super - duper advanced civilization opened the portal , demons came over and had a blast , then wiped out the civilization . Which is why we 've never heard of them , conveniently enough.<br /><br />Christian Slater , perhaps pining for the days of Heathers and Pump up the Volume , plays Edward Carnby , a paranormal researcher to whom Something Bad happened when he was 10 years old . He 's hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization . Carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713 , which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long - ago civilization . But Carnby believed he was n't going to be able to find the answers he sought , so he left the group.<br /><br />But see , these beasties are out , and they get their prey in varying ways , such as gutting them , splitting them down the middle , implanting neurological control devices in them , or just turning them into killing zombies . Yes , it 's another zombie movie.<br /><br />That 's about as distilled I can make the plot . It 's pretty convoluted and incomprehensible . In similar movies , one might see the intrepid researcher / adventurer figure things out a step at a time , and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher , it 's a lot of fun . But when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context ... not so much fun.<br /><br />The acting is dreadful , save for Slater , who ( although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie ) showed he was capable of carrying the acting load . He had to ; get this - Tara Reid is cast as a museum curator ! Honest to goodness , I thought I 'd seen the casting of a lifetime when Denise Richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in Tomorrow Never Dies . But Reid here matches Richards , crappy emoting for crappy emoting . Hightlights include Reid pronouncing " Newfoundland " as " New Fownd Land , " Reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed , throaty monotone ( kinda like she 'd been on an all - night bender for the past week before filming ) , Reid - a museum curator , mind you - spending a lot of the movie in a midriff - bearing top and hip - hugger jeans . Oh yeah , she was as believable as Jessica Simpson giving stock quotes . Oh , why must the pretty ones be so dumb ? ( Note : I do n't think Tara Reid 's all that good looking . She looks like she 's in perpetual need of food . ) Almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable , except perhaps for Steven Dorff , who played Burke , one of the leaders of 713 . Dorff 's character was n't terribly well developed , but nothing in the movie was , from the sets to the characters to Tara Reid . But I digress.<br /><br />Anyway , the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace , but director Uwe Boll tosses in a pounding , mind - deadening soundtrack ; it 's so loud you ca n't hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes ! That ca n't be right . Given the acting level , however , perhaps thanks are in order to Mr. Boll.<br /><br />Oh , and a fun note . The opening moments of the movie include narration ... of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time . Remember the first Star Wars ? You heard that now - familiar Star Wars theme while the prologue crawled . There was surely no need for narration ; why do I need some doofus to read what 's on the screen for me ? Were the producers simply looking out for blind people ? Maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud - they were also looking out for hard - of - hearing people . Also , the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl - then lost it . Bizarre.<br /><br />Alone in the Dark is a loud , dopey mishmash of dreadful acting , an incoherent script , and ham - handed directing . Hardly a note rings true . There 's so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise . Even in the dark , the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison.<br /><br />Ironically , since there were only three other people in the theater , I watched this Alone in the Dark . I wonder if Uwe Boll planned it that way ? I ca n't quite give this the lowest rating , because I had low hopes for it to begin with - and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it . It 's atrocious , although Slater redeems himself a tiny bit .
0 I know I 'm in the minority , but ... <br /><br />Uwe Boll is about as talented as a frog . Not even a toad ; just a frog . He 's reminiscent of about a hundred other no - talent hacks who churn out one useless crap - fest after another . < br /><br />This movie ? Is a crap - fest . Slater 's talent is only minimally utilized leading one to believe he 's got other things ( like his failed relationship ) on his mind . Reid performs as if she has either forgotten her acting lessons , been severely hit on the head and MADE to forget her acting lessons , or has one of the worst directors in the history of film . I 'm voting on the third choice , myself , although the other two are always possible . < br /><br />Uwe Boll has never done a single thing from which I 've derived even the slightest pleasure . Frankly , I 'm satisfied that he made this stinker . I was concerned with Bloodrayne competing with " Underworld : Evolution " for ticket sales . Now , I 'm confident that Len Wiseman has nothing , and I mean NOTHING , to worry about.<br /><br />This rates a 1.0/10 rating for this messy , convoluted crap - fest , from ... <br /><br />the Fiend : .
0 Joyce Reynolds seems a might grown - up for the role of Janie , a boy - crazy sixteen - year old in small town America who ditches her steady guy for a visiting soldier AND winds up on the cover of Life magazine ( smooching at a blanket party ) all in the same week ! Non - stop barrage of wisecracks , put - downs , bull talk , and unfunny bits of business such as Janie 's little sister bribing family members , Hattie McDaniel ( as the maid ) constantly scuttling after sassy kid sis , Janie 's mother involved with the Red Cross , and Janie 's father trying to write an editorial on the problems with today 's teenagers ( as the parents , stuffy , sexless Edward Arnold and pert , chatty Ann Harding make an unlikely couple , even for 1944 ; he looks incapable of helping to conceive a child much less raising two of them ) . Nominated for an Academy Award ( ! ) for Owen Marks ' editing , Warner Bros. followed this in 1946 with " Janie Gets Married " . Reynolds must have outgrown her co - horts by then -- she was replaced by Joan Leslie . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 It is considered fashion to highlight every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance , however moronic this illogical ' logic ' may be . However within the story and theme of the film , there is no grey area and the woman who should be called the film 's antagonist , is the ' ' villain of the story '' . Under no circumstances can what she did be justified . Sexuality of women is just hype in this case and has nothing to do with the actuality . It is betrayal of the ultimate sort . The man ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful raising of another man 's offspring . To top it all , the most feeble of arguments raised by the 3 ' liberated ' female characters in the climax is pathetic . A woman 's sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse , there are no other children . So in essence his life has been wasted . In some societies where justice still prevails , such situations result in the execution of the unjust .
0 Bridges of madison county is a better made version of this story . I felt the ending of this movie was not handled sensitively as they did in the original English movie . This movie is very indianised , if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a movie when hero dies in the end you 'll love this movie , On the other hand if you are a fighter in life and think crying is for wimps you may not like the ending . But on the whole it 's pretty good subject is well handled for indian conditions . Tabu was good as a caring wife and mother . Everybody acted well .
0 In a movie that follows a struggling actor , played , evidently , by a struggling actor , this does no favours for Chris Klein . He struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display , what could only be described as , a bland leading man . The story exists , but that is all , and fails to show any basic start , middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened.<br /><br />One bright light in the midst of this is Fred Durst , who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co - stars and does a semi - decent job of bringing the backward character of Legde to life . Whether Fred can re - create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but I'l be watching out for him in future .
0 Dumb is as dumb does , in this thoroughly uninteresting , supposed black comedy . Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile , eventually morphs into an uninspired version of " The Three Amigos " , only without any laughs . In order for black comedy to work , it must be outrageous , which " Play Dead " is not . In order for black comedy to work , it can not be mean spirited , which " Play Dead " is . What " Play Dead " really is , is a town full of nut jobs . Fred Dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton 's character from " A Simple Plan " , while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of , well , Jake Busey . - MERK
0 It 's been a long time since I last saw a movie this bad .. The acting is very average , the story is horribly boring , and I 'm at a loss for words as to the execution . It was completely unoriginal . O , and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood 's a pregnant Schwarzenegger ! < br /><br />One of the first scenes ( the one with the television show - where the hell are you ? ) got it right - the cast was 80 % of let 's face it - forgotten actors . If they were hoping for a career relaunch , then I think it might never happen with this on their CV ! The script had the potential , but neither 80 % of the actors nor the director ( who 's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor ) pulled it off . Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.<br /><br />I'm sorry , but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic , because not only it 's a total loss of time , but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like .
0 Once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent . Reuniting with some former co - stars to clean up the town.<br /><br />Low key , often to the point of blandness , " action " comedy mostly just does n't work . Part of the problem is the casting Chris Klien as a former action hero . he 's not bad , but he 's really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy . As I said he 's not bad , he 's just just miscast for what his back story is . The real problem here is the combination of the script , which really is n't funny and seems artificial at times , and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness . There is no life in the way things are set up . Its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list . It makes for an un - engaging film . And yet the film occasionally springs to life , such as the in the final show down that ends the film . That sequence works , but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power.<br /><br />I ca n't really recommend the film . Its worth a shot if you 're a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms , but otherwise this is just a disappointment .
0 Everybody just seems to be raving about the subject , and not really noticing how the movie was made . The deaf , mute guy is fine , the underdog wins - that 's good , the cricket aspect is great , but the movie is average overall . I think it could be made much much better than it is.<br /><br />The plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a real life event . I 'm sure the movie could have been made more interesting . The songs are just stuffed in there , and I had to literally forward the scenes where the same thing would be shown from different angles.<br /><br />Good acting , though . Watchable .
0 This is one of those movies that 's trying to be moody and tense , and instead , ends up tripping all over itself . Having seen it at a queer film festival , I was intrigued by the " young college threesome gone wrong " write - up , however , over - all ended up quite disappointed.<br /><br />It 's hard to critique a " true story " since there 's not much that can be done about the plot - but I found this disjointed , melodramatic and wholly depressing . It 's dark and almost sinister , painting a darn creepy flash of the seventies with imposing music and jerky close - ups . It just does n't work - some scenes where so cheesy that instead of hushed awe , my audience was supressing snickers and rolling eyes.<br /><br />The story has an interesting premise , but this just spins downward into a dark , miserable spiral .
0 I basically found Eden 's Curve to be a very poorly constructed that made it difficult to watch . However , there is something I must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70 's in the choice of settings and clothing . The " back to the earth " philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent , as portrayed in many later versions of the 70 's was right on , as was the " do n't ask do n't tell " pseudo - liberalism of the fraternity made up of east - coast intellectuals , except that I would have thought this was more likely of a New England school rather than one in Virginia , where I imagine the " good ole boy " mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one . Another thing I appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and I appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images . I felt it was very unfortunate that " gay culture " took on certain standard forms in the 80 's out of Castro and Christopher Streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles . I appreciated the film mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without " the scene . "
0 I saw this film at the NY Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and thought it was pretty bad . First and most distracting was the way much of it was shot ; that is , a lot of slow motion and overly arty close - ups that seemed to have no point -- story wise or aesthetically -- other than to show the skills of the cinematographer ( who I believe was also the director ) . This film seemed what a pretentious film student would come up with . The lead actor ( Sam Levine ) was certainly very cute , but was a mediocre actor at best ; and the rest of the cast ranged from so - so , to bad . The story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable . I do have to concede that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the film ; laughing and sighing constantly , but I disliked it a great deal .
0 I could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end . I can not comment on the story as I did not watch the whole film and the reason I could n't watch it was because of the ' actors ' . Firstly , for the most part they just looked stiff and I 'm sure their scripts were in their hands just out of frame - but that 's a minor issue . The main issue I have with the actors is n't really their fault ... it 's whoever cast this film ! Come on , this movie came out in 2003 ... I thought that casting people in their late twenties to play teenagers went out of fashion with new wave ? ! I can not watch a movie where one of the first lines , from a grown man older than myself , is " I 'm 17 ! " How can anyone take that seriously ? ? ? ? ? Do n't fall victim to this movie , go out for a walk for 90 minutes and you 'll get far more than this movie could ever give .
0 This could have been a very good film , if I had been able to watch it . The hand held camera was very bouncy . From the opening credits I was worried . Several of us watching it felt very nauseous by the end . But we did stay until the end because it was such a charming and interesting film , giving some insight to the young pop culture in South Africa . The black and white film did enhance the artful feeling of it . The acting seemed very authentic . Some of the dialog was a little hard to understand , but a theater full of non - South Africans seemed to find most of it funny . If you get motion sickness at all though , you may seriously consider skipping this film . It 's quaint , but not worth the nausea .
0 I so wanted to believe in this movie after the only form of mainstream comedy this country recognises is slapstick and stereotypes.<br /><br />Of course , it went completely the other way - let 's be cool and edgy - and came out the other side with little to show for it . I bet One Small Seed went nuts for this . I know SL did.<br /><br />None of the main characters have the comedic chops to pull it off . Even Danny K had better timing . I 'm actually being serious . Every time they introduced a bit character I kept thinking , " Darn , this person should have been the lead!".<br /><br />Independent does n't mean that the camera work needs to be horrible . Black and white did nothing for this movie - actually with such flat dialogue it hurt this even more by bringing the boredom into sharp relief . The black and white also was n't crisp . The composition was horrible . The use of music was horrible . Strangely enough I watched Little Miss Sunshine after this movie and the composition on that was superb - maybe that 's why the deficiencies in this movie stick out in my mind.<br /><br />I think Corne ( who was funnier than the leads before he even said anything ) was speaking to this movie and not David - see it and you 'll understand . I bet the guys who organise Oppikoppi were dismayed . One would think nothing happens there at all . I got the feeling it could have been filmed in someone 's back garden . I know regular guys who have much funnier , raunchier and wittier conversations than any of these " comics " . The dude who they hooked up with end was OK though.<br /><br />Guess SA comedy 's gon na stay in the stone age a little longer . Nice work guys .
0 I totally agree with the review by a reviewer of Variety that the film is never quite as funny , lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to warrant . Narratively it is messy and the lighting is really problematic . If the film is supposed to be character - driven the poor lighting does n't enhance the acting and it is sometimes difficult to observe the facial expressions of the actors . Many non - South Africans will have difficulty in following the spoken English in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process . I watched the film at the Cape Town World Cinema festival last year . Comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the films about our painful past . Unfortunately Bunny Chow wo n't be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave , but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid history will indeed be rated among our best in our 110 year old film history . Not surprisingly the film disappeared from cinemas in Cape Town only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in Durban and Gauteng . It has clearly limited appeal among South African audiences .
0 This is the kind of movie which shows the paucity of French cinema when it comes to making thrillers . The director 's desire to " sound American " is so glaring that you will not be fooled a minute , unless you have not seen a serial killer movie since " Peeping Tom".<br /><br />Two male cops ( or one and a half , more like , as you will see),horrible murders , a plot more complicated than complex . Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre(see the astoundlingly dumb " l'inconnu de Strasbourg " a couple of years ago).The scenes with his pregnant wife -which are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot - are among the worst ever filmed . Add a steamy love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus to attract the huge adolescent audience . A violent and absurd conclusion , followed by a silent epilogue who could make a nice commercial for the côte d'azur , it 's really the silence of the lame .
0 It 's sort of hard for me to say it , because I so greatly enjoyed both " Targets " and " Paper Moon " , but I thought " The Last Picture show " was a somewhat fascinating but overly self - indulgent film . Its main positive , as far as I 'm concerned , is the stunning photography . But for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty ( and a kind of hidden beauty , at that ) . The characters were very hard to relate to or to care about . Basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting , but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story , complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama -- everything from the boy cheating with his teacher 's wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on . It was like " American Graffiti " without the joy of life.<br /><br />Some might say this film is more realistic -- nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess . But for me the film was simply oppressive , and I want to see it again about as badly as I 'd like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live in.<br /><br />Maybe this film really just belongs to its time -- perhaps if I 'd seen it in 1971 I would have been impressed by its novelty , just by seeing something different on the screen . But that would basically assume that I had never seen anything like , say , Godard 's " Breathless " . Maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the film 's weaknesses . But in the post - Tarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either.<br /><br />It is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth . We see 3 films as I recall in the picture show . First we see Vincente Minnelli 's " Father of the Bride " -- Liz Taylor 's exquisite looks provide a contrast to Sonny 's girlfriend and Minnelli 's studied upper - middle class milieu contrasts to the character 's " real life " surroundings in a similar way . Later , clips from Howard Hawks ' " Red River " emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a protégé . It really just reminds me that Bogdanovich is kissing his own mentor 's butt , much as he did if I remember correctly by selecting a Hawks film as part of his own on - screen reverie with Boris Karloff in " Targets " . I guess in 1971 this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems self - indulgent , like so much of the rest of this film.<br /><br />Ultimately , I 'd rather see another film by Hawks , Ford or Minnelli than to have Bogdanovich 's film remind us of why they were so striking in such a less - than - subtle way . Maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed -- all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation .
0 Many people see this as a classic , but I obviously must have missed something . Life in Anarene , Texas in the early 50 's is pretty dull - which means that a movie about life in Anarene , Texas in the early 50 's will be pretty dull too ! What is it that so many people see in this ? Once the last picture show in Anarene closes there really wo n't be anything to do in town . Duane ( Jeff Bridges ) makes that point at the end of the movie . But even before it closes there is n't much to do , so basically everything revolves around sex . High school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town . You see , there 's not much for them to do either - except to have sex ( sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers ) or to whine about the local high school football team . Three times something happened that I thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie . Sam ( Ben Johnson ) dies unexpectedly , but nothing really happens because of that , Sonny ( Timothy Bottoms ) and Jacy ( Cybill Shepherd ) elope , but nothing really happens because of that , Joe Bob ( Barc Doyle ) kidnaps a little girl , but nothing really happens because of that . The only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of Billy ( Sam Bottoms ) which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town , as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfast.<br /><br />Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white , which is intended I suppose to point out how grey this town is , but the only thing I found interesting was the early look at actors like Bottoms , Shepherd , Bridges and Randy Quaid . ( As an aside it was terrifying to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - actually looks like his character of Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation movies . ) Classic ? I do n't think so ! 3/10
0 I 'm not going to comb over TLPS 's obvious peterbogdanovichian flaws . Instead , I shall take a look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygmy of a film.<br /><br />1 . Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be endured in its entirety . This fact alone places the movie high up above and all the way up to the top of his lame filmography.<br /><br />2 . Bogdanovich had shown how amazingly generous some lucky boyfriends can be , by sharing Cybill Shepherd 's ( his then - gal ) fabulous body and breasts with his male audience - and not just on one but on two occasions . Brava ! The unquestionable highlights of this cinematic festa del siesta.<br /><br />3 . TLPS has barely a scene without stereotypical country music doodling in the background . ( Peter tried to make the obvious point that the movie is set in America 's Deep South ( as if it were n't bleedin ' obvious ) so he hammered that point on and on and on ... ) How is this an advantage , you might ask ? Well , when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country music finally ceases massaging your tired ear - drums , you start experiencing a strange exhilaration : " The movie 's finally over ! " It 's pure joy.<br /><br />4 . The movie gives all women who look like Cloris Leachman hope . Hope that they , too , may one day snatch a much younger and maybe even good - looking boyfriend.<br /><br />5 . Cloris Leachman 's biography ( which I realize is n't technically a part of TLPS ) gives hope to all women that look like that , that they too may one day win a Miss Chicago beauty pageant . ( Provided they have enough money to bribe the jury with.)<br /><br />(You think I 'm joking abut Cloris having won a beauty pageant , huh ? Well , check out her bio and then we 'll see who laughs last ... ) < br /><br />6 . The movie was shot in black and white which spared us the sight of Cloris Leachman 's face in its original , natural non - glory .
0 A boring movie about a boring town in the 50 's . How can anyone think this is a classic ? The producer pretty much ended his career by pushing his girlfriend , Cybil Shepard , into several movies that were way above her acting ability . I think this movie gives an insight to how bad Peter Bogdonovitch 's future movies were going to be . Cybil Shepard 's career took a dive after being in several movies that Peter Bogdonovich produced . It was n't until " Moonlighting " that her career started to come back . I thought the acting was poor rendition of the , " Graduate " . I have noticed that this movie has n't been shown in the US . The only place I have watched it was overseas in Europe late at night .
0 I gave this movie a very fair chance , and it betrayed me . This is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the hell out of the audience even as the egotist Bogdanavich ( who did way better with TARGETS ) gets " great performances " out of a ton of hams in their debuts . Lots of teenage sex clichés come out of this movie , such as Doing the Teacher 's Wife , Impotence , Doing the Ugly Prostitute(which is very awkwardly shot and grinds things to a complete halt , not that things were really going anywhere anyway ) and skinny dipping.<br /><br />I suppose this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the sex nonsense , to me , it was just annoying . I was seriously much more entertained by cleaning my finger nails than watching this mess .
0 Black and White film . Good photography . Believable characters . < br /><br />Just awful.<br /><br />I have wasted another perfect evening watching a film that other rated as " worthy " and " very good . " There is some good acting here and the back ground setting for the plot is good ( more should have been done with this ) but it is very slow to grow and never develops . It is totally bases on sex without much romance with much un needed nudity . More could have been done with the main characters . If you are looking for something to watch with you family this in not the movie and if not you will have trouble sitting through it . Though this film is long its only about 1 inch deep !
0 For getting so many positive reviews , this movie really disappointed me ! It is slow moving and long . At times the story is not clear , particularly in the evolving relationships among characters . My advice ? Read the book , it 's a fabulous story which loses it 's impact on screen .
0 After hearing raves about this movie for years , I finally decided to rent it and watch . Let me start by saying that I 'm glad that the rental was free from the local library . This move was slow , boring , unrealistic and the plot made no sense . After 2 hours , I was ready to nuke that backwater Texas town and put the group of those characters out of their misery . I realize that taste is subjective , but believe me , I just do not understand all of the hype that I have heard about this movie . Dallas provided as good a detail of the life in Texas as this movie . Rent it only if you want to understand how movie studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that a bad movie is good .
0 This is your only spoiler warning . What a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional junk like this is considered " Oscar worthy".<br /><br />I divide material into three levels . The first is the stage theatre . Here the viewer is stagnant and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and , most importantly , in the power of the writer . A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better . The best playwrights know how to create imagery that the barren stage can not show.<br /><br />The second level is film . In this medium , a weaker writer can be used , but the viewer is not sitting in one spot the entire time . With film , the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing . Furthermore , film can manipulate everday elements like sound and color in ways that are almost surreal.<br /><br />The final level is literature . In this context , everything is imagined by the author , translated onto paper , and then re - imagined by the reader . Far more detail can go into a novel than is conceivable for a film studio.<br /><br />This is why adaptations can go up , but never down . Novelizations are never better than the base film ( see the dime - per - dozen ones at your local book store ) , whereas the film can not convey the same power as the original book ( Catch-22 and LotR ) . Movies can rarely be made into plays and plays can always be made into movies.<br /><br />As for ' The Last Picture Show ' , it fails . It is a film that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right . The characters talk the same and act the same , it 's pure futility . Add to that an obnoxious soundtrack and you have an entirely unwatchable film.<br /><br />I saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe thespians . The instructor raved about how sad the movie was . What is sad is how such stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious . Had this been in color the scenes of impotence , the pool party , and the old hooker would be considered great comedy . Look what Lucas did with ' American Graffiti ' a few years later.<br /><br />The American secondary education system needs to start teaching ABOUT film rather than trying to teach WITH film . Two visually powerful downbeat films : Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon . Rely on them , not this . It 's the ' Last ' I want to see of it . 1 out of 5 .
0 Florence Chadwick was actually the far more accomplished swimmer , of course . She swam the English Channel both directions . She swam from Catalina Island to the California coast . Marilyn Bell 's is a sweet story , but the usual glorification of us Canadians in the face of a superior world . Another sample of our inferiority complex . Our political system works pretty well and the health system allows people not to die in hospital lobbies . That 's pretty good . Better than Lebanon . What should we do about hockey though ... ? And curling . The notion of calling this a sport , of its inclusion in the Olympics ... ! ah , but we digress ...
0 This little show is obviously some stupid little prequel / spin off of the original series.<br /><br />Compared to the live action series this show is utter crap . The live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines . While the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest but i think maybe kids deteste this crap.<br /><br />The storyline in every episode is basically just Sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it . That s basiclly the idea every episode . The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina uses magic to become Gem and Gem to become Sabrina . So then Gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave . This then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were Gem says " just adore me for now " and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like she s a god . ( which is quite right since he 's her mind control slave ) But this stupid spin - off is not worth the time or the effort .
0 One can only assume that Robert Osborne is contractually obligated to express delight at even the least appealing films in the TCM library as this would explain him extolling the ' virtues ' of this " charming " film during his introduction when I saw this on cable TV . Seeing as any old film on IMDb receives ' classic ' status from a number of fawning amateur reviewers , I thought there was a dire need for a more honest review of this film.<br /><br />This is not your father 's ' Shop Around the Corner ' . For all my quibbles with ' You 've Got Mail ' , it still outshines this as a remake in just about every way imaginable . For those who have seen the original , the flaws will only be all the more obvious.<br /><br />From one of the lamest Meet Cute sequences I can recall seeing ( a sad slapstick attempt at ' humor ' ) , this film gets off on the wrong foot and it never really gets back in step . This ' musical ' only qualifies as one in the sparsest sense of the term . There are a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then there 's Judy singing " I Do n't Care " while flailing her arms around as if in a seizure . The Christmas song she sings in the store is probably one of her better numbers here . Miss Garland was wonderful in a number of musical films , but here she seems horribly miscast . The role was originally to have been filled by June Allyson and Judy is definitely unable to fill the shoes of Margaret Sullavan 's old part . Van Johnson also turns in a rather bland performance as a second rate Jimmy Stewart type . The leads never achieve the chemistry of Stewart / Sullavan or even that of Hanks / Ryan.<br /><br />This is a film that knows ( some of ) the notes , but not the music . It does n't really seem to understand why the original worked and even feels the need to add another possible love interest for Van Johnson 's character to complicate things unnecessarily . The remake 's substitution for the original 's infidelity subplot is a hackneyed plot device involving a priceless violin . It is almost embarrassing to watch and feels as if it had perhaps been lifted from an episode of Three 's Company by someone with a DeLorean and a flux capacitor . It 's really just an excuse for a Keaton pratfall . Even the big resolution scene between the romantic leads is mishandled . After seeing both films , you 'll understand why they called it ' the Lubitsch Touch ' and NOT the ' Robert Z. Leonard Touch'.<br /><br />Avoid this and rewatch either the original film or one of Judy Garland 's earlier films unless you 're an iconoclast who enjoys seeing a once great star falling down to earth .
0 As has been noted , this formula has been filmed several times , most recently as " You 've Got Mail " , with Tom Hanks and Meg"Trout Pout " Ryan . Of the several versions , this is my least favorite . The problem i think is that the studio coasted on the Stars charisma , which does n't quite cut it here.<br /><br />The chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie . There are no real sparks . Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of day old donuts , pleasant but bland . And when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow . Judy in particular is disappointing . She looks like she has no neck ! I do n't know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it 's head into it 's shell , all hunched up and everything . I could n't figure out what Van Johnson was getting so hot about . I would have made a bee line for that cute violin player . And Van was n't great either . I 've always thought of him as a rather generic Hollywood leading man and he does n't do anything to dispel that image here.<br /><br />If you 're a fan of the stars or the early 1900 's then you might like this movie . But there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there , and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confection .
0 I rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my Horror this movie was the worst movie I had ever seen ! I read the comment from Gumby-8 and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew . Unless Gumby-8 is a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all.<br /><br />I could n't believe Gumby-8 's comments . < br /><br />Quoting : " From the " Dune " inspired opening animation to the quick pace ... this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpected." < br /><br />The Animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving , well that 's because you keep looking for any type of suspense . I mean give me a break Halloween was shot with a budget of $ 100,000.00 and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic . As far as " repeat viewing is not unexpected " I think he made a typo.<br /><br />Another quote from Gumby-8 the only Fan : " The acting is also a strong aspect of the film." < br /><br />With all due respect for the actors , their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of Robert Napton.<br /><br />The catchy Tagline : " Beware the hour between dusk and darkness" < br /><br />That 's because there is no dusk or darkness in this movie.<br /><br />MPAA rating " Rated R for some violence / gore" < br /><br />The only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see . As far as I know it might be a clump of grass.<br /><br />In summation , I have seen horror flicks from the 50 's , 60 's and 70 's . I have seen what I thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good . The director of this film either did not make any attempt , was asleep , or took a hit of acid . Whatever the case I think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction . I would give this film a rating of .5 for a ' B ' movie .
0 As a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fan , I can withstand ANY motion picture that can be foisted upon me , but there is absolutely no reason for this.<br /><br />Rated " Super Action " in the Blockbuster Video section and given the dreaded " Restricted Viewing Sticker " I 'm assuming these are the only methods that film maker ( HA ! ) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4.50 from one unsuspecting person.<br /><br />Shame on you Robert Napton ! Shame on you for exploiting these poor Mexican actors who you probably promised hopes for making it big in American cinema . You are a disgrace!<br /><br />There is n't one moment in this movie that holds the slightest bit of action . Did you use snot on these people ? Oh , look , they 're having a rave in a field ! Like all 6 of them . And is n't that an Asian guy in the background ? Why is it always daytime ? Why did it take 1/2 of the movie to show anything .. and more importantly why did we watch the other 1/2?<br /><br />PS : You owe me 4.50 .
0 This is n't cinema . It is n't talent . It is n't informative . It is n't scary . It is n't entertaining . It is n't anything at all.<br /><br />I got this because my cousin says , " Diablo ! COOL ! " Yeah , right . The only thing cool about this experience was the lone fact that I did n't buy it but rented it instead.<br /><br />It 's shot like a bad soap opera . No wait . Soap operas at least LOOK professional ... sorta . This ? This looks like it was shot with someone 's camcorder . It 's horrid ! Wretched ! It sux.<br /><br />The cinematography is detestable ! WHO IS this director anyway ? I do n't even care enough to look him up . He STINKS ! The performances by these poor unsuspecting actors were far better than this crap - fest deserved.<br /><br />2.6/10 on the " B " scale . < br /><br />That registers about a 0.3/10 on the " A " scale from ... <br /><br />the Fiend : .
0 It is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen , but Hostel is definitely much more worse . This movie is more funny and ridiculous , than scary . I laughed most of the time when watched it . Low quality effects ( when you gon na watch it , you 'll understand what i 'm talking about and HOW LOW quality is that ) , bad actors ( i hear of them for the first time ) , and it seems like it 's shot by an amateur camcorder ( so it looks more like a TV show , than a movie ) . But at least i 've had the patience to watch it till the end . Like comedies ? Watch it . Wanna horror ? Go watch Ju - On : The Grudge or some other good horror movie.<br /><br />If i 'm talking about the Legend of Diablo , i do n't even know if i can classify it to a Horror genre . Just some low - budget crap.<br /><br />I rate it 3 out of 10
0 The good news is a movie was made , drawing on a supposed Aztec myth and featuring an unusually Aztec - American ( is such a word exists ) cast . The bad news is , it was dead at birth.<br /><br />If Ed Wood had come out of retirement and coached George Romaro through his classic ' Night of the Living Dead , ' this is what we might have come up with . ' The Legend of Diablo ' is clearly fodder for any future resurrections of ' Mystery Science Theatre 3000!'<br /><br />I do n't think one can even call this a ' B ' movie . The production values are so abysmal that I kept getting the feeling I was watching either a lengthy skit from a variety show or a backyard 8-mm film shot by a group of school kids . < br /><br />SOME SPOILERS < br /><br />The basic plot line sounded interesting enough to lure me into renting it . A rural California sheriff finds a box containing an Aztec demon and accidentally unleashes it on the unsuspecting community . His daughters , one hot and one homely , team with a gringo FBI man and a priest , to try to re - cage the demon . < br /><br />Meanwhile , every zombie scene one has ever seen in previous undead movies is re - enacted - poorly . These zombies walk more like an army of Nutty Professors than the undead ! The supposed infrared scenes from the demon 's viewpoint are nothing special   and he / she / it sure seems to back up a lot ( as opposed to turning around the moving forward ) . And the scene where the priest lures the demon out of the cave in fast - motion is ludicrous ! It really , really appears to be done for comic effect - although I know it was n't ! I kept expecting the Benny Hill theme music to start playing & for the whole gang of zombies to start chasing the priest all over the beach!<br /><br />Of course the Darth Vader / Field of Dreams voice , calling the FBI agent becomes downright comical . Then again , so was most of this cheese ball ! Robert Napton , director and writer of the screenplay , should win SOMEthing for this effort ! ( How about a lifetime blackballing , like the ' Hollywood 10 ? ' ) This one , I now see , is rated 1.5 on a 10-scale . I fear this might be a tad generous ! < br /><br />Is there anything good about this movie ? Well , Lindsey Lofaso looks pretty hot as the younger daughter of the dead sheriff . This is probably why her homely older sister ( Calvi Pabon ) really ran away from home ! Fred Estrado is reasonably decent as the FBI agent . I wonder if Mario Soto , who played Father Rodriguez , is the same Mario Soto who pitched for the Cincinnati Reds ? If so , he should have stuck to baseball . In fact , they could n't have done any worse if they had gone with a baseball theme and called it ' Demons in the Outfield!'<br /><br />If I find out this was actually a project for a community college cinema class , I will issue apologies . It might be good enough for a B or even B+ as long as the gang got the college 's camcorder back to campus in one piece ! ' The Blair Witch Project ' proved that a cool , campy movie could be made on a shoestring . ' The Legend of Diablo , ' though , did n't appear to have a shoestring OR shoes to work from ! It was low - budget , low - talent , low - everything . The very final scene - and I mean about the final 10 seconds of the film - is the ONLY mildly creative or interesting moment.<br /><br />I paid $ 3.45 to rent this . I could have better spent it on a hamburger !
0 me , my boyfriend , and our friend watched this " movie " if that s what u wanna call it , and we agree with the last person , but we were stupid and bought the damn thing , we thought it really was about diablo so we bought it.<br /><br />we hate it Really SUXZ ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! so beware : DO NOT BUY THIS THING THEY CALL A MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />we would return it , but do n't no if anybody would want this stupid movie.<br /><br />oh and another thing , the should n't call it " The Legend of Diablo " they should of called it " Legend of Azar".<br /><br />and this movie is rated R ? ? ? ? ? this should not of even been not rated.<br /><br />we think that diablo would be crying his eyes out laughing at this stupid movie.<br /><br />this is a movie that would have been done by a Church.<br /><br />theses " actors " are never gon na become nothing because this movie .
0 This may be one of the worst movies to ever make it to production , ever.<br /><br />1 . The most exciting part is the beginning , where the guy is walking ... and walking ... and walking ( spoiler ) . There is about 15 minutes of just walking . How ? < br /><br />2 . Not to mention there 's a lot of issues with the lighting , and it 's almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day . < br /><br />3 . The acting was TERRIBLE . It looks like they found a community theater ( in Mexico ) ... and then took the people who were turned away.<br /><br />Please , for the love of everything holy , do n't rent this movie . If you know someone who owns it , apologize to them . The director should be subject to punishment through the war crimes tribunal for foisting this on the public .
0 The small California town of Diablo is plagued with mysterious deaths after sheriff Robert Lopez unearths an ancient box . Legend has it that the box holds the sixteenth - century Mexican demon named Azar . FBI agent Gil Vega is sent to investigate the murders and joins forces with the sheriff 's daughters , Dominique and Mary to fight with evil and bloodthirsty demon."The Legend of Diablo " is an absolute garbage . The film lacks scares and gore , the acting is amateurish and the direction is bad . The animation is the only one aspect of the film I enjoyed . I'm a big fan of indie horror flicks , for example I loved " Torched","Live Feed","Bone Sickness " or " Neighborhood Watch",unfortunately " The Legend of Diablo " is a huge misfire . Definitely one to avoid .
0 I can not get past the message of this movie . It 's laid out much too clearly to ignore , and it is obscene because it has lost its sense of what it 's about . I have n't read the novel , but Pollack 's film opens with a scene at a CIA - front organization in New York , which is broken into by two professional assassins , headed by Max von Sydow , who proceed to brutally slaughter the half dozen quirky staff members we 've come to know and understand . The staff include an elderly female receptionist , a fussy elderly professorial guy who 's toupee falls off when he is machine - gunned ( is that a joke ? ) , and , last , the beautiful Tina Chen who looks up from the copier , realizes she is about to be murdered , and says , pitifully brave , " I wo n't scream . " Von Sydow replies sympathetically , " I know . " These murders are completely unexpected , savage , unmotivated by anything that we are aware of , and graphic . It is a brutal scene . < br /><br />There is absolutely no way in which von Sydow and his henchman can be redeemed . And yet that is exactly what Pollack tries to do towards the end.<br /><br />After having killed these innocent good guys , von Sydow switches sides ( because the other side is willing to pay him ) and assassinates the evil mastermind behind a complicated intramural CIA plot . The script then turns him into a perfectly reasonable , sensitive human being . " It is better to live in Europe . Things are not so rushed . " Or whatever . I swear I 'm not making this up . Pollack wants us to believe that it is better to be an honest mass murderer than a crooked bureaucrat . That 's the message . You should write it down in case you forget . Just exactly what kind of psychiatric shambles do you have to be in order to turn ordinary values , not to mention common sense , upside - down like that ? I understand that there are thoughtful adults who dislike the government of the United States , even hate it , and who see conspiracies just about everywhere , providing a knee - jerk explanation for otherwise unexplainable events . I know that people who think this way exist because I number some of them among my closer friends . Nevertheless , at some point this dislike , this hatred , if it increases in intensity , must pass beyond politics or ethics and into the realm of the psychiatric . I do n't for a moment believe that a man who murders people for money is better than a sinister government official . I do n't care how suave and cultured the murderer is or whether he knows how to reach the Louvre on the Metro . Whoever is purveying that message needs either medication or meditation.<br /><br />I'd like to be able to argue that the production is as thoroughly rotten as its message , but I ca n't . It 's quite well done . ( In some ways that 's worse , because it makes the film less dismissable . ) Even New York City looks photogenic on the screen . And it 's been a long time since I 've thought of New York as photogenic . Robert Redford does an admirable job of projecting his character 's initial shock and confusion , but then turns into a telecommunicational semi - genius . And , man , he looks just fine ! His wardrobe is just right . Even his rimless glasses are becoming . And his peacoat . It 's not everyone who can make a navy pea jacket look glamorous . He seems extremely handsome too , the swine . I want to look like that . I want to wear a denim shirt and a tie with such panache . Faye Dunaway is alright in her role but it 's not too believable a role . Would anybody eagerly sleep with a guy who has just kidnapped her and is holding her at gunpoint ? Even if he did look like Redford ? Would anyone be emotionally wounded if , when this ambivalent relationship is about to end , Redford asked her not to tell anybody about what happened ? Cliff Robertson is surprisingly good . He does one or two extremely good double - takes . The mailman is superb . The fight between him and Redford in a crowded apartment is exquisitely choreographed and , for once , we really do n't know for sure how it will turn out , because Redford ( a book reader after all ) seems mismatched against the brute cunning of this hired assassin . This is one of John Housemann 's final roles . A shame . He 's a magnet on screen . And what an end to his life : a friend finds him lost , wandering the streets of New York , in a neighborhood he 'd been familiar with for most of his life . < br /><br />Yes , the movie is very well executed , but I ca n't ignore that vicious , paranoid message . I have the same problem with Leni Riefenstahl 's " Triumph of the Will . " Or her Olympic documentary in which the announcer is watching a foot race in which Jesse Owens is pulling into the lead and says ominously , " This Negro is dangerous . "
0 1st watched 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10(Dir - Sydney Pollack):-DVD version I watched titled " 3 Days of the Condor"- So so CIA drama full of laid - back performances making for a very laid - back movie . The premise of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 members of a CIA research group being killed with Robert Redford 's character , codename = Condor , being the one that was left . Who killed them and why ? That 's what Redford tries to find out while trying to not be the 8th victim at the same time . Along the way , he gets Faye Dunaway 's character involved involved , originally because he needs a place to hide , and then she eventually helps him out after a little lovey - dovey time . This is one of a handful of innocent guy on the run stories but this one does n't have a lot of suspense . The flat performances do n't help and the finish does n't seal the deal for the audience enough either . Despite having a good director in Sydney Pollack and a group of classic performers , the story and the performances are not what they should be and therefore the movie is not what it should be .
0 Generally I do n't like films directed by Sydney Pollack ( " The Firm " being somewhat of an exception ) and I 've never been a Robert Redford fan either . Still , I thought " Three Days of the Condor " must be good because of the number of praising comments it has received.<br /><br />Although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and Max von Sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer , I found the whole affair tremendously disappointing . The film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere , but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which does n't seem to make any sense.<br /><br />The film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings I have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air . And what can one say about that absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway ? I 'd much rather watch any of Hitchcock 's films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more .
0 Being a big fan of Corman 's horror movies I expected from his western a bit more than I got . Well , I was entertained all right . I had almost as many laughs as watching Mel Brooks ' Blazing Saddles.<br /><br />See the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the prairie of the old west . You can kill time by counting them if there happens to be an otherwise boring scene going on . And the horses seem to have gears in them too , considered the fast - forward chases . See also the swinging bar room queens of the traditional wild west saloon doing a number that reminds of a certain fashionable dance from 1920 's , here decades before the style was invented . Hope the saloon around them wo n't crumple.<br /><br />In the middle of all this mayhem the main actors do a decent job . Ireland , Garland and Hayes are all truly fine . A special praise for them for doing the best they could with the material that seems mostly having been lifted from ' Johnny Guitar ' , but does n't quite impress the same way . But there is really nothing wrong with a laughable western like this . Just like a really bad old horror movie , it might fail one way but succeeds to give joy anyway . That is one of the reasons Corman 's work appeals to me and that is why I dare to recommend you to experience this movie if you get the chance .
0 I 'll admit that I do n't expect much from a Roger Corman film . Generally , I expect a lot of walking and bad scripts . Yet in this case , I am pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The Gunslinger is a story of a woman ( played by the spunky Beverly Garland ) who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered . Ms. Garland is a pretty good shot herself , killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband 's funeral . Her first task is to shut down the local bar that is violating the town curfew . The bar 's owner is trying to buy land in anticipation of being bought out by the ( hoped - for ) railroad . However , Ms. Garland is a thorn in her plans , and the bar matron hires a man to kill Ms. Garland.<br /><br />Because of Ms. Garland 's plays her role honestly and realistically , there is absolutely no temptation to go to Suzanne Somers " She 's the Sheriff " jokes . With the exception of a couple of faux pas ( the apartment door that opens OUT from the inside , jeep tracks , and the two horsemen waiting on screen for their cue to ride around a corner ) , the movie becomes quite passable as movie fare . However , Corman could not resist padding his film with horse riding scenes , much like he does walking in other films.<br /><br />Sterno says The Gunslinger is a horse opera worth your time .
0 - When the local sheriff is killed , his wife takes over until and is determined to clean - up the town . Not everyone in town , however , is happy with what she 's doing . When the sheriff orders a curfew in town , the local saloon owner ( also a woman ) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff . There 's no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love.<br /><br />- Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution . There 's a good movie here somewhere trying to get out . In more capable hands or with a larger budget , Gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the Old West . As it is , Gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie.<br /><br />- There are just so many things wrong with the movie : a supporting cast with no acting ability , stilted and unnatural dialogue , and sets that look like sets . But the biggest offender is the editing . I was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors ( and horses for that matter ) obviously waiting for Corman to yell " Action " . The best is the scene of two riders on horseback just standing beside a building . All of a sudden , they take off and come racing around the corner like they had been riding hard for several miles . Or , take the example of people who can seemingly transport themselves across town . We see a man enter a building and a second later emerge across town to mount his horse.<br /><br />- It 's not as if Corman did n't have a few decent actors to work with . While none were great stars , Beverly Garland , John Ireland , and Allison Hayes were all capable of turning in a good performance . But , in Gunslinger , they 're not given much to work with.<br /><br />- I have now seen both the MST3 K and non - MST3 K versions of the movie . I would strongly recommend going the MST3 K route .
0 Beverly garland was born in the wrong time . She was an actress ahead of her time , bringing power and grace to even such lame flicks as the Corman films she starred in . In Gunslinger , she 's the town sheriff 's wife . He gets offed , so she takes over his job to pursue his killers . She 's better than the material she 's working with , by far . The movie is gray , stilted , and mostly boring . There 's some(unintentional)humor with the tire tracks everywhere , people running behind one building to emerge suddenly in front of another ( I 've heard of false fronts , but this is ridiculous ! ) , and the truly stupid plot line of the newly widowed sheriff falling in love with the guy hired to kill her . Even if she had n't loved her husband , it had only been something like a week or two since he 'd died ! And she ends up shooting the guy to death in the end , anyway . No luck with men , this one.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is another woman , the saloon owner . She 's scheming to buy up a bunch of land just in case the railroad goes through and makes her rich . Her plan of action if it does n't is pretty lame - she'll just steal as much from the town as she can and skedaddle . Hell , it 's just her and her hired gun at the end against an entire town . Are you telling me these people are n't armed ? Look what happened in real towns of the Old West when bank robbers came in to rob the bank , then were cut down in a hail of bullets by the armed and dangerous town folk.<br /><br />There'a a lot of pointless talking and riding around , interspersed with a few lame shoot outs . The ending is as grim as usual in a Corman flick , although thank goodness it lacks the moral proselytizing at the end that was in It Conquered the World . The sheriff turns over her badge to Sam Bass and rides off into the sunset , although the movie was so gray that you never saw the sun .
0 I guess that " Gunslinger " was n't quite as god - awful as most of the movies that " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " shows , but westerns just are n't Roger Corman 's forte . Portraying Rose Hood ( Beverly Garland ) becoming sheriff in an Old West town after her sheriff husband gets murdered and having to fight off baddies , the movie is pretty predictable . John Ireland is Rose 's new hubby , secretly working for unctuous Allison Hayes ( yes , the 50-foot woman ) . Also appearing briefly is frequent Corman co - star Dick Miller as a mailman ( Miller nowadays stars in Joe Dante 's movies).<br /><br />I do wish to assert that you 'll probably want to watch the " MST3 K " version to really enjoy this movie . They had a great time with it .
0 Sure it takes place in the west , but the title makes it seem like it is a conventional western . Instead , it is a movie of a woman sheriff . Make no mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff . She becomes sheriff when her husband is gunned down ; she is only a tad bit upset by this . Her main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman , but the villain hires a guy to kill her . So this is what happens , the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa . Utterly stupid , as anyone killed in this movie has the new sheriff to thank . She had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars , but I guess because she liked him she would n't do it . The killer is also after the mayor of the town for personal reasons that are also rather dumb . This movie is very boring and not really worth watching ... it is not one of the better episodes of MST3000 they made . I can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because that would make it that much more painful . Corman is a low budget director , but even he should know better than to have people go into one place and coming out another .
0 I 'll be blunt . I 'm not one for politically correct movies where the woman plays the bad ass who 's not going to take any crap from anyone . If any one of the cast members wanted to , they could have just taken her out in a heartbeat . It was entertaining on MST 3 K , but do n't rent the real version . Trust me . Have I ever lied to you ?
0 One of the other commenters mentioned that they almost walked out . If I had n't been with my wife , who wanted to stay , I would have left . It 's a shame , too , because I think it could have been a good movie . But this is easily one of the worst adapted screenplays I 've ever seen . It starts out nowhere and it goes nowhere ( I would say it goes nowhere fast , but it really goes nowhere slow ... painfully slow ) . From time to time there are hints that something interesting might happen , or that there is potentially some depth underneath one of the characters , but that 's all we get - hints . There is not a single payoff or revelation in the entire movie . Not that I need a slick plot to be entertained ... I love a good meandering character study as much as the next indie buff . But these characters add up to nothing . For the entire duration of the film you do n't care what happens to a single one of them . As a matter of fact , you almost start hoping they die , because at least a death might be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior , which is so strange and unpredictable that you 'd think it in itself would be compelling , but it 's not . Instead of quirky , noir - esquire characters acting in hard - boiled fashion , you simply recognize it immediately for what it is : a bunch of talented but miscast actors , brooding and raising their eyebrows while reading bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context . All this for two plodding , painfully slow hours . Awful .
0 This is a movie that demonstrates that mood and music and texture are n't enough to make a good film . Sure , the viewer is treated to numerous fine scenes of Los Angeles in the thirties -- I especially liked the view of the trolley approaching the tunnel , and the tram rising up the hillside -- but in a sense this fine cinematography is self - defeating , because it creates a mood that " something 's going to happen "-- and nothing does . The script too keeps feinting toward some plot or action or trauma -- and time after time not delivering . Not even delivering the ( I assume ) theme of the movie , the characters ' essential misfit . The lead actors , both too pretty for their roles , did n't convey any repression or agony , and the script did n't expose us to any.<br /><br />Now , Donald Sutherland ? That 's another story . His character was so well fashioned , so perfectly played , that I wanted the camera to follow him .
0 This movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in Ask the Dust . Colin Farrell is usually a fine actor but in this he is juvenile . Donald Sutherland comes across as an amateur . Why ? Because the script is awful , the adaptation is awful and the actors seem bored and half hearted . The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I could only think when it would finish and I turned it off half way . The director has done a very poor job and even though I have not read the novel it is certainly a missed chance . The atmosphere this film is trying to evoke and the message and storyline never reaches the audience . In one word , it is a TERRIBLE film .
0 A friend told me of John Fante last summer after we got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski . I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski 's - an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier . ' Ask the Dust ' was the first Fante book I read , and it remains one of my favorite novels . The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad , frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident , masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of . In the novel the protagonist is a virgin , with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines . The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla , how he settles for his first sexual experience with a ' wounded ' admirer , and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real , with no touching Hollywood ending . The film adaptation stays true to the book for a while , but meanders into the cinematic trap of love persevering through racism , sickness and death . The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is f - ing crazy , and their love never was and never would be the real thing , no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other . This movie tore out the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with schlock . I ca n't believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so wrong .
0 It must have been excruciating to attend the dailies as the shooting continued on this failure of a film . Probably Cruise , the Exec . Prod . , saw what was happening and had Towne use much , much more of the nude footage in the final cut then Towne wanted to , to make up for the disaster he saw looming.(Maybe Cruise even thought of " Titanic".)A few items : Colin Farrell ca n't act his way out of a paper bag . But he 's one of the flavors - of - the - decade , a producer 's darling and one is forced to avoid the embarrassment of watching him by not attending his films . He has so many moments of not believing in what he 's doing and you can see it in his eyes . I think he would have been at his best as a film actor , albeit not as rich or famous as he is now , playing second banana to dynamic leads who can act . The trap of spending a lot of money for period sets , costumes , cars , et al and photographing them as if they just came from the dry cleaner or car wash / wax . No one seems to want anything to look , well , worn . Or dirty . Is this because the production designer was told by the line producer to make sure they did n't ruin the stuff because then the company wouldhave to pay for the ruined items?<br /><br />This was a story about the depression - thirties folks , not a Disney Broadway musical about that era . How about doing it in black and white or better yet , given Caleb Deschanel as your D.P. , have him desaturate the colors during the mix to suggest some of the actual grime and poorness of the times . It should have been , after all , a bit depressing to live so desperately as these folks did , in the Depression . More on Farrell . Did anyone for a moment believe this guy was a writer ? H.L. Mencken on the wall ; did I see his eyes roll at one point ? Hayek and Farrell as a sexually dynamic duo ? Sending a boy to do a man 's work ? Perhaps in the book , which I have n't read , the story was about an older woman and a youth . I can not delve too deeply into the middle to latter parts of the film because I bailed out early on . But the memory of the scenes I did see made me think that someone was doing a not - too - amusing parody of a noir movie . Sort of what Saturday Night Live has been like for the past decade : not funny . ( In my mind I kept thinking of a Guy Noir sketch , music and all . )
0 I love the depiction of the 30s and 40s in film . I love Salma Hayek . I was more than ready to love this picture . but . . .<br /><br />BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ! ! ! ! ! ! < br /><br />No sir , nothing good about this . The only entertaining aspect for me was Colin Farrell 's character is an insecure writer and this screenplay , despite tackling the juicy subject of racism , approaches the audience in the fashion of an ABC Afterschool Special.<br /><br />The only person who did n't sound like he was " acting ' was Sutherland , and his minutes were few.<br /><br />Stale approach to a tired plot .
0 A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell , two respected and talented actors , sounds like a great idea . An independent film sounds even better . The studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more creativity.<br /><br />But then why is this movie so bland ? Ask the dust.<br /><br />This film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters . No one is given a proper back story , so we do n't ever know why the characters act the way they do.<br /><br />Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination , if you still have one left at the end of this movie.<br /><br />I told a friend that I went to see this film , and that I thought it was awful.<br /><br />Her question : " Not even Colin Farrell could save it ? " My response : " Not even Colin Farrell 's ass could save it . "
0 " Ask the Dust " looked intriguing from the trailer , and we especially like all of the actors . Unfortunately , the movie was not compelling enough to be considered drama , and it was n't funny enough to be a comedy . It practically seemed to satirize itself , and to no entertaining effect . After seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get better , my wife and I walked out , valuing not having wasted any more time on such nonsense . It simply was not interesting , moving , funny nor artistic . It appears as though it were written , produced and directed by a high school kid ; worse yet , it was such a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actors , not to mention our time and money .
0 Given the history of the director of this movie , it is hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through . I was at the European premiere last night and one of the Executive Producers was there . He was yet to see the movie and , boy , was he in for a surprise . I have not read the book that this is based upon , nor do I know if it highly rated or appreciated , but I have read " Captain Correlli 's Mandolin " and given how poorly that was adapted for screen and how bad this movie was , I can only presume that something similar has happened here . The acting was n't bad albeit that there were a couple - too - many raised eyebrows from Farrell . Honestly , I ca n't believed how little I cared for any character in this movie . Situations play out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness . Donald Sutherland 's part comprises a few scenes where he opens a door , says something and closes it again . I kept looking at my watch when I was n't cringing at the dialogue on the screen . I have never walked out on a movie but I was tempted to start during this . I gave this movie a score of ' 2 ' for reasons which seem horrendously shallow to me but these are the best things that I can say about this movie . The first is that I really enjoyed the all - too - short earthquake scene and the second is that Salma Hayek got naked and looked beautiful . I can say little else positive about this movie . Do n't ask the dust anything , it ca n't talk !
0 I do n't like this film , but then I did n't think much of the book either which , although lauded by many as a " masterpiece " , I found lacking in character development and disjointed and illogical in plot , although it was far more readable than Fante 's dreadful first effort " Road to Los Angeles " not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid 80s.<br /><br />I was intrigued to see what sort of soup Towne would make with such meager ingredients . He has worked hard script - wise to repair the many shortcomings of the book but for my money did n't rescue it . There was never a movie in Ask the Dust while ever he tried to stay faithful to the book . I consider this film Towne 's folly.<br /><br />In a word : forgettable .
0 The 1930 ' were a golden age of Los Angeles with its film industry and great potential of various other possibilities to become rich and famous and happy . People were arriving there hoping to fulfill their dreams . Expecting open arms and welcoming offers there were only a few who managed to succeed and find their way to stardom , majority then condemned to live starving , disillusioned and unwanted , searching for a bit of respect in dirty bars and nasty hotel rooms . < br /><br />Young Italian - American writer Arturo Bandini arrives to LA on a similar quest - to spread his charms around to get one of those beautiful wealthy women and to write an excellent novel that would set him on a career path , having so far written a single short story published in an obscure anthology . Wishing to create a romantic masterpiece he seems to be unable to produce anything without experiencing it himself though , occasionally , he sends pieces of magazine stories to a local editor that helps him survive . He is proud to present himself as an Italian but deep in his heart he truly feels his Italian origin as a burden . The little money and the courage to conquer the world he once had are all long gone and watching his dream turning into a hangover he holds a last single nickel to spend . < br /><br />The coffee she brought him was cold and sour and spitting a curse on her triggers a never - ending relationship of insults , unspoken excuses and a love concealed beneath . Camilla being an uneducated girl trying to receive US citizenship through a marriage also carries her heavy cross of a non - perspective racial heritage . Though she is much of a stronger and life experienced person her situation as a beautiful Mexican woman is much harder to deal with than Arturo is able to realize . < br /><br />Is it obvious that Arturo eventually finds his inspiration to work on the novel ? Is it possible that their love finally finds its place in the sun ? Is it likely that their romance takes an unlucky turn?<br /><br />It is very surprising to find out that the chemistry between the two main characters , performed by Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell , does not work . The relationship lacks the raw and authentic feelings . Hayek though livelier a character compared to Farrell 's forgot to arm Camilla with the passion and strength of her once brilliant character Frida . Also it is hard to have faith in a character which being intelligent but uneducated and illiterate uses quite difficult vocabulary and complicated sentences . A tougher character of a Phil Marlowe sort would definitely suit Farrell better , though he looks stunning in a period costume , he seems very lost trying to find the fragile world of a twenty - year old dreamer balancing between a hidden love and desire to be true to himself . < br /><br />Feeling embarrassed watching the two on the screen is not right . Their relationship might have been wild but it is more likely what a thunder and a lightning are without a storm , far from real passion , feelings just described not felt inside . It is very sad that such a potential of an interesting script and good actors was wasted , turned into a grey average of soon - to - be - forgotten .
0 This film is based on the novel by John Fante . Could someone please tell me why ? I see absolutely no reason why this fine book should be adapted in this way . If you want to make a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek , then how could you possibly make a connection to Ask The Dust ( the novel ) ? -And if you wanted to make this story into a film , then why would you want to make it into a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek ? I do n't get it.<br /><br />The adaptation of the story is poorly made , and if you have read the book and liked it , I 'm almost sure you wo n't like what Towne did with it . < br /><br />In the beginning of the film you 'll maybe find the casting odd , the acting bad and the cinematography just a bit overdone . But you hope for the best . I really hoped a lot during this film . I actually wanted it to be good . But it only gets worse , and it is as simple as that : Whether you read Fantes novel or not , this is not a good film . Just another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production combined with bad acting , lack of structure and - of course - plenty of shots of Colin Farells naked butt.<br /><br />I could complain a lot more about this film , but why waste my time . I 've seen it . Alright . I had to see it , because I like the book so much and was curious . And I 'm very disappointed.<br /><br />1/10 is for Colin 's sweet little mustache in the end of the film . So sweet ... Had he worn it the whole time through , I 'd given it 2/10 .
0 Gorgeous bodies , gorgeous colors and camera work , pretentious dialog , banal plot . The name of the prima donna , Camilla , and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently , are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from Dumas ' novel La Dame aux Camelias , the movie Camille starring Garbo and ( I think ) Robert Taylor , and last but not least Verdi 's opera La Traviata . Beautiful , not - too - virtuous young ladies , social outcasts for one reason or another , loved , split up , reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene ... One forgives banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialog in opera , but why waste Hayak , Don Sutherland , a beautiful rendition of LA in the 30s , a deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills the other woman , and all that beauty on this mediocre turkey where there is n't even any beautiful singing ?
0 What do you expect when there is no script to begin with , and therefore nothing that the director can work with . Hayek and Farrell , and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors , they just do n't have anything to say or anything to react to . Even the earthquake was pretty poor . And I do n't know how closely the movie follows the novel , but two have the Jewish girl show up out of nowhere just so show that Arturo has a nice , warm heart , but some stereotypes do n't amount to anything . And he even buries Camilla out in the desert , instead of bringing her back to L.A. for a nice Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while . Pathetic . And the L.A. set was ridiculously graphically created . Anything good ? The window to his apartment felt real , the curtains , the sounds , the wind . And Donaldson is always great . Has been since the Body Snatchers or Night of the Living Dead , whichever it was .
0 A warning to potential viewers : if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story " The Most Dangerous Game , " look elsewhere . " Seven Women for Satan" < br /><br />only superficially addresses the original work by using the name of Zaroff and having said character murder people.<br /><br />Some of what follows might be considered by some to be spoilers . Or not.<br /><br />Boris Zaroff is played by writer / director Michel Lemoine . Whereas his ancestor hunted men because they were the only prey that were truly challenging , Boris ' victims are usually in a position where they can not defend themselves . The film rambles from scene to scene with a near - total lack of clarity . The director seems to have totally disregarded pacing and left the viewer with a suffocatingly dull film . A few individual scenes are mildly interesting ( such as a torture rack sequence ) , but as a unit , the film fails to entertain . Viewers who are more < br /><br />interested in an assortment of attractive and semi - attractive actresses in various stages of undress might find the film watchable . Most will probably find their time is better spent watching Mentos commercials.<br /><br />In a side note , the DVD extras included a fair amount of information on the film 's history . Apparently , it was banned for several years in its native France which pretty much ruined any chance it had for widespread distribution .
0 You just got to love opening sequences like the one in " Seven Women for Satan "   During the intro there 's a naked girl running through the woods , chased by a hunting dog and a malignant looking dude on a horse , until she falls off a cliff and splits her head open on a rock . Then the camera zooms out on the face of the guy and we notice how he 's simply sitting behind a desk whilst his secretary waiting for him to sign some papers . " Oh I 'm sorry , I was lost in my thoughts  " he then says ! Sweet , I have stumbled upon yet another completely bonkers movie . Even if you only understand a minimum of French and have a look at the original title , you immediately know that " Seven Women for Satan " has n't got anything to do with Satan or ritual sacrifices , but simply revolves on the flamboyant escapades of a perverted and mentally unstable count during his weekend in the countryside . This is , in fact , another sleazy variation on the classic milestone " The Most Dangerous Game " about a lunatic 's disturbing hobby of hunting people  preferably hot naked chicks - in the forest for sports . Well actually , this is more than just a variation on the 1932 classic , as writer / director / actor Michel Lemoine had the pretension to directly link his protagonist to Leslie Banks ' legendary villain in " The Most Dangerous Game " . Count Zaroff supposedly is the original Count Zaroff 's son but he exchanged his private island for the remote French countryside . He also ca n't afford to be unemployed anymore , so he 's an office clerk from Monday to Friday and a maniacal killer during the weekend . Zaroff is a genuine weirdo who hallucinates about dancing with deceased woman but actually runs his car over the live ones . His butler once pledged to prevent the Zaroffs from killing , but he 's obviously doing a lousy job . There is n't any depth in the screenplay and the build - up certainly does n't pay attention to suspense or sinister atmosphere . Really , the only useful thing to do during this film is count the girls that are lured for Zaroff 's deceptive trap and hope they 'll reach seven rapidly . Half of the film is pointless and tedious padding footage , like the overlong erotic dance act in which a statue inexplicably transforms into a muscular black guy ( ? ? ? ) , and the other half exists of psychedelic sleaze that eventually grows tiresome as well even though all the girls look ravishing . I have the impression that it was Michel Lemoine 's intention to imitate his pal Jean Rollin and make a deliriously kinky sex - thriller . " Seven Women for Satan " is a French production , so inevitably it also stars Jess Franco regular Howard Vernon ( " The Awful Dr. Orloff " , " Zombie Lake " ) . Lemoine himself surely has the looks of a crazy killer , but not the talent to depict one .
0 Summer Holiday is the forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neill 's Ah Wilderness and deservedly so with the Broadway musical adaptation of Take Me Along . With the exception of the Stanley Steamer song , none of the other Harry Warren - Ralph Blane songs are worth remembering and even that one is questionable . < br /><br />It was right after the release of this film that MGM let Mickey Rooney go and I do n't think it was a coincidence . The film was made in 1946 and released in 1948 , so Mickey was 26 playing an Andy Hardy like teenager . He was just way too old for the part of the 17 year old who was affecting radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellion.<br /><br />Rooney made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948 , this one , Killer McCoy a remake of Robert Taylor 's A Crowd Roars , Love Laughs at Andy Hardy and Words and Music . In all of them Rooney was playing an adult part . Even in the Andy Hardy film , Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy returned from World War II . Why he was in this Louis B. Mayer only knows . < br /><br />Rooney 's bad casting makes Summer Holiday all the worse because in the original Ah Wilderness the emphasis is on the father 's character played here by Walter Huston . And in the Broadway show Take Me Along which won a Tony Award for Jackie Gleason , the Great One played the inebriated brother - in - law Uncle Sid here played by Frank Morgan and that 's the central character.<br /><br />Gloria DeHaven steps in for Judy Garland as Rooney 's sweet and adorable girl friend and Marilyn Maxwell plays the show girl who gives Rooney an adult education . In the original play O'Neill has her as a prostitute , but this was the Hollywood of the Code so all Marilyn does is get young Rooney soused.<br /><br />A lot of really talented people had a hand in this one and they do their best , but Summer Holiday fades rather quickly into a chilly autumn .
0 I love watching early colour films - you mean those 40s clothes were n't all grey ? < br /><br />Margaret Rutherford dominates this movie . Her " eccentric " garb is actually rather attractive and yes , she has an amazing hourglass figure . But I feel she was given her head rather too much . She probably developed this characterisation over many performances , and nobody told her " If it gets a laugh , leave it out . " She does too much deranged fooling about when she 's supposed to be surprisingly down to earth . The Madame Arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery . Arcati behaves like a retired headmistress ( We 'll really put our backs into it ! ) . The contrast between her breezy , commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs is n't really brought out.<br /><br />Just because all the actors are English ( apart from Cummings ) , the Americans feel they have to use the words " Brit " , " stiff " , " lip " and " upper " . Oh , give it a rest ! The three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risqué remarks ( Did he make love to you ? Yes , but very discreetly - he was in the cavalry ! ) .
0 I recently saw the Broadway revival of " Blithe Spirit " starring Angela Lansbury , Rupert Everett , Christine Ebersole , and Jayne Atkinson . It 's a terrific production , and shows what good actors can do with a play that is less than perfect . Angela Lansbury is extremely funny as Madame Arcati.<br /><br />It was probably a mistake , then , to check out the film version of the play starring Rex Harrison . The movie does not have the energy or the laughs of a good stage production.<br /><br />"Blithe Spirit " is probably one of those plays that works better with a live cast , in an audience full of people who have come to laugh . The actors can improvise , give touches and nuances to their performance and delivery of the lines , and involve the audience on a personal level that you ca n't get in a movie house , or with a DVD showing , where the audience is separated from the story by the " Fourth Wall . " The story : Charles Condomine ( Rex Harrison ) , a successful writer , lives with his wife Ruth ( Constance Cummings ) in a house in the English countryside . Seeking information for his next book , a book dealing with the supernatural , Charles invites Madame Arcati ( Margaret Rutherford , reprising her role from the original 1941 London production ) , a local spiritual medium , over to his house to conduct a séance . Charles believes that spiritism is a sham , but hopes to pick up " the tricks of the trade . " But then Madame Arcati brings back the ghost of Elvira ( Kaye Hammond ) , Charles 's first wife , who died of pneumonia seven years ago . Elvira refuses to leave , and develops a spitting rivalry with Ruth over Charles ( complicated by the fact that only Charles can see or hear Elvira).<br /><br />On stage , the actors can give performances that invite laughs in this situation . But on the screen , the actors in " Blithe Spirit " tear through the lines as if they do n't know that anyone is listening to them . They mumble lines that were designed to get laughs on the stage . The performances by Harrison , Cummings , and even Kaye Hammond are flat and lifeless . Only Margaret Rutherford seems to have retained her spark and humor as Madame Arcati.<br /><br />The Oscar - winning visual effects in the film are unimpressive -- not just by today 's standards , but by the standards of 1946 ! They consist mostly of Kaye Hammond walking around in fluorescent green outfits and makeup , being photographed in special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost.<br /><br />The cinematographer deserves some credit for creative lighting . But compare the dull visual effects of " Blithe Spirit " to the truly groundbreaking effects in Disney 's " Song of the South " -- which was eligible for awards the same year . In " South , " humans and animated characters share the screen seamlessly for minutes at a time . Compared to " South , " the Oscar that " Blithe Spirit " received for special effects was completely undeserved.<br /><br />At any rate , I can only encourage you to catch the Broadway revival of this play with Angela Lansbury before it closes . As for the movie with Rex Harrison , skip it .
0 David Lean 's worst film . Even ' In Which We Serve ' was'nt as bad as this . Usually a film with a really good reputation like this one , has at least some redeeming qualities , which makes one understand why it might be considered a classic . But after watching this I just could not get why this piece of crap was liked so much even back in 1945 ! I disliked the acting , stiff upper lip British mannerisms , story , script ( which may be quite witty at times but totally unfunny ) and soundtrack . The elvira character is meant to be alluring and attractive , but was in actual fact ugly and had a weird and annoying voice . Just another film that has convinced me not to trust a films reputation . Another very overrated ' british classic ' .
0 High heels are tricksy things . They can elevate women ( or cross - dressing men ) to newfound heights , put forward a sharp statement of style and bring a touch of fragile elegance . Alternatively , they can be a perilous foot pain that will inevitably lead to trips , falls and ultimate tragedy . Tacones lejanos is more of a disappointment trip than a stylish high riser.<br /><br />Almodóvar 's mother - daughter drama is stylish for sure , but in terms of plot it 's a tongue - tied and tedious affair full of confusing , complex characters that never fully engage or make sense . A few moments of comedy aside , Tacones lejanos just is n't interesting . The best bit comes at the beginning in a marvellously macabre case of manslaughter orchestrated by a child . From this brilliant bit of black comedy things are looking up , but then the film comes to a heel.<br /><br />There 's solid enough acting performances and there 's some stylish , arty direction that you 'd expect from Almodóvar , but otherwise Tacones lejanos is n't an impressive piece of Spanish cinema . With a story of murder , showbiz , femininity , fractured mother - daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge , a transvestite and a police informer this could have been a melodramatic powerhouse . Instead it 's poor . High Heels stumbles for sure .
0 I saw this movie the other day in a film school class , and I had n't seen an Almodovar movie before but went in expecting it to be good . Unfortunately , it turned out to be a pointless film with only a couple of laughs mixed in with two hours of sheer boredom . High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that might have worked in their own separate movies but together do n't add up to any kind of meaningful whole at all.<br /><br />Or so I thought . Then , the next day , my film professor spent the entire class period explaining all of the movie 's hidden little details , like how the mural depicting stereotypical flamenco dancers in the background of the drag queen scene is some kind of commentary on the lack of identity that Spain as a nation has developed under fascist rule . Apparently , the whole movie is chock full of clever little visual tricks and references like this.<br /><br />Great , but you know what ? It 's still a bad movie . It takes more than depth and complexity to make a good film -- you still need to give the audience a reason to keep paying attention , something to interest the viewer enough to actually care about all the subtle tricks . High Heels gives us strange , off - beat characters but keeps them in mostly mundane situations recycled from other movies , and Almodovar does n't seem to be using them to make any kind of point . What is the significance , for example , of the Hitchcockian surprise character revelation that occurs towards the end of the film ? Why is that even in there ? Just to surprise us?<br /><br />There is one funny scene that has to do with a news broadcast . And that 's it , that 's the only entertaining moment . The rest of the movie is just nonsensical filmic references and visual cues that apparently exist only for the sake of showing us how smart Pedro Almodovar is . But no matter what my film professor says , it takes more than self - indulgent trickery for a movie to be good .
0 This was an awful movie . Basically Jane March was a half - Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something horrible to the American forces in South Korea . She becomes a maid for an American military family , they all regard her as being Korean even though she looks more white ( I believe the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asian , not at all Korean ) , and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her . The way Korea and the U.S. military in Korea is depicted is completely insane . Of course , the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men who 've never spent a day in Korea prior to this movie and had no intention of showing any real insight into life in Korea for either Koreans or American GIs and instead just tried to fulfill their pathetic Asiaphile fantasies without any regard to how completely unbelievable it made the movie . Anyone who 's ever been to Korea will know this is utter garbage . In the end the North Korean honhyol spy - girl gets killed , in an obvious " paying for her sins " way . Very bad film with a made - for - TV feel to it .
0 The name " cult movie " is often given to films which continue to be screened , or to sell in home movie format , more than a generation after they were first released . Superchick , which was first released in 1973 , now comes into this category . Its cult status is largely due to ongoing interest in it by those women who regard it as an early and effective feminist film.<br /><br />Despite the " Superwoman " connotation , " Superchick " is not a cartoon character but a very competent young lady working as an air stewardess - a career option which in the 1970 's was commonly regarded as one of the most glamorous open to any girl , and which also enables her to emulate the traditional matelot who reputedly has a wife in every port . Since she holds black belt status in karate , she is in a position to make it quite clear that she is very happy with her bachelor existence , and is in no way beholden to any of her extensive suite of male admirers . This film is a situation comedy which avoids the generally much shorter lived appeal of outright farce . Its appeal to feminists is also heightened by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to avert a hijacking and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate . To ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as to their partners , the Director has wisely ensured that is liberally sprinkled with eye candy.<br /><br />Superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light easy to watch comedy which they will forget soon after viewing . It is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if watched again in a year 's time ; despite its age it may therefore retain its status as a cult movie for some time to come . However the dialogue and acting would make it hard to give this film a rating of more than 4/10 .
0 Suggesting nothing less than a movie - length version of the 1970s TV hit " Love , American Style , " decked out with flashes of nudity , " Superchick " ( 1973 ) is a lighthearted piece of fluff that somehow still manages to entertain . And the lead character here , Tara B. True , really IS some kind of superchick . A stewardess ( not flight attendant ) who 's so good - looking that even her plane 's autopilot has made a pass at her ( ! ) , and with a hunky boyfriend in every port , this wingin ' , swingin ' gal really does put the " lay " in " layover . " What with her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York , her playboy with gangster problems in Miami , and her creatively challenged rock star dude in L.A. , Tara sure does keep busy . And when she 's not draining these guys of all their manly energies , as the viewer learns , she 's liable to be taking a karate class , mile - high clubbing , fending off flashers and rapists , attending groovy pot parties AND stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane . As I said , lighthearted fun , and surely good for a night when you 're feeling somewhat brain - dead and just want to veg out in front of the tube . Future astrologist Joyce Jillson does bring some vacuous charm to her role as Tara , and the film looks handsome enough to please . Disappointingly , buxom ' 70s faves Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin ( aka Candy Samples ) are wasted here in very small roles , but still get to do what they do best -- show off their chesticles ! Though the picture is never laff - out - loud funny and does n't really have many thoughts in its metaphorical head , it does succeed in being consistently amusing , and I suppose that is something . Strange that the end credits should call attention to Ms. Jillson 's body double , however ; do n't think I 've ever seen THAT before !
0 This is only somewhat attractive for fans of " bad movie " entertainment . It is more worthwhile for students of 1970 's pop culture : the fashions , the furniture , the attitudes , and that great " women 's lib " moment of the early 1970 's , when it was still fresh and novel for a self - employed , independent woman to exist.<br /><br />"Superchick " ( Joyce Jillson ) had a monetarily rewarding if stultifying career ( after all , what is a flight attendant but a waitress at 30,000 feet -- that goes for the male ones too ) , she slept around with multiple men , could protect herself and others ( with karate ) and was n't tied down to anything . This is the kind of emancipated woman that scared the juices out of anti - feminists , those retrograde idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband.<br /><br />The " sexy stewardess " was a potent archetype of the late 1960 's to 1970 's , ( geez , even on " The Partridge Family , " I remember swinging bachelor Ruben Kincaid constantly hooking up with stewardesses ) and from that point of view , this silly film is an important pop culture time capsule of the pre - AIDS , free - love , women 's lib , swinging Seventies . The plot is quite awful though . And for those cavemen in the audience , there are few bare breasts to look at .
0 This was a quite brutal movie . There were huge implausibilities , and a silly script , bad acting , etc.<br /><br />The only reason to watch this movie is that from time to time some quite impressive sets of breasts were exposed .
0 A retired diplomat , played nicely by Michael York , goes to Russia to get revenge on the Russian gangster that murdered the diplomat 's policeman son . There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian cop who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice.<br /><br />I remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the Russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous U.S. government . It 's interesting to see this time the Russian guy as a hero.<br /><br />Not a great flick , it 's really typically a " B " action flick . Michael York lends some class to this mediocre movie . Alexander Nevsky , who plays the Russian cop is kind of " blah " but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York . Face it , Michael York is such a good actor that he 'd have chemistry with anyone he 's doing a scene with . Disappointingly , the handsome Adrian Paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie . Now , if Adrian Paul was in this movie longer , it would 've been an above average " B " action flick . All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he is real nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie . The villain , played by Richard Tyson , is your typical bad guy . He 's very blonde and very villainous in this movie.<br /><br />Rent this flick if there is nothing else on TV to watch . It 's okay . It does n't suck too bad . The action scenes are decent . The acting could be better , the plot could 've moved much faster , but hey , you get to see what Russia looks like today !
0 But it does have some good action and a plot that is somewhat interesting . Nevsky acts like a body builder and he is n't all that attractive , in fact , IMO , he is UGLY . ( his acting skills lack everything ! ) Sascha is played very well by Joanna Pacula , but she needed more lines than she was given , her character needed to be developed . There are way too many men in this story , there is zero romance , too much action , and way too dumb of an ending . It is very violent . I did however love the scenery , this movie takes you all over the world , and that is a bonus . I also liked how it had some stuff about the mafia in it , not too much or too little , but enough that it got my attention . The actors needed to be more handsome ... The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was just too normal , not sexy enough . I think for most guys , Sascha will be hot enough , but for us ladies that are fans of action , Nevsky just does n't cut it . Overall , this movie was fine , I did n't love it nor did I hate it , just found it to be another normal action flick .
0 This movie is a vehicle for Schwarzenegger - clone Alexander Nevsky . His charisma however is insufficient to lift this movie above the level of its poor script . He has little to add to his Arnie - act.<br /><br />Michael York is quite pathetic as the begging diplomat . Watching him revisit his D'Artagnan - act from the time that he was a better actor made me feel uneasy . Come on , you can do better than that!<br /><br />The story is full of holes and unexplained relations ; top of this bill is the informer of Vlad , who sounds like an American woman , but from the context appears to be working for a Russian government - department.<br /><br />Although the story takes place well after the end of the Communist - regime , all the Russian characters are still very communist - like . In contradiction to that , Vlad is allowed to drive a pimped up all utility vehicle as police - car . The action scenes are poorly shot and therefore lack dynamics.<br /><br />Not a must see movie ...
0 It felt like I watched this movie thousand times before . It was absolutely predictable . Every time the story tried to get a bit twisted , every time I awaited something interesting to happen , I saw nothing but what I expected . Like " The bread factory opened up another facility , because there was not enough bread " . In two words : Flat story , that has become a cliché , bad acting , bad special effects ... Only the dumb Russian cop , Vlad , was a bit funny while punishing around the bad guys . The pile of muscles was so incredibly STUPID , that it made me laugh at him for a moment . I wonder why i waste my time spitting on that shame - of - a - movie ... It wo n't get worse ( because it is not possible ) :D

0 You do n't expect much from a PRC picture , and with rare exceptions -- mainly from Edgar G. Ulmer and a few by Joseph H. Lewis or Lew Landers -- that 's exactly what you get : not much . This " epic " about Nazis in Africa trying to incite an Arab revolt against the British is n't much different . The script , by longtime PRC hacks Arthur St. Claire and Sherman Lowe , is trite , laughable , full of unfunny " wisecracks " and plot holes the size of Outer Mongolia . The direction , by longtime PRC no - budget specialist Al Herman , is semi - comatose at best . The performances , though -- except for spectacularly incompetent and irritatingly hammy lead Walter Woolf King -- aren't really half bad . Veteran comedian Parkyakarkus is actually the best thing about the film . He plays a guy from Brooklyn masquerading as a razor - blade salesman and brightens up the screen considerably when he shows up . He 's got great comic timing , charm to spare and seems to be having a heck of a good time . Duncan Renaldo is fairly convincing as an Arab sheik -- despite his Spanish accent -- and veteran bad guy George J. Lewis as Renaldo 's Arab rival does his usual fine job of villainy , even if he goes a bit over the top sometimes . Joan Woodbury is quite pretty and has a nice light touch , and she and Renaldo have great chemistry together , although -- like the rest of the cast -- she has none at all with King . H.B. Warner , whose career stretched back to the silent era , lends a shred of dignity to the low - rent proceedings , even though he blows his lines several times and , PRC being PRC , they were n't cut out . There 's a great deal of stock footage spliced in from a big - budget silent movie with a similar Arab theme -- although I have no idea which one it is -- and , PRC being PRC , no effort was made to try to make it inconspicuous : I 've seldom seen stock footage that was so blatantly obvious.<br /><br />"A Yank in Libya " is n't very good , of course -- well , OK , it stinks -- but it would be worth a look just to see Parkyakarkus in his prime . I had heard of him and knew that he was the father of actor / director Albert Brooks and Super Dave Osborne , but had never actually seen him in anything before . It was worth watching this tenth - rate PRC " extravaganza " just to see him in action . Otherwise , forget it .
0 It definitely fits the time period as the Axis & Allies were playing espionage games throughout most of North Africa & the rest of the world . It 's not the best of films , but certainly not the worst of the budget films as described previously from the compilation War Classics . < br /><br />Duncan"Cisco Kid " Renaldo was actually very good in one of his first feature films . I really enjoyed the performance of Harry Parke ( credited as Parkyarkarkus ) . Why he never got any bigger roles is beyond me . He played the perfect buddy / partner role and saved the movie ... imho.<br /><br />As said , this film was part of a budget package from Superbox - Mart entitled War Classics . Eight movies for eight bucks , which included other never - heard - from - films that has some decent stars trying to pay the bills.<br /><br />This script is ... well , not so hot . The editing & cinematography is ... worse . If you can by - pass all of that and want to see the future Cisco Kid & a great sidekick that sadly never fulfilled his true potential , definitely pick it up ! Otherwise , there 's other WW2 films to watch.<br /><br />-Thunderossa .
0 Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive . I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT 'S OK is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between . Attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet ( CITY OF LOST CHILDREN , DELICATESSEN ) , Park embarks on a fanciful , lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare . Hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision , it is genuinely unexpected , then , to see all Park 's effort add up to so very little.<br /><br />I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT 'S OK seems astonishingly to subtract from itself as it goes along , with the the end result being a fraction of the sum of its parts . The premise is promising , gags are copious and offbeat humour abounds but it all fails miserably to create any meaningful connection with the audience . The characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast , but , try as i might , i could not bring myself to care for any.<br /><br />SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a misstep , indicating perhaps that Park was overindulging himself a little bit , but it still managed to showcase some of the director 's unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography , was readily forgiven . None of the assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR . VENGEANCE is evident here . I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT 'S OK left me so utterly unengaged i caught myself instinctively fast forwarding from time to time ( more regularly as the film progressed ) . I gave LADY a 5/10 , and by that measure , this probably deserves no more than a 3 . For old time 's sake , i 'll be generous : 4/10
0 The story : Young - goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness . She ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg . In the institution she meets Park Il - sun , a young man who develops a bond with her.<br /><br />If you 're reading this you probably already know how talented Chan - wook Park is . But ' I 'm A Cyborg ... ' is a big departure from familiar , and ( sadly ) stronger territory . I 'm a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different . God knows , we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas . The main point about the movie I need to say is , that it fails to say anything about mental illness , or create a characters that you care about.<br /><br />This story has to be one of the weirdest things I 've seen in years ... but weird is n't enough . There 's no heart to the movie ... just surrealism and confusion . Confusion does seem to be the main theme of the movie . The characters all try to make sense of their own problems , but it 's Chan - wook Park himself who proves to be the most confused of them all .
0 Prior to this release , Neil LaBute had this to say about the 1973 original : " It 's surprising how many people say it 's their favorite soundtrack . I 'm like , come on ! You may not like the new one , but if that 's your favorite soundtrack , I do n't know if I * want * you to like my film . " < br /><br />Neil , a word . You might want to sit down for this too ; as Lord Summerisle says , shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent . See , Neil , the thing about the original , is that Paul Giovanni 's soundtrack is one of the most celebrated things about it . The filmmakers themselves consider it a virtual musical . Along with Richard and Danny Thompson , and Bert Jansch , it practically kick - started the 1970s Folk New Wave . To undermine it is akin to imagining Jaws without John Williams . Or The Buddy Holly Story without Buddy Holly . The result 's one of the most breathtakingly arrogant , pointless remake of a British cult classic since Sly Stallone 's Get Carter.<br /><br />The original had apparently left Nicolas Cage " disturbed for about two weeks . " So disturbed , during that fortnight 's window , that he pitched the idea of re - imagining one of the most nuanced films about inter - faith struggle ever devised to a writer - director previously known for his wholly unsubtle depictions of male chauvinism . It 's like some parlor game : what would you get if Sam Peckinpah took on Bambi ? Or Gaspar " Irreversible " Noe remade Love , Actually?(Actually , I 'd quite like to see that ) . Unfortunately , someone took this parlor game seriously : All LaBute 's succeeded in doing is ripping out the original 's guts while saddling it with his own gormless Sex War preoccupations.<br /><br />After failing to rescue a little girl and her mum from a fatal car crash , Cage 's highway patrolman spirals into a medicated torpor . Then he receives a letter from ex - fiancée Willow Woodward ( this one trades on name - homages for kudos ) , now living on the private island community of Summersisle  that extra 's ' stands for ' superfluous '  and wants Edward to help locate missing daughter Rowan.<br /><br />Summersisle , it transpires , is a female - dominated joint , conceived as a haven for oppressed womenfolk and refugees from the Salem witch trials . Here , the matriarchs observe the Olde ways , and the few males are near - mute breed - mules . It 's like Lilith Fair on a grand scale . Summersisle 's main export is honey  a symbolic and literal headache for Edward , as he 's allergic to bees . " Beekeepers ! " cries Edward . " They seem to be everywhere on this island ! " Well , that 's probably because Summersisle 's main export is honey.<br /><br />While making his investigations , Edward overhears of an oncoming Mayday ritual called " the time of death and rebirth " . He discovers the previous year 's crop failed ; nearly dies from bee stings ; and eventually comes to the conclusion ( a conclusion which admittedly could n't be more obvious if the locals had tattooed a timetable of events on the back of his hands ) that Rowan will be burnt alive in a pagan rite to ensure a bountiful harvest . He also meets the Queen Bee of the hive , Sister Summersisle ( Burstyn ) , who has her own plans for him involving the eponymous Wicker Man : " The drone must die . " < br /><br />First , the good news : any concerns Cage would be airlifted from the Wicker Man 's flaming jaws at the last minute by a fleet of black CIA helicopters can be laid to rest : he toast . That 's about it for the good news . " This is a story whose chapters were carefully written " intones Burstyn with sublime irony . Though retaining the basic cat - and - mouse premise ( and credits typography ) , what 's left subjects the original to a scorched - earth policy.<br /><br />Crucial to Shaffer 's original screenplay was that his Christian copper , in accordance with ritual , came to the island of his own free will  and most importantly , was a virgin ; the perfect sacrifice . In reducing matters to a sexual , as opposed to a religious power - struggle , LaBute presents the flimsiest of qualifiers for a harvest sacrifice . By the time Cage has worked out he was the bait , you honestly could n't care less.<br /><br />And Cage is one of the very worst things in this ; a lumbering , drawling donkey  an arsewit whose tongue seems just slightly too big for his mouth . " Goddamit " he moans after he hallucinates a drowned Rowan , with all the mental torment of a man who 's set his morning alarm clock half - an - hour too early . One hopes it 's his character 's frequent reliance on pills that has reduced him to this state  alternately fatigued , then full of preppy , overbearing vim . If so , it 's a fine portrayal of an undistinguished IQ addled with anti - depressants . If not  it does n't bear thinking about . As Willow , the saucer - eyed Beahan is similarly dreadful , presenting her lines as if in competition with Cage for the  most  half - hearted  delivery . While Burstyn entirely lacks the mercurial menace to convince . Who 's afraid of Naomi Wolf ? < br /><br />Every element that made the original great  the lovingly detailed depictions of folk customs , the ingenious score , the dialogue ( Lord Summerisle 's majestic " You did it beautifully ! " has been replaced with the rather less attractive " You did it excellently ! " Whoah , dude ! )  have been substituted for a meandering battle - of - the - sexes thriller with occasional crash - bang wallop . Namely , walloping women ; this is a LaBute flick , after all . Cage 's Sister Beech bashing is just one of the more embarrassing episodes ; impotent little men will be hooting with glee at how them uppity hippie chicks finally got what was comin ' to 'em , hyuk hyuk.<br /><br />The closing coda sees the whole rotten mess collapsing under the weight of genre cliché : in a bar , two guys run into a couple of Summersisle maidens on shore leave , flirty - fishing for fresh martyrs . At the moment of their successful pick - up , you half expect the women to turn round and give an exaggerated wink and a thumbs up to the camera.<br /><br />One more thing : keen credit watchers may have noticed that films sporting an unusually high producer count ( anything up to 10 ) tend to be Not Much Cop . The Wicker Man has 18 producers in total .
0 This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that I 've spent in a very , very long time . If you knew how often I went to the movies you 'd probably say , that 's hard to imagine , but never - the - less , it 's true ! After seeing the trailer for this movie , I knew that I had to see it ! If you 're a fan of horror , mystery , and suspense , why would n't you ? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting ; unfortunately , the movie is none of these.<br /><br />From the cinematography , to the script , to the acting , this movie is a complete flop . If you 're reading this , planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills , mystery , action , horror , or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty - five minutes I 'm afraid you are in for disappointment.<br /><br />"Why is it so bad , " you might be asking yourself . Let me tell you . The movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful . Nothing about the movie made me the least bit " on edge , " frightened , or curious . The script was at best laughable . There were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous I began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it was n't . The acting was absolutely dreadful . I like Nicholas Cage but this was a miss . Without exception , every performance in this movie was incredibly below average . The cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique . Finally , the story is completely transparent . You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away.<br /><br />I am not usually a very harsh critic . Frankly , when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery / suspense / horror , I just want to be surprised . This movie was boring , poorly acted , poorly written , and an overwhelming disappointment . Do yourself a favor and go see something else .
0 The Wicker Man . I am so angry that I can not write a proper comment about this movie.<br /><br />The plot was ridiculous , thinly tied together , and altogether - just lame . Nicolas Cage ... shame on you ! I assumed that since you were in it , that it would be at least decent . It was not.<br /><br />I felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor , and even if it 's complete - the movie was just outlandish and silly.<br /><br />At the end you 're left mouth agape , mind befuddled and good taste offended . I have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred . People were complaining about it in small groups in the mall , four floors down from the theater near the entrance . It 's that bad.<br /><br />I heard it compared to : Glitter , American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli . My boyfriend was so mad he would n't even talk about it.<br /><br />Grrrr !
0 Unfortunately , this movie does no credit whatsoever to the original . Nicholas Cage , fairly wooden as far as actors go , imbues the screen with a range of skill from , non - plussed to over the top . The supporting cast is no better.<br /><br />The plot stays much the same as the original in terms of scene progression but is far worse . Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to by into what is being sold . It turns out it 's just a bill of poor goods . Disbelief can not be suspended , nor can a befit of a doubt be given . The only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual , as the medium requires , and whomever scouted the location should be commended.<br /><br />There was much laughter in the audience and multiple boos , literally , at the end.<br /><br />Disappointed ! Wait for the original to come on television , pour a whiskey and enjoy .
0 I have n't seen the original , but just wanted to drop a quick note to anyone who happens to scroll down this far : Wicker Man is the worst movie I 've seen this year . Maybe even in two years . I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or turn back time to warn myself not to see it.<br /><br />I'll give it two positive nods : The sarcasm of Cage 's character at least got some laughs from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful . Sorry , that 's it . Here come the jeers . The movie 's plot is only propelled forward because other characters wo n't give Cage any straight answers -- and he puts up with this ! ! ! How this could go on for over an hour of my time(much less days in the movie ) is beyond me . < br /><br />Not to mention that the plot is full of holes . You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library . How anyone could read this script and think , " Yes , people should pay $ 11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like " is beyond me.<br /><br />Do not go see this flick . Or even rent it on DVD .
0 Anyone not aware of the 1973 original British Lion movie ' The Wicker Man ' would , no doubt , have left the cinema with the impression ' Poor ' and ' Peurile'.<br /><br />As a devotee of the original I left with the impression Purely Poor.<br /><br />From the grim reality of haggle toothed inbreds drawing the force of law and order into a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a remote Scottish island , named Summerisle(the original ) to a near Amazon - ic colony off the Maine coast of the US , named Summersisle , the remake hardly hits the spot.<br /><br />This is , quite sadly , a case of what ' could ' have been a classic remake of a classic being tampered with to cater for a simple minded public . NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS . < br /><br />Gentlemen ( or given the reworked context of the film ) Ladies involved ... hang your heads in shame .
0 How this film could miss so many of the fascinating , complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original movie is truly remarkable . An unbelievably thin and unengaging plot , ankle - deep characterisation / motivation and a really awful soundtrack ( replacing tension with vast swathes of noise , replacing the arcane musical references of the original for digitised crashes and roars . Then there are the specific references to the original which are merely " plastered on " over the cracks ... Dreadful . In a world where gormless , brain - dead Amerikan remakes of The Italian Job ( a tear appears ) , Get Carter ( sobs uncontrollably ) and Alfie have desecrated our screens recently , this one takes the proverbial biscuit . Execrable nonsense . How Ellen Burstyn ever got involved is a wonder ... Rubbish .
0 This has got to be one of the worst fillums I 've ever seen and I 've seen a few . It is slow , boring , amateurish - not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot . The actors do not act . I ca n't blame them - they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in SummersIsle.<br /><br />There is not one moment in this film that rings true - not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved . The Nicholas Cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations . I have no doubt that I was seeing a suffering man up there but it was Nicholas Cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career .
0 what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless . movie . A remake that did not need to be retold . Everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments . Worst movie I ever saw . Save your time and money!!!<br /><br />Nicgolas Cage was biking down hills , swimming in murky water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene.<br /><br />Although a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and Cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself . It is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies . Do n't they get a copy of the script first . If you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on DVD .
0 This film was terrible . OK , my favourite film is ' The Wicker Man ' ( 1973 ) , so I was always bound to be a little biased . < br /><br />The plot rambles along , throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term ' remake ' highly dubious . ( He 's not a virgin , but IS allergic to bees . WOW ! ) So many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained , which I 'm afraid Mr LaBute does not a horror movie make . ( How are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film ? ) Cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout , and his character is prone to calling out " Rowan ! ? " at the slightest noise . The ' nods ' to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage . For example , certain incidents mirror the original ( The girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when Woodward / Cage is searching the island ) and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned in.<br /><br />I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this , I really ca n't be bothered to write any more about this film . It lacks any kind of substance . Throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were ' based ' on ( in this case very loosely ) .
0 Everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful . I was n't going to comment , but the film just bugs me so much , and the writer / director in particular . So I must toss in my hat to join the naysayers.<br /><br />I saw the original " Wicker Man " and really loved the cornucopia of music , sensuality , paganism in a modern world , and the clash of theological beliefs . This said , I am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies should n't be done . For example , I liked the original 1950 's " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " , but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake . Both films can stand on their own . Another example is " The Thing " . The original , as campy as it looks compared to today 's standards , has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell ( my all time favorite horror movie ) . So that small minority of people who like " The Wicker Man " re - make can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it 's a re - make.<br /><br />This film solidified for me Neil LaBute 's sexism and misogynistic tendencies . It also made me wonder how executives , wanting to make a serious thriller , would green light a product that is so anti - female . There are too many scenes of Cage hitting women just because he 's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl . would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects are n't forthcoming ? The original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a Goddess based religion . The threat to the main character came from everyone , male and female . There was no sexual hierarchy.<br /><br />The metaphor of bees , drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient ( " The drone must die ! " ) , especially when Cage 's character has bee allergies . I kept wondering why the men on the island did n't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts . These were not women with special supernatural powers , and half of them seemed to be pregnant , the other half old and fat , and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs , so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women . Physically dominate them . There did n't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy . But if they were content being drones , why make them unable to speak ? They could be used as a threat to Cage because they will defend the community . They are drones because Neil LaBute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated . ( That movie was made already . " The Stepford Wives " anyone ? ) Classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sh*t together and were truly equal citizens.<br /><br />The problem with the man - hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when Cage starts knocking women out . I belief LaBute should 've left the society an egalitarian one , kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness , and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island . No one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited . So how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around ? There would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused , thus , an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children . LaBute has said he created the fiancé and daughter story thread to give Cage 's character an incentive to search . I do n't think you need that . Any child abused will make an adult react to save them . The irony of course would be that the child Cage " saves " ultimately brings him death.<br /><br />The dialogue was contrived and campy . The whole third act was hilarious . The audience I saw it with guffawed ( and later booed at the end ) . I just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded Cage is . We do n't need that . Just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child . Most of us in America have seen " Law & Order " and other cop procedurals . We come into the movie as if we are Cage 's partner solving a mystery.<br /><br />So much potential ... wasted . Neil LaBute , stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst - ridden plays and flicks of that sort . Stay with your own company of men . Leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers . Here is your jar of honey . I 'll watch that .
0 Do n't let the premise fool you -- this was one funny movie . The problem -- it was n't supposed to be a comedy . The story sets you up nicely for an ending that never comes . Even worse , the set - up is NEVER explained . You will leave the theater asking " Is that it ? " I rate it a 2 simply because there were a few brief moments of promise , but the finish leaves you completely flat . Nicholas Cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role , but he had very little to work with . There are odd quirks , and interesting turns everywhere , which had absolutely nothing to do with the movie . Let this one come out on video before wasting your money .
0 I have never seen the 1973 , older highly rated version . I am a Nicholas Cage fan ( by the way , fine acting as usual ) . This movie probably took all of five minutes to hammer out the whole plot ( I can see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party ) , if you ca n't figure out the ending of this drool in the first thirty minutes you will probably find this movie entertaining . This is , of late , the terrible rut that Hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror / mystery / thriller genre , unable to give the audience enough credit and write a fresh , smart , and tantalizing screenplay , they dish out some creepy music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final print off to your local theater . At least , it did n't have the jiggling hand - held camera syndrome .
0 A phenomenal achievement in awfulness . It 's actually hilariously awful.<br /><br />First off ... Nicholas Cage must now have made it to the finals in the Over - Emoting Category in his acting class . Wearing new hair plugs and with a face that has been lifted so many times his pinned back ears seem to be straining to touch in the back he oozes not only a sick smarmiess but creates a " hero " character that you have no vested interest in.<br /><br />I do n't know what it is with Neil Labute and female characters . He makes females out to be totally deviant and evil ... and pays them back by having Cage punch several of them directly in the face and call them all " b****es " a few times too . I 've enjoyed LaBute 's early films and a few of his plays ... but it 's a strange fascination he has.<br /><br />I'd give this film a 2 out of 10 solely based on Ellen Burstyn 's performance . By the time she finally makes her appearance ( bravely soldiering through her scenes with her wig line clearly visible on her forehead ) it seems like all hope may be lost . She deserves an Oscar right here and now for saying her lines with a straight face and when she appears wearing a white mumu and blue , white , and gold face paint booming about The Wicker Man you know that working with Scorcese and Friedkin really prepped her for this role dang well.<br /><br />This movie is so wrong - headed and cuckoo that is has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Highlights include : Nicholas Cage running away from a swarm of bees and then falling down a hill.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage stealing a bicycle and looking like Ms. Gulch from The Wizard of Oz riding around on it.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage running around the island kicking down doors looking for the missing girl.<br /><br />Leelee Sobieski PLUMMETING from a once - promising acting career in a " brawl " with Cage.<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn dancing around in a said while mumu.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage screaming " Who burned it ? Who burned it ? Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it?Who burned it ? " for no reason.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage in a bear costume ( I 'm not kidding ) running through the woods , taking off the costume ( but leaving the bear feet on ) and then doing some karate moves to some villains.<br /><br />And you have n't lived until you have seen the final 15 minutes of the movie and its dreadful epilogue that looked like it was shot yesterday in your cousin 's basement.<br /><br />Needless to say , if you can make it through this film without laughing out loud then you deserve a medal . There was actually a point in the movie where I stopped snickering to wonder if maybe this was n't an elaborate send - up of " hysteria " films ... only to be reminded when Cage would scream / shout / whisper his dialogue that he really was taking himself quite seriously.<br /><br />I think this one is destined to be a cult film all over again ... just because it 's so dreadful .
0 The Wicker Man Has Done The Impossible ! It replaced Cat Woman as the worst recent movie in my steel trap cinema mind . YES it 's really that bad . So bad that when sitting down to write this review I thought to myself " If I had a choice to either see this movie again or to have red hot needles shoved in my eyes " I might actually go for the red hot needles.<br /><br />Neil LaBute created a rare movie where Joel Schumacher could sit back and say with comfort and a guilt free mind " Yeah that 's some bad direction right there".<br /><br />I think the first clue for myself should have been the tag line : " Some Sacrifices Must Be Made " . Sure it might sound sort of cheeky ominous line to intrigue you but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen . Trust me on this the people responsible for this movie should be charged with a hate crime .. or at least fraud for trying to pass this off as anything resembling entertainment . Seriously ! The movie is about an island where men are just there for breeding and I would still rather with be stuck on Gilligans Island with only pictures of Condoleezza Rice then find myself stranded there.<br /><br />The most entertaining part about this movie was the guy who ripped the loudest fart I 've ever heard in a movie theater . That 's not a joke nor is it fictional . I 've never been to a " thriller " and heard so much laughter through out the entire film . I ca n't tell you with an certainty if the laughs were intentional in some effort to lighten the cinematic tension or if they just really thought this crud would actual fly . I honestly found myself routing for a power outage or a perhaps a fight to break out in the movie theater , anything to make this more interesting which is pretty sad since Deez , Powder and I pounded 2 beers each before the film just for a little mental anesthesia ( soon to be a law before all Nic Cage films , write to your congressman today , do n't delay ) . At one point I actually thought perhaps this movie is really a spoof and Anna Ferris is going to show up  oh how I wish.<br /><br />Nic Cage throws out so much ham per frame I 'm thinking of having a cholesterol test done today . To think that I ever thought Sean Penn was a d*ck for slamming Nic 's acting , oh he 's still a d*ck just lesser of one  yes Sean Penn 's d*ck was lessened because of this film . Do us all a favor Nic play your strengths and stick to being pathetic losers and drunks . You can not play superman you do not get to play strong hunky roles go straight to jail do not pass go do not collect 200 dollars . His best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a burly woman to steal her bear suit ( like the fart , not a joke or a functional moment during this review ) then proceeds to run amok like Conan O'Brian 's masturbating bear , but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around . Thankfully he meets his end shortly after when it turns out he 's to be a sacrifice to the crowd at the new tour hybrid show of Burning Man and Lilith Fair . Yes ! ! ! ! I just spoiled the ending for you  and if you knew any better you 'd build statues of me in worship and sing songs of my legend . I sat through this crap - fest so you do n't have to.<br /><br />About half way through this little misadventure I kept thinking to myself Jack Bauer would have wrapped this case up in 20 minutes of real time .. OK 35 minutes if Kim gets attacked by a mountain lion first . Even Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau could have figured this out in under an hour  and you Sir are no Inspector Clouseau.<br /><br />If for some reason you are taken captive and you have a choice to see this film or take a bullet , take the bullet.<br /><br />Somewhere Uwe Boll is laughing at us all .
0 I picked this DVD up at the Dollar Store . The DVD was on the 2 for $ 1 rack , but since it had Michael Madsen in it , I thought that since I had never seen the movie , I bought it anyway.<br /><br />I must say that I did n't like the movie . The movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else . I found that the director 's use of flashbacks did not add to the story line for me . I would have preferred to view the story line in chronological order.<br /><br />I wo n't throw it away like one of the other commentators , but It may be quite awhile before I would consider watching this movie again.<br /><br />Who knows , since it was Michael Madsen 's film debut , maybe it might have some archival value at some future date .
0 Poor Michael Madsen ; he must be kicking himself to know folks have found out about this horrible flick . I really ca n't think of anything worse I have ever seen , except amateur porn . It 's that bad , and all here ; wooden acting , bad script , crappy moral ending , you hate it and it is in this movie.<br /><br />My question is : " Who the Hell put $ $ $ into this piece of doggy doo ? At least we could have seen Michael 's sister Virginia nude in a scene , but I do n't think even that would save this stinker ... <br /><br />For a cool guy that has made some exception movies , I want to know what wacky church sponsored this piece of crapola .
0 An actor 's first film is usually something one can afford to miss - it 's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display , and this film is no exception.<br /><br />But worse than that , even by 1982 standards this is so bad , it 's hysterically funny . Filmed entirely in the Chicago area on an obviously small budget , most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff , wooden , and cartoonish - a cross between a high school play and bad community theater . Noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialog , and the dialog is truly bad , very declarative in a way that comes off as forced and expedient rather than natural and organic . Scenes are contrived and choppy , and even though the characters go through a span of years , neither the children nor the adults age at all.<br /><br />I do believe it 's possible to make a Christian film that 's palatable to a large , secular audience , but too often the creators of such films are so focused on ' The Message ' or in this case , their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are tossed aside . ( I 'm sure it 's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and cast member . ) < br /><br />Luckily , Michael Madsen was much more interesting - and believable - to watch in his subsequent films . Careers like his are certainly not built on films like this one .
0 THE TEMP ( 1993 ) did n't do much theatrical business , but here 's the direct - to - video rip - off you did n't want , anyway ! Ellen Bradford ( Mel Harris ) is the new woman at Millennium Investments , a high scale brokerage firm , who starts getting helpful hints from wide - eyed secretary Deidre ( Sheila Kelley ) . Deidre turns out to be an ambitious daddy 's girl who will stop at nothing to move up the corporate ladder , including screwing a top broker she ca n't stand and murdering anyone who gets on her bad side . She digs up skeletons in Ellen 's closet , tries to cause problems with her husband ( Barry Bostwick ) , kills while making it look like she is responsible , kidnaps her daughter and tries to get her to embezzle money from the company.<br /><br />Harris and Kelley deliver competent performances , the supporting cast is alright and it 's reasonably well put - together , but that does n't fully compensate for a script that travels down a well - worn path and offers few surprises .
0 " The Secretary " is one of those cheesy , cliched , " thrillers " that one is subjected to watching on a Sunday afternoon , when there is virtually nothing else on . While the plot ( a demented woman becomes jealous of all who succeed over her in the office and decides to do whatever she can to stop them ) may be one of a kind , I recognized countless plot twists , probably taken from other TV movies that I had been subjected to for the very same reason.<br /><br />To make matters worse , I was not wild about the cast . Mel Harris is one of those actresses who appears in so many TV movies as either a " mom " or some sort of " victim " of foul play or abuse , that one must wonder the kind of life she leads . In this one , she gets the joy of playing a mom AND a victim of psycho secretary Sheila Kelly , who was not a very good choice as the villain . While Sheila Kelly has made some good career moves(Singles , Breaking In , and I guess , Law and Order ) , she is also beset by a string of pitiful TV movie roles , and this one just adds to it . As for the others , I do n't have any clear memories of them , so that must say something.<br /><br />This one WILL play on the Lifetime network(I think that 's where I saw it ) , but do n't bother watching it , unless you are too bored for words . Not that it will make you any more excitied ...
0 A chemical spill is turning people into zombies . It 's up to two doctor 's to survive the epidemic . It 's an Andreas Schnaas film so you know what the par for the course will be . Bad acting , horribly awful special effects , and no budget to speak of . The dubbing is ridiculous with a capital R and the saddest thing is that I feel compelled to write one word about this piece of excrement , much less the ten lines mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by IMDb . My original review of merely one word : Crap would n't fly so I have to revise it and go more in to how bad it is . But I do n't know if I can , so .. wait I think I may have enough words , or lines rather to make this review pass . Which is cool , I guess . So in summation : This movie sucks balls , do n't watch it.<br /><br />My Grade : F
0 I will keep this as short as possible as this piece of crap barely warrants a mention . ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst films ever made - right up there with Schnaas ' other horrible zombie entry - ZOMBIE DOOM ( aka VIOLENT SH!T 3 ) . These films suck so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot . I somehow managed ( barely ... ) to sit through ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 is so horribly inept - even when compared to Schnaas ' other horrible film - that I had to fast - forward through everything after the first 10 minutes . ZERO acting skills , inept gore , horrible camcorder - style camera - work , ridiculous dubbing ... it just goes on and on . I really ca n't find a single thing redeeming about this garbage - and I can usually find SOMETHING redeeming in just about ANY film . This truly is one of the worst films ever made - You 've been warned ... 1/10
0 Beyond dirt cheap , this shot - on - video exercise in ineptitude was difficult to get through . It 's got the typical gore that you 'd expect in a zombie movie , but none of the required atmosphere to make it worth while.<br /><br />What 's strange is that this is an amateur German video , and the version I saw is English - dubbed ! The dubbers seem to be American fans ( penpals of the Germans ? ! ) who ca n't decide whether they want to play it straight or turn it into a comedy . One character ( a white German , of course ) is dubbed by a black guy apparently , who speaks with thick ebonics ! ' Kno wahm sayin ' , Comrad ?
0 What in God 's name happened here ? How does one go about creating what is practically a cheap knockoff of Redneck Zombies ? Was Zombie ' 90 ever supposed to entertain someone ... anyone , or even make a dollars profit ? But mainly , what happened here ? < br /><br />Zombie ' 90 Extreme Pestilence was directed by a lunatic by the name of Andreas Schnaas , who specializes in earth - shattering gore films , such as Goblet of Gore , and Anthropophagus 2000 , and some of which contain profanity in the titles . In the gore department , this one is n't much different than the rest . Although , the level of ineptness ... well , earth - shattering.<br /><br />Zombie ' 90 Extreme Pestilence is as bad as Peter Jackson 's Dead - Alive is gory , think about it.<br /><br />Getting too specific with the story would be a waste of time . An accident , involving chemicals causes the dead to come back , and eat the living . Never has the concept been treated in such a manner . The gore effects are a whole , new low . Just a Z - grade nightmare . I ca n't tell whether , or not this was originally meant to be funny , somehow , I doubt the English dubbing was being very true to the original script , but stranger things have happened . The whole thing just reminds me of a shot - on - video introduction to a Troma movie , except it lasts a hell of a lot longer.<br /><br />I've seen only one film that was worse than this , The Chooper.<br /><br />For proof that Andreas Schnaas is an actual director , I would highly recommend Nikos The Impaler If you think you have no standards in what you look for in a bad movie , give Extreme Pestilence a try , but you 've been warned . It takes nerves of steel to make it all the way through . But if gore is all you 're here for , then you might be able to stomach this one . Other than that , no atmosphere , no , and I mean NO budget , no entertainment value , but mostly , no pride . Show some pride , Schnaas . 1/10 < br /><br />Updated 7/5/09 : After a few more viewings of Zombie ' 90 , I 've had a change of heart , or I guess I just get it now . Zombie ' 90 is hilarious , so nevermind the harsh words , Although , Extreme Pestilence still only deserves one star .
0 This review is based on the dubbed Shock - o - Rama video released on an undeserving world in 2002 . How bad is it ? It 's awful , which is what a ' 1 ' represents on the IMDb scale -- but it 's much worse than that . It 's nice to imagine that an original German - language print might improve matters -- the comedic English - language dubbing is n't funny at all -- but truthfully , this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre you 're likely to see . The zombies in the film are as slow and clumsy as ever , and they do n't seem to have the ability to speak or think about anything beyond their next meal . However , they 're also intelligent enough to operate chainsaws and malicious enough to know that western taboos about genitalia will no doubt enliven their dinner table conversation . George Romero 's Land of the Dead posited a zombie nation that retained a shred of social coherence ; here , zombies are nothing more than an empty canvas for the perverse imaginings of director Andreas Schnaas . Utterly without redeeming social value , and even worse , entirely lacking as entertainment , Zombie ' 90 is a bad joke on anyone who wastes money on it .
0 This is one of the worst movies i 've ever encountered , but i want to say that some of the criticisms i had heard turned out to be unwarranted .. <br /><br />As far as pure film - making technique goes , this director is competent . He 's held back by the limited budget and the VHS camera , but the actual editing , camera angles , camera movements and scene staging are pretty professional . i 've seen many movies where the " directing " was much worse . At least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and he has a few clever shots here and there . Also , the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere . There is only so much you can do with a VHS camera , and he does a nice job as far as the technicalities go . As far as artistic merit , there is none . The scene where the camera pans down so that we can watch a guy urinate in the woods for 15 seconds sort of epitomizes the artistic style of the whole film . This is pure trash ... Total garbage.<br /><br />The gore is decent for a film in this budget range . , it 's obviously fake but there 's lot 's of it , and it 's very outlandish .. <br /><br />I saw the American version with the intentionally campy dubbing . This was a good idea ( and it 's the only thing that allowed me to make it through the film ) ... Unfortunately , it 's overdone , especially towards the end.<br /><br />It 's really a terrible film , but i have to recommend it for it 's camp value . It 's really hard to find a movie that 's worse than this and that sort of puts it in a unique category .
0 Wow , not only is this film a " new lesson in real bad taste , " but also a lesson in " real bad film making . " Do n't get me wrong , I appreciated the concept of ' Zombie ' 90 : Extreme Pestilence , ' but at the same time one must realize when a movie is terrible . In case you missed out on the storyline , the plot of ' Zombie ' 90 ' is about a government plane carrying toxic chemicals that so happens to crash into the wilderness , causing the chemicals to spill , turning locals into hideous looking zombies . The next thing you know , zombies are all over the city eating people alive , while a goofy - looking doctor and a government agent are trying to figure out the disease that 's making these people eat one another - hence the name " Extreme Pestilence . " From then on , all we see is zombies having a field day on every local in sight - nothing but extreme and sickening disembowelments and dismemberments accompanied by endless buckets of guts and gore . Since this is a German film , the film had to be dubbed into English and when you 're not laughing at the feeding frenzies of the zombies , the voice - overs are quite hilarious and entertaining as well . As user UnratedX mentioned * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER * , there is a scene in the film that crosses the line between what 's acceptable and not acceptable , hence the scene in which a woman , who is carrying her infant baby , is being wheeled around in her wheelchair by some dude and a horde of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them . One zombie grabs the baby and rips it into pieces , eating its organs as you hear the baby crying . Wow , that is a new lesson in REALLLLLLLLLY bad taste . Atrocious I tell you , atrocious .
0 First , I am not really a fan of the whole " things eating flesh in disgusting new ways " genre of film but I am a bad movie afficionado so my next door neighbor said he had the worst movie ever . This one . So we start watching it . First and foremost - it is recorded on a camcorder sans tripod ! Second the voice of the skinny white doctor is dubbed by a large black man ! Third , none of the dialogue makes any sense . Fourth , the zombie scenes , though unconvincing and chockful of poor makeup and tomato paste , lead me to believe the director ( and my next door neighbor ) are in need of psychological help . It 's funny for about 5 minutes but it gets old fast . It 's so amateurish it 's like watching a poorly dubbed high school video yearbook .... with zombies . A note to anyone involved with this movie - I want the 20 minutes of my life I spent watching this , before I fell asleep , back .
0 This movie is god awful . Not one quality to this movie . You would think that the gore would be good but it sucks bad . The effects are worse and the acting if you can call it acting is the worst I 've ever seen . This movie was obviously shot on a camcorder and runs on a budget around 500 dollars probably . If you want to watch a good Zombie movie than watch Dawn of the dead or Day of the dead . If you want to watch a good cheap shot on video Zombie movie like this but way better than watch Redneck Zombies . Please avoid this movie at all costs . It is unwatchable and pointless . You 've been warned . I 've got nothing else to say about this stupid movie .
0 This really is one of the worst movies ever made . I consider myself a HUGE zombie film fan and usually tolerate bad acting , lame " special effects " a dumb story and whatever you may encounter in second rate movies , AS LONG as the film has a good atmosphere / story / suspension or whatever to offer . This one has basically no positive aspect to it and is third or fourth rate , maybe worse . Some friends of mine and myself made a small movie during a week´s holiday and definitely did a better job ( no zombie film though).<br /><br />This flick is not even funny , not speaking of anything else . Really bad and redundant special effects , zombies that look like normal people ( except for a white additional skin pulled over their faces ) , WAY TO MUCH fake blood ( I like realism a lot , the combination of realism and Zombie films being debatable , but the presented gore is just plain silly ) . The camera stays quite long with feedings scenes , it gets boring and you can not help but wonder , why the zombies use WEAPONS ( ! ) to kill their prey . I will not go into the details of the dubbing ( others have done so ) . Although I am from Germany myself and am at least a bit curious about the original version , I will NOT waste more of my time with this movie.<br /><br />Keep away from it , as far as you can .
0 A movie best summed up by the scene where a victim simulates disembowelment by pulling some poor animal 's intestines out from under her T - shirt . Too terrible for words .
0 I 've seen the original non - dubbed German version and I was surprised how bad this movie actually is . Thinking I had seen my share of bad movies like Ghoulies 2 , Rabid Grannies , Zombie Lake and such , nothing could 've prepared me for this ! It really was a pain to sit through this flick , as there 's no plot , no good acting and even the special effects are n't convincing , especially the so - called zombies , wearing nothing more than white make - up and their old clothes , so their good set would n't be ruined by ketchup and marmalade stains . < br /><br />If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life , then watch it , for all the others , do n't do it , because you WILL regret it !
0 Like some of the other folks who have reviewed this film , I was also waxing nostalgic about it ... before I had the misfortune to actually watch it again . Alas , my childhood memories of this film were completely untrustworthy , and The Perils of Pauline is now revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal , racist , and plain boring film - making . Even the presence of old pros Edward Everett Horton and Terry - Thomas ca n't overcome a rancid screenplay , a horrible theme song , and some wretched ' special effects ' . In addition , the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make for painful viewing , especially considering this was produced in the immediate wake of the Civil Rights movement . Michael Weldon 's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia reports that The Perils of Pauline was originally produced for television but inexplicably ended up getting a theatrical release . Judging from the results , that is a completely believable ( and baffling ) scenario .
0 While not exactly offensive , the 1967 version of " The Perils of Pauline " is certainly moronic . The title might lead you to expect a tribute to Pearl White ( the original Pauline in the 1914 silent 20 episode serial ) but for that you would be better served by the 1947 version starring Betty Hutton . This 1967 version is like a mix of " Casino Royale " and the weakest of the Elvis movies . Worst of all it is not a blend of these but more like someone scotch - taped together segments from each so that the thing skips back and forth between the two styles . < br /><br />What unity there is in the production comes from the pairing of Pamela Austin ( Pauline ) and Pat Boone ( George Steadman ) , a good match because both lack even the most basic of acting skills ( imagine Mandy Moore playing opposite Dan Quayle ) . < br /><br />Austin would later play opposite John Aston in " Evil Roy Slade " , with the talent disparity between them actually painful to watch . In the mid-60 's she was the " Dodge Rebellion " girl , as such she was featured in a similar series of perilous situations - imagine Sandra Dee in a dark blue jumpsuit . When the automaker 's ad agency replaced her with the " Dodge Fever " girl someone got the bright idea to showcase her in a feature film . < br /><br />What story there is here begins with Pauline growing up in the Baskerville Foundling Home run by the actress who played Mrs. Chatsworth Osborne Sr . on " Dobie Gillis " . George falls in love with her ( Pauline - not Mrs Osborne ) and sabotages several opportunities she has to be adopted . George leaves to seek his fortune and 19 year old Pauline gets a job tutoring a young oil rich Middle Eastern prince . When he tries to add the attractive blonde to his harem she runs away and goes from peril to peril . These include African pygmies , a 99½ year - old millionaire who wants to freeze her until his one year - old grandson is old enough for marriage , the movie industry , and the Russian space program.<br /><br />All this is intended to be silly and charming but manages only the silly part . There is some effort to incorporate a silent film look to the action sequences by simulating the under- cranking of a camera ( which speeds up the action ) . Unfortunately everything else ( film stock , production design , editing ) is depressingly 1960 's . Nothing here even approaches the images of Pearl White strapped to a log moving toward a buzz - saw or tied to railway track waiting for the approaching train.<br /><br />Then again , what do I know ? I 'm only a child .
0 I 've noticed how all the other reviews of this film mention how " wholesome " and " entertaining " it is . These people need to get out of the house more often . I do n't know why they 're shilling for this vapid , insipid , brainless piece of fluff . Pat Boone has absolutely no acting talent whatsoever , and his ineptness is exceeded only by that of his co - star Pamela Austin , a former model ( yet one more reason to outlaw the insidious practice of inflicting talentless models on an unsuspecting moveiegoing public , a foul habit that unfortunately persists to this day ) . A good supporting cast ( Terry - Thomas , Edward Everett Hortyon , among others ) tries hard to make some sense out of this , but to no avail . I noticed that two directors shared credit , although " credit " is n't the word I would use ( neither is " director " ) . As for " wholesome entertainment , " there are plenty of those types of movies available without torturing your loved ones by forcing them to sit through this . Find one of those films , and skip this one .
0 This is one of those films that 's more interesting to watch from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective . I do my ratings based on how much I enjoyed or was entertained by the movie , so I 'm giving it a 4 . If I were to rate it as an academic film , though , it would get a 10.<br /><br />It is shot in a very interesting manner , like a pseudo - silent film with elements of sound effect and reality . It 's meant to convey disjointed memory and fragmentation of the mind , and it is interesting in these respects.<br /><br />However , the film has a lot of disgusting elements to it that I did n't find all that entertaining . They 're mainly just disturbing . It has some very interesting imagery too , and some interesting concepts , but some of the character relationships ( especially between the mother and son ) are pretty disturbing.<br /><br />In all , this film will either appeal to you or it wo n't . For me , it was interesting from an academic perspective , but it was n't a good watch , and I 'll probably not go back to it a second time.<br /><br />4/10 if you 're looking for entertainment . 10/10 from an academic standpoint .
0 I should have never watched this movie . The style of filming may be considered artsy to some , but it is considered migraine - inducing to me . I think it may have had an interesting plot , but since I could n't watch it for long stretches at a time I missed a lot . The flickering pictures and stop motion filming branded my brain . I stopped watching mid way through and wo n't be back for a second try . I suppose if I were home alone in my own lighthouse some dark and stormy evening , this might be just the ticket ... PS Not sure if the lighthouse/ film style thing can be considered a spoiler , but I do n't want to be blacklisted on my first review ;)
0 I did n't know this was a silent movie with narration . I do n't care for silent movies - the corny humor , flickering lighting and film , etc . I 'm sure that attributes to the low score I assigned it . It was about chapter 8 before I found any interest in this story and had I had popcorn I may have thrown it at the screen . Maybe this appeals to the sci - fi crowd ? The only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant . I went with two other people on a Friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the entire theater . Isabella Rosselinni narrated this movie - the one enjoyable aspect of the movie . No one left commenting how much they enjoyed this nor appreciated the unusual approach to telling this story . I can not recommend this movie .
0 This is a wonderfully goofy example of a self produced , written and directed vanity project ... while I was working as a crew member John Carradine commented to me ( before the burning at the stake sequence ) : " This is the worst piece of sh*t I 've ever worked on ... and I 've worked on a lot of pieces of sh*t . " Also An interesting moment earlier when Jim Mitchum was having trouble with his lines and started cursing in the courtyard location of the Santuario ( a religious shrine in Chimayó ) - at which point one of the local " vato loco " low - rider onlookers growled " ... show some respect man " , which apparently caused Jim to remember where he was , as he then made a very profound and heartfelt apology for his inappropriate behavior . In any case the crew did the job on deferment and were never fully paid - but came away with plenty of particularly bizarre stories - like the night we caught the producer / director 's 10 year old son entertaining himself by constructing miniature Burmese tiger traps for us to break our legs in . Like they say : " Ya got ta ' love the Biz ... "
0 Hey HULU.com is playing the Elvira late night horror show on their site and this movie is their under the Name Monsteroid , good fun to watch Elvira comment on this Crappy movie .... Have Fun with bad movies . Anyways this movie really has very little value other than to see how bad the 70 's were for horror flicks Bad Effects , Bad Dialog , just bad movie making . Avoid this unless you want to laugh at it . While you are at HULU check out the other movies that are their right now there is 10 episodes and some are pretty decent movies with good plots and production and you can watch a lot of them in 480p as long as you have a decent speed connection .
0 Monster is a mind numbingly awful movie about an evil American concrete factory ( are there any else in Hollywood ? ) polluting the waters of the small Colombian town of Chimayo somehow creating a catfish - like beast with a predilection for lamb and loose women . James Mitchum is Bill Travis the man who is sent down to Chimayo by his foul - mouthed boss Barnes who himself ca n't keep his hands off of his secretary 's rear to get to the bottom ( pun intended ) of the story . While in Chimayo Bill must contend with an annoying reporter who apparently broadcasts all of her stories in perfect English directly back to America . I guess in the seventies there was a market for news from small South American towns . There is also a radical named Sanchez that wishes to sabotage the factory for polluting the water which , by the way , also supplies the town with jobs for the locals , but why let cold hearted economics get in the way of touchy - feely enviro - marxism . Pete the factory boss is unwittingly aided by the monster when he has sex with his ex - girlfriend on the beach , tells her that he is seeing the mayor 's daughter Juanita and it 's over between them , then she is promptly eaten that night . A little side action without the evidence . My hat is off to you Sir . John Carradine rounds out the cast as a priest that believes the monster is sent by God to punish sinners . You can see the contempt he has for being in this movie in his face . Might as well filmed him running to the local currency exchange to see if his check did n't bounce.<br /><br />Supposedly based on a true story , so much so they say it twice in the opening credits , this film is awful on all fronts . Filming began in 1971 and was abandoned until eight years later when Kenneth Hartford put his foot on the throat of Monster by adding his two annoying children as new characters , even putting his daughter , Andrea in top billing with Mitchum and Carradine . The sound quality is nonexistent and most of the scenes seem as if someone smeared tar over the camera before filming . This is made even more tedious during the many scenes done at night . The monster itself is laughable as it rears its ugly rubbery head for the anticlimactic ending . James Mitchum along with his brother Chris are proof that nepotism in the acting industry needs to be curtailed . Utterly unwatchable dreck . Shame on you John Carradine .
0 Tough guys , sexy women , lots of swearing , and a most unconvincing monster that rises from the depths of a polluted lake . You 'd think " Monster " would be fun ... but it is n't , really . It does star Tony Eisley and John Carradine , however , and in my book that makes it worth viewing at least once . In an interview with " Fangoria " in 1987 , Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had directed the bulk of the film , but somehow Kenneth Hartford -- who only directed the footage featuring his children Andrea and Glenn ( portraying characters named Andrea and Glenn , in a particularly inventive turn)--received full credit . Considering how awful the end result was , Strock was probably glad that he had n't been credited ! " Monster " has the look and feel of a mid - to - late - seventies TV movie , which is why I like to leave it on in the background every so often . As entertainment it falls flat on its face , but as a reminder of another age and a vanished type of film - making , it 's very effective . The only thing that 's missing is a car chase .
0 I could barely keep myself from either nodding off or just turning off this turd , but I decided to stick it out if only for the reasoning that maybe * something * would happen . This is the work of a writer / producer / director / special fx , Kenneth Herts , who wants to make a statement on ecological damage while making a monster movie . That 's what he wanted , anyway . What it turns out to be is a lot of acting , either slightly hammy or just mundane and without much merit , and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster ATTACKS in the river waters ( oh , and what luck , a woman just happens to be naked in it ... even though there have already been DISAPPEARANCES ! ) < br /><br />This is just nonsensical stuff , but I suppose it 's not too harmful ; it 's not very obnoxious at the least and once or twice we get a semi - interesting peek at Brazilian " culture " ( which is the father walking through town with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of ' hey , this is NOT America ! ' ) . But whatever hope the director had in casting Mitchum or Carradine is squandered on at best pedestrian and at worst excruciatingly banal and dumb dialog . It does n't help that when we finally get something of a good look at the monster and the " action " happens , it too is stupidly staged and with only sleazy appeal . Usually I would feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of problems getting a particular picture finished- in this case it took the better part of the mid 70s- but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever it 's called ... nah.<br /><br />If you happen to get the Elvira DVD double - feature of this ( bad print with bad transfer quality ) with Blue Sunshine , make sure to skip this one . Unless , of course , you 're an Elvira die - hard and ca n't help yourself to hear her luscious commentary ; personally , I 'd rather get Joel or Mike Nelson with the robots from Mystery Science Theater on this roast turkey .
0 " True " story of a late monster that appears when an American industrial plant begins polluting the waters . Amusing , though not really good , monster film has lots of people trying to get the monster and find out what s going on but not in a completely involving way . Give it points for giving us a giant monster that they clearly built to scale for some scenes but take some away in that it looks like a non threatening puppy . An amusing exploitation film that s enjoyably silly in the right frame of mind . ( My one complaint is that the print used on the Elvira release is so poor that it looks like a well worn video tape copy that was past its prime 20 years ago . )
0 This has got to be the cheesiest , stupidest , most retarded monster film of all time . It 's a complete joke that this even surfaced into theaters . This is sort of like watching the Loch Ness monster in rural America . This movie deserves to be thrown in a toilet and completely forgotten . John Carradine , shame on you . The people involved in this moronic pile of trash need to be lobotomized . Wait ! Maybe I 'm giving them too much credit . I 'm sure they were lobotomized before the filming . How else can one explain the utter and sheer stupidity that this bucket of crap contains . Do n't waste a minute of your life watching this . Do n't even waste your time sending a review .
0 This could be a cute movie for kids My grandson watched it once . he was watching it a second time I was watching some of it with him.<br /><br />When the little bear gets lost on the ice burg and he is in the water he is trying to get to a piece of ice it says " Come back stupid ass fool".<br /><br />I do n't want my 3 year old grandson watching movies with words like this in it.<br /><br />That is why its rated for children . Should be child friendly . That is what I would expect . put out by warner brothers and G rated I would expect this to not have cuss words in it . The words do n't even fit the movie in most places as it seems added later . And the movie drags out in many parts .
0 What a load of rubbish .. I ca n't even begin to describe how awful this film was . The rating it has here is really hard to believe.<br /><br />Avoid ... Particularly if you enjoyed the first ginger snaps . The first one was well written , well directed , well executed .. a brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere . The second one was ' alrite'- decent as a self - standing film , but clearly not up to the level of the first ... The third is an insult to the series , period . I rate the films : 10 , 6 , 1 . It 's that bad.<br /><br />Oh , and yes it really is set in the past , the sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... all muddled in with some half - assed native American mythology . The sisters do n't have any real story , or progression , or even a clear relationship ... They 're just trying to survive and be ' together forever ' . That 's about as deep as it gets.<br /><br />Staggered that the girls agreed to be in this pile - of - shite , after reading the script.<br /><br />Oh and another thing , staging of action was terrible- people appearing from nowhere regularly , like the girls turn around and there 's an elaborate candle - lit setup with a mystic native American woman just sitting there , about to go into a speech . Sets were terrible , could n't get away from the fact that it was all obviously based in a set , which really did n't help . Also , there was consistently snow outside the camp , but not a trace inside ( .. on the set).<br /><br />Arrghh , , , so bad ! I really was hoping it would be at least as good as the second one .
0 Am not familiar with the trilogy but came upon this film last night on Showtime . The film looked very well done with the set design and the cinematography , but the screenplay was stilted and wooden . The acting was fairly bad- thought the two female leads were serviceable . You never really believed anything the supporting actors said though . There were the stereotypes- bible - thumping Reverend without a hint of nuance , authoritative Captain , hot - headed soldier , etc . I am sorry to say that based on these deficiencies I clocked it straight away as Canadian without knowing it to be such - the Telefilm Canada end credits gave it away . I know I 'm a horrible person.<br /><br />Maybe I missed something in the beginning but the hostility towards the girls is never explained . Here they are besieged in a fort by werewolves and the men are wasting time and energy brutalizing two young women for no reason . FOCUS people . There 's a bit more of a pressing situation beyond your walls than whether or not these girls are lesbians - that 's just my inference for the hostility directed towards them . If they can aim and fire a gun you might as well make nice with them . The question of their " immortal soul " can be resolved later.<br /><br />Also , I guess this relates to the rest of the trilogy , these girls are supposed to be the protagonists ? One of them murdered the Indian guy at the end that saved one of their lives . I guess one is just a victim of her condition who ca n't be necessarily blamed for her actions , but the other is just a murderer who does n't deserve her happy ending .
0 For a good half hour or so , I remember myself thinking : " Hey , this could very well be Bill Rebane 's best achievement ever ! " . The opening sequences are atmospheric , there immediately are some scary moments to enjoy and our director even refers to his own notorious stinker " The Giant Spider Invasion " in a playful way . The concept is shamelessly stolen from William Castle 's " House on Haunted Hill " , with three old and extremely bored millionaires luring nine losers to an isolated mansion to win $ 1,000,000 in an elimination game . Naturally , the participants start vanishing quickly and one by one , and it takes the remaining greedy boneheads too much time before they realize either the old folks are sadists ... or there 's another murderer amongst them . The film begins & ends with an odd narrator telling a lot of senseless stuff that is n't relevant or even interesting to the plot , but there 's some nice T&A to admire in the first ten minutes and that dumb bimbo ( Shelly , I believe she 's called ) is really hilarious to observe . After the first half hour , naturally the inevitable happens and " The Cold " turns into a textbook Rebane - production with retarded plot twists , the dumbest dialogs ever and a total lack of excitement . There was n't any budget for bloody murder sequences but our multi - talented director ( ? ) tries to compensate this with endless footage of disco dancing girls and an amateur rock band . The film also has four or even five different climaxes and none of them are a slight bit satisfying . Maybe it was an inspiration for LOTR : Return of the King ? Avoid this film , you 'll live longer and happier .
0 This movie had what sounded like a good premise : 9 people facing their fears to win one million dollars . Unfortunately , it did not turn out to be a good movie . There are several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene . A few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts . The acting is bad , but some of the lines are amusing in their awfulness . What 's really strange is that towards the end of the movie it turns into like a 5 minute western , and at the end , the twists , of which their were several , do n't make sense with the rest of the movie . It seemed as though the director just added stuff on because he thought it would look cool , while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point . It just did n't make a lot of sense . The only creepy thing was the old people dancing down the hall , but that does n't even come close to making up for the rest of this mess .
0 This is one lowly film . It has no real plot . We never are made privy to motivations , other than wealth . The characters are some of the worst actors ever to be put on film . The threat seems to be supernatural , but then it 's being controlled by these three older people . Why are they doing what they are doing ; in order to strike fear into other members of the group ? I do n't know . There is some mist from a fog machine that rolls around in the halls and everyone seems to be scared of it . Does it do something ? I do n't know . There 's some nudity for its own sake . I 'm always surprised to see this in films this old . Things have actually settled down in this regard these days . Anyway , the people run around like chickens , ready for the ax . They have no plan ; no resources ; no nothing . There are about five silly climaxes in the film . Who are these people and " is " there a ghost or demon . What happened to the other people ? I challenge anyone to tell me this with any confidence . What a mess .
0 This is one strange hacked together film , you get the feeling that the bond company had to come in on this one , I 'm not surprised there 's no credits on it , who would want to be associated with this film . The Acting of all involved is terribly stilted and the plot jumps around all over , it all makes very little sense . As I said before it looks like the bond company had to come in because it seems like there was alot of footage that was n't shot that needed to be , and all the music was very ill - fitting library music ( cheap I guess ) . Very , very odd . I might actually buy a DVD of it though , if it could let me in on what the hell was going on , and what happened to this movie .
0 This complete mess of a movie was directed by Bill Rebane , the man partly responsible for the truly infamous anti - classic Monster a - Go Go . As I was nearing the end of The Cold I came to the unbelievable conclusion that this film was in fact even worse than that 60 's shocker . The story  such as it is  is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games . Whoever manages to last the pace and survive to the end will win $ 1,000,000 . It 's a very simple plot but Rebane still somehow manages to make proceedings verge on incomprehensible . Things happen . Characters are completely forgotten about . Nothing makes too much sense . And then it ends . Weirdly . I mean what the hell was that ending all about exactly ? I guess you are left to draw your own conclusions . Production values and acting are without question of a pornographic movie standard . In truth Pamela Rohleder ( Shelly ) is n't even that good . She is so unbelievably terrible she 's compelling . Sadly the same thing can not be said about this crap - fest as a whole , it 's just a bargain basement rotter .
0 A real head scratcher of a film by Bill Rebane who appeared to be getting worse in his trade throughout the eighties . Three crackpot millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a last person standing contest in which the final contestant will be given $ 1 million provided he or she makes it that far . A series of lame pranks are pulled on some of the guests while the others engage in what most adults would do under the circumstances namely get shatfaced at the hotel bar . Most scenes are merely an excuse to focus the camera on various female body parts including an opening dance number that is a crossover of American Bandstand meets geriatric aerobics complete with hookers . If there was any hesitation that white people ca n't dance this scene hammers the final nail in that coffin . Pay close attention for the nipple slip . This continues on for about forty - five minutes until Bill Rebane begins throwing darts at various plot twists and whatever he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene making this one incoherent mess . It 's a game until it 's not a game . The three old coots are in complete control until they 're not . The hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes just props . They 're dead until they 're not . Even the narrator at the end replies that he does n't know what the hell happened . I defy anyone to reason where Rebane was going on this one . The acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner . Most of the actors probably went back to their day jobs at the local Stuckey 's . I give it a few points for the scene where the yuppie broad opens the closet and a skeleton is inside skull humping himself . Let 's see Gone With the Wind do that ! This Chilling Classics collection is really becoming the bane of me . Bane , Get it ! Like Rebane ! I hate myself .
0 This God forsaken film is about three dumb millionaires who gather a bunch of people to play a deadly game , and the winner gets a million dollars . First of all , the acting is terrible , and the movie makes absolutely no sense at all . It is not scary in the least bit , it is so stupid that it made me laugh , which is why it earned that 1 star . The movie is not violent at all , but is pretty sleazy and focuses mostly on the women 's breasts the whole time , and some of the characters are very annoying and whiny . Plus , the monsters in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not scary that it just makes you want to throw something at the screen . Last , but not least the ending is terrible . I do n't want to give it away , in case you actually are strange enough to see this piece of junk . AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!!<br /><br />Not Rated ( But should be R ) for Nudity , Profanity , and Mild Gore .
0 To anyone not familiar with c . S. Forrester 's book this film should be interesting . It is colorful , well acted and depicts high adventure , but to those of us who know the original stories it is appalling . I could hardly sit through it.<br /><br />For some reason screen - writers seem compelled to rewrite the stories they are working on . Of course , the spoken word is different from the written word , and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film . But , why do the screen - writers rewrite the story instead of just adapting it ? In this case the writers out - did themselves.<br /><br />Just a few examples : There was no mutiny on the Renown . The officers did take over the ship after the half - insane Captain was driven completely mad when he fell through a hatchway -for reasons implied but never given . There was no court martial . The court of inquiry was conducted in an almost congratulatory atmosphere . Captain Pellew does not appear appear in this part of the Hornblower saga , nor does Col . Ortega 's wife . Hornblower , himself , was never in the brig either on the ship or on shore . There are plenty of such manipulations of Forrester 's story.<br /><br />On a purely technical basis , I think the film 's repeated use of the flash - back device hurts the continuity of the story.<br /><br />Why , oh why did screen - writers have to mess up a good story ?
0 < br /><br />As with the other episodes in this made - for - TV series expanding on the many adventures of the sea legend , Horatio Hornblower 's super human infallibility ruins all chance for suspense.<br /><br />As little Wesley Crusher ruined many seasons of THE NEXT GENERATION , Horatio Hornblower invincibly saves every situation . Each and every clever solution inevitably comes only from the lips of Horatio Hornblower . Immeasurably superior , Hornblower 's main trouble in this movie series seems to be tolerating the many error ridden characters above and below him in the chain of command . A perfect being makes for dull story telling . So superior is our hero , that even those who attempt to help him are powerless to do something correctly unless Hornblower is there to direct and control their every move.<br /><br />What is the sense in telling a story about any person who can not do wrong and will repeatedly win at everything every single time ? What is the point of watching such a story ?
0 Strange , almost all reviewers are highly positive about this movie . Is it because it 's from 1975 and has Chamberlain and Curtis in it and therefore forgive the by times very bad acting and childish ways of storytelling ? < br /><br />Maybe it 's because some people get sentimental about this film because they have read the book ? ( I have not read the book , but I do n't think that 's a problem , film makers never presume that the viewers have read the book ) . < br /><br />Or is it because I am subconsciously irritated about the fact that English - speaking actors try to behave as their French counterparts ?
0 What is this ? A low budget sex comedy ? Anyway it describes perfectly the people in Spain . They could come up with a better idea , I mean they do this kind of movies since the 60s .. and people like them ! This is neither a teen comedy nor a family one ( you ca n't let your 12 year old watch 2 guys in bed kissing , he 'll never want to go to Spain ) . This should be rated " R " , because only people 35 + seem to laugh watching : S I 'm truly disappointed , maybe I do n't like gays ( which is quite an important part of the movie).<br /><br />Foreign humor is awful in films ( except Kusturica ) , stick with doing dramas ! If you want a new comedy try Talladega Nights
0 My giving this a score of 3 is NOT what I would give the original Soviet version of this film . It seems that American - International ( a studio that specialized in ultra - low - budget fare in the 60s ) bought this film and utterly destroyed it -- slicing a two hour plus film into a 64 minute film ! Plus , much of this 64 minutes was new material ( such as the " monsters")--so you know that this film bears almost no similarity to the original . The original film appears to be a rather straight drama about the Soviet conquest of space -- though I really am not sure what it was originally ! For insight into the original film , read Steven Nyland 's review -- it was very helpful.<br /><br />By the way , this was the third Soviet sci - film I 've seen that American - International bought and then hacked apart to make a " new " film -- standard practice to a company that was willing to put just about anything on the screen to make a buck -- provided , of course , it did n't cost them much more than a buck in the first place ! ! This Americanized film was about two rival world powers ( NOT the US and Soviets ) trying to be the first to Mars . The tricky " bad guys " try but fail and the " good guys " rescue one of the idiot astronauts and then head to Mars . Unfortunately , they are temporarily stranded on a moon of Mars where they see some monsters ( added by American - International ) that are REAAAALLY cheesy and one does bear similarity to a certain part of a female 's anatomy . Then , they are rescued -- returning to Earth heroes.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the film was butchered -- turning an incredibly beautiful piece of art ( for the time ) being turned into a grade - C movie . Because of this , the Soviets really had a reason to hate America ! I 'm just shocked that the horrible job A - I did with this film did n't convince them to refuse to sell more films to these jerks ! It 's worth a look for a laugh , but the really bad moments that make you laugh are few and far between . So , the film is a dud -- not bad enough to make it a must - see for bad movie buffs and too dopey to be taken seriously . I would really love to see this movie in its original form -- it must have been some picture .
0 Considering John Doe apparently inspired Kyle XY 's creator I was expecting its pilot to be quite interesting . However I probably had too high expectations because I was quite disappointed by it . First they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience , in a public area . So after that scene I began to worry that it was just entertainment . But the problem is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced . They focused too much on John Doe which made the story far less intriguing . I was also slightly disappointed by Dominic Purcell 's performance because I found he did n't make a believable John Doe . An other problem was the police story . It really felt like déjà vu and it was n't a pleasant sensation . It leads us to the worst issue in the bunch , the episodic format . I could already see the fillers coming one after an other.<br /><br />So overall I was very disappointed by it and do n't recommend it to anyone . Considering how bad it was I better understand now why the show got canceled . In some way I have the impression that it missed its target , developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity . It 's sad because there was potential , like the people he met at the club . The production quality was also quite good and the casting correct . But I 'll never know if it got better , probably not , because I do n't plan to watch the next episode .
0 After a series of power - outages on a remote island zoo , genetically engineered sabertooth tigers are on the loose and mauling residents of the island . Man , the sci - fi channel has made some bad " original " movies , but I think this might possibly be their worst so far ! This badly written and directed " Jurassic Park " rip - off offers all the usual clichés ( mad scientists who thinks people killed by the monsters are " expendable losses " , characters walking down long dark hallways alone , brain - dead teen characters who 's only function in the film is to die a horrible death , etc . ) , and , unsurprisingly , no suspense whatsoever . The special effects are atrociousthe puppet heads in close - ups of the title beasties are bad enough , looking like stiff plush dolls , but the CGIwhich makes the computer - generated dinosaurs in " Walking with Dinosaurs " look life - like by comparisonare just downright awful . There 's some gore , but most of it looks pretty unconvincing . Oh , and the death scene of the scientist at the end is truly one of the worst things I 've seen in years . I could n't even laugh it was so bad!<br /><br />Don't waste your time , this one is just downright bad.<br /><br />2/10 . < br /><br />Oh , and here 's some interesting trivia for youthis film borrowed music cues from the 2003 sci - fi film " Alien Hunter " , which was far superior to this piece of crap .
0 In the Fiji islands , the greedy and unscrupulous owner of the Valalola Resort Primal Park invites investors and guests for an opening party of his compound composed of hotel and zoo aiming to find partners for his discoveries . When a bunch of college smalltime thieves puts a virus in the security system to participate in a scavenger hunt , the greatest attractions of the zoo  sabretoothes from the prehistoric age developed from DNA found in fossils  escape , killing the hosts and guards for pleasure.<br /><br />The incredibly lame and cheap " Attack of the Sabretooth " is one of the worst movies I have recently seen . The characters are awful and not funny or pleasant and the story is a terrible Jurassik Park rip - off with a bad collection of clichés . Basically all the lines and situations are poor and stupid , but the winner is when the guard explains that the sabretoothes are bulimic and like to kill for pleasure . My vote is three.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " O Ataque do Dente de Sabre " ( " The Attack of the Sabretooth " )
0 The film starts with a manager ( Nicholas Bell ) giving welcome investors ( Robert Carradine ) to Primal Park . A secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized DNA , like ¨Jurassik Park¨ , and some scientists resurrect one of nature 's most fearsome predators , the Sabretooth tiger or Smilodon . Scientific ambition turns deadly , however , and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey - the human visitors , tourists and scientific . Meanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre - historical animals which are deadlier and bigger . In addition , a security agent ( Stacy Haiduk ) and her mate ( Brian Wimmer ) fight hardly against the carnivorous Smilodons . The Sabretooths , themselves , of course , are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing . The giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one nature 's most fearsome predators . Furthermore a third Sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victims.<br /><br />The movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading , hair - raising chills , full of scares when the Sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects . The story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring .The giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy .Middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food . Actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts , running , bound and leaps or dangling over walls . And it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene . No for small kids by realistic , gory and violent attack scenes . Other films about Sabretooths or Smilodon are the following : ¨Sabretooth(2002)¨by James R Hickox with Vanessa Angel , David Keith and John Rhys Davies and the much better ¨10.000 BC(2006)¨ by Roland Emmerich with with Steven Strait , Cliff Curtis and Camilla Belle . This motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by George Miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films . Miller is an Australian director usually working for television ( Tidal wave , Journey to the center of the earth , and many others ) and occasionally for cinema ( The man from Snowy river , Zeus and Roxanne , Robinson Crusoe ) . Rating : Below average , bottom of barrel .
0 this movie had a lot of blood in it when the sabretooth attack it also i loved it when that guy and the women were having some good time and then the sabretooth attacked the women and ate her stomach and took the liver out . that was the best and the 1ton sabretooth walking on its front legs hilarious to make this movie better more action and less talking if you know what i mean and also please please people who made this movie do n't make anothwer movie like this movies ending cause it was terrible 1 sabretooth alive and killed that women in the end this movie reminds me of the grudges ending always there 's 1 enemy left ! OK damn it this movie sucks i can ' t believe it i loved it when my lil bro got freaked from the attacks stomach takin out and the blood ya
0 I have a piece of advice for the people who made this movie too , if you 're gon na make a movie like this be sure you got the f / x to back it up . Also do n't get a bunch of z list actors to play in it . Another thing , just about all of us have seen Jurassic Park , so do n't blatantly copy it . All in all this movie sucked , f / x sucked , acting sucked , story unoriginal . Let 's talk about the acting for just a second , the Carradine guy who 's career peaked in 1984 when he did " Revenge of the Nerds " ( which was actually a great comedy ) . He 's not exactly z list , he can act . He just should have said no to this s -- t bag . He should have did what Mark Hamill did after " Return of the Jedi " and go quietly into the night . He made his mark as a " Nerd " and that should have been that . I understand he has bills to pay , but that hardly excuses this s -- t bag . Have I called this movie that yet ? O.K. I just wanted to be sure . If I sound a little hostile , I apologize . I just wasted 2hrs of my life I could have spent doing something productive like watching paint peel , and I feel cheated . I 'll close on that note . Thank you for your time .
0 I remember watching ATTACK when it first came out and caught it again recently . The sci fi channel has run worse , but not by much . A shameless ripoff of Jurassic Park , ATTACK substitutes sabertooth cats for dinosaurs . And they are on the loose , devouring as many extras as possible . The CGI is pretty bad , and closeups of prosthetic cat heads are laughable . We get some gore , which helps a little . Wait until you see how the mad scientist who started this whole mess gets it . Other than Robert Carradine , who has very little to do , the cast is unknown . Apparently this was shot in Fiji . Nice work if you can get it . Reminds me of all those low - budget monster STVs that were popular in the 80s and 90s .
0 Three giant sabretooth tigers( .. created in a laboratory from mitochondrial DNA , a " genetic breakthrough " derived from fossil material)are on the rampage accidentally set free through a series of events(such as a computer geek 's introduced virus in order to unlock security measures keeping the resort novelty shops closed during construction & a security guard 's leaving a gate open while searching for the missing page from a porn mag that flew away in the breeze)that threaten the lives of those it comes in contact with . The tigers are always hungry , but are unable to digest what they eat . So pretty much the tigers just rip their prey to shreds . Victims include a group of college kids( .. the stereotypes include a goth girl , jock and tech nerd ) , security personnel , and those somewhat developed rich scoundrels who we can easily despise and wish horrible death.<br /><br />Rounding out a series of bad sci - fi channel flicks , Attack of the Sabretooth has some of the most wretched computer simulated animals I 've seen yet . And , the final death sequence is so putridly presented , you 'll demand within the deepest recesses of your soul the time spent on this truly awful exercise in the creature feature canon . There 's some good dark humor deriving from heads being torn from necks , but even here the prosthetic work is unconvincing . Prosthetic body parts and blood aplenty as victims are pounced upon , crying for help and receiving none . I 'm starting to sound like a broken record , repeating myself in every user comment I write for these sci - fi channel flicks . I think maybe it 's time to move on to other kinds of cinema . Robert Carradine has a role as a ruthless businessman who is being wooed by his truly repellent ex - brother - in - law , Nicholas Bell , the one opening " Primal Park " , a resort / zoo featuring genetically created sabretooth tigers as it 's major attraction . Stacy Haiduk , still quite yummy , is a security officer who attempts to convince Bell to get the investors he hopes to goad into putting money in his multi - million dollar project to leave the island . Brian Wimmer is Haiduck 's lover and his role is a mechanic keeping operations running smoothly.<br /><br />Bell 's fate at the end , resulting from a dislodged tooth from a sabretooth tiger statue is the pits . Carradine spends a great deal of the film taunting Bell , his arch nemesis . The tiger 's point - of - view shows humans in a bright color as it moves towards them . The film ultimately consists of characters walking through darkened corridors( .. the tech nerd 's virus cut off the power)worried for their safety . The college kids commit breaking and entering to score certain items needed( .. it 's a scavenger hunt type of activity)to enter a fraternity / sorority . The cast playing these kids do not rise above their clichés .
0 Spoilers will be in this . The movie could have been better if they had just had a different script , director , and CGI provider . Not much right ? The movie has a man starting his own theme park ... err ... zoo on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs ... err ... Sabretooths and it is called Jurra ... oops ... Primal Park . I do not mind rip - offs , because there are no original ideas for these kind of movies , but this one just slaps you in the face with it , R e p e a t e d l y . There is even the " creature 's shadowed head on the design " thing . The Sabretooths , that are not sabretooths according to Mr. Primal Park ( Just ancient killing cats ) , Are rather junky but the crowning accomplishment is the one I call " Sloggy " . Because , after disposing of one big cat , a hero is relaxing a little because there is only one left . Enter the weird feeding guy who says , Nah , we made three , the third being a monster who pulls itself around with its front feet . Great , groovy . A group of college students are also on the island for a scavenger hunt , there test to get into their cliques frat or sort ( Always thought that needed a short nickname ) . Out of the ones who do live , only one has completed their task , so I got a kick out of that . Oh yeah , the mandatory " Evil Capitalist Must Die " Clique is in force with not one , but two of them ! Mr. Primal Park 's death is the most laughable thing you will see in one of these movies as a Sabretooth statue 's tooth jars loose ( Courtesy of Sloggy ) , shrinks a few sizes , and impales the man through the throat . If I had only gotten away so easy . I like " Sabretooth " better than this spin - off .
0 Everything about this film is hog wash . Pitiful acting , awful dialog , ugly native girls . this movie sinks into oblivion ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The director must have been a weekend bender . Robert C. is totally lost and has not got a clue on what is going on . The college kids are worst . No acting talent at all , very stupid reasoning , and just down right dumbbells . Special effects are for the birds . The so called security force around this park belongs in toy land : with stupid looking guns , walkie talkies that are useless ; and a computer system that ranks with a roll of toilet paper . if the park is under construction and nothing works ; why bother inviting potential clients until everything is complete . the writers should be the first victims of the mess along with the producers and the crew . The whole film belongs in a septic tank shot to another planet for viewing . What a gem . Convicts should have to watch this , so they can commit suicide .
0 The film is about a sabretooth on the lose at a amusement park where teens are on a scavenger hunt . Since there are no rules they break into a building and start getting killed off . The deaths are cheesy and are dumb . But at least it had better effects then sabretooth . I gave it a three because Stacy was in it and I loved the movie Sabretooth . I thought it was okay but some deaths were off - screen . There was a dumb scene where the two teens kiss and the sabretooth 's head pops out and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind leaving her to have her totally fake looking red guts out . Then the sabretooth gets up in the vents and bites the kids head off . The end death with the owner was totally fake looking graphics . Even that death was stupid because the statues tooth went through his mouth and hangs there like that will support it and there is a scene when a goth girl loses her contacts does n't find them , and seems like she does n't need the . The film is idiotic and a waste of time .
0 First , the CGI in this movie was horrible . I watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the SciFi channel . At the end when the owner of the park gets killed , it 's probably one of the worst examples of CGI I have even seen . Even Night of the Living Dead had better animation.<br /><br />That said , the movie had almost no plot . Why were they on that island in particular ? Well , it was n't stated in the movie . And , why would the people keep coming into the cat 's area ? Makes no sense.<br /><br />One thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting . In what could be called a " B made for TV movie " movie , the acting was very good . Parry Shen stood out in particular.<br /><br />If you have absolutely nothing to do on a Saturday , watch this movie . It may be good for some memorable quotes .
0 This movie was the worst movie ever made on the planet , I like BARNEY more than this movie . The graphics suck , half the movie is animated , the deaths suck , and over all , I was ready to SUE the people that made this movie!PLEASE DO NOT WASTE HOURS OF YOUR LIFE WATCHING THIS MOVIE . The only good part was when the movie * * * * * * * ended ! This movie is 50 percent Jurassic park , .1 percent Sabretooth , and 49.9 percent DUMB ! Please do not waste your time watching this movie , you will regret it . You want to know why this movie sucks ? Well , the cover sucked , the graphics sucked , the blood looked ( I mean is ) ketchup , the people tried to blow themselves up , the college students think there all that and can stand up to the animal . I mean , there was a 5 ft . tiger running straight at a woman , she throws a spear at it from 100 ft away ! WAIT TILL YOU CAN Actually HIT IT ! The acting was horrible too . Jurrasic Park is actually a good movie , and this just had to go and ruin it .
0 This movie should have NEVER been made . From the poorly done animation , to the beyond bad acting . I am not sure at what point the people behind this movie said " Ok , looks good ! Lets do it ! " I was in awe of how truly horrid this movie was . At one point , which very may well have been the WORST point , a computer generated Saber Tooth of gold falls from the roof stabbing the idiot creator of the cats in the mouth ... uh , ooookkkk . The villain of the movie was a paralyzed sabretooth that was killed within minutes of its first appearance . The other two manages to kill a handful of people prior to being burned and gunned down . Then , there is a random one awaiting victims in the jungle ... which scares me for one sole reason . Will there be a Part Two ? God , for the sake of humans everywhere I hope not.<br /><br />This movie was pure garbage . From the power point esquire credits to the slide show ending .
0 This movie was pretty bad . Sci - fi is usually my favorite channel so I watch all the original movies that play on it . I really do n't know if this movie can be called original . Starting a zoo / theme park on a remote island sounds pretty familiar . What was it , oh yeah , Jurassic Park . But this has Sabertooth tigers instead.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a few stereotypical college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt . One of them ends up dieing a rather gruesome death with some of the worst special effects I 've seen . The blood looked a lot like ketchup . Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber tooth tigers as possible for people to enjoy . 3 of them have already escaped and are going around eating the tourists , or the people invited to the island to see the tigers first hand . Again , sound like Jurassic Park . Probably the coolest thing was the 1000 lb saber tooth who crawled around on his front legs killing the mad scientist with a tooth statue of sorts that somehow shrinks and goes through the guys neck . Funniest death I 've seen on TV.<br /><br />The acting is extremely cheesy , the special effects are horrible . The CG tigers could almost pass for clay models , and even some of the sounds were off . For instance , when one of the college students is trying to escape , he uses an ax to break down a door , the ax goes into the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound . This movie was pretty bad . The cheesy deaths were quite funny though .
0 Just the fact that the cover is a drawing , like those old B - movies should give you a warning about the quality of this movie . This is , however not a B - movie . It is a D - movie ! < br /><br />There are no known actors , and the animals - WOW - it is the worst data - animation ever made during the last two decades . < br /><br />You hardly ever see the SCAAARY sabretooth shown on the front cover . You just hear people scream , bleed and die and you occasionally see a teeth or a tiger - paw . It 's so amateur ! Maybee worth seeing , just because it 's so bad . Give it to a friend and say : " This is the best movie I have ever seen , and wait for their reaction " He , he . < br /><br />The movie is to weak to give it a Spoiler Alert ! THIS IS A SPOILER .
0 Literally every aspect of this science - fiction low - budget flick falls under the categories that have been classified for its predecessors , contemporaries , and those to follow . Bad special effects , a weak storyline , ridiculous amounts of blood and gore , annoying and pointless characters , all that you can expect . " Attack of the Sabretooth " is about a new vacation resort where the proprietors are genetically engineering Smilodon cats for an attraction . The cats escape and begin to kill people , the guy running the show wants to save them and not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them , and there is a band of visitors and some employees who rebel and plan to kill the cats.<br /><br />Special effects - wise , the film is about an average achievement given its budget . The sabretooths are portrayed through poor CGI . Amazingly , though , the cats look more realistic in an up - close , detailed shot rather than the longer , more distant shots where the CGI is better concealed . Their attacks are recklessly bloody and distasteful . Just as you 'd expect , they attack , rip off some arms and legs , and leave very little behind . This is part of the reason why the film descends into poor schlock.<br /><br />The plot and characters are just as horrendous . We have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a scavenger hunt . And take it very , VERY seriously . Even so much as to trespass on private property , tamper with security systems , and steal . Why are they taking a simple game so seriously ? Did I miss something ? Was there money involved ? Or were they sent to do it ? I do n't know , I could barely follow the film . But it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun of doing it . Even so , they went too far for normal.<br /><br />"Attack of the Sabretooth " is a very poor film . Even for a low - budget sci - fi flick , it is a very poor and cheap example . It will bore most viewers to tears , might be attractive for some , and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through . And keep in mind , this is not a comedy , this is a cheap horror flick , so it 's not suppose to be comical .
0 Where to begin ? the special effects should be named special defects , When the director shouted " action " I guess he also indicated to the actors to carry out the worst performance they could think of . Maybe he was annoyed with the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not recover a single cent out of their investment and that the work would be a case study of how not to make movie . Or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an accountant but his family did not let him.<br /><br />The only thing that is sure that whoever employs him in the future is because its in love with him ( so its objectivity jumped through the window ) or because he changed its name and deleted all past previous references .
0 Well this movie actually made me feel so strongly that I signed up for an IMDb account just to warn people . It is patently AWFUL ! ! NOTHING makes sense in this movie . There is way too many subplots for a start . Josh Hartnett 's character is an aspiring actor and yoga instructor as well as a cop who seems to be living way beyond his means and only teaches yoga to hot girls ( Some of whom wait naked in his jacuzzi for when he comes back from work ) . Add to that the fact that his dad was killed by a crooked cop who just so happens to be in on the current crime being investigated by the hapless duo . Harrison Ford 's character is trying to sell real estate on the side and is sleeping with the Internal Affairs investigator 's ex - wife who happens to run a psychic radio show which Ford 's character calls from time to time . NONSENSE!!<br /><br />I ca n't remember the characters names ( that 's how forgettable this is ) so I 'll refer to them as Ford and Hartnett.<br /><br />Then there 's the dialogue which is brutal . I mean cringe - inducing stuff here . Throw in every cliché in the book ( having a heart - to - heart in a dark bar during the day over a drink where the bartender knows his name ; the duo being investigated by internal affairs ( why ? ? ) ; hartnett confronting his dad 's killer ) and you 've got one hell of a mess.<br /><br />As I mentioned the plot is preposterous and continuity is non - existent : 1 ) When Ford 's car is being repossessed , how the hell did the repo guys know where it would be parked ? Were they following him ? ? 2 ) When Hartnett goes to the morgue and it just so happens that the only clue from the crime scene ( an earring ) is replicated on of the charred bodies there ( that was lucky ! ) 3 ) When the two are arrested and taken in for questioning - Ford keeps answering his phone and Hartnett " centers himself " with a yoga pose on the table . Instead of taking the phone from Ford the IA guy waits for it to ring each time and then tries to grab it off the table before Ford does . Meanwhile the female IA officer in with Hartnett is rubbing herself all over him . Then , inexplicably , the two are released without answering any questions . 4 ) During the car chase Hartnett 's car is crashing and smashing its way around Hollywood but then suddenly the car is perfect again . Not a scratch ! 5 ) When Ford chases the bad guy into the building and he gets in the elevator how the hell does he know which floor the bad guy got off at ? ? 6 ) When the two are chasing the bad guy around in hartnett 's car , Ford is trying to close a real estate deal . Come on ! 7 ) The bad guy is the most unconvincing record exec ever . His motivation for killing an aspiring group of rappers on his label ? They might leave his label and it 's a warning to keep his other groups loyal . But hang on , how is he ever going to sign anyone new with that business plan ? ? 8) Why is the IA guy who is investigating Ford arrested in the end ? There is no explication ! ! 9 ) And Hartnett gets to use his " acting " to capture the bad guy in the end.<br /><br />I could go on , I really could . Anyone who is looking deeper into this movie than a straight up action comedy needs their head examined because that 's all it is . There 's nothing else to it ! It 's not supposed to be satirical or ironic . It 's just crap .
0 This film was one of the worst I 've seen in a long while . < br /><br />It 's a combination police drama and comedy about two Hollywood detectives , Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett , investigating a shootout at a hip hop club . < br /><br />The plot is contrived and there are way too many side issues going on . Ford is hustling real estate on the side ( Martin Landau is one of his clients ) , Hartnett runs a yoga school where he 's hustling chicks in his spare time , the two are under investigation by Internal Affairs , Ford is screwing the ex - girlfriend ( Lena Olin ) of the IA investigator and she 's a psychic who has a radio show , the man who set up the killing at the club is a dirty ex - cop who shot Hartnett 's father years ago.<br /><br />Toss in the obligatory car chases and some lame attempts at humor , and that 's about the gist of this turkey .
0 Lame movie . Completely uninteresting . No chemistry at all between Indiana Jones and the guy from Black Hawk Down . The car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad nauseum . They manage to switch vehicles a few times , but always end up right on the tail of the baddies . The scene where Hartnett grabs the family 's car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be . He is telling them about Eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die , which I imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty . It just came off as moronic , totally unbelievable and even cruel.<br /><br />Some subplots were n't even explored , they were just used as filler . Why does Hartnett get sick seeing dead bodies yet keeps ordering burgers at crime scenes ? Why , and on what grounds , is the bad IA guy suddenly arrested out of the blue by the chief ? Why can IA pick up the buddy cops and then just let them answer their phones or pretend to be Indian mystics and then just let them waltz out of there without so much as a slap on the wrist ? For some reason , even though Ford is uncovered as a cheat and a fraud when acting as a realtor , ( he makes up the prices when he is trying to sell the producer 's house to jack up his own commission ) , they keep coming back to him anyway ! They knew he lied to both of them ! Yet there they were , coming to terms that both said they would never go for . Stupid , just stupid . This is also one of those cop movies where they just fire wantonly on public streets with no care in the world for innocent bystanders . There they were , just standing on the sidewalk blasting away while people ducked for cover . Amazing that they did n't hit a single person after having fired about 60 rounds each .... <br /><br />The scriptwriting was terrible , the action sequences were boring , the plot just a sidestory to a very pathetic attempt to have us root for Ford and Hartnett . It fails miserably . And Ford 's phone ! Turn the damn thing off ! How many times could it ring in a 2-hour movie ? 50 ? 60 ? It was frustratingly aggravating by the midpoint in the movie ! Every 30 seconds , that stupid tune would play ! And if it was n't Ford 's , then Hartnett 's was ringing ! It was incredibly annoying!<br /><br />Complete waste of time , Ford 's worst movie since 6 Days 7 Nights , which was without a doubt , the lowest point of his distinguished career .
0 Josh Hartnett 's dead eyes , the thick writing of it , and Harrison Ford being in a buddy - cop comedy ! Here 's 3 reasons to hate it , avoid it , and to utilize 116 minutes of your life better.<br /><br />The buddy - cop movies are fun . However their real golden age was back in the 1980s and the 1990s . Making one that tries to mix action and comedy through the police of Hollywood itself is sure a good idea but the final result of that turned out to be not at least a spoof of the subgenre but a reason to ask God to have mercy upon all the past movies of the same kind whereas the worst of them was by all means greater than ( Hollywood Homicide).<br /><br />What really did happen to this entertaining formula ? ! Since a whole decade the things had n't been the same . You 'd have a buddy - action stubborn flop after another . I 'll delight you with some titles to catch on the disaster well : ( I Spy - 2002 ) , ( National Security - 2003 ) , ( Taxi - 2004 ) , ( Starsky & Hutch - 2004 ) , and the worst of them all yet ( Miami Vice - 2006 ) ! < br /><br />I believe one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many similar cinematic flicks and TV shows during 2 decades already . Add to that , particularly here , the negligent dealing and the dull humor . Actually the matter this time is totally unbearable . Yes , we 've got the characters of 2 loyal cops who have second jobs , and the background of sinful city , but what else was new ? ! It 's not about cliché ; it 's about few renewals mixed with clichés where both have been badly made.<br /><br />The acting , especially from ( Hartnett ) 's side , is terrible . This guy is anything but a comedian ( or actor ! ) . So his character was wanting to revenge for his father 's death ! Revenge on yourself man , he probably died out of watching your acting ! ! . Even the small roles got people that have nothing to do with comedy ( or that 's what they seemed here anyhow ! ) .<br /><br />The directing fails in presenting something that comic or that harsh , some parts managed to be highly dull ( arresting the black guy through the lack ? ? ) ; it 's a rare time to be boring in what supposed to be action / comedy ! They did n't utilize Hollywood itself whether as an ironic place where there is ugly face behind the superficial charm , or even as a place which 's full of shining or fallen stars ( cameos that could 've given it few interesting moments).<br /><br />It 's a very easy movie that relayed on being watchable by only its stars ' glamour , and as being a Buddy - cop movie to end up as one of the worst cases of 2 stars with non - chemistry on the screen ( one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself ! Guess who ? ! ) , and a Buddy - Cop destroyer more than movie ! God , do n't make me , or my children , live enough to witness ( Hollywood Homicide  Part 2 ) ! At last , look at Harrison Ford 's performance , he wanted to have a good time , but at least we did n't .
0 This film actually manages to be mindless enjoyment for 2/3 of the journey . Sadly , the film ends up being too ' confused . ' While I know some of the plot contrivances are standard of ' buddy cop ' films I got drawn in to the characters who foil each other brilliantly but in the end the film relies too much on chase sequences as a crutch and I lost interest.<br /><br />The filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we got to see who they are and identified with both cops early on . We formed our own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant bickering.<br /><br />In the end there is too much going on and it detracts greatly from what could 've been an enjoyable piece of escapism . Here 's what 's concerning Joe Gavilan ( Harrison Ford ) at the end of the film:<br /><br />1 . His real estate deals 2 . His affair with a radio psychic 3 . He 's being investigated by internal affairs 4 . The homicide investigation < br /><br />If you add in Casey 's concerns you fond out he wants to be an actor and avenge his father 's death . Now some of these things do come together and even come together well but all the plot elements come together amidst this bogus chase that is so long and pathetic that I hardly have time to break my ennui and give a crap about what just happen . The impressive screenwriting acrobatics can not overcome the bad filmmaking.<br /><br />As if a ridiculous chase sequence was n't bad enough , one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour , was n't bad enough , Joe Gavilan fields calls about his real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun . All these extra - curricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether or not the criminal gets caught . We already forgot or no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plot - lines and eye candy of the chases have numbed us beyond all comprehension.<br /><br />While I could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story , I wo n't . This could 've been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its britches and it turned into a redundant waste of time . Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually did rather well and a small appearance by Gladys Knight is worth noting . Sadly none of the actors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettable.<br /><br />While this will probably be better than the likes of " The Hulk " and " Lara Croft II " that still does n't make this film good . I once heard that Harrison Ford claimed to only make films that eh thought would make money , I 'm not sure if that 's true or not . What is true is that to get great box office you do n't need a great movie or a great actor , this film has neither in its lead roles . My advice to Harrison Ford would be : to stick to Indiana Jones because at least you can still run .
0 Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he made great movies ? Those days are feeling like a more and more distant memory.<br /><br />While " Hollywood Homicide " is by no means terrible , it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy cop movie . It 's a comedy that 's not particularly funny , and an action movie that 's not especially exciting . An overabundance of subplots can not mask the weakest of the central storyline.<br /><br />Ford at least appears to be enjoying himself more than is his last few projects , and he is able to carry the film most of the time . Hartnett is adequate , but he and Ford are n't exactly Newman and Redford as far as chemistry is concerned.<br /><br />All in all , " Hollywood Homicide " is a reasonably amusing diversion , but just barely . Take out Ford , and it 's not even that .
0 The movie was " OK " . Not bad , not good , just OK . If there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far . Sadly , Fast and Furious 2 also stunk , but I 'd rather see this than FF2 . :) If you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk , this will be a " cute " movie for you . Personally , I 'd wait for HBO or Blockbuster .
0 Who in the world told Harrison Ford that this was a good role for him???<br /><br />And Josh Hartnett ... how does a 19 year old who ca n't fire a gun become a cop ? Over used cliches plus zero character development and about 15 pointless music industry cameos equal a surprisingly bad film ! ! !
0 Journey to the Center of the Earth is the story of some tourists of Hawaii , three of them siblings , and one of them a young British nanny babysitting a dog . When the siblings accidentally drive off in their jeep with the basket of dog biscuits , the nanny follows them ( it might 've just been safer to purchase more ) all the way to the cave the siblings intended to explore ( I guess ) . For some reason , they actually go in the cave and then , when the place starts caving in , they try to get out to no avail , except for the six - year - old sister who they tell to go get help . Meanwhile , the more they move around in the cave , the more they continue to plummet further and further towards the earths cavernous core . And behold , it is here where they find the City of Atlantis and its bizarre alien habitants who are living under the oppressive rule of one alien that does n't want them asking to many questions about the worlds external to their own.<br /><br />I see that Rusty Lemorande , the named director of the film has provided comments on this film , in which he explains that part of latter half of this film is actually the sequel to Alien in L.A. Well , whatever it was , it was an amazingly cheap movie that I would rank only slightly higher than City Limits ( a 1988 sci - fi film also made on a non - existent budget ) because at the least ending of this dreadful piece of mostly incoherent film - making that cuts corners where it can aims for some humor and amusement in the last 20 minutes when we finally see what life is like in the alien world at the center of the Earth . I also give it a two star rating rather than one because it was at times , funny , even if only in its subtleties . For example , the aliens asks the British girl if she 's an alien and she explains that the Ministry should be sending her work visa shortly . Or when the alien girl finds Bryan and explains that he is in the city of Altantis and he mistakes this for Atlantic City , New Jersey . Little things like that make the idiocy of the first hour or so tolerable . Imagine how great the film could 've been though if they had 1 ) actually intended to make it , and 2 ) actually had money to make it.<br /><br />I do like how in the end , no one wonders what happened to the little sister who was sent away in the beginning to get help . She 'd just be wandering around the Hawaiian caves and not too far from the erupting volcano , mind you .
0 The funny sound that you may hear when you eyeball this execrable version of Jules Verne 's classic " Journey to the Center of the Earth " is Verne spinning in his grave . The only thing about this 80 minute opus that has anything to do with " Journey to the Center of the Earth " is the title . Otherwise , everything else in this lackluster production is new and not worth watching . In fact , the director has written here at IMDb . COM that he directed only eight minutes of " Journey to the Center of the Earth " and the studio tacked on part of " Dollman " helmer Albert Pyun 's sequel to his own " Alien from L.A. " with Kathy Ireland . Evidently , the producers ran out of money and to satisfy overseas contractual obligations , they grafted Pyun 's sequel onto director Rusty Lemorande 's movie . Please , do n't rent or buy this wretched piece of garbage.<br /><br />Unlike director Henry Levin 's period piece " Journey to the Center of the Earth " ( 1959 ) with James Mason and Pat Boone , Lemorande 's " Journey to the Center of the Earth " takes place in contemporary times in Hawaii . Two fellows , a British nanny , and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence . Richard ( Paul Carafotes of " Blind Date " ) and his comic book obsessed brother Bryan ( Ilan Mitchell - Smith of " Weird Science " ) are going out to explore a cave . The heroine , Crystina ( Nicola Cowper of " Underworld " ) , works for a domestic service called ' Nannies R Us . ' Being a nanny has been Crystina 's life - long dream , but she has made a less of all five of her nanny jobs . Nevertheless , her sympathetic supervisor , Ms. Ferry ( Lynda Marshall of " Africa Express " ) , sends her to Hawaii . Crystina 's new client , rock star Billy Foul ( Jeremy Crutchley of " Doomsday " ) who is scheduling one last concert to revive his flagging career , has a dog named Bernard . Foul wants Crystina to take Bernard to a doggie day spa . Crystina is waiting on the arrival of her taxi when a careless motel attendant accidentally puts the basket that conceals Bernard in Richard 's jeep . You see , Foul has hidden his canine in a basket because motel management strictly prohibits pets on their premises . Foul has disguised the dog as a human baby . Anyway , Crystina catches a cab and tells the driver follow Richard.<br /><br />After she catches up with them to get her dog , the cabbie cruises away and abandons her . Crystina demands that Richard drive her back to town , but he has other plans . Unhappily , Crystina joins the guys and they get lost , and then find themselves in the lost city of Atlantis , a police state ruled by a dictator , at the center of the Earth . The rulers of Atlantis repeatedly notify their citizens that life on the surface does not exist . Our heroes and heroine stumble onto Atlantis quite by accident . Atlantis resembles a disco and everybody looks like they are straight out of a punk rock opera . The ruler of Atlantis , General Rykov ( Janet Du Plessis of " Operation Hit Squad " ) , is orchestrating a raid on the surface with clones of the first human , Wanda Saknussemm ( Kathy Ireland of " Necessary Roughness " ) , to visit Atlantis . Predictably , General Rykov machinations to rule Atlantis and overthrow the Earth fails , and our heroes and heroine save the day.<br /><br />"Journey to the Center of the Earth " is an abomination . The movie seems to be a comedy despite its superficial satire about dictatorships . Albert Pyun is one of my favorite low budget action directors , but he blew it on this lightweight shambles of a science fiction saga .
0 This film is the worst film I have ever seen . The story line is weak - I could n't even follow it . The acting is high - schoolish . The sound track is irritating . The attempts at humor are not . The editing is horrible . The credits are even slow - I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film . Do n't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting .
0 What a disgrace ! I was checking this out hoping it would be an undiscovered James Garner gem and what a stinker it turned out to be ! The production quality was fine , but the plot was undeniably lame and I can honestly say that I am only a couple hours older and a lot dumber now . The movie really had no redeeming qualities and if this kind of stuff keeps coming out , it will give Hallmark a bad name . For those of you who insist on knowing what it was about , it 's about nothing , and in this case , it 's not a good thing . We are subjected to watching one old ornery woman who is one of the dumbest creatures ever to roam the earth , who happens to be married to a real sweetheart who is probably the only person alive that could put up with her . She drags him through one mess after another , gets him into one embarrassing situation after another , and is proud of herself the whole time . Then the movie ends . What a relief that was ! Not worth the time it would take to watch it , so do yourself a favor and skip this one , you 'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this one really is .
0 Before writing this review , I went back and reread the reviews of others . This movie was a particular disappointment to me , since it features two of my favorite dancers , Gene Kelly and George Chakiris , boasts a score by the often wonderous Michel LeGrand ( " Wuthering Heights , " " Ice Station Zebra , " " The Thomas Crowne Affair " ) . The dancing was stilted , unmotivated and unoriginal , the songs forgettable , the story a joke . Even the costuming was not particularly flattering . Only the photography correctly captured the proper mood and spirit . I 'm glad other people enjoyed " The Young Girls of Rochefort , " though I most certainly did not .
0 The comparison is perhaps unfair , but inevitable . Those attracted to the intimacy and depth of Umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut - and - paste musical in the American style - awkward , stilted dialogue with inexplicable song - and - dance numbers . Gene Kelly 's French accent was apparently so poor , that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted ( as you 'll remember , the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in Umbrellas ) . The translation of the French ( for subtitled versions ) , as well , leaves something to be desired , although this ca n't be attributed to Demy . The film also has several self - aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting , such as references in songs to LeGrand himself . And the costumes - well , the tight pants / white boots combination , and the freakishly unnatural colors , reminds one of an Austin Powers film . . .<br /><br />But Demy does reward the viewer with allusions to Umbrellas ; note , for instance , the suitcase carried by Maxence in his departure from Rochefort - this is the same suitcase carried by Guy in his departure from Cherbourg . Also , note the " Convenient Brunette of Resolution " - Madeleine in Umbrellas , and Josette in Young Girls.<br /><br />Generally speaking , those expecting the natural feel of Umbrellas ( save the floating bicycle scene ) , or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in Umbrella 's script , should probably pass this one b y. Those looking for a French version of a thin ' 60s American musical will be quite happy .
0 Despite much style , flash , and glitter , this French musical fails to speak . The tunes are repetitive , predictable , and tedious . The story is uninteresting , as are the many characters . < br /><br />People break into song and dance , without motivation or reason . Most of the cast wears phony looking wigs and hairpieces , and the sets look hopelessly studio bound.<br /><br />To be honest , this video of the restored version was stopped before the end , so negative an effect it had on me . Certainly a shame , to have such a multi - talented cast in so feeble a final effort . < br /><br />Goes to show , I guess , where followups ( in this case , to the great classic , " Umbrellas " ) often do go awry . One can not recapture , only recreate .
0 A wonderful television mini - series completely ruined by a 45-year old woman trying desperately to pass herself off as a 16-year old ingenue ! No exaggeration - that 's the ACTUAL age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at Pearl Harbor . This TV mini - series really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one I refer to whenever the topic comes up.<br /><br />That alone makes this completely unwatchable , despite the fact it 's one of the best filmed WWII ' global ' dramas TV has ever produced . If you have the stomach - or a decent fast - forward ability - you might be able to enjoy the late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance . < br /><br />I'm stunned at some of the comments referring to the love story ( pun intended ) . Did they watch the film with their eyes closed ? Or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their " selective memories " and " selective vision " . I 'm a Boomer myself so do n't think for a second I 'm some hubristic young punk . 45 WILL ALWAYS LOOK 45 . Get used to it . Deal with it . Age gracefully damnit.<br /><br />The Winds Of War could have been ... so good . How much more would we be talking about this mini - series today , some 25 years later , had an ACTUAL ingenue been cast in such an important & critical role ? Right now , with the constant haggard old biddy distraction , that alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of The Winds Of War .
0 .... this mini does not get better with age . I saw this and it 's sequel when originally broadcast , and like so many others was blown away . In early 2002 I borrowed the novels for both WOW and W and R and was even more impressed . I then decided that I had to see both again and invested $ 200 plus on the DVD sets . I watched both minis again in painful detail and realized I had done things backwards - I should have purchased the novels and borrowed the DVD's.<br /><br />Don't believe it is abysmally miscast ? Read the novels and see for yourself . Do n't think this is dated ? Screen it for somebody not old enough to have seen it originally broadcast and watch the reaction you get ( warning - reactions from such people range from looks of horror to belly laughs).<br /><br />According to the trivia section for this mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum . Yikes ! ! Production quality , music scoring , dialog - a great story was turned into a late 70 's soap opera by an overly ambitious producer / director who was in way over his head . This thing was dated the minute it was completed.<br /><br />These two minis were great when original broadcast and to those of us who saw them then , tug at a nostalgic string that reminds us of younger days . IMO - this mini does not nearly live up to its reputation and severely disappoints .
0 I am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first . And from that perspective I can honestly say that while enjoyable , I can see why it has n't been rebroadcast anytime recently . More specifically , this mini has some serious problems , such as:<br /><br />1 ) It is terribly miscast . The actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters . Ali McGraw ( 45 at the time ) was playing Natalie Jastrow who was supposed to be about 26 . Jan - Michael Vincent ( 39 at the time ) was playing Byron Henry who was supposed to be about 22 . The other Henry children , and Pamela Tudsbury , were also played by actors way too old for characters who were supposed to be in their 20's.<br /><br />2 ) Some of the acting was absolutely awful . Ali McGraw at times almost made this mini unwatchable . I have seen more convincing performances in high school plays . < br /><br />3 ) The directing was poor . To be fair to Ali McGraw , the bad acting and character development were probably the directing . The portrayal of Hitler was way overdone . His character came off looking and behaving more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic , sometimes charming , but always diabolical genius Herman Wouk painted him as in the novel . Some of the other characters are done so stereotypically ( Berel Jastrow ) they do not gain the depth of character that Wouk created for them.<br /><br />4 ) This mini is very dated . The hokey music , the pretentious narration ( it sounded like a junior high school history film narration ) , and the entire prime - time soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comical at times . Also , too often Byron and Natalie are costumed and made up to look like they are in 1979 rather than 1939.<br /><br />Someone who watches this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit through it all , because it will come off more as a late 70 's / early 80 's " take myself too seriously " prime - time soap drama , rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern American classic.<br /><br />Remakes of older movies and the like are sometimes poorly done , but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning , memorable , and critically acclaimed production . I do n't ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long ( 15 hours ) or longer to do it right , and given the short attention span of most of the current American viewing public , it would n't fly .
0 * * * Warning - this review contains " plot spoilers , " though nothing could " spoil " this movie any more than it already is . It really IS that bad . * * * < br /><br />Before I begin , I 'd like to let everyone know that this definitely is one of those so - incredibly - bad - that - you - fall - over - laughing movies . If you 're in a lighthearted mood and need a very hearty laugh , this is the movie for you . Now without further ado , my review:<br /><br />This movie was found in a bargain bin at Wal - Mart . That should be the first clue as to how good of a movie it is . Secondly , it stars the lame action - star Dolph Lundgren . That should be the second clue as to how good of a movie it is . I 'm still shocked that it was even put on DVD ( who would waste their money doing such a thing ? ) , though as you might imagine , there are n't any extras or bonus footage on the DVD . In fact , there 's not even a menu ; the movie just starts playing.<br /><br />First , the writer for this movie deserves to be tortured and killed . It has one of the worst scripts ever written and is plagued with terrible one - liners ; remarkably unbelievable , fake dialogue ; and inappropriate comments ( like Lee 's comment on Lundgren 's . err . manhood , which I 'll mention later ) . There is n't one single sincere sounding line in the entire movie . The dialogue and plot go hand - in - hand , as the script and plot both progress in an entirely nonsensical fashion . The two cops hate each other for no apparent reason at the beginning , and then for again no reason at all , Lee 's character pulls over to the side of the road , runs around to the other side of the car , and says ` I 'm not going to let you go alone , 'cause despite myself , I like you ! And I do n't want to see you get killed ! ' . or something to that extent , anyhow . There are disgusting one - liners , mostly said by Lee . For instance , when duking it out with a bad guy , Lee says ` You have the right to remain silent . You have the right to be dead ! ' Lastly , I 'll mention the entirely inappropriate and nonsensical comment that Lee makes about Lundgren 's nether - regions . When bad guys start to attack after a seemingly random love scene between Lundgren and Carrere , and Lundgren decides to fight them off in his underwear , Lee says to him : ` Incase we die , I just wanted to let you know that you have the biggest dick I 've ever seen on a guy . ' . Yes , he actually says that . It makes no sense and is n't even possible ( Lee never actually sees Lundgren naked , so how would he know ? ) , but the writer threw it in the script anyway . The entire movie looks like some kind of action video game , and Lee even admits it . After Lee and the underwear - only Lundgren defeat all of those bad guys , Lee makes a comment that is also truly beautiful : ` Wow , this is sort of like a video game ; we just defeated the first wave!'<br /><br />Second , the plot of this movie is despicable . It suffers , in my opinion , mainly from the fact that it just does n't exist . The trailer for this movie - which IMDb has available for viewing , by the way - makes it sound like the movie is about two cops trying to stop the Japanese Yakuza from taking over Lost Angeles . This is extremely misleading , however , since the movie has practically nothing to do with that at all . They make very brief , vague references to the Yakuza trying to start up a methamphetamine business with local drug dealers , but the entire movie ACTUALLY revolves around a poorly - written attempt for Kenner ( Lundgren 's character ) to revenge the death of his parents , whom the Yakuza leader ( named Yoshida ) killed when he was only 9 years old . The entire plot can basically be summed up like this : Yoshida wants Kenner dead , Kenner wants Yoshida dead , and the two try two kill each other . And of course all the while Kenner 's sarcastic sidekick ( named Johnny and played by Brandon Lee ) acts like an ignorant idiot , and Tia Carrere gets naked . twice.<br /><br />The acting is one of the worst parts of the entire movie . The dialogue is so unrealistic , and their entirely insincere portrayal of it emphasizes this even more . You 'd expect poor acting from action stars anyway , but this movie highlights some of the most unimaginably bad acting ever recorded.<br /><br />Finally we get to the heart of the movie 's baseness : the flagrantly bad action . There are so many astoundingly bad , unrealistic action sequences in this movie , it 's just downright impressive they managed to fit them all in . Although Lee has his fair share of bad scenes as well , most of the truly terrible action involves Lundgren . For instance , Lundgren nonchalantly takes on four or five kung fu bad guys one - handed , without spilling his tea . Then , when surprised by an oncoming speeding car , Lundgren casually leaps over it . Or how about when he reaches THROUGH a closed door , grabs the villain on the other side , pulls him back through the door , and beats him up ? Or when he picks up Tia Carrere , gently walks ( not runs ) backward through a glass door that shatters around him , and leaps down a one - story height with Tia still in arm , only to then lift up an entire car without the slightest effort and uses it as a barricade to shield them from bullets ? All of the shameless gunfights are terrible as well , with Lundgren and Lee killing every bad guy instantaneously , while the rain of bullets from their fifty attackers never seem to hit either of them . That is , of course , until the final fight scene of the movie . Lundgren gets shot point blank in his bare chest in a region that even if it did manage to miss his heart , would still immediately begin to fill lungs with blood and kill him within a matter of seconds . Despite this , Lundgren remains in top - notch condition and manages to duke it out in the middle of a parade with Yoshida , the evil super villain . And of course the passing people in the parade dressed as samurai are carrying REAL , fully sharpened katanas , which the two use to sword fight . Now in addition to his bullet wound , Lundgren gets several deep slices in his chest and arms . Does this stop him ? No , of course not ! In fact , a few seconds later after easily killing the evil Yoshida ( who gets pinned to a dartboard - like wheel and then bursts into flames for no reason ) , Lundgren casually walks off with Tia and Lee as if he was n't injured at all . God , it 's terrible.<br /><br />All of these factors are then mixed up with an entirely unnecessary , gratuitous nude scene every five minutes , including topless women at a party , the beheading of a topless woman , women at a strip club , nude women at a Japanese spa , and the pointless hot tub and love scene with Tia . Not to mention the trip to the bizarre sushi bar , at which rich Japanese men are eating sushi off of naked women . Which , by the way , prompts Lee to say with much fake enthusiasm that after defeating the bad guys he and Lundgren will ` go eat fish off those naked chicks ! ' Which , of course , is followed by a disturbing high five . And we ca n't forget the terrible editing either , like when the villains are crushing a man trapped in a car at a junk yard , and the editors left in a really obvious glimpse of a prop dummy . The credits also list an enormous list of stunt workers , which implies that a lot of the action probably was n't done by the movie stars after all.<br /><br />In the end , this movie repeatedly outdoes it self with brazen badness . It is illogical and impossible , and as a result , remarkably entertaining . If you 're looking for any kind of thoughtful cinema , this movie will make you want to die . If you 're looking for a good laugh and a good time mocking bad movie making , this movie will delight you . As an actual movie , I 'll merit this movie a 0.5 out of 10 . As an entertaining way to waste an hour and eighteen minutes , however , this beauty takes the cake .
0 This movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action films ever put to film . Dolph Friggin ' Lundren with a Japanese accent is funny enough , but add really corny buddy - buddy action to the mix , an eccentric and over - the - top villain , a clichéd love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time , and you 've got yourself quite the little suicide - inducing cure for people who enjoy their life and , up till watching " Showdown , " had never contemplated killing themselves with a blowtorch.<br /><br />I do n't know if it 's just me but the whole homosexual subtext is none too subtle . There are constant references to male genitalia , and not by females , either . Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about each other 's manly parts , and in fact before going on a suicide spree , Brandon says to Dolphy , " In case we do n't make it , I want to tell you , you have the biggest d--- I 've ever seen." < br /><br />Now , is this what a normal man would say to another man ? In an ACTION film no less ? And would you want those to be your _ dying words_??<br /><br />Later , there 's this gem:<br /><br />Dolph ( regarding the villain ) : " I would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy . " Brandon : " Man , you 've got a fixation . " < br /><br />As the guy at RuthlessReviews.com pointed out , " Unfortunately , Dolph does n't respond with , ' I 've got a fixation ? I 've got a fixation ? ! You 're the one who decided that his last words should be about my privates ! I was just gon na chop of his ears and his nose , man." < br /><br />This is relentlessly silly stuff and great fun if you 're someone who enjoys receiving root canals from unlicensed dentists , without novocain . It 's about on par . Great fun for the whole family !
0 Seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie , I figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that was n't quite meant to be . I watched the first two fight scenes , listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by Lungren , and all of the other thrown - in Oriental actors , and I found the movie so awful that it was funny . Then Brandon Lee enters the story and the one - liners start flying , the plot falls apart , the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it 's welcome , as it turns into the worst action movie EVER.<br /><br />Lungren beats out his previous efforts in " The Punisher " and others , as well as all of Van Damme 's movies , Seagal 's movies , and Stallone 's non - Rocky movies , for this distinct honor . This movie has the absolute worst acting ( check out Tia Carrere 's face when she is in any scene with Dolph , that 's worth a laugh ) , with the worst dialogue ever ( Brandon Lee 's comment about little Dolph is the worst line ever in a film ) , and the worst outfit in a film ( Dolph in full Japanese attire ) . Picture " Tango and Cash " with worse acting , meets " Commando , " meets " Friday the 13th " ( because of the senseless nudity and Lungren 's performance is very Jason Voorhees - like ) , in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie.<br /><br />The good ( how about not awful ) performances go to the bad guy ( who still looks constipated through his entire performance ) and Carrere ( who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing ) . Brandon Lee is just there being Lungren 's sidekick , and doing a really awful job at that.<br /><br />An awful , awful movie . Fear it and avoid it . If you do watch it though , ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non - underwater shots . Speaking of the underwater shots , check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight - scene - ending ever . This movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fill - in between the flashes of nudity.<br /><br />A BAD BAD MOVIE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0 Well , I could n't even enjoyed this movie much for its cult values . It 's a B - movie action - flick , by the director of " Commando " , that is however far too lame and silly to consider it a good B - movie with enough entertainment value in it.<br /><br />It 's an ' 90 's flick but foremost the movie should remind of an ' 80 's action movie , when these type of B - movies were at an all time high . These movies always went over - the - top and never paid much attention to its story or acting . It was all about blowing stuff up , big muscle heroes and bullets flying around . This movie has all of that ingredients in it but yet I really did n't liked watching this movie as much as I like watching some similar type of movies . Hard to say why really , since the story and acting and such are just as bad as would be the case in basically any other genre movie from the same era.<br /><br />It 's probably because the movie is being often far too silly . All these type of movies have its silly moments but this movie is just filled with it . The fighting , Dolph Lundgren running around shirtless , the characters , the story . It all just is n't very good because it 's often just too lame for words . The story at times is n't even trying to make a bit sense and what 's even the main plot - line of the overall movie ? Its story is all over the place really and seems only to be written to create a movie out of with fighting sequences , gun fights and such . And those sequences are n't even much good to watch really . The moments are way too short and quite disappointing to watch really , from the man who brought us " Commando".<br /><br />It 's foremost a Dolph Lundgren , in which he gets to play the big action hero star , who kicks butt with seemingly relative ease , knows how to handle guns and other weapons and of course also gets the girl , played by Tia Carrere . This all also brings us one of the worst montage sequence in action movie history and also definitely one of the worst sex sequence I have seen in any movie really . Both are just too lame for words and just very poorly put together.<br /><br />None of the characters work out really . The good guys are cops but they never seem to behave like one . They simply kill around without having to face responsibility to anyone and they are not very keen on making any arrest , or to inform anyone about their discoveries . Not even when they find out a big Japanese crime syndicate is trying to take over the streets of L.A. and a beer brewery is working as a cover for a drugs factory and large scale drugs smuggling . And also just think about it for a moment , what is Brandon Lee 's overall purpose in the movie ? The movie could had easily done without him and the girl as well.<br /><br />Too silly , lame and simplistic and just not entertaining enough.<br /><br />4/10
0 Extremely poor action film starring the ever wooden Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee trapped in a sidekick role that never seems to gel . The action is at best average , a bit of nudity chucked in and yes Tia Carrera does use a body double ! < br /><br />The set - up is the usual renegade cop forced to break in a new partner on a big case , the makers at least try to give the formula a twist making Lundgren the cop with Oriental values and Lee the modern city slicker but there is zero character development making it almost comical , Lundgrens oriental warrior outfit for the big showdown has to be seen to be believed . The action sequences are by the numbers and Lee(who would go on to make the excellent The Crow ) is never given the scope to show off any particular martial arts brilliance . But given his illustrious parentage he must have been under a hell of a lot of pressure and was far better served not having to live up to his father by taking on a very different role in The Crow which showed what a unique actor he may have become if not for his tragic and early death.<br /><br />Unless your a hardcore Lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80 's style action movies ( think Cobra etc . ) then avoid.<br /><br />Poor 3/10
0 The fight scenes play like slow - motion Jackie Chan and the attempts at wit are pathetic ( worst pun by far : " Guess what ? This time I heard you coming " ) . The stars are a mismatched pair : Brandon Lee , despite the terrible lines he has to say , actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm - things that Dolph Lundgren is completely free of ( at least in this movie ) . Note to the director : in the future , please stay away from any love scenes , especially when your main actress wo n't do any nudity and you have to rely extensively on a body double . ( * 1/2 )
0 There are n't enough gay - themed movies and there are n't enough ` coming out ' movies . Every one is a welcome addition to the genre . Although the production values are high(the movie ` looks ' good , Matthias Freihof ( Philipp ) looks REAL good in a pair of jeans ) this is a bad one . It is a period piece : gay life under an oppressive regime(East Berlin , 1989 ) a life that seems 40 years behind the west . In a way we 're seeing our own history ; what it might have been like for gays in the 40 's and 50 's here(it often reminded me of ` Last Exit to Brooklyn : the book not the film).But it is unremittingly depressing and SLOW in a contrived way that evoked an old SCTV send up of Ingmar Bergman . It is so sloppily edited I wonder if the director just did n't hack at random . Yes , it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before The Wall came down and yes , life behind the ` Curtain ' was hard for gay people . A good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience . A good director would have had me mark this one as one of the great coming - out movies and not one of the misses .
0 The easiest way to describe this movie is as a satire . The target of the satire is quite vast , from the US Government to corporate America . It is also not a stinging satire , but rather a silly one.<br /><br />Think of this movie as a mix between the Kentucky Fried movie , Airplane and Police Squad series , done with a much smaller budget and not as funny . I can see how this movie is a satire of many sci - fi disaster movies from the 50 's and 60 's . I see this movie as a big influence on Tim Burton 's Mars Attacks.<br /><br />The plot is simple enough . Genetically engineered giant tomatoes go " crazy " and start attacking people and cities . At first there is a cover up and then it blows over into full blown war.<br /><br />The movie runs the gamut of characters and characterizations : Lois " Fairchild " ( a Lois Lane clone ) , a very ambitious Presidential Press Secretary , Clark Kent , Mason Dixon ( FIA agent who has n't worked since the Bay of Pigs ) , a useless President ( who only seems to be able to sign his name and attack New York ) , an even inept Congress , a sleazy marketing CEO , and Mason 's team consisting of an obese East German " female " swimmer , a scuba diver , a crazed WWII paratrooper and an African - American disguise expert ( disguised as George Washington , Abraham Lincoln , Hitler and finally as a tomato ) . Did I also forget to mention , lots and lots of tomatoes ? There are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes , to giant plastic tomatoes , to smashed tomatoes , to tomato juice and finally to people dressed up as tomatoes.<br /><br />On top of all this , you have a couple of musical numbers as well . They are n't that good and seem to be dubbed . The best tune is by far the theme of the movie ( " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " ) . It is way too catchy and you might end up humming or singing it in public . Be warned.<br /><br />Most of the movie is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various entertainment genres . I do n't believe I was induced to laughter , but mostly smiled and scratched my head . I definitely recommend this movie for fans of B and C grade movies , but only as a rental.<br /><br />-Celluloid Rehab
0 In case you 're a self - acclaimed connoisseur of cult cinema and/or bad movie - making , there comes a certain point in life  preferably sooner than later  that you have to watch " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " . It 's an inescapable certainty , as this is one of the most notoriously awful cult movies ever made . One tiny but essential detail , however , is that " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " is deliberately awful . Right from the opening message already , mocking Alfred Hitchcock 's " The Birds " , this is clearly intended as a zero - budgeted parody and I ca n't escape the impression that writer / director John De Bello never expected for his film to become such a hit . The film spoofs the contemporary popular trend of so - called " eco - horror " movies ( plants , animals and nature in general revolting against humanity ) and introduces the least menacing type of vegetable imaginable as undefeatable killing machines . A secret government agricultural project to produce bigger and tastier tomatoes goes horribly wrong and soon there are reports about tomato - attacks coming from all over the country . The president puts together a Special Forces team to battle the juicy enemy , which includes secret agents with very specific areas of expertise and scientists with horrendously dubbed voices . The first half hour of " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " is very entertaining . As silly as it is , the sight of normally shaped vegetables jumping up from the sink and attacking hysterical housewives is quite original and funny . The first half hour also contains numerous memorable moments like the catchy theme song , the " Jaws " homage and the infamous unforeseen helicopter crash ( see the trivia section for more details ) that made it to the final cut . After that , however , the whole thing turns into a tedious , unstructured and insufferably amateurish mess . The quality level of the jokes goes from fresh and inventive towards embarrassing and downright not funny and there are too many characters and sub plots . Personally , I prefer the late 80 's and early 90 's sequels ( which I saw before seeing the original ) because they benefit from slightly better production values , incredibly over - the - top tomato special effects and the presence of veteran actor John Astin ( " The Addams Family " ) as the mad scientist Dr. Gangreen . But , as said before already , the original inexplicably remains obligatory viewing material at some point in your life .
0 When I heard the plot for this movie I simply had to see it , I mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes ! Sadly the title is about as funny as it gets.<br /><br />Led by Detective Dick Mason , a special team of military and scientists ( including Greg Colburn who never takes his SCUBA outfit off and Lt . Finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind ) ' Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes ' is a parody of B - Movies , in particular Japanese horror of the 1950 's . The film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady , and let me tell you it does n't get any saner as the film progresses ! To be fair there are a couple of funny moments , for instance anytime the Japanese scientist Dr Nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an American accent , or when disguise expert Sam Smith infiltrates the tomatoes ' hey , can somebody please pass the ketchup ? ' . Equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept . Unfortunately for ' Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes ' spoof films such as the ' Airplane ' and ' Naked Gun ' series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since.<br /><br />The acting is atrocious ; there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy . For a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once , one gag after the over . The singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre , even for this film . Ultimately , however , you can see why this film is a cult one ; I ca n't see many people being indifferent to it . Unfortunately terrible would be the way I would sum this up .
0 I have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when I was rather young so much of the movie is blurred in trying to remember it . However , I can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor Timmy . Other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type . However , just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make . Granted this movie is supposed to be a B movie , nothing to be taken seriously , however , you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to extend a mildly amusing premise into a full fledged movie . Perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger tomato was actually pretty good . The trailer itself looked like a mock trailer , but no they indeed made a full movie , and a rather weak one at that .
0 Yes , it can be done . John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic , horror , Sc - Fi musical . If there is any acting , it is terrible or way over the top . Special effects ; take your pick ... very low budget or kindergarten . Every cheap cliché thought of is used . No doubt a fun movie to watch . Worth a cold six - pack or two . Point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse . Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind . San Diego is a good place as any to start . Scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace . This cult favorite features : David Miller , Eric Christmas , Al Sklar , Tom Coleman , Sharon Taylor and John Qualls .
0 Awlright , damn it , the MooCow will grudgingly admit the truth : I kinda ' like this cheap , cheesy 70 's parody . The idea that vast hordes of killer tomatoes are destroying the US is a great idea , and in spite of itself , the moovie does provide some decent chuckles , moostly the sight of terrified extras running away from large , obviously fake tomatoes . This film , along with The Kentucky Fried Moovie , is one of the earlier attempts at spoofs , which became so popular in the 80 's & 90 's , thanks largely to Airplane!. This one , like moost spoofs , is pretty poor . Many attempts at humor are dismal failures , and will induce much groaning . But thanks to the ravenous tomatoes hordes , the obnoxious " Puberty Love " song , and the awesome helicopter crash scene , Attack of the Killer Tomatoes does provide some goods , though largely for the wrong reasons . There are sooooo many things wrong with this film ... and so right , it 's hard to explain . Enough people must also have enjoyed it as the Tomatoes made a comeback in 2 moore films , and a cartoon series ! ! Large chunks of time spent away from the tomatoes are pretty dull . And dig those 70 's clothes , dude ! ! ; = 8 ) This tomato is seedy and cheesy , but worth a chuckle or two ; the MooCow says grab a pizza and pop in the Tomatoes ! ! : 
0 I knew this film was supposed to be so bad it was funny , so I went into it with that expectation . I just found it to be so bad it was murderously boring . The whiny theme song is funny for about 10 seconds , until you realize there is nothing clever about it except its intentionally irritating quality . Seeing things get splattered with tomatoes gets old in about 30 seconds . There is just nothing clever or funny about the film except for the premise . It could sustain a 3 - 4 minute comedy sketch maybe , but this is just not a feature film by any stretch of the imagination .
0 < br /><br />Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes is a " parody " of bad monster movies which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs . The ( very meager ) story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them badly . Basically , they spin and growl ( yes , they growl ) and the next thing you know the person is covered in ketchup . The actors are no - names who never made movies after this , so there would be no point to name them . There 's a guy who 's hired by the governement to try and stop the menace of tomatoes . He 's accompanied by a black guy who 's master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives . Anyway , there 's another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government . if this is n't making much sense to you , you understand . This movie never would have been very good in the first place , but it even lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes . The movie is horribly cheezy , which although being the whole point , really really hurts what could 've been a ( reasonably ) entertaining movie . At one point , a giant wax tomato " slides " on an unconcealed plank of wood with wheels on it ! Maybe I would 've recommended the movie if it would have enjoyable camp value , but even this is lacking from this terrible movie . 2/10
0 This movie 's heart was in the right place , no matter where its brain was.<br /><br />"Attack " is basically a spoof a la " Airplane ! " ( two years before the fact - nice going . ) of what happens when vegetables , or in this case fruits , attack.<br /><br />Through all manner of film magic ( stop motion , papier - mache tomatoes on skateboards , reverse filming , people watching off - screen tomatoes , people throwing basketball - sized tomatoes at the on - screen actors ) , the tomatoes do indeed attack everyone in their leafy grasp . < br /><br />Then , it 's up to Mason Dixon ( Miller ) and a group of spies I would n't wish on any government 's side to save the day . Of course there 's a meddling reporter ( Taylor ) who pops in at the worst times , dancing and singing Army soldiers , Japanese scientists with dubbed - in voices , some guy dragging around a parachute and a samurai sword ... and oh yeah , the San Diego Chicken before he made it big.<br /><br />The gags here are n't all that great . In fact , you could probably make up better yourself after watching these . Some of the dialogue is inutterably bad ( " Please pass the ketchup " - not something to say in front of tomatoes . ) and as far as " Puberty Love " goes ... well , I ca n't blame the tomatoes for shriveling up on hearing it.<br /><br />What 's good about it ? Well , I liked the theme song and the beginning credits , and there was a scene with four people on the phone at once that was pretty well executed . ... that 's about it.<br /><br />Three stars . Not a " Killer " comedy , but it tries.<br /><br />Rock on , Peace .
0 " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " consists mostly of rambling , poorly assembled footage in search of a movie . The plot makes no sense , and the various characters drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all . Watching this silly spoof , you get the feeling than so many other comments have captured so accurately : that it 's easy to make a cheap , low - quality film and then use the " parody " angle as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality ( in one scene , female swimmers are terrified of tomatoes that are floating near them ; how far can " suspension of disbelief " go - even in a parody ? ) . The title song is great , though . ( * 1/2 )
0 Never see this movie.<br /><br />It tries to be a spoof on scifi / thriller films of the 1950s and 1960s but all it succedes at is making you wish really badly that you were watching one of them and not it.<br /><br />It is very lame . A spoof has to have some aspect which has some above par quality to it . This movie does not have any such aspect.<br /><br />Save yourself . It 's too late for me but ... just do n't watch it .
0 The only aspect of this film that saves it from being my least favorite piece of celluloid trash is a single line uttered by an agent attempting to infiltrate the man - eating tomatoes by dressing in a tomato costume : " Can somebody please pass the ketchup ? " I highly urge anyone with a sleeping disorder to use this film as a sedative ; it works better than an overdose of demarol .
0 With a title like " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes ! " , anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a ) a bad science fiction movie or b ) a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies . It 's supposed to be a mix of both , with a dose of parody splashed in . Unfortunately , it falls flat very soon.<br /><br />You're never supposed to take this movie seriously , I realize that , but you 're supposed to think it 's funny , right ? I found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny ( i.e , the side - by - side phone conversations , the Russian Olympic spy eating steroid cereal , Superman walking by Lois , etc . ) . " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " strives to be a cult classic , but it does n't make it . A cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it ( or a similar description ) . " Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " could be enjoyed by any 8-year - old with a bad sense of humor , so therefore , it does not qualify as a cult film.<br /><br />There is one good actress in the entire thing : Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild . She is a thin , gawky reporter , but has an endearing personality , loves to overact , and is a natural comedienne . Unfortunately , she is put to bad use here.<br /><br />"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes " is not as funny as , say , " Amazon Women on the Moon " or " Kentucky Fried Movie " , but it does have a few hilarious moments , so I would still recommend seeing it once . Avoid the director 's cut , it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly " lost " footage dubbed in a pretend African dialect ( it can be found in English on the out of print tape ) .
0 The same night that I watched this I also watched " Scary Movie 4 , " making for one messed up double feature . Unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the Scary Movie franchise . While I fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid , brutally dated and brutally bad , the more recent parody had me laughing out loud . How could I desire any more than that . Director John De Bello uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers . But his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day . The script reeks of stoner humor , and perhaps if you take illegal substances with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea . I , sober , was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a tomato . And that one joke , that is never funny , where the discrepancy between the Japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here . Some may giggle , I did not . They even had a Hitler joke that was n't funny , and I thought all Hitler jokes were funny.<br /><br />The narrative of this film is so splintered ( for no good reason ) that it is nearly impossible to explain . Tomatoes kill people , the government tries to stop it , bad jokes are told . Their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media , consumerism , and paranoia ( three things that still control our lives today ) . Oddly enough the main selling point of this film , those gosh darn tomatoes , really do n't make much of an appearance . And when they do , get this , they 're played by real tomatoes . That washed up gimmick did nothing for me as I get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes devour a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks . There is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny . The gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members , but more than likely it will be seen as an invitation to join in the fun.<br /><br />I might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human egotism at work here . Man eats tomato and that 's dinner , tomato eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe . But that is just the way the world works . In the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic modification , but in the real world our produce ( see : Taco Bell ) becomes evil thanks to neglect . And like those evil doin' green onions this film 's shelf life expired a long time ago . There are a few good chuckles to be had . The last shot was really quite splendid , but it was nowhere near enough to save this moderate stink bomb . I 'm pretty sure there is a good movie buried deep within this concept , but the script needed to be filtered through about a dozen rewrites to get there . And by " there " I mean to the level of " Scary Movie 4 . " * * 1/4
0 ( spoilers)<br /><br />I shoulda figured . The dvd did n't even show the time or how long it was . I thought Wild Cardz was the worst anime movie I 'd ever seen . This one is much worse . Makes no sense . Thrown together plot . All so we can see oversized breasts on a figure that does n't support them . < br /><br />It had to of been a student film . That musta gotten a C grade < br /><br />2/10<br /><br />Quality : 1/10 Entertainment : 6/10 ( until I found out it was n't going to end . ) the ending made no darn sense < br /><br />Replayable : 0/10
0 Well , there 's no real plot to speak of , it 's just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex ( which can sometimes be fun , too , but it 's not in this case ) . What else can I say about this ... ? The action , when happening , is inventive and there 's a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper ( one that has to be several miles high ) , but overall there 's not much to recommend " Kite " . Watch it if you want , but you 're not missing much if you skip this one ...
0 A famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend . Suddenly , she kills him and runs away while an old lady gets a heart attack . The name of the female assassin is Sawa . She is still going to school and works for an vicious criminal , Akai , who is sleeping with her . One day Sawa finds out he killed her parents .. <br /><br />------- < br /><br />Even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this vicious action thriller is an disappointing gore fest . " Kite " has style , but it is still trash . The weird plot about a teenage girl that kills people as an assassin tried to be scary and touching at the same time , only causing the story to fall flat on it 's face . One of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good / bad heroine Sawa is falling together with a bodyguard from a building , yet the dramatic structure is n't nearly as good orchestrated and the director Yasoumi Umetsu 's weird and grotesque animation of the character 's faces is awful . Not only that , the intercourse sequences are just simply creepy.<br /><br />Grade : 3/10
0 I 'm a Black man living in a predominantly Black city . That being said , I have some major misgivings about Tyler Perry 's work . I realize that some people out there feel the need to praise him , because he 's Black and trying to portray a positive image about the culture . But , I honestly do believe that , were Perry White , this film would have had the NAACP , Al Sharpton , and Jessie Jackson all over his ass.<br /><br />I have been forced to watch this movie one whole hell of a lot recently and each repeated viewing makes my blood boil . The characters are poorly written and acted . The jokes are so bad , I have to actually be told something is supposed to be funny . I 'm just going to break this big pile of sh - t down.<br /><br />Madea = suck . The character may have had some appeal , but it does n't anymore . When the only thing she ever seems to do is smack around children and threaten adults with violence she is less than useless . She is unnecessary.<br /><br />The situation with the wife beating fiancé was horsesh - t . If a woman was so scared to death of her husband , why would she try to run away when he 's sleeping in bed . Would n't it have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work . At any rate , the characters in this arc were so annoying and overbearing that I hoped he would throw her off the balcony and was royally ticked when he didn't.<br /><br />Then there are the two lovebirds . A bus driver asks a woman out by harassing her while he 's making his rounds . I could n't believe it . I really could n't believe when she agreed to go out with him even more . But , what takes the cake is that a grown man was reduced to tossing pebbles at a window and passing notes like a ten year old by a castrating mega bitch . I do n't use this term lightly , but that woman only had two modes . Morose victim and psycho momma . No matter which of these two faces she showed , however , there was one constant . The bus driver was n't going to get any . He even married her without sampling the goods -- WTF ! < br /><br />Then there 's the family reunion scene . Here we 've got the mother load which includes implied incestual taboos , grinding for the sake of grinding , shirtless , overly musclebound , b - ball , plus the great taste of Maya Angelou . When those babes dragged their butts outside and called a meeting , was I wrong to wish that the oldest of them was claimed by a heart attack . All this crap is going on at the reunion , in laughably easy to separate groups , and then they ring a bell . When they do , everyone drops what they 're doing and heads on over for a stern talking too , just like a pack of Pavlov 's doggies -- WTF ! ! < br /><br />Then you have the final five minutes of the film . In it we see the abusive fiancé get manhandled by his longtime victim and all around bad actress . There is an impromptu wedding where Black people are dressed like angels and are hanging from the ceiling -- WTF ! ! ! The only reason to watch it this far , besides testing your threshold for pain , is the hope that the second villain of this story gets her ass handed to her as well . Guess what , it does n't happen . Instead , Perry takes the testicularly challenged way out and plays it safe , ending the movie on a tone of forgiveness -- WTF ! ! < br /><br />I'm pretty sure that , if given a day , I could probably write a doctoral dissertation on all the ways this movie sucks . Do n't even get me started on the rest of Tyler Perry 's films . I 'm just going to say this . In my opinion , as a Black guy , D.W. Griffith 's legacy lives on . The irony is that it is doing so through a Black man who will be praised for doing what Birth of a Nation did , selling us down the river . I only wish Perry 's films were dudes so I could kick them in the nuts . Thanks a lot , dude ! ! What are you going to follow this up with in 2009 , a comedy about the raping and savage beating of slaves in Colonial America ?
0 The original show was so much better . They should have left on a good note . This movie killed the whole idea . It was boring , over - dramatic , and the funny parts were too far in between to make up the slack . This movie really seemed like it was trying way too hard to be serious , and that was definitely not what I was wanting from this sequel . Not to mention , that for a long time it was just depressing about the same thing over and over again . So , sorry , Tyler Perry , but try harder next time . This movie is just kinda dull , and not that funny either . Sorry . 4/10 stars is it.<br /><br />Jay Addison
0 I saw the movie last night here at home , but I thought it was too long first of all . Second , the things I saw in the movie were way too out of text to even have in this what I thought was going to be a comedy type movie like the rest before . The things is n't funny in the movie : fiancé hitting his girlfriend , beatings . The movie was way too long -- talk about wanting to go to sleep and wondering when it will end when you wake up and still have it playing ! Some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture -- like the lady singing -- i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here ! come on Perry , you can do better then this !
0 I expected a comedy like the " Big Mama " movies . Instead , the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy , drama and a love story.<br /><br />This movie has three plots : The first involves Madea and her taking in a foster child . The second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who is abusing her . The third involves a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single father.<br /><br />There is actually very little comedy in the movie . There are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie . For example , Madea beats the foster child with a belt ( in a comedic manner ) , to convince the child to straighten out . The child does , in fact , turn herself around . Apparently , it pays to beat children.<br /><br />There are plots dealing with child rape ( with the consent of the mother ) . There are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them . ( The ogling takes place at a family reunion . ) The movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always off - balance . Is this a comedy , a love story , or a drama ? It is , in fact , nothing ... except a waste of time and money .
0 Can I give this a minus rating ? No ? Well , let me say that this is the most atrocious film I have ever tried to watch . It was Painful . Boringus Maximus . The plot ( ? ) is well hidden in several sub - levels of nebulosity . I rented this film with a friend and , after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better , we decided to " fast forward " a little to see if things would get any better . It never gets better . This film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls , sounds interesting , but , in reality , it is just a bore . Nothing even remotely interesting ever happens . If you ever get the chance to watch this , do yourself a favor , try " PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE " instead .
0 This mini - series is actually more entertaining than some others with much bigger budgets and grander aspirations . SOTD falls somewhere between " Kung - Fu " and " H R Pufnstuff " on the entertainment spectrum . If it were n't so long ( nearly 3 hours ) I think that kids would like it quite a bit . It 's got adventure , action , " cliffhanger scenes " , and not too much romance or other " icky " stuff . When you 're young , you 're not too critical of flexing rubber swords , campy acting , and scenes that are repeated . ( At least two scenes are repeated identically in the movie , just as was done in old - time serials in order to bring the audience up to speed . ) Finally , kids are usually more accepting of American English dialogue coming out of the mouths of Asian actors . ( Not to mention the fact that several of the leading roles are played by non - Asian actors . ) < br /><br />I was going to give this movie three stars , but I felt like the director , producers , and cast deserved some extra credit for at least carrying through on the project . This movie is not art , but , like painting your house , it actually took some time , effort , and discipline to get it made.<br /><br />Overall , not a recommended use for your time , but it might keep the kids entertained while traveling in the mini - van.<br /><br />Oh , yeah ... hey , IMDb ! " Dialogue " is the preferred and traditional spelling . Your spell - checking seems to think that " dialog " is the proper spelling . While " dialog " is acceptable , both Webster 's and the OED consider it an alternative form .
0 Yeah , stupidity ! I just finish watching and I still have bad taste in my mouth . Too much colors , too much unnecessary " addons " to a story , too much stupid characters ( I presume they wanted to achieve comic relief , but I only wanted to cry ) ... too much of everything . Shame to spoil one of divine stories from " Arabian Nights " like this . Childish , naive ( both on a bad way ) and with lot of magic - breaking mistakes , I do n't think this could keep a child of five for more then ten minutes . Princess is lovely , but should be tongueless , cause actress do n't know how to carry a role . Rest of the cast is even worse ... our " bad guy " is REALLY bad . Shame that the " good guy " is not better . Only light in this dark is , of course , David Carradine , who goes unfortunately deeply down under his level with this , but at least keep his actor/"fighter " skills at top . I 'm still sorry to see him in a thing like this , but glad that I had something to watch in whole charade , so thank you David . Only , ONLY , for him , I give this 2 stars to this fiasco ... I would give more for him , but that would rise final score to entire movie . The rest is so bad , that I would , maybe , like to grade it , but there is no grade lover then 1 here , and I think that would be too much .
0 I was in such high hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story like the Arabian Nights . Instead i was disappointed in a film that failed to keep my attention from the very beginning , even though i tried watching it twice ! ! < br /><br />It was a bonus that Caradine was in this movie but it did n't amount to much as the actors lacked likability . For something a little similar Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is much better for action , comic moments and overall enjoyability.<br /><br />OK , so Son of the Dragon has many possible fans out there , but if your looking for something to wow about in terms of martial arts and plot line you wo nt get it . If you just want the kids to settle down on a Sunday afternoon then maybe this it for you along with the 3 ninjas .
0 Unless you 're twelve , this movie really is n't worth it . It 's obviously a low - budget film with B actors , and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense CGI work that 's not good . I knew it would be bad when I rented it . I enjoy laughing at bad movies . I did n't know how bad though . It 's bearable , until after hour 2 , then it really starts to burn . Fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics , and wire - fighting . There 's no real explanation for the transitions . It has a plot , but once again , it 's obviously a kid 's movie . It seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed , like Sesame Street or something . It 's bearable . But much better if you 're , say , nine .
0 Is there anything that happens in this movie that is NOT predictable ? I think not . Basically the movie is cliché after cliché and really nothing ever comes as a surprise . It makes the movie extremely predictable and because of that the movie is also seriously lacking in tension . So for a thriller it is not tense and unpredictable enough but also as a drama it 's a failure . This is because the movie its story is highly unlikely . I mean , no way this could ever happen in real life , as in the same way as the events occur in this movie . So the movie has a real suspense and credibility problem.<br /><br />But it truly are the clichés that killed the movie . It was cringing stuff at times . Everything is so formulaic in this movie . The predator is portrayed as a cool heartless , almost psychopath like sexual frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman , who acts like she did n't see any of this coming . Everything that happened in the movie was so obvious and all seemed to happen for a reason . Such as the sequence in which the ' predator ' fixes the ' victims ' broken car . That has got to be one of the oldest clichés out of the book . I knew what the movie tried to achieve after that point . I tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing toward each other trough the eyes of the other persons around them . It was so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point . The movie is filled with moments like these.<br /><br />The title might suggest that this is a cheap porn movie but this in fact is a sappy made for TV movie . Which means that everything is slowly happening and the movie spends halve its time on character development and unnecessary sub - plots to make the movie even more drama like.<br /><br />I'll admit that Elizabeth Berkley is pretty good acting in this movie . She makes some of the clichés and events look even almost realistic at times . Her Hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the Paul Verhoeven movie " Showgirls " , so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies- and television series like this one . It 's a waste of her talent and she surely deserves better . All of the other characters are a disappointment . Corey Sevier plays the cliché pretty ' untouchable ' rich boy and the way the husband of the main character is portrayed is even worse . He looks more like a sexual frustrated predator than the true predator of the movie . He basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence . He wakes up , he wants sex . Before he goes to sleep , he wants sex . He gets home , he wants sex . It might be a realistic thing but I do n't know , it just did n't feel right for a movie like this one and the story in general.<br /><br />A cliché filled movie and I ca n't think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie . It 's predictable and therefor also lacks in suspense and credibility . Not an ' horrible ' movie and it certainly is a watchable one at times but all the weak and cliché elements in the movie also make this far from a recommendable one.<br /><br />4/10
0 There are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flick 's abundance of clichés throughout -- and I agree completely , both with regard to the characters AND the dialog.<br /><br />I'd read about Elizabeth Berkly 's awful performance in the equally - awful " Showgirls , " which I 've never seen - and her performance here , while not awful , is barely up to the standards of Lifetime 's worse fare . There was not a hint of depth to her character , but then there probably should n't have been . If so , it would have placed the film completely out - of - balance , since there was n't a hint of depth or charisma - not a trace - in any one character , performer , or portrayal.<br /><br />The principal 's handling of Liz 's initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable . Her husband 's initial reaction and advice were likewise ( Forrest Gump , attacking Jenny 's boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic , intelligent action , and , hell , he was mentally - challenged).<br /><br />The smarmy , unctuous lawyer ( excuse the redundancy ) father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance : he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time , no mean feat . Her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd , also not unknown in the profession.<br /><br />Finally ( and frankly , I rather enjoyed this part ) , the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs , that you 'd rather depend upon Barney Fife , without Andy , to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community . I know that most real - like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness , intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the " Law and Order " series ' , and the like -- but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on " Lifetime." < br /><br />Finally , I found a kind of " story within a story " fascination with Josh 's concoction of his being the " victim " of his teacher . This scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story . This was something of an achievement , like going from " F " to " F - minus." < br /><br />This whole lame situation should have been resolved - in real life - in about 15 minutes , following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities , with husband involved . But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following , and left an hour 's blank film in the camera . < br /><br />But the writer(s ) here , proved with their ending , they could do even worse . When the situation was finally " resolved " and " righted , " this was accomplished in all of about 45 seconds , with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any " real world " context for the perpetrator and his parents , or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption.<br /><br />This one 's a 2 * presentation ; the second " * " because it does have some mild " fascination . "
0 Student Seduction finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier . Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student . That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School . Even as a young gay kid , I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class . She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.<br /><br />Corey being the hotty he is , is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not . The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief . He 's flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she agrees to tutor , but believe no more . < br /><br />So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it 's damaging to his ego . When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police , the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just do n't believe here . Sevier 's parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy.<br /><br />Student Seduction which is a misnomer of a title if there ever was one is trash all the way . After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls this TV film was not an upward career move .
0 Anyone giving this movie a good review obviously must have had something to do with its creation . This movie is a painful suckfest . The acting is stiff , the stock generic soundtrack is laughable , the direction is bland and strangest of all , the teacher really is n't all that attractive ( making the student 's blatant advances all the more awkward ) . The creative minds behind this trash should disband and spread out to prevent further displays of such concentrated craptitude . I 'm certain that some starving kids in Africa could have used the money squandered on this project . Hell , the funds would have also seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crack - addict ; at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it . For the sole reason that it did n't give me a terminal illness , I 'll give this film a two .
0 If you like films that are totally bizarre , then this one is for you ! Abdullah is one mean mother , with a passion for strangling people and eating ham . You should check this film out , just for a laugh . It is a low budget sci - fi , musical , comedy , cannibalistic , classic . If you get bored of the film half way through you should persevere , just for the sake of seeing the aliens , which are nothing more than little toy robots , but in my opinion are the films highlight . " I 'm the Big Meat Eater , pass me
0 Terrible film made on a budget of about $ 9.99 . Very obvious miniature sets used , poor acting and an awful storyline concerning aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship . The film contains some blood ( not enough to disturb ) and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands . ( Yes you read that correctly.)<br /><br />One saving grace was a song performed at the " talent show " ( how 's that for irony ? ) by a punk / new wave band that I think was called " I 'm A Heat Seeking Missile " . Other than that , this is not worth your time , not even on a " so bad it 's good " level . Watch if you are into cheesy alien films , but anyone else should steer clear . < br /><br />Rating : 1 out of 10
0 I started to watch this movie with high expectations . However , after one hour I gave up on this movie as it only instilled lots of unanswered questions upon me . This already started in the opening sequence and only got worse.<br /><br />Why would they bury the Hollander under a statue ? Why is there an Italian comediant present ? Why did the farmers wife save the Hollander ? Why did he , upon being saved , not run for his life instead of starting to make love to the farmers wife ? Why did the farmers wife not save the Hollander at a time when the farmer would n't be around ? Why did these presumably illiterate farmers understand Italian ? Why did the Italian comediant know about the Hollanders gold ? Why did he hide it in the cesspool in the midst of the evil farmers property ? These and many more questions popped up , and none of them seemed to get answered in an acceptable way . So I guess I am totally missing the point of this movie , and I am not connecting to the story in any way ....
0 First of all I would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the Dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called THE FLYING DUTCHMAN . In this film , you will not see a single sailing boat . You will not see sailors , ghosts , or anything remotely exciting . It is not the story of the ghost ship , and I wish they had notified it in the main credits or I would n't have watched it , because I really thought it was the film about the legend . It seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship , since the film is listed on the Wikipedia page for the " Flying Dutchman " legend ... I do n't understand why . It is maybe based on the resembling legend called " The Wandering Jew " ? Or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend ? The film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes . Unfortunately , it is the only battle scene of the film . Then you see Daniel Emilfork ( who was Krank in City of Lost Children ) for about two seconds , and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting . Unfortunately he is very bad in the film . The same thing can be said about Italian actor Nino Manfredi , who was one of Italia 's best actors ever , and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the " wise man " of the film . And boy , does that film need wiseness ! Every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement , yelling , torturing others ( in excrement ) , fornicating ( in excrement ) or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it . It seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another . Coming from a Dutch director , you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece , elements which contributed to make Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven 's film , " Flesh + Blood " , such a great film . The thought of " Flesh + Blood " would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight - forward would be good . Unfortunately , and unlike " Flesh + Blood " , there is no dramatic progression , no fights , no good acting , and put simply , no " Flesh and Blood " . The photography , as the opening sequence unfolds , is well - done and enticing . This too , stops very early in the film . The music , from Nicola Piovani ( of " La vità e bella " fame ) is repetitive and annoying , when not irrelevant ( it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence , while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung ) . Throughout the first " act " of the film , which lasts nothing less than an hour ( ! ) , the film takes place within the same perimeter , which is around the farm where the main characters live . The characters play with excrement a lot , drown in it , play in it . A long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character , a young boy who loves to play in excrement , to become older and play in excrement some more . The bird - man talks a lot to say foolish things in Italian . Spanish conquistadors speak French . Nothing makes sense . Everything is confused and takes hours to happen . Then there is a second act called " the Ship " , in which we see what might have been a ship , a long time ago , but which is now remains of a ship ( covered with excrement did I mention ? ) . The main character , while walking a bit further away from the farm , just happens to run into it , and decides it 's really cool so let 's live in it . The hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him , but he does n't really mind because ( did I mention ? ) he 's not very bright . He thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it , until more conquistadors show up ( at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the Don Quixote style hats but as I 've said it 's really confused who 's who ) , make the Dutchman a prisoner , along with the retarded hunchback , and they burn the ship to the ground . The last part of the film , which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle - age peasants fighting in it , takes place in a mad asylum . Yet more torture and drowning each other with feces . Yet more loitering for the director , who seems to have definitely given up on his job , or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job . In the end , a lot of the mentally - challenged new " friends " that the Dutchman made die . The woman he had sex with who was his brother 's wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son . The Dutchman and his son talk . The film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances . Then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends , while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they do n't have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses .
0 Confounding melodrama taken from a William Gibson story , produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli ! Richard Widmark heads up posh , upscale rural nervous asylum , where his loose wife battles with self - appointed queen bee Lillian Gish , and Widmark himself gets the straying eye for staff - newcomer Lauren Bacall , who is putting her life back together after the death of her husband and child . Facetious and muddled , set in an indiscriminate time and place , and with a " David and Lisa " love story hidden in the plush morass . Widmark and Bacall do have some good chemistry together , but this script gives them nothing to build on . For precisely an hour , most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the drapes hanging in the library ( this thread is n't used as symbolism , rather it 's a red herring in a non - mystery ! ) . The picture hopes to show the loggerheads that disparate people come to when they 're working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right , but unfortunately the roundabout way Minnelli unravels this stew is neither informative , enlightening nor entertaining . * * from * * * *
0 This film just goes to prove that not every film made during the glory days of Hollywood is worth seeing . Just because you 've got an excellent ensemble cast does n't mean that this can overcome a script that was probably written by a chimp ! Think about it -- the film featured Richard Widmark , Lauren Bacall , Charles Boyer , Gloria Graham , Lillian Gish and Paul Stewart and yet it still was a bad film ! The basic premise of the film is n't bad -- a private psychiatric hospital where the staff are more screwed up than the patients ! Also , the subplot involving the overworked husband and wife ( Widmark and Graham ) had a lot of promise . However , the script was handled with all the finesse and deftness of a drunk buffalo -- with bellicose and way over the top scenes again and again in the film . In fact , it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of " General Hospital " . Subtle , this film ai n't ! ! Realistic , this film ai n't ! ! < br /><br />While most of the reason this film reeked was the awful script , but I also blame the producers as well for miscasting and misusing come veteran actors . For example , Paul Stewart may not be a household name but this character actor had exceptional talent -- especially when playing gangsters in Film Noir movies . Yet here , Stewart is cast as a very nondescript psychiatrist with some bizarre European accent -- it just did n't work since this was well outside his acting range and his character was totally undeveloped and one - dimensional . Also , Charles Boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place . Seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heartland of America just seemed bizarre.<br /><br />Overall , this is a rather awful film . It is very watchable in a train wreck sort of way but it certainly is n't very pretty . My wife and I disliked much of the movie but also felt it could have been very good had the writing been competent.<br /><br />PS -- In a case of art imitating life , Oscar Levant played one of the patients . In real life , the brilliant Levant spent much of his life in and out of mental institutions .
0 " The Cobweb " is an example of many examples of movies that feature strong , sometimes noteworthy performances and high points , but unfortunately are shattered and slowed down drastically by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience . It stars Richard Widmark as a doctor working at a mental institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ludicrous and overworked conflict that really seems like no big deal at all.<br /><br />The plot is preposterous . Its time for the institution to get new drapes for the library windows . One old woman wants to have her drapes put over them , but a lot of the patients want to make their own . And somehow , this ridiculous and unintentionally loony conflict breaks out into the point where lives are in danger and families start to fall apart . It sounds more like a conflict that would occur between very young children.<br /><br />The questioning of the logic of the plot and whether it could really happen is so massive that one wonders if only a real - like lunatic could buy it . Do n't get me wrong , there 's nothing wrong with the acting . The cast following Widmark is composed of other great actors , many of them Academy Award - nominees and winners . And there is occasionally a moment in the film that works out brilliantly , but it always excludes the stupid plot about window drapes . Unfortunately , there is too much about the doggone drapes and thus , the movie slows down . A lot of the takes are long and done from one camera viewpoint , adhering to the slow pacing and lack of viewing interest.<br /><br />In a short analysis , " The Cobweb " is an unrecognized film and it becomes obvious why to the viewers basically as soon as the plot comes into focus , which it does pretty quickly . It just really does n't sound like much fun to watch and I tell you that it is not much fun to watch .
0 Featured in 1955 's THE COBWEB is an all star cast ranging from silent screen veteran LILLIAN GISH to Actors Studio progeny SUSAN STRASBERG . Set at an exclusive psychiatric hospital , what is this movie about you wonder ...... high drama ? Doctor & patient relationships ? Shock therapy treatment ? No , this howler is about who exactly will get to pick the draperies for a psychiatric hospital ! You think I 'm kidding ? You wo n't believe your eyes as you 're watching this unbelievable storyline that was turned into a movie ! Progressive head shrink Dr. McIver ( RICHARD WIDMARK ) wants to have all of the hospital 's patients involved in the design , selection and execution of the needed new draperies . McIver 's wife played by marble mouthed GLORIA GRAHAM wants to get her 2 cents in on this monumental task too . So does long time staffer Miss Inch ( LILLIAN GISH ) . Directed by VINCENT MINELLI , you kinda wonder if he really became this overly involved in minute detail because of his marriage to worry wart JUDY GARLAND . Talented actors like LAUREN BACALL , SUSAN STRASBERG , CHARLES BOYER , and JOHN KERR are wasted in this hokey story . What were they thinking ?
0 Sean , you know I think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world , but I ca n't commend you for this . Comedy just is n't your strong suit.<br /><br />However , it was n't all your fault . Some of the stuff was just too hard to understand . Alfred Lynch did a decent job , but you got ta wonder where the lines came from from the beginning.<br /><br />Once again , Sean ... I apologize .
0 Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view . The plot is pretty much foreseeable , the characters are stereotypes , the editing too exaggerated . Anyway , the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions . < br /><br />Instead , I think this is a straight commercial thing . Including a character from the french part of Switzerland ( the actor IS the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie - the band 's called SENS UNIK ) seems to aim to a larger audience . A straight German - swiss movie would not have sold in the french part - and vice versa . What really got on my nerves were the product placements all over the movie . Sometines scenes remembered of advertisement clips ! < br /><br />I also think the topic of " young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives " is a wide spread reality in Zurich . Therefore , it should be elaborated with more care . I hope Samir got enough money with Snow White , in order that his next movie is gon na show his true artistic skills .
0 I blind bought this movie and am pretty upset that I paid as much as I did but I would say that it 's at least worth a rent for some cool deaths and laughable acting . It is not a good movie in any way but I must say that I was pretty darn entertained . I guess it could be called so - bad - it's - good.<br /><br />As I said , the acting is awful , I feel like I could have done a better job showing , at least , any emotion . The story is nothing new and has been done better . I guess I just have a soft spot for any carnival - esquire type film . I would say rent this or download it but definitely do n't buy it . It is not worth more than one watch .
0 A family traveling for their daughter 's softball league decide to take the ' scenic route ' and end up in the middle of nowhere . The father is an avid photographer , and when he hears of an old abandoned side show in the town , he decides to take another detour to take some photographs.<br /><br />Of course , the side show is filled with inbred freaks , who promptly kidnap the women and leave the young son and father to fend for themselves.<br /><br />The only cool thing about this film is how the family actually fights back against their inbred captors . Other than that , there 's nothing worthwhile about the film .
0 I 'm a huge Randolph Scott fan , but this film is a dud . The whole thing has a canned , fake , soundstage feel to it , with truly awful rear - screen projection . It has a good plot idea that the screenwriter has successfully buried in a nitwit script , which makes it impossible for the audience to become immersed in the action and truly care about any of the characters . The directing is pedestrian , and only accentuates how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it . I 've seen plenty of thoroughly enjoyable " soundstage productions " before , but this is not one of them . All it does is make you appreciate the gritty Scott / Boetticher films all the more.<br /><br />Randolph Scott is tanned , trim , and shines that million dollar smile throughout . He 's always a pleasure ... even in the worst of his films . Aside from Scott , the other main reason I wanted to see this movie was due to how much I enjoyed Ms. Wymore in Errol Flynn 's movie , " Rocky Mountian " . In " Man Behind the Gun " , she is just as beautiful , and you can tell she 's a good actress , but she was forced to say some pretty dumb lines , and the blocking she was given by the director was truly awful . I 've only seen Phil Carey in " Operation Pacific " , and he plays the exact same character here ... an arrogant pain - in - the - butt you want to beat into unconsciousness . I guess it proves he 's a good actor ... he made me hate him . There are some lame attempts at comic relief that only detract from the film , in my opinion . Although there are many elements to knock , I must say that I found myself truly enjoying the two Spanish songs sung in the musical numbers ... but that 's not why we go to see Randolph Scott movies , right?<br /><br />There are definitely worse Scott films out there , and this one certainly is n't unbearable , but it also certainly could n't be deemed anything beyond mediocre .
0 Oh dear!What a disappointment . I 've been watching old Westerns on British TV for decades , and I was n't aware of this one until its showing yesterday - most other Scott Westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth watching again.<br /><br />The rich colour and outdoor sets were good , but that 's all I can say about this film . I have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made . Several times I felt like turning it off , and finally I did , halfway through , something I hardly ever do.<br /><br />Scott seemed unusually oily in charming the girls , his two sidekicks were annoying and so was the Mexican bandit lad . And I 've a feeling the army uniforms were 20 years or so too modern , not that this has bothered makers of many other Westerns.<br /><br />Perhaps it got better in the second half , but I could n't be bothered to wait and see .
0 The explosion of TV channels must be eternally grateful to the Randolph Scott Western production line , because any any moment there must be one of what seems like a hundred Randolph Scott movies playing on at least one no - budget station.<br /><br />"Man Behind The Gun " is a typical early 1950 's period melodrama with pre - WWII production values that relies on a historically - topical murder mystery plot peppered with action scenes to disguise the script 's complete absence of character development , and thus lack of suspense . In years to come the role of these films would be taken over by TV shows like ' Gunsmoke ' , ' Bonanza ' , etc - and these actually did the job better . Randolph Scott , looking particularly grizzled in this , is the good guy , struggling against the bad guys against whom he will eventually prevail . There 's no more interest in what he goes through emotionally than in what his horse is feeling , unless you count wondering whether he 'll sort out the initial misunderstanding with the female lead by the end . The music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the ' characters ' than the acting is . But it 's fine if that floats your boat ; and I would n't berate you for enjoying ' Diagnosis , Murder ' , either.<br /><br />Workmanlike , pedestrian , and ageing rapidly . 3 stars for being competently put together ; 0 for artistic endeavour .
0 This piece of crap might have been acclaimed 60 years ago , but it is one of the most racist movies ever made with the Native American Indians played by white men . The right - wing Republican James Stewart was a huge racist in real life , just like his close friend John Wayne . In 1971 Stewart had actor Hal Williams fired from " The Jimmy Stewart Show " ( a short - lived series that mercifully flopped ) just because Williams was black . As if that were not bad enough , this film is very dated and boring . Watch " Dances with Wolves " instead for a less racist view.<br /><br />Stewart was in his forties when this awful movie was made , and even with his ridiculous wig he still looked like a paedophile chasing after 16-year - old Debra Paget . I 'm surprised it was even allowed.<br /><br />0/10 .
0 I guess if you are into the sci - fi and horror stuff it might be interesting . The acting was okay but not great . The two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen but are played by obviously older actresses who turned out to be twenty and twenty - one at the time . The plot is okay , but the story does jump around a bit , leaving one guessing whether you 're in Boston or Pennsylvania . The priest seems to use warp speed between the two . The catholic church is portrayed as having a secretive sect for investigating events which only happen to those of that faith . What if the two girls had been protestant ? Would the catholics of cared ? Therefore some what contrived . Who knows , some day the catholic church might even learn what the Bible teaches . If you miss this one , do n't feel you 've lost anything .
0 Actually , the movie is neither horror nor Sci - Fi . With a very strong Christian religious theme , this movie delivers minimal content and no suspense . Second - tier actors do half - decent jobs of reading their boring roles . The only good performance is by Sydney Penny who plays a role of a mother of ... I wo n't spoil the movie , it 's either Christ or Anti - Christ . Avoid watching this movie unless you a Christian religious fanatic obsessed with apocalypse.<br /><br />Being a non - Christian , I had to force myself to watch this movie just because I wanted to write this review . It 's a pity that Sci - Fi channel had to air this movie at the peak evening time .
0 This movie is AWESOME . I watched it the other day with my cousin Jay - Jay . He said it was alright , but i think it RULEZZZ ! I mean , it 's so cool . Ted V. Mikels is so brave and smart . He made a movie totally unlike those terrible Hollywood films , like the Matrix and STop or my Mom will Shoot . It could have been better , though . I like ninjas and pirates . I also like that big talon that the funny man wears . I think he 's the coolest guy since that Domino Pizza claymation guy . Not only does this movie look really cool , like those out - of - focus movies my dad made of my birthday when I turned 6 . BUt it tells a complex tale with dozens of characters that seem to be totally unrelated , but they all meet up in the end . It 's genius how this web is woven to make everything meet up . I wish Ted V. Mikels would make a sequel . But it needs more aliens . And a pirate .
0 The original exploitation classic - though far from enjoyable on almost any level concerning some guys who turn cats into human flesh eating monsters because the cat food they make is made with people is remade with scifi elements added . The cats ca n't get enough and when the flesh tainted food runs out the cats turn on their owners . Poorly put together on almost every level this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to actually play movie theaters in the early 1970 's updated with alien cat and dog races battling for supremacy . Director Ted Mikel is a hack , but is so lovable a person ( I generally like the guy thanks to his smile inducing interviews and commentary tracks ) that you can pretty much excuse the garbage he mostly turned out . Mikels wanted to make films and he did n't care how they turned out so long as he was producing something . More power to him , but I wish he would n't subject us to his home movies
0 Want a great recipe for failure ? Take a s****y plot , add in some weak , completely undeveloped characters and than throw in the worst special effects a horror movie has known . Let stew for a week ( the amount of time probably spent making this trash ) . The result is Corpse Grinders , a movie that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotically low places.<br /><br />The movie utterly blew . My words can not convey how painful it was to watch . This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of . This is not Plan 9 From Outer Space . This is a long , boring , sad waste of time . Corpse Grinders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I have ever seen . I depresses me when I realize that people actually took time out of their lives to act in this shit , if you can call it acting . But than again , when you have poor direction , poor storywriting , poor everything , acting is the last thing to criticize.<br /><br />This movie is like a huge , disgusting turd that you yearn to quickly flush out of existence , fearful that a friend or loved one might somehow see it . I really with I could somehow destroy every copy of this film , so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers . Thank you , Ted V. Mikels , for giving me new found respect for every movie I have ever seen . You have shown me what is truly awful , and why I should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy or boring .
0 Ted V. Mikels 's film Corpse Grinders 2 is 103 minutes of excruciating cinematic swill . The plot is pretty much a mixture of nonsensical business dealings among people who grind corpses into cat food while cat aliens , who are losing a war with dog aliens , looking to get some of this cat food . Watching this movie , I began to look for any kind of distraction , anything to reassure myself that I was doing something else besides losing my mind from the inside out.<br /><br />Several scenes go on for far too long , as characters take forever to do simple things . I 've heard that Mr. Mikels does n't like to use jump cuts too often , fearful that they will confuse his audience . I 'm not sure if this attitude is " avant - garde " or just " stupid . " Try as I might , I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters in the unnecessarily huge cast , well with the possible exception of the old men who are the caretakers of the factory . The majority of the cast are a bunch of no - talent amateurs who do n't even bother to learn the lyrics to " Amazing Grace " before they have to sing it on camera . Although perhaps the blame should go to the poor sound quality , since I only actually heard around 80 % of the dialogue while watching the DVD.<br /><br />This is quite possibly the worst film to ever be shot . I 've listened to snippets of the commentary , and Mr. Mikels comes off as a surprisingly sweet old man , what the hell was he doing making this kind of trash ? I 'd like to hear the explanations from the old men who had to lie shirtless on a metal conveyor belt waiting to be ground up . Movies I 've long hated suddenly seem a lot better . I long for the intermittedly appropriate music of Excalibur , and the consistent lighting of Dawn of the Dead . I need to go do something , anything . Do n't see this movie .
0 I am a huge fan of Ted V Mikels and the original " Corpse Grinders " is the main reason why but this is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen . Even the brilliant casting of the legendary Liz Renay ( " Desperate Living " ) could not save this worthless piece of garbage . This film should serve as a lesson to all past , present and future film makers ... when you have a film as successful as the original " Corpse Grinders " was you should probably leave sleeping dogs lie and you should definitely not try to revitalize it over twenty years later ( unless you have the financial backing to pull of a superior sequel such as Herschel Gordon Lewis did with " Blood Feast 2 : All U can Eat " ) Even if you do decide to do this you should probably spend a little bit more money than you did on the original and for god 's sake ... NEVER film a movie onto video ... why do film makers even attempt to do this when everyone knows the quality is going to turn out hideous ... I personally have yet to see one film made in this fashion that 's even worth the powder to blow it to hell ... if you ca n't afford to make a sequel that is better than your original film then sell the rights of the film to someone who can ... and what was Ted V Mikels thinking about ( or smoking ) when he wrote this god - awful script ? I mean come on , dog and cat " aliens " from another planet ? A cardboard box painted to look like a devastating machine capable of grinding up human bodies ... bones and clothes and all ? If any of these actors , aside from Liz Renay , were paid more than five dollars for their hideous performances than they are grossly overpaid ! Avoid this film at all costs and watch the original instead .
0 In a far away Galaxy is a planet called Ceta . It 's native people worship cats . But the dog people wage war upon these feline loving people and they have no choice but to go to Earth and grind people up for food . This is one of the stupidest f#@k!ng ideas for a movie I 've seen . Leave it to Ted Mikels to make a movie more incompetent than the already low standard he set in previous films . It 's like he enjoying playing in a celluloid game of Limbo . How low can he go ? The only losers in the scenario are US the viewer . Mr. Mikels and his silly little handlebar mustache actually has people who STILL buy this crap.<br /><br />My Grade : F < br /><br />DVD Extras : Commentary by Ted Mikels ; the Story behind the Making of ( 9 and a half minutes ) ; 17 minutes , 15 seconds of Behind the scenes footage ; Ted Mikels filmography ; and Trailers for " The Worm Eaters " " Girl in Gold Boots " , " the Doll Squad " , " Ten Violent Women " ( featuring nudity ) , " Blood Orgy of the She Devils " , & " the Corpse Grinders "
0 The plot of Corpse Grinders 2 is very much similar to the original Corpse Grinders , what is left that is different from the other film consists of weird aliens.<br /><br />It is my belief that this film would be the # 1 worst film on IMDb - if anyone had actually watched it . The plot is disconnected and , in several ( way too many ) instances , makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . The real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous ( but still somewhat better ) film.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh .
0 This horrible ! The acting , costumes , production values , editing , the script , everything about this film is as bad as it can get . It looks as if it was filmed with a video camera . Can you give a movie a negative rating ? Watch The Ring instead .
0 I found myself very caught up in this movie , at least at the beginning , and any credit I give to this movie , is Lacey Chabert , she was fantastic ! ! But that s where it ends . I seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is , and I like it when a movie is able to completely baffel me , but I felt out and out lied to , they whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end , they gave no hit to it at all , that s not misleading that very bad writing and planning , someone did not think at all!<br /><br />I felt the movie would have been much better if they had stuck to the plot that the lead you on , they also seemed to not answer anything , why did Jane(maria ) burn down the professor 's house.<br /><br />Its a great pity as I felt it started out as a relatively good movie .
0 I found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible.<br /><br />The only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was Lacy Chabert 's performance who I thought played the multiple personalities really well . For me she was definitely the highlight of this movie.<br /><br />Dina Meyer was pretty as always but I found her role pretty bland so I do n't think one can say that her acting was great.<br /><br />As for the male lead , Armand Assante , his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese 1980s hospital series.<br /><br />All of that I could have lived with . However the terrible , terrible , terrible end / solution , the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing I have seen in a long time .
0 " Cement " is a bad movie about a bad cop ( Penn ) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition who has a bad guy in a bad way up to his cajones in fast drying concrete . While we 're waiting for the cement to dry and the film to figure out what it 's about , we 're periodically jerked back in time without rhyme or reason so we can watch events leading up to the cement thing . A boring junk flick overall , " Cement " suffers from lack of a story , a clumsy execution , and that most ubiquitous of filmdom 's faults ; no reason to care . A time killer for the needy couch potato at best . ( D+ )
0 Where to begin ? How about with the erroneous synopsis : < br /><br />"X - Men Origins : Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine 's epically violent and romantic past , his complex relationship with Victor Creed , and the ominous Weapon X program." < br /><br />His epically violent past turns out to exceptionally non - violent.<br /><br />His relationship with Creed is so glossed over it 's difficult to understand how they have any connection at all . We are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run , to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan , and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of assassins.<br /><br />There is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all . Nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving . < br /><br />The romantic element of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and abrupt . We are thrown into a romance so fast that it 's over before you can blink an eye . Having just introduced the character , Silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later . We are left wondering why we should care about this . Who was she anyway?<br /><br />For a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story , the romance is surprisingly unexplored . It was rushed in simply because it was required.<br /><br />Oddly enough , when Wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find Sabertooth . Being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprise.<br /><br />As for the weapon X program , lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure Wolverine is up and running . Eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple . Surprisingly Ma and Pa Kent are n't alarmed when finding a naked sweaty man in their barn . Is it any wonder what fate awaits them?<br /><br />In the previous films and the comic books , the main reason that Wolverines ' amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldblooded.<br /><br />Knowing this was the case ... did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates?<br /><br />As hinted to in X2 : X - men United when Stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together . This film sets up the team fairly well only they do n't really do much of anything . No disturbing violence , no ruthless actions , they merely harass a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen . < br /><br />It seems that Wolverine was n't an evil man under Stryker at all . Instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother Sabertooth which consequently WAS the violent agent we all thought Wolverine was . Eventually he just leaves all together.<br /><br />No conflict of duality here at all.<br /><br />Idiotically REMOVING that character conflict of good and evil DULLED the story immensely . They may as well have given him rubber claws.<br /><br />There were a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the X - Men trilogy , including the introduction of one of the lamest Deus Ex Machinas to ever hit a script.<br /><br />Magic memory - erasing bullets . < br /><br />Really?<br /><br />Apparently they are the only thing to bring down Wolverine . Yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all.<br /><br />Another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on Wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all . Interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story . Most were in the film for 5 - 10 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of Wolverine.<br /><br />Fred Dukes ( the Blob but not the comic version ) can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all , but a simple headbutt from Wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him?<br /><br />Cyclops optic beams ( which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers ) can burn through buildings but when fired at Sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes . Adamantium trench coats anyone?<br /><br />The ( gravity defying ) mutant Gambit , instead of utilizing his signature cards , is made into some sort of crazy acrobat . In one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by Wolverine ... then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running TOWARDS Wolverine . How he regained consciousness , ran away a few blocks , climbed up a building , then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained.<br /><br />Some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash . The idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect.<br /><br />The comic book source material , the REAL origin of Wolverine ... is a story worth bringing to the screen . It does n't sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless CGI junkies . It is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time , began with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor - Smith . A much more intense and exciting story.<br /><br />This FOX film should seriously be forgotten . < br /><br />Anyone have that magic gun?<br /><br />4/10
0 All of the X - Men movies were great . And I mean all of them , including the long hated X - Men 3 . They had solid characters ( Magneto and Xavier were the best ones , in my opinion ) , and a good story arch.<br /><br />I was all excited when I heard this movie was on production , and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until I saw the movie . I was so disappointed.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor ( his best movie is The Fountain , although you wo n't hear about this movie when they talk about the actor ) , and his acting is not what screws the movie up.<br /><br />The whole film is plagued with lots of meaningless characters that add nothing to the plot ( like Blob or Gambit ) , which were tossed there to make fans believe that the film makers had read the original comics.<br /><br />I am a fan of XMen , I have read many , many of their stories and this movie respected none of them . None . Not even the continuity . It does n't respect Weapon X project , or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth , or Emma Frost , the motivations for wolverine are plain stupid and seen in millions of movies : Revenge for the death of a loved one.<br /><br />Oh . What I was expecting the whole darn movie was a Berseker moment for Wolverine similar to the one he has in X2 in the school when Stryker men come in and he alone decimates the enemy forces , but hey , this is Fox , this a family flick and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and gruesome Marvel hero.<br /><br />Besides , I had a feeling of constant dejá vù with this movie because Wolverine 's Origins are already explained in X2 , we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton so it kind of does not make sense to make a movie of something we already know.<br /><br />I personally believe that wolverine is one of those few characters that does not need a solid back - story because mystery is the nature of the character . Do we really want to know how the Joker got his scars ?
0 This film was slated to be a blockbuster film , and it really is . This is the type of movie that is made to eat popcorn to and watch the flashy graphics . With that in mind , the movie delivers , perhaps not as well as the ultra flashy Iron Man , but well enough . Outside of the popcorn munching action and special effects , the film drops off of the cliff faster than Wile E. Coyote.<br /><br />Many viewers , myself included , will complain about how most of the characters were severely altered , but that only makes the film a poor adaptation , not a poor film . This film is unsatisfactory for other reasons . The makers focused more on making it appealing to the eye than they did to the mind . The characters that have been long awaited and promoted are reduced to 4-scene cameos . The main characters of Wolverine , Victor Creed ( never called Sabertooth in the film ) and Colonel Stryker are well developed . I was pleasantly surprised by Liev Schriber 's performance . The rest of the characters are tossed to the wayside to make way for the all important eye - candy . Wolverine 's character is fully developed after 30-minutes , as is Sabertooth , though Victor does pull off some surprises late in the film.<br /><br />The " final boss " of the film is a twisted and perverse adaptation of the original character and barely gets any development to show just why he is the way he is . The filmmakers obviously felt that all they really needed to do was create a bad ass character who could do anything they wanted and slapped on the name of a popular character.<br /><br />Very disappointing ...
0 Soulless milking of cash cow franchise . Generic superhero flick . CGI showcase . Gavin Hood 's " A Series of Improbable Events .

0 Most would agree that the character of Wolverine is one of the most intriguing characters in comic book history . I 'm no Marvel expert , but I did grow up with the adventures of the X - Men and definitely approved of Hugh Jackman 's now widely known portrayal of the scruffy Logan . I enjoyed the first X - Men , found the sequel too heavy and messy and liked the third one as comic book entertainment . All through the three movies , I probably enjoyed Jackman more than anything else . I figured the idea of making an " origins "- movie about Wolverine could very well end up being a better movie than all of the three X - Men movies . If we concentrate on one character , I figured there could be a movie that achieves what I found the second movie failed at - being a fairly complex and character driven comic book adventure.<br /><br />The reason that the Wolverine - movie fails is not because the competition is tougher after The Dark Knight . It 's not even because of a plot development that is beyond obvious and rudimentary - even though that certainly is n't good - no , it 's because the movie does n't even seem to try . To begin with , this does not qualify as good entertainment . There is something about the action in this movie that comes off as so very , very automatic . With no greater special effects or elements of suspense , and when one event will make you predict the following five , it almost feels like an Uwe Boll movie , imitating an action / adventure movie concept that you 've seen a dozen times before . Of course , nothing in this movie is as downright awful as a piece of Bolls**t but when everybody 's talking clichés as if they are part of a chain of events that is so standard , you at least make the connection and that surely is bad enough.<br /><br />But there is an even bigger problem . Even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and , by the way , that makes you forgive a lot of plot holes and character stupidities . I think you find the most fundamental flaw in the very title . I mean , " Origins " . Really ? What to the people behind this movie think about that title ? What do they mean ? ? You want to know the origins of Wolverine ? He grew up with his brother . They ran away from home during dramatic circumstances . Then they went off to war . All of them ! The Civil War , World War I and II and Vietnam too . Why did they do this ? Still unknown . Eventually , the brother ( Sabertooth , played by Liev Shrieber ) became evil . " How ? " you ask . I do n't know , it was somewhere between Omaha Beach and Hanoi . " Yeah , but why ? " you still ask . I just said I do n't know ! ! The movie does n't explain . He 's evil alright ! " Yeah , but ... you know , ' origins ' " ... Yeah , well that 's an origin ! I mean , duh ! Anyway , eventually they end up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers . Something with the government , ho - hum . Wolvie gets enough and leave his brother . For six years he 's a happy lumberjack with a loved one , who ends up a little defenseless around the time Sabretooth suddenly appears again . " Yeaaah ... but ... whyyyy ? " - Oh shut up ! - and Wolvie decides to be a guinneapig for a bunch of evil scientist who make him a flesh - covered metal war animal . He goes after all the bad guys and they come after him and after all the fighting he ends up with his memory wiped , cue X - Men the first movie.<br /><br />There . That 's the origin . You can also find it on the back of the DVD cover . The actual movie wo n't tell you anything else . With no worthwhile scenes of action , no good heroes , villains or characters in general ( lines from my couch audience : Fat suit ! Token black guy ! Oh , I give you 200 in cash if that girl survives this movie .. , That is supposed to be Gambit ... ? mmhm , yeah well ... uh - huh , right ) , not one line of memorable dialog and zero lines to cover a T - shirt with , added to that the common stupid things that ruin the plausibility in general that you might usually forgive ...... well , that sounds pretty much like a waste of time , right ? Fans will check this out , or have already . There 's no stopping that . But if you liked the X - Men movies for no other reason than that they were well - made and entertaining - see them again and do yourself no favors by trying to look for origins where there are none .
0 It was n't notable enough to be truly horrible , it was just incredibly lame . The story was not half bad , but the execution was just horrendous.<br /><br />To start with , it moved too fast for us to emotionally get involved with what was going on . It was just paced badly . The dialog was so utterly un - sparkling , just flat and boring.<br /><br />And the characters , cripes almightly , they made Deadpool boring . How the hell do you make Deadpool boring ? He was n't even funny . He was n't crazy . He was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords he did not even know how to use properly.<br /><br />Gambit was boring . And since when did he have telekenisis to make the cards just float and fly around , or super strength to leap hundreds of feet into the air ? And what the heck was up with all the stupid helicopter moves ? I mean , we know they are mutants , but they still exist within the realm of physics . A round bo staff is not a helicopter blade , you can not fly by twirling super - duper fast . Which Gambit would n't be able to do anyway . Nor Deadpool , especially when using it as a replacement for real fight choreography.<br /><br />And this film stands as proof that wire work should only be used by fight coordinators who know WTH they are doing , and know better than to use it in every . single . shot . as a replacement for real fight choreography.<br /><br />Three of the most physical fighters in Marvel comics ( Logan , Creed , and Wilson ) , and some of the worst fight choreography I have ever seen in recent film memory . It was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged his shoulders and left it all up to the special effects guys.<br /><br />And then you had the break out , with all these mutants who did nothing . Even mutants who had been shown in their cells to have powers ( nice to see a Quicksilver nod ) , did f - all when they got out . Only Emma - really - lame - for - this - film - Frost and Cyclops did something.<br /><br />And since when was Logan so pretty ? And the stupid , " The bullet will take his memory away . " Do n't you think Xavier and the X - Men would have noticed the big freaking bullet holes in his adamantium skull when they X - rayed him in X1 ? I felt sorry for Liev Schrieber man , he actually brought in a good Sabretooth considering the script . He made one of Marvel 's more simple super villains feel real . But he could not save the film from it 's own epic lameness.<br /><br />Seriously , this was " Daredevil " level of suck . Decent story , good actors , absolutely horrible execution .
0 I saw most of " My Bollywood Bride " today at the IAAC film festival in New York and had to leave the theater due to feelings of nausea welling up within me . I 've seen Bollywood movies , and I 've seen satires of Bollywood movies . This movie could n't decide which one it wanted to be , so it ended up being a joke on itself.<br /><br />It seems to have been liberally copied from movies like Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling , and what a sloppy , lazy job at that . How can Bollywood ever be weaned off of its determination to stick to overused , well - trodden scripts ? Is there no one who can bring to the screen the millions of real , fascinating stories that surely exist and transpire in the land of a billion people ? The over - smart auto driver , the cow on the street , gratuitous scenes of foreign locations , pointless scenes of Mumbai streets , they 're all in there . Every possible cliché about India has been faithfully included . So sickeningly predictable . ugh ! ! ! Acting performances are weak across the board except for Neha Dubey , who is talented and beautiful . One wonders why she would pick a project like this .
0 Unbelievable!<br /><br />this film gets a 7 out 0f 10 . This has to be one of the worst films i have seen in years . not only was the acting incredibly bad , the storyline ( if you can call it that ) was just as bad . Offcourse everyone knows what 's going to happen within the first 5 minutes . Which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during leading up to that moment . That however , is not the case . There is no action , no suspense , not even a spark between the 2 leading actors . It was unfortunately a waste of my time , and certainly a waste of my money . < br /><br />and the 2 of merely for trying
0 I did n't expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend . It was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out . Still , I held out hope . It sounded a bit much like " Bride and Prejudice " ( L.A. guy falls for an Indian beauty , parental conflict , blah blah blah ) . B&P was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters.<br /><br />"My Bollywood Bride " had none of that . The acting seemed stilted and way to by - the - numbers . Characters were so cliché the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student . Technically , the sound really bothered me . It seemed as if there was a lot of over - dubbing of dialogue . I mean a lot . I know sometimes it 's necessary but it sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very distracting.<br /><br />Two stars is being somewhat generous .
0 An excellent performance by Alix Elias highlights an otherwise mis - directed and confused pile of dreck . I have seen this movie , perhaps 12 times , and with each run through , I find less and less pleasure . Why are Munchies so lustful ? Is that ever explained ? Are they a reflection of our wanton , boorish ' animal selves ? ' If they are , why not make it more obvious ? Why not peal back just a touch of the subtlety that plagues this movie , and make that connection explicit ? Another part of this movie that bothers me to no end - motorcycles . The jacket the little monster wears on the front cover seems to suggest ' street - wise ' traveler . The sun glasses say ' pretty cool dude . ' With all this I 'm ready for Easy Rider meets the Muppets . All I get is Munchies ( 1987 ) . What gives ? Stick to the Gremlins series if you 're a fan of diminutive , wise - cracking , reptile puppets - it 'll give you the treatment you deserve .
0 Not a knock on Korman as he was very funny on the Carol Burnett show . He was also good at playing secondary characters in Mel Brooks ' movies ( " High Anxiety " comes to mind ) . He is , however , not a person who can carry a movie in dueling roles no less . This one is basically a " Gremlins " knockoff , following a tradition of such movies as " Critters " and " Ghoulies " . It is not a very good knockoff either , on par with " Ghoulies " , but with a much lighter tone to it as it is no where near as dark as that movie got . In fact , this one is too light and frothy , and unfortunately many of the jokes end up falling flat . Though I did give it a 3 for a score , this is only because there is a movie that is even a worse " Gremlin " knockoff . If you watched Mystery Science Theater 3000 you know the one I am talking about ... the infamous " Hobgoblins " . This one has a guy finding a little critter in some underground place ( I only saw this movie once a long time ago so I do n't remember everything to clearly ) and it starts out friendly enough . However , this creature quickly becomes unfriendly and of course more are spawned and that is the movie . More misses than hits in the joke department , and it is also really lame to see Korman playing the evil brother role . Best to skip this one , but then you may want to check it out just for kicks .
0 Munchies starts in deepest darkest Peru ( looks more like a dirt road to me ) where archaeologist Simon Watterman ( Harvey Korman ) & his son Paul ( Charles Stratton ) are on an expedition . Simon thinks that ancient Aztec buildings were in fact spacecraft control centres & he is on a mission to gain proof that alien lifeforms have visited Earth , while in once such structure he discovers a strange small creature which he sticks in his backpack & takes back home with him to the small American town of Sweetwater in California . Simon feels that the creature is the proof he has been looking for & for some inexplicable reason decides to leave the thing at home while he goes to share his discovery . Simon ask 's Paul & his wife Cindy ( Nadine Van der Velde ) to take care of it . Meanwhile Simon 's brother & fast - food businessman Cecil Watterman ( Harvey Korman again ) steals the creature so his brother wo n't make any money out of it , but his idiotic stepson Dude ( Jon Stafford ) has a fight with it & chops it up with a knife but the individual parts grow back into separate little creatures that proceed to cause much havoc amongst the townspeople ... <br /><br />Directed by Bettina Hirsch this has to be one of the worst horror comedy 's ever , if not the worst . The script by Lance Smith is so unfunny it 's painful . Every joke in Munchies misses the target by the proverbial mile , I doubt the humour in this piece of crap would even appeal to pre - teens . There just is n't anything even remotely funny or even amusing in Munchies as far as I 'm concerned . The basic story is crap too , they just happen to find this creature running around with no explanation of what it is , why no - ones ever seen it before , how it manages to learn English so quickly & how it learns to drive etc . The whole thing is a big Gremlins ( 1984 ) rip - off with none of the elements that made that film so good . The character 's are moronic , the stupid Deputy ( Charlie Phillips ) & his dad ( Hardy Rawls ) , Cecil wearing an embarrassing wig & fake moustache & his air head wife Melvis ( Alix Elias ) & more besides . They just plain embarrass & are ridiculous , I defy anyone to find any of this rancid rubbish funny . Basically Munchies fails spectacularly at being either a comedy or horror & ends up being , yes you 've guessed it , crap.<br /><br />Director Hirsch was obviously working with a low budget here & it shows , the entire thing takes place in two houses , the desert , some caves & a miniature golf course . This is really cheap & incompetent film - making . The special effects on the Munchies themselves are really awful , their just dolls that have no movement unless someone off camera pulls a string attached to it 's arm . I can not stress how bad the effects are , these things would n't convince my 4 year old nephew ( as proved by me & him yesterday ! ) . Total incompetence all the way , this film sucks.<br /><br />Technically the film is terrible , bad special effects , lame production design , rubbish sets & well , just everything 's crap . The acting is rotten through & through , from the cops to Korman who has two roles both of which prove he ca n't act & is n't funny.<br /><br />Munchies is a really bad film that fails in everything that it tries to achieve , sure watch it if you want I wo n't stop you but just do n't say you were n't warned ! My advice would be to watch Gremlins again instead , but the decision is yours !
0 Ridiculous - looking little boogers that spawn foam and reproduce themselves . So far for the horror - elements this movie has . All the rest of MUNCHIES plays out like a really retarded comedy that 's so stupid you wo n't find it funny anymore after about 15 minutes . I can imagine little kids cheering for these little boogers , but adults will be left with only those supposedly " smart " references translating to on - screen stuff like Capt . Kirk 's log entries from STAR TREK , the most well - known scene from E.T. , a blatant statement from the filmmakers going " Look ! We 're cashing in on GREMLINS ' success here ! " and a cardboard cut - out of Clint Eastwood telling us ... what about his western movies exactly ? That last one was totally lost on me ... Oh yes , and chemical waste disposal in caves seems to be a bad thing . Do n't know where they got that idea from.<br /><br />Not to say that MUNCHIES is the most insufferable film to sit through , for that matter . It 's just really , really dumb . And if you manage to crack a smile while watching it , you 'll probably feel as dumb yourself for having done that after the film 's finished.<br /><br />Good Badness ? Yes , but only if " dumb " , " retarded " & " ridiculous " are criteria you 're looking for . 3/10 and , well , uhm , 6/10 .
0 I think i watched this movie , but do n't quote me , as i may have fallen asleep during watching it as it did n't exactly " grip my excitement and imagination . " At least i know i watched enough of it to know i wo n't be watching it again soon . Or ever.<br /><br />Jeez , talk about lame ... Really lame . Totally lame . It would n't even appeal to a six year old . It basically had NO worthwhile dramatic impact . Zilch . Nada . Just shlock turned into dreck . Comedy ? That was supposed to be comedy ? Ya coulda fooled me - ee - ee ... !<br /><br />Now , if the aliens had been insatiably carnivorous like in the movie " Critters " , we could have had the human characters do something a little more profound than be overly smugly cutesy ... like yelling and screaming and running for their lives so they would n't be eaten so the story could be something more exciting than watching paint dry.<br /><br />Don't bother watching this . It 's not worth the effort . You can find something more interesting to do . Like watching paint dry . Or falling asleep .
0 Cute and playful , but lame and cheap . ' Munchies ' is another Gremlins clone to come out from the 80s . I 'm not much of a fan of the imitations.<br /><br />First it was the excellent ' Gremlins'.<br /><br />Then came the very average ' Critters'.<br /><br />Lets not forget the lousy ' Ghoulies'.<br /><br />But the complete pits would have to go to ' Hobgoblins'.<br /><br />Is there more ? ? < br /><br />Now ' Munchies ' for me would have to fall somewhere between ' Ghoulies ' and ' Hobgoblins ' . Actually I probably found it more entertaining than ' Ghoulies ' , but I preferred thst one 's darker tone . < br /><br />From the get - go it plays up its goofy nature ( which it 's better for it ) , but due to that nature the hammy acting ( Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips ) , can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the munchies running amok . That 's where the fun occurs . Mostly light - hearted fluff though , as the story mainly centres on the munchies ( who are either hungry , horny and destructive ) in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounters ( some moments do work ) in the small desert town as a couple of people are on the chase . It 's silly , but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing . The creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed , as they 're basic dolls being chucked about . Where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak ... and with attitude.<br /><br />Charlie Stratton and a feisty Nadine Van der Velde ( who was in ' Critters ' ) were fair leads . Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles . Robert Picardo also pops up.<br /><br />Amusingly low - cut entertainment for the undemanding .
0 . . . And that 's a bad thing , because at least if this had been a Troma film , it would have had wanton violence and a greater sense of anarchic abandon that might have brought my rating up a bit.<br /><br />So what we have instead is a very tame ( rated PG ) , barely lukewarm , low budget ( Roger Corman produced it with an unknown director who has subsequently remained unknown ) Gremlins ( 1984)/Critters ( 1986)-wannabe with almost exclusively flat humor , little of the logic that made Gremlins work so well -- fantasy logic or not , no suspense , no sense of adventure , and no violence or nudity to make up for it.<br /><br />Although I 'm sure some of the problems with the film are inherent in the script -- let 's face it , no one could deliver these jokes so that they would be funny -- it seems like the biggest blame has to fall into the lap of the director , Bettina Hirsch . In more capable hands , Munchies could have been entertaining.<br /><br />After all , it starts out like many great adventure films . Simon Waterman ( Harvey Korman ) and his son Paul ( Charles Stratton ) are in Peru on an archaeological dig . Simon is a bit of a wacky archaeologist who is always floating theories about the connections between ancient sites and alien civilizations . For example , he thinks he sees evidence of laser - cutting on ancient stonework . So they 're at Machu Picchu looking for more evidence of Simon 's theories when they happen upon a secret chamber . Inside they quickly find the animal they later dub " Arnold " , one of the titular munchies.<br /><br />They take Arnold back home to their small California desert town . Simon , who thinks that Arnold is probably an alien creature , has to go off to a colleague 's lecture , and he plans on telling the colleague that he finally has an alien specimen . Paul and his extremely cute girlfriend , Cindy ( Nadine Van der Velde ) , are left in charge of Arnold , but as they have n't seen each other in a long time , they leave Arnold unsupervised while they hop in the sack.<br /><br />Meanwhile , Simon 's brother Cecil ( played also by Korman in a dual role ) , owner of a successful snack foods company , is eager to buy off Simon 's home and land -- they're adjacent to his own . Simon does n't want to sell , so Cecil hits upon a scheme to steal Arnold . Things gradually spiral out of control , and the munchies , who have a mean streak to go along with their cravings for junk food , begin to overrun the town.<br /><br />That reads better in a summary than it plays on the screen . The best shots in the film are those with natural landscapes in the background , such as when characters are driving on the outskirts of the desert town . Interiors , with the exception of Cecil 's home , tend to look like poorly decorated , cheap sets , and more importantly , they tend to show that Hirsch is not very skilled at blocking and setting up shots . Oddly , given the paucity of the production design overall , Cecil 's home is quite a gem , imbued as it is in overblown 1980s style down to the smallest details , and Cecil 's stepson , Dude ( Jon Stafford ) , was an amusing counterpoint . Too bad , then , that he 's out of the film so quickly.<br /><br />At any rate , Korman is a fun actor , but he comes across much better here as Simon than as Cecil . Unfortunately , Simon ends up being absent for most of the film . Cecil , who is differentiated physically by a ridiculous wig and facial hair , is not only the " evil capitalist " of the film , he 's one of Korman 's classic inconsiderate , boorish characters -- that was one of his specialties , frequently capitalized on in " Carol Burnett Show " ( 1967 ) skits . Unlike " The Carol Burnett Show " , which tended to succeed because directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers had a studied way of pushing the skits just to the brink of chaos , Hirsch reins Korman in way too far , and the Cecil character just does n't work the way it should.<br /><br />There are a lot of other director - related problems , not the least of which is wonky pacing and editing , which completely sap any possible suspense or compelling dramatic impact from the film . Even scenes that should have been shoe - ins for amping up the drama -- such as when the munchies are harassing an old lady on the road -- are put together far too awkwardly to have much affect.<br /><br />There are also serious logical problems with the story as it stands . Where did the munchie in the chamber at Machu Picchu come from ? The film 's trailer seems to show an answer to this , but it was edited out of the final cut . A more serious problem is that , unlike gremlins , there is no clear reason for munchies to go from cute , cuddly furballs to menacing monsters . It just happens . Further , because Munchies was kept PG , and the violence remains toned down , when the creatures are in their monster phase , they 're never very threatening . They 're also easily dispatched , at least temporarily.<br /><br />Admittedly , the gist of the film is n't suspense , horror , compelling drama or any of that other stuff , but humor . It 's intended more as a spoof of Gremlins and the countless rip - offs in its wake . The only problem with that is that the film just is n't funny , even though I chuckled a couple times . A surprisingly high percentage of the jokes are bland clichés . Too much of the remaining material consists of non - sequiturs . Given bad timing from Hirsch , it all just falls flat . There was potential to make a film that while a spoof , was both funny and frightening , hilarious and disturbing , cheesy and suspenseful , all at the same time , ala Killer Klowns from Outer Space ( 1988 ) . Too bad , then , that Munchies comes nowhere near that .
0 The title creatures wreak havoc at a peaceful little desert town . That 's basically the whole plot for this film , and while the scenes devoted to the Munchies themselves are somewhat fun ( in a lowbrow kind of way ) , all the rest is just filler , and bad filler at that . From the " hero " , who is a painful Woody Allen wannabe , to the ultra - dumb town cop , it 's hard to pick the most irritating character in the film . There were some times when almost all of them were on the screen together and I was thinking , " OK , at least the girlfriend is cute , but why do we have to put up with the rest of those morons ? " . The film is also filled with pop references ( from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair ) , which probably made it already dated by the early 90 's . ( * 1/2 )
0 I suppose all the inside jokes is what made Munchies a cult classic . I thought it was awful , though given the ridiculous story and the nature of the characters , it probably could 've been a much better ( and funnier ) movie . Maybe all they needed was a real budget.<br /><br />Munchies , as many viewers have pointed out already , is something of a Gremlins parody . Hence , all the references to the movie . The movie begins somewhere in Peru during an archeological dig . An annoying dufus named Paul , aspiring stand up comedian who offers no sarcasm or witty jokes during the movie despite his career plans , is holed up with his dad in the caves . His dad is an unconventional kind of archeologist , searching the caves not for artificats or mummies or anything , but proof of U.F.O. 's . And that 's where the Munchies come into the picture . Hidden in the crevice of a rock is an ugly little mutant that looks like a gyrating rubber doll with a Gizmo voice . They name him Arnold , stash him in a bag , and bring him home so Paul 's dad can finally show proof of extra terrestrial life.<br /><br />Paul , the idiot that he is , breaks his promise to his dad to watch Arnold ( a wager he made with his dad , if he loses , it 's off to community college to get a ' real ' career ) . The creepy next door neighbor with the bad rug , Cecil ( television veteran Harvey Korman ) , wonders what his neighbors are up to . So , he and his lazy son , some airhead hippie type ( who looks more like they should 've made his character a biker or heavy metal enthusiast ) to go and snatch Arnold . Why ? A get rich quick scheme of course . And of course , even Cecil 's son is too dumb to look after Arnold . And after a few pokes and prods at Arnold , he multiplies into more Munchies.<br /><br />This was n't even a movie that was so bad it was good . It was just plain awful . I was hoping that the Munchies would 've mutated and killed the morons that were always after them , even Paul and his girlfriend . At least it would be one way to get rid of all the bad acting in this movie that really hams up the movie . Not to mention poor special effects that look like hand puppets . And really bad writing all around -- it was n't even funny -- not even that young cop who can really give you the homicidal twitch in your eye . Like I said , Munchies , if they had been given an actual budget and better actors , they might 've been able to pull off a good parody . Pass .
0 When I saw this movie , I could n't believe my eyes . Where these hilarious creatures , dustbin muppets with big pointy teeth , really meant to be scary ? Or where they designed to have a good laugh ( I sincerely hope so ) . If you watch carefully you can even see the strings operating them ( better ; dragging them across the screen ) . The whole was rather funny than scary and I had a good time watching the movie because I was amazed by its overall incapacity to have only one good part . It is one big joke from beginning to end and I believe this movie belongs into a new category : So unbelievable crappy you 'll be laughing from beginning to end . ( I 'm not even gon na try to comment on the acting or all the other things )
0 This movie was made for people who found Gremlins too serious and Critters to hardcore . Like many of the critters / trolls / gremlins movies of the 80 's this movie is bad . The sad part is that there 's no punchline to that comment . It 's just bad and not in a funny way.<br /><br />The problem with this miniature monster movie is that it actually tries to be funny and ends up being as successful in doing that as Howie Mandell was in Walk Like A Man . What made the other 80 's horror movies into classics was that they were genuinely trying to be scary , but were hilarious because they failed so miserably . Someone must have told Bettina Hirsch ( yes THE Bettina Hirsch)she had a knack for comedy before she started directing this movie . Unfortunately they were wrong.<br /><br />Sure seeing a weird little mutated cross between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown trenchcoat and throwing pool balls at an outcast from the Lost Boys is amusing , but not enough to save the movie.<br /><br />By far the most annoying part of the movie is the Paul character . His Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to make you start fast forwarding from the time of his first scene until the ending credits only stopping once to see a scene where a munchie throws pool balls at a guy ... not that I did that.<br /><br />So the bottom line is run , do n't walk , to your nearest Blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thank him for not having the grapes to stock this pile of garbage on the shelves .
0 Not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviews.<br /><br />While watching " Bang " one night on TV , I found myself bored by the nonsensical , random plot which was occurring on screen . The entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless , artsy - fartsy self - indulgence on the part of the filmmaker . The fact that the director / writer goes by a one name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness . < br /><br />Those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare I say , more entertaining than this complete waste of time .
0 Germans think smirking is funny ( just like Americans think mumbling is sexy and that women with English accents are acting ) . I had to cross my eyes whenever the screen was filled yet again with a giant close - up of a smirking face . One of those ' housewife hacks corporate mainframe ' tales where she defrauds a bank by tapping a few random keys on her home PC which is connected only to a power socket . The director obviously loves the rather large leading lady . Ca n't say I share his feelings . There 's quite a funny bit when the entire family sit in front of the television chanting tonelessly along with the adverts . Apparently this review needs to be one line longer so here it is .
0 Unless you are an Evangelical Christian then make like an Egyptian and avoid like the biblical plague.<br /><br />Awful - why oh why does IMDb list the most favourable reviews at the top of the list - it was due to one of these that I have just wasted the end of what started out as good evening on this claptrap.<br /><br />The plot premise started out strong enough - I was drawn into the film and was interested right up to the point where the Bible sermons took over . What a waste.<br /><br />This film has so incensed me that I have registered with IMDb for the first time just to complain about it - I hope at least that by doing so I save someone else 's evening.<br /><br />Hay - what a Christian act on my part ;-)
0 At the beginning we get to see the start of a secret council of some sorts . It all looks very promising from the get go . With some supernatural elements thrown in , the mystery gets more interesting by the minute . The main character who seems like a good bloke gets into trouble because of his claim for money he is entitled to ( temptation ) and other factors . You really empathize with the guy and you want to know what exactly is going on . Normally a person in his situation would have several options . Somehow he does not have those options . In this movie there only seems to be one solution even when it is clear it is not his fault . Out of the blue he encounters characters who talk about church , prayer and God . And they provide the answer for his problem . It should be obvious at a point in the movie what this solution is . Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message . Since it always is helpful . But was it really necessary to disguise this message . This religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me . While the message is good , it 's simplicity ca n't escape the fact that in real life more needs to happen to resolve issues presented in this movie . The mystery that is presented to us never gets solved . In stead you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot . Do n't get fooled because of Malcolm Mcdowell . The once brilliant actor is adequate , but if you watch closely you will see that he is not serious at all . He really must be desperate for money . Otherwise what would posses an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like this .
0 It started out with an interesting premise . I always like Civil War stuff and ancient secret societies . The more the film progressed , the more I realized that this was a B movie at best . In the latter half , it quickly became a C movie , then D , then F , then " I wish that this was n't a rental so that I could put it in the microwave ! " I ca n't say that the acting in all cases was awful , just most . The writing , however ... I never read the book . Maybe the book is well written . The screenplay was written by a 10 year old . It was ridiculously shallow , the dialog drab and uninteresting , the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer . I really hated this movie , as did my wife . I am a Christian and I have no problem with movies that promote or support Christianity . This movie did a great disservice to the cause . Awful , terrible , worthless . If you liked it , I strongly recommend Superman 4 .
0 The IMDb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film . It should have read ' Be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your family 's church at 8 years old , listening to the preacher drone on about God 's will while all you can think of is getting back home to your Lego'.<br /><br />It starts off well intentioned , building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as Renny 's ' how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast ? ' moment . It then slowly morphs into a Christian jamboree , sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic - induced babble . I believe I counted the use of the word ' pray ' about 53 times in a five minute span near the end . After the 31st , I tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym , ' prey ' . Sadly , this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes . Plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say ' prayer ' ( ' preyer ' to me ) as it became totally zany . Indeed , even my Catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom , almost to the point of ending up on the floor.<br /><br />For all the salivating Christians who ranked this film 8 - 10 stars , I suggest sticking with your theology - reinforcing safety standards like Circle Square , The Ten Commandments , anything from Narnia , Jesus Christ Superstar and the like . Stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as Jesus Camp , The God Who Was n't There , What Would Jesus Buy , or the soon - to - be released Religulous.<br /><br />Maybe Robert Whitlow 's book is better .
0 How sad there is no option to post a mark lower than 1 . I watched this piece of nonsense and could barely believe what i was watching . Every single part of the film was awful . Music , acting , direction , story , everything , simply everything . I actually found myself laughing out loud at various points in the film . I particularly loved the bit where our hero is dashing through the hospital in soft focus slow motion , and knocks the clipboard out of the nurses hand , because , ............. well . Just because . Product placement ? Crucifix 's ( crucifi ? ) everywhere . If you are of a Christian persuasion and very easily satisfied , you may like this movie . If you do like this movie , you really need to get out more .
0 I just finished watching this movie . It was n't ridiculously bad , but I 'm really disappointed with it . I 'm not really sure why someone would make a movie like this . It was marginally entertaining , but I feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making . Monday , the writer was in charge ; Tuesday , the director ; Wednesday , the guy who gets the coffee ; etc . It almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies , but only had the time and money to make one.<br /><br />Someone else commented that the acting was really good , but I 'd have to disagree . Then again , if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming , perhaps they 're better actors than I give them credit for.<br /><br />The back of the DVD gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery ... something along the lines of a historical Law and Order or National Treasure . It starts off like that , but then , out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the Twilight Zone , or ... what was that other show that was n't as good ... A bad episode of The Outer Limits.<br /><br />My main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out . There 's the evil guy with spiked white hair . There 's the love interest , who , when she first appears , the wind actually blows through her hair . Seriously . Once you realize it 's a Christian movie , the end is also pretty easy to spot.<br /><br />The cinematography was poorly done , especially in the opening scenes - way to put your best foot forward . It was n't atrocious for most of the movie , but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady , praying , arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking - the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie .
0 did n't know anything about the film or that it was based on a best selling book . Tried guessing from the opening scenes what it would be about , best guess , buried treasure and a death list . That lasted about 15 minutes when i got the sneaky suspicion that the film was crap . I'll not bore you with how bad the plot and acting were but anyone who gave it more than two stars must work for the film makers . I watched until the hero jumped into his corvette to rush to the hospital . He had his on his suit , shirt and tie arrived at the hospital in jeans and a t / shirt . Couldn't even get the continuity right . I got the Christian theme , hard to miss it .
0 ... then they will have a proper place to file this crap . Sorry , not a " mystery " as claimed , it is religious mumbo - jumbo . I kept waiting for the " unimaginable evil " that was promised me , but the " evil " in this flick would only be unimaginable by a five year old with learning disabilities.<br /><br />I ca n't believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment . Unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them , and I will likely avoid anything they do in the future . I 'm also a little cheesed off that I now have a writer 's name and director 's name to memorize as I 'll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too.<br /><br />It 's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10 , etc . will get their reviews posted first . This could lead to more people getting tricked , as I was , into believing this movie was something other than religious preaching.<br /><br />Well , it 's off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising . Too bad they ca n't give me back the 105 minutes I wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a Hollywood horror / supernatural film .
0 I have nothing against religious movies . Religious people need something to watch on a Saturday night , I guess . But what really ticks me off is when the write - up on the DVD box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer . Passing off religious propaganda as entertainment is NOT cool , bro.<br /><br />And even if I was a religious person , I would have to agree with most of the other posters here , this movie was a mess . Poorly directed , poorly acted , poorly edited , and the attempt at a soundtrack was hilarious . The fake accents were terrible , the characters were mainly stereotypes , and continuity was out the window . The only reason we sat through this lame waste of time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead . Should have just gone to bed.<br /><br />Absolutely no redeeming qualities to this movie , unless you are the religious type who will immediately endorse anything that will preach your beliefs to the unbelievers , even if it 's a pile of garbage . If you are n't , avoid this at all costs . Do not be deceived by the box write - up .
0 I believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies . When I want a sermon , I 'll go to church , but I do n't want one from a movie . I do n't mind some supernatural themes , ( after all , religion is about as supernatural as you can get ! ) but this movie had so much preaching in it that I was really annoyed . The landlady reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies . The bad guy even looked like he had horns . < br /><br />And what a silly ending : the hero went into the meeting and yelled at all of those old men , and that broke the spell . If only life were that simple . I think that when movies are that stupid , they ought to be distributed with a warning : DANGER ! PREACHING CONTAINED HEREIN !

0 The deceptive cover , title and very small hidden print of Power of Prayer tricked me into renting this movie.<br /><br />It started out really well and pulled me in . I REALLY liked it . Between 1/3 and 3/4 's of it , the film started throwing in things that were not set up and made no sense . My first thought was , " This is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story . " I ended up re - watching parts of the movie , thinking I had missed something.<br /><br />By the time I reached the last 1/5 of the movie , it was all BORING , ANNOYING , RELIGION THUMPING DIALOG that made no sense , said nothing , and was annoying to listen to ; I turned off the sound and did a fast forward to the end.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this flick.<br /><br />Beware of DVDs labeled Whitlow Films and Level Path Productions.<br /><br />And I 'm a practicing Catholic .
0 After stopping by the movie store to find something to watch , we stumbled on this . It looked appealing from the summary , at least , so we gave it a try . And here 's the kicker : the first 20 minutes are interesting ! It 's actually enjoyable ! Oh , wait , spoke too soon.<br /><br />Somewhere in there , the movie took a disgusting turn into fundamental , right - wing Christian brain - washing . Not entirely sure what happens , but I think the screenplay writer found God somewhere in there , finished writing this script , and had no time to edit it because he had a KKK meeting to get to with his friends from the Westboro Church and his hood was n't clean.<br /><br />Can they put warnings on this ? I refuse to support this religious idiocy . Much like video games have rating systems , movies need some sort of symbol : maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to take a turn for the worse.<br /><br />Unless you share sentiments with whatever moron came up with this story , and will have your Bible open in your lap while you watch this and plan on how you 'll convert your neighbors , do n't waste your time . It 's some of the worst junk that 's come out in a very long time , and the radical religious nuts do n't need anymore funding .
0 This film is a portrait of the half - spastic teenage boy Benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his lousy marks in Math . He did n't make the best experiences in life before and got serious self - esteem issues . After a rough start at his new school , he starts making friends , falls in love with a girl and does some American Pieish teenage stuff.<br /><br />Beside some comedy elements , the film is told in a very serious way , focussing on Benjamin and his problems.<br /><br />If you already do n't like this story outline , save your time and watch something else . If you do , please be aware of the following:<br /><br />1 ) Benjamin is a total loser . Whatever he does , he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for self - pity all the time . For me he was n't that kind of " charming loser " who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with . Instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind I could barely stand watching.<br /><br />2 ) The film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just are n't ( except for Janosch maybe ) . And yes , I know this film is based on an auto - biography written by a 17-year old - but having some experiences with German schools and German youth myself , I do n't believe him.<br /><br />3 ) Showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject . But I doubt that teenage boys do an " Ejaculate on the cookie "- contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass - masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the sperm - wet cookie afterwards . Although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way , it 's nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this film.<br /><br />4 ) There 's a sub - plot about Benjamin 's family and his father betraying his wife - still , I do n't know why it 's there and where to put it . It just bored me.<br /><br />Well , I personally hated this film for having the character of Benjamin , being without a message , concept , scheme , whatever and it 's failing attempts to be dramatic and serious . However , I can image that some people may find it sensible and touching . If you liked " The Other Sister " you 'll probably like this one , too . I hated both.<br /><br />17-year old boys should n't write an autobiography and if they do , it does n't seem to be the best idea to make a film out of it.<br /><br />2 out of 10 .
0 Animal Farm ( 1954 ) was a very good read about the dangers of totalitarianism . How good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are ignorant or rule with an iron fist and an empty head . Sadly this movie does not portray either of these . What we 're shown is a propaganda piece with a lot of finger waving and pointing . The animation and the direction were good considering the budget and the time period but the very essence of George Orwell 's novel is sorely missing.<br /><br />If you 're one of those who want to see how not to adapt a novel or are just interested in seeing an adaptation of this brilliant novelette then by all means watch . I just found this one to be somewhat mediocre . Just one man 's opinion however.<br /><br />The remake is a notch below but not by much .
0 First off , I have to say that I loved the book Animal Farm . I read it with my 9th grade class , and it was great . We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial . The movie was so disappointing to me . The movie cuts out some characters , and misses a lot of the main points of the book . It skips around a lot , and does n't explain anything in detail . If someone was watching this movie without having first read the book , they would be confused . The most disappointing thing in this movie to me , was the ending . The ending in the book was the most powerful , and in the movie , they changed it ! It was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of " melting " together , but instead , the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs . To sum up , I do n't think that this movie captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book .
0 I am a big fan of the original book and this adaption is simply bad . First of all , it had trouble deciding if it is a kiddie toon or an adult one , that caused a strange mix of an adult story and some pretty violent scenes with a silly little duck that keeps giving " funny " moments in the beginning.<br /><br />But that 's hardly important , the film is simply boring , unmoving and not true to the original story . It simply fails to transfer to the picture all the points Orwell tried to make to his book.<br /><br />{SPOILER}<br /><br />Second revolution ? ! ! Have n't they guys learned anything ? ? Who be the next Napoleon then ? Benjamin ? ! !
0 The makers of this film have created a future where not only is abortion and birth control illegal in every state , but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serve long prison sentences . In other words , this film is every liberals worst nightmare!The political agenda is so heavy - handed here and the style of the film is so low - key that it just loses steam pretty quickly . Regardless of which side of the fence you 're on , I'd recommend skipping it .
0 At a panel discussion that I attended after viewing this film , the filmmakers stated that one should look at this not as a movie but a provoker of thought . Well , the only thoughts that were provoked from me were of the time wasted watching the movie . The gimmicks of the film ( documentary style , futuristic setting ) served as distractions of what was supposed to be a thoughtful examination of the abortion debate . This film illustrates the problem when people try to use film as a platform for their political views - usually a very boring movie that preaches to the choir .
0 Les Visiteurs , the first movie about the medieval time travelers was actually funny . I like Jean Reno as an actor , but there was more . There were unexpected twists , funny situations and of course plain absurdness , that would remind you a little bit of Louis de Funes.<br /><br />Now this sequel has the same characters , the same actors in great part and the same time traveling . The plot changes a little , since the characters now are supposed to be experienced time travelers . So they jump up and down in history , without paying any attention to the fact that it keeps getting absurder as you advance in the movie . The duke , Jean Reno , tries to keep the whole thing together with his playing , but his character has been emptied , so there 's not a lot he can do to save the film.<br /><br />Now the duke 's slave / helper , he has really all the attention . The movie is merely about him and his being clumsy / annoying / stupid or whatever he was supposed to be . Fact is ; this character tries to produce the laughter from the audience , but he does not succeed . It is as if someone was telling you a really very very bad joke , you already know , but he insists on telling that joke till the end , adding details , to make your suffering a little longer.<br /><br />If you liked Les Visiteurs , do not spoil the taste in your mouth with the sequel . If you did n't like Les Visiteurs , you would never consider seeing the sequel . If you liked this sequel ... well , I suppose you still need to see a lot of movies .
0 In a way , Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal : being seen by thousands . But it fails at making them laugh ... <br /><br />Les Visiteurs has had its success , because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel : forget about Zemeckis 's Back to the future , here comes the old France , the middle - age knight and its nearly barbaric way of life . Full of pride , funny thanks to the ancient words he uses , Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor . Then comes the sequel.<br /><br />Nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs , the first . And it 's no use being a movie expert to realize that the Corridors of Time has been made for money.<br /><br />The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs , and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed some second tought . Explanation : it 's no use trying to get back the jewelry Jacquouille has stolen ; do n't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode ? Where do you think he found the money ? Selling the jewelry ... And that 's only one of many holes Poiré tries to avoid ... and fails.<br /><br />Let 's have a look at the characters : Montmirail does n't change , he 's just a little more boring . Regarding Frenegonde ... that 's another story : Valérie Lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the bourgeoise role . And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so pitiful I nearly felt pain for her . And Poiré does n't realize that a cast of humorists is n't enough to make a good comedy.<br /><br />Forget about the time travels , about the digital effects , concentrate on the story and you 'll see that there 's enough room on a mail stamp to write it 10 times.<br /><br />The main interest of this film is the landscapes . A movie for youngsters , let 's say up to 13 years old .
0 This film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion . Its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it . What really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny . The actress replacing Jean Reno 's descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married . Nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it 's a waste of perfectly good film . The torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions . This second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well . This film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a ' necklace ' . No script since it was apparently written and added to daily . No attention to camera or shots in mind . Poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so . This film would not even pass for a student film in basic Film 101 . How this pile got through no one can tell . It was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries . This movie has one good part ... its END ! This film is my # 1 worst film of all time , finally " Howard The Duck " is no longer the goose .
0 Everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie ! It shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie ! My grandma could have done better than that ! But that 's not the only reason why this movie is really bad ! ( It 's actually so bad that I 'm not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark ! ) If the first episode of Les Visiteurs ' was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues , this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one . The funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it . Clavier is over - acting his role even more than in the first part , Robin is trying to act like Lemercier ( because she 's replacing her ) but that 's grotesque ' . Lemercier is Lemercier , Robin is Robin ! Even if Muriel Robin can be funny by herself on stage , she is not in this movie because she 's not acting as she used to act . I know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role ( Lemercier obtained a César award for her role in the first movie ) but she made a big mistake : instead of playing her role , she played Lemercier playing her role ' ! As for the story , it 's just too much ! Of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but Poiré and Clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode . The gags are repetitive , childish and déjà - vu . No , really , there 's no more than 3 funny parts in this . The only good things might be the costumes and some special effects . So you have only 2 reasons to watch it : 1 ) if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie , 2 ) if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment ' ! 2/10
0 In 1993 , " the visitors " was an enormous hit in France . So , the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately , this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made . < br /><br />This is a movie that does n't keep its promises . Indeed , it 's supposed to tell a sole story . Jean Reno must go in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier back in the Middle Ages so that time can normally follow its course . The problem is that Clavier feels completely at ease in the world of the twentieth century , and so make him get back in the Middles Ages is rather hard ... Instead of this , the movie goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main plot . As a consequence , the movie becomes sometimes muddle - headed , sometimes a bit of a mess.<br /><br />But the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors . Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie : they 're going over the top and become annoying . Then , why did Jean - Marie Poiré the film - maker engage Muriel Robin in the female main role ? He made a mistake because she seems ill - at - ease and is absolutely pitiful . The other actors are n't better : Marie - Anne Chazel is nonexistent and Christian Bujeau , unbearable.<br /><br / > Of course , the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into vulgarity and easiness . Certain sequences and dialogs are affected . It also appears hollow because Poiré takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie . Thus , a young girl takes Reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding.<br /><br />A labored and disappointing follow - up . Anyway , what 's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial?<br /><br / >
0 The original " les visiteurs " was original , hilarious , interesting , balanced and near perfect . LV2 must be a candidate for " Worst first sequel to a really good film " . In LV2 everyone keeps shouting , when a gag does n't work first it 's repeated another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually become funny . LV2 is a horrible parody of LV1 , except of course that a parody should be inventive . If you loved LV1 just do n't see this film , just see LV1 again ! !
0 Corridors of time . The movie you can watch if you 're looking for a sophisticated way of suicide . Some use guns , ropes , or gas , but you want to ruin your brains ? Do not wait any longer ! Corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes : thinking Christian Clavier is able to act and to bring you fun . I do not miss the 45 francs this poor thing cost me : sometimes , one has to reset its evaluation system looking at the absolute zero . This film deserves a 2/10 , but that 's only because I like Jean Reno . Too bad for him , he also stars in Ronin . I think I 'm gon na dislike him ...
0 I 've seen many of Guy Maddin 's films , and liked most of them , but this one literally gave me a headache . John Gurdebeke 's editing is way too frenetic , and , apart from a tour - de - force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object , does nothing but interfere with the actors ' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />Another thing I disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin 's earlier works -- though his films have always had dark elements , his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity . This one seemed more like harshness for harshness ' sake.<br /><br />As I 'm required to add more lines of text before IMDb will accept my review , I will mention that the actor playing " Guy Maddin " does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well .
0 Okay , I 've tried and I 've tried , but I STILL DON'T GET this Guy Maddin thing . Tales From the Gimli Hospital left me cold , that movie about the Austrian villagers and the one about the Ice Nymph were pretty to look but lacking in the story department ... and this nudie movie about abortion and hockey is just boring . I 'm glad Maddin has an appreciation for silent film , but I dislike his films for the same reason I dislike the films of Quentin Tarantino : they 're empty homages to better , more imaginative films -- films that advanced the art form or broke new ground -- and are all style and no substance . No amount of jump cuts and odd camera angles can disguise the fact that Maddin is an unoriginal David Lynch wannabe , though he DOES have one advantage over Tarantino : he generally does n't write embarrassing dialogue , because most of his films rely on intertitles . The bottom line is , Maddin 's schtick is clever clever film - making for aspiring film majors .
0 ' The Hills Eyes II ' , one of the most pointless and blatantly stupid sequels to come around in some time , is 90 minutes of incompetent film making at its finest . Or worst , however you choose to look at it . While 2006 's ' Hills ' remake was one of the year 's best , and truly frightening , horror films , this sequel takes every spark out of what made that such an accomplishment . Part 2 never gets off the ground , and neither does its mind numbing dialogue . Worst of all , it 's not that scary.<br /><br />2006 's remake followed a family who find themselves in the middle of the New Mexico desert , deserted , and one by one being picked off by deranged and sadistic hill people . People who , as a result of the military testing the atomic bomb on their land years ago , have become who they are . Surviving off travelers who wander into the region . The sequel puts audiences in the same desert , now occupied by the military as they covertly investigate the hills and what might have happened to that poor family . When a group of military trainees are brought to the campsite , they find it deserted with no signs of life . A grim reality soon befalls them , as they come to the realization that they 're not alone . And the bloody fate that was handed to many before them will soon become their destiny.<br /><br />It does n't take a genius to realize that ' Hills ' has no legitimate reason to exist . But because last year 's remake was received well both at the box office and by critics , it came to no surprise that a sequel would be rushed into production while there 's still money to be earned . There 's no rhyme or reason to it this time around , just an unbelievable and ridiculous set - up to pave the way for thoughtless characters , unoriginal killings , a non - existent story , and slipping interest . Originally , director Alexander Aja made Craven 's cult classic into a remake that was a unique and thoroughly disturbing experience . One that gruesomely crossed the line on more than one occasions . Its frank display of violence , sadistic torture , well - rounded characterization , and white - knuckled suspense were all effectively used to shock and repulse audiences . The second time around , it 's rehashed hand - me - downs . There 's no style , no grit . It tries to build up tension by dismembering bodies , when all it really does is make for a been there , done that kind film , where even the gore seems tame compared to more recent bloodbaths.<br /><br />It 's a sad state of affairs when deformed mutants who capture women for breeding purposes fails to keep your attention . It 's a bore , nothing more . ' Hills ' has no bite . Despite a jump or two here and there , there 's nothing very scary about this by - the - numbers horror flick . It feels like something you 'd see on the Sci - Fi channel , only with some F - bombs , a blood splatter here and there , a rape , and a graphic birth scene that 's more gross than shocking . It 's cheap . And with ' Hills ' , you reap what you sew . With no effort given , you ca n't expect anything in return.<br /><br />Replacing Aja with Martin Weisz as director was the film 's first big mistake , all he does is drain the film of any sort of emotional resonance . But even more shocking is the uncharacteristically bad script penned by Wes Craven and his son , Jonathan Craven . You ask , how bad could it possibly be ? This is the kind of dialogue that makes any comparison look like Shakespeare . Craven has had his fair share of clunkers in the past , but I 'd never expect something like this from him . It 's so unintentionally funny , you have to wonder , is Craven playing a joke on this ? Or did he dump this one on his son after the studio payed him off ? The film 's characters are one - dimensional talking heads with no emotions or common sense . The acting is just as bad . The only character who may win you over is ' Napoleon ' Napoli , the scrawny kid who does n't fit in with the others . Even the deranged and instinct - driven villains , who we might have found some favor with in the deepest of our thoughts a year ago , are met with indifferent . You do n't hate them , you do n't like them . You honestly could n't care less . Just like this movie.<br /><br />Even if you were giddy with fear during ' The Hills Have Eyes ' , as I was , you 'll have a tough time finding anything to enjoy in this piece of garbage . It 's as generic as generic gets , and there 's absolutely nothing here we have n't seen done many times already . I ca n't express this enough , avoid ' The Hills Have Eyes II ' like the plague . It 's frightless , unoriginal , frantic , and a bore . Stick to the remake or Craven 's original vision . Because if you do n't walk out after the first thirty minutes , do n't say I did n't warn you .
0 Last year 's remake of ' The Hills Have Eyes ' was one of the better attempts to update the vaguely exploitational horror flicks of the 1970s for a new audience . Alexandre Aja allowed for an admirable degree of character development and when the violence started it was mean and savage and all carried out in a landscape of impeccable photography and production design . I was one of the few people who actually thought that it was better than the original and looked forward to a second visit to the particularly dark and cruel world of the savage desert mutants.<br /><br />'The Hills have Eyes 2 ' , released just a year after the original , seems a rushed and ill - conceived attempt to cash in on the franchise with little thought to quality . Jonathan Craven 's screenplay could have been written in a weekend , and given the speed with which this movie made it into cinemas , probably was . It falls back on every hackneyed genre cliché in the book while offering absolutely nothing new to the desert mutant mythology . I always let out a groan of disappointment when a sequel replaces civilian characters with the military . Soldiers are always so lazily written and never fail to thoroughly bore with crude caricatures of strutting macho bullshit . In my mind , ' Aliens ' was the only movie to successfully make such a transition , due to James Cameron 's talent , not simply for directing the best action sequences around , but never forgetting that an audience has to care about the people being butchered . He was also ably assisted by some genuinely talented actors . With ' The Hills have Eyes 2 ' , it 's clear that video director Martin Weisz is no James Cameron , and the cast of television bit - parters have n't the talent or even the inclination to turn their cardboard cutout characters into anything approaching living , breathing human beings.<br /><br />Needless to say , every character is a broad and generic cliché . They act in dumb and illogical ways , making dumb and illogical decisions that lead them to predictably dumb and illogical deaths . The latter half of the movie becomes just another tedious chased - through - dark - corridors scenario . ' The Descent ' ( on which Sam McCurdy , coincidentally , also worked as cinematography ) proved that even this most derivative of sequences can still be carried out with genuine originality and suspense , but we see no such innovation here.<br /><br />'The Hills Have Eyes 2 ' is just a very lazy movie , devoid of any suspense , tension , or surprise , with not a single individual involved remotely interested in producing anything of quality . It 's a tame and tired excuse for a sequel and deserves to spend the rest of its life in a Blockbuster 's bargain bin .
0 The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing more . Of course it 's not going to be an Oscar nominated film , it 's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes.<br /><br />The plot is basically about a group of National Guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert . It 's just them fighting back throughout the whole film , which includes a lot of violence ( which is basically the whole film ) as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing , and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience.<br /><br />I'd give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment , and that only . Although even then I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on , as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake . The Hills Have Eyes II is just decent entertainment , something to pass time if you 're bored , and nothing else.<br /><br />4/10
0 THHE2 is entertaining in that you 'll laugh a lot and cringe and probably say " oh sh*t ! " and " get your face away from the goddamn hole you dumb**s " or things along those lines but I do n't know if its really worth seeing- I was very annoyed throughout the entirety with the horrible military characters who do n't seem to know the first thing about combat.<br /><br />Yes there was more violence , gore , and a higher body count than the first one but I am still am debating whether that cancels out my feeling throughout the whole movie about how ridiculous it is ( and not a good ridiculousness like Dead Alive or Feast ) . My time would have been better spent watching Aja 's remake for the 5th time.<br /><br />So go for some laughs , or go for some gore , but do n't go hoping to come out of it satisfied .
0 Okay , let 's not get confused here . If this is a sequel to a remake of an original horror classic , does that mean it also automatically is a remake of the original horror classic 's sequel ? Here 's to hoping that 's not a general rule , as Wes Craven 's own sequel to the original " The Hills have Eyes "  released somewhere during the mid-80 's  is easily one of the worst and absolute most redundant horror movies ever made . Part two did n't have an actual plot and re - used footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and petrifying premise . Craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories , as the loyal German Shepard of the Carter family re - experienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies . There were quite a bit of alarming signs indicating us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well . The remake came out barely one year ago and here 's the sequel already ? The incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script . Do n't they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary , menacing and disturbing ? With his excellent film , Alexandre Aja nearly single - handedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes , as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for . Also , Aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his French instant cult classic " High Tension " , but who is this new director ? Aja 's " The Hills Have Eyes " was an unexpected hit , appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over - enthusiast target groups . It 's a really good film and , even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable , it 's highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of Aja 's smashing hit . Bearing all this in mind , plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism , I must admit this rushed sequel really is n't as awful as anticipated . The screenplay is routine and clichéd horror fodder , introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no backbone and tastelessly depicting how they get slaughtered by traditionally repulsive - looking freaks . After the events of the first film , the US army has set up a camp in the middle of the New Mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear tests , which took place there in the 50 's and 60 's . For the horribly mutated survivors of the miner 's community that stayed there during the radioactive testing , the scientists and researchers form a tasty starter until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck . They are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless humanoids that live inside the remainders of the mines.<br /><br />This basically is just another by - the - numbers slasher with dumb characters who are , even after losing several of their friends already , still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill . It 's also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive , especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute 3-year - old son . " The Hills Have Eyes II " completely lacks  as to be expected  originality , logic and plausible situations . The mutated miners are n't nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one , mainly because they are n't organized this time and only just behave like drooling and sex - hungry prototype monsters . Since you do n't care for the amateur G.I. Joe " heroes " and definitely do n't feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills , this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last year 's original . Most peculiarly , this second film is n't nearly as violent and gory as the first ! Sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprise - twists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences , but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor . There are a handful of scenes to satisfy the bloodthirsty horror fanatics  mainly showing soldiers falling down cliffs or getting shot by their own guns  but there sadly are n't any outrageous pick - axe battles or virulent dog attacks . What a shame ! What 's the point of a sequel if it even fails to surpass the level of grossness and/or gratuitous filth of the original ? Luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental , and you 'll have the most fun spotting all the things that do n't make the slightest bit of sense ! For example , wallets falling out of people 's bloodied heads , women without any muscle power cast as tough - ass soldiers and  my personal favorite  assigning the ONE soldier with a speaking disability to operate the radio communications .
0 The premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake I expected a lot sincerely.<br /><br />The sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inept . The situations are dumb and beyond reason and the acting is truly awful.<br /><br />This time there are n't likable characters or violins unlike the remake . Also , the gore is not that abundant and when it happens it 's truly bad.<br /><br />The violence is minimal and it 's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think that there 's room for heavy violence . I mean , there 's a SWAT team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants . You surely expect something different ! When I watched it on the movies I wanted my money back.<br /><br />Anyways this is a clear example of how rushed out movies turn out to be a mess and demonstrate poor quality on all aspects.<br /><br />A mess that let down the fans of the remake like me . That 's why sequels are never welcomed ; at least this movie is n't as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original .
0 Martin Weisz , who directed the solid " Rohtenburg " , will be taking the heat , with Wes Craven , for another shabby " The Hills Have Eyes 2 " . The memory of the legendary original , which boasted an unbelievable storyline and a dog having a flashback , will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake ( in name only ) . A bunch of National Guardsmen ( and women ) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants . One by one the weekend soldiers are picked off . That 's it . There is some hardcore violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene , but there is precious little else to get excited about . The film 's " heroes " are the usual bunch of clichés and the mutants , a far cry from Craven 's original " family " , mostly resemble Brian Thompson from " Cobra " coupled with some creatures Stan Winston had left over from the " Wrong Turn " shoot . Much of the action takes place in caves , ala " The Descent " , and is well shot by Sam McCurdy . A laughable aspect is Wes and Jonathan Craven 's addition of a sympathetic mutant who skulks around his cave like Leatherface in Hooper 's original " Chainsaw " . Weisz will be blamed for this dull debacle , but he 's not really at fault because he does his best to maintain suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the contrived situations . Not a fan , unfortunately .
0 My God . This movie was awful . I ca n't complain about it too much . I went to see it just to be grossed out . It did suffice , sort of . It 's funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was in the very , very beginning where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby.<br /><br />I also think that it 's funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the Hispanic soldier , who was a supporting actor in Next Friday . Everyone in the movie did a horrible acting job . It was some of the worst acting I 've ever paid to see . < br /><br />I also expected that it would be much more gruesome than the first one . It was n't . I expected it to be more gruesome because it 's a sequel and horror movie sequels are usually much less successful than their predecessors . I expected it to be more gruesome since gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days ( Grudge 2 , Saw 3 , Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2 , Dead Silence ) , but It actually was n't nearly as gruesome as the first one , which was yet another disappointment . < br /><br />The mutants in the first one were kind of disturbing but the filmmakers were trying so hard in this one to make them creepy that they were absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />I also hated the entire concept of showing the clip of the female soldier 's son on her camera - phone saying " I love you , mommy " FOUR TIMES . It was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers , and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel even WORSE for her by showing it three more times for no reason . This movie was a joke .
0 I appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these kind of ' horror ' movies , but they should at least hire some proper actors . The sergeant especially is guilty of using his monotone to bulldozer every single line he has . But let 's face it , the lines are n't really important . There is n't really a recognisable plot , so most of the writing involves the words f**k , s**t , m*****f****r and other assorted bad language in place of proper dialogue.<br /><br />The ' story ' as it is , is mostly made up of seemingly random gore and death , with a couple of cringe - worthy ' surprises ' , which happen around 10 minutes after you see exactly what 's going to happen . Not only this , but there are several glaring plot holes and continuity errors ( Why are they going in there ? Did n't he have a weapon ? Was n't he dead ? ) , so it makes the whole film seem as if it has been cut down by the several hours it would take to fix them.<br /><br />Another film which simply relies on blood and gore instead of any real cinematic experience .
0 Is n't anyone else tired of that old cliché ' where a nearly dead person shows up in a horror film , gives us some informations , and then blasts his head off for no apparent reason ? I know I am.<br /><br />The sad thing is that it 's use in this film is worthless . If you have seen the first film ( the first remake I should say ) then the information given is completely worthless , because you would have already known it . I guess , you can that it is n't worthless to the main characters .. but then why does the idiot shoot himself in the head ? Would n't he want to live ? Sure , he would have died anyway .. <br /><br />This is the second film to be titled " The Hills Have Eyes II . " The first being the sequel to the original 70 's film . This is where it gets a little complicated for someone like me . See , I 'm probably part of minority of people my age that even knew there was a HHE2 to begin with , much less an original HHE1 . And now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is named exactly as the sequel to the original HHE1 ... it just makes it worse ! But anyways .. <br /><br />Wes Craven 's original Hills Have Eyes was decent . In the end , though , the idea was better than the presentation , but he most likely had a low budget . To be quite honest , Wes Craven is n't that good of a horror director . He 's only made a few good horror movies ( Nightmare on Elm St. , New Nightmare ) , a few alright ones ( Scream ) and a bunch of horrible ones ( Cursed , Shocker , Vampire in Brooklyn ) . Oh yeah , and he made Swamp Thing , as well ... but the original HHE2 falls under the latter category . I 've only seen a few minutes , but it was terrible.<br /><br />Now he has co - written the new HHE2 .. and it 's such a disappointment ! Last year 's HHE remake was even better than the original film . It was tense . I guess it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family , and not a bunch of beer and pot and sex crazy teenagers . It made us feel dirty . For the first hour , we were in hell , and finally in the last few moments , the good guys got revenge on the bad guys and it felt good .. <br /><br />This new film has no tension . No suspense whatsoever . Just violent things happening to mostly stupid people . There is hardly any menacing presence here . Just ugly hobos hiding under rocks.<br /><br />I'm getting tired of horror movies where people die because of the stupid mistakes they keep making . It was just the other day that I watching " Deep Blue Sea " where Samuel L. Jackson kept on walking around the water , while giving the speech , and then he gets eaten by a shark , only because the idiot stayed to close to the water .. something that nobody would do in the given situation ! Here is the exact same thing . People go off by themselves to take a leak even though they know people are dying .. seriously , could n't a potty break wait ? And then when you think people would have learned , someone else goes of by themselves ! Seriously , is n't more scary when the characters are bringing their A - game and still losing ? I would think so ... <br /><br />It even under delivers . It should have made the first remake look like " The Fog " remake ( which was less menacing than an episode of " Becker " ) . More bad guys . More time in the caves . More tension . More of everything.<br /><br />But it actually downgrades . Less bad guys . No tension . Sure we have more time in the caves , but not a whole lot happens there . In the end , it only seems like there is two or three bad guys . The last film made it seem like a whole tribe of people . Where is this tribe ? Who keeps on watching them through binoculars ? Seriously , these are the things this film should have brought us , but it ends with the exact same promise that the last film gave us , with that exact same " being watched " scene . Come on ! I 'll give the devil it 's due . The look of the film is good .. but that s it.<br /><br />I do n't even think fans of gore will like this .. though I 'm probably wrong ! There is gore ( though most of it is sped - up while in the dark ) , but without the tension , and characters you even care about .. the gore does nothing in my book ! In the end , you 're not frightened . You;re not shocked ( unless you 're an 8 year old girl ) . You do n't even feel like you have seen anything new .
0 This movie pretty much sucked . I 'm in the Army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible . If your in the Military and you see this movie you 'll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad . It was ridiculous . They acted like a bunch of normal people with Army uniforms on not knowing what to do . It was a pretty gory movie I 'd have to say the least . There was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump . I 'd recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent , gory movie . It will be a better movie also if your not in the Military . I also would have to say I liked the first one better than this one .
0 I could n't believe my eyes once I 've watched this movie . There 's no point in it either then blood and violence . Unlike other scary movies that had gore and a meaning to it this movie is just blood , gore , and killing one after another . This movie is n't interesting at all , has no meaningful plot or story line , nor does it have an intelligence in it . The blood looks very fake and this movie overall , is pointless . Do n't even waste your time with it . It 's just an hour or two of mindless violence . It has many bloody scenes that are n't scary but just plain revolting . This is probably the worst horror film I have ever watched out of all the horror films I ever saw .
0 wow this is the worst movie ever . the only reason i signed up for IMDb was so i could complain about this movie . i have never walked out of a theater or stoped a DVD but i almost stopped this one ( and i should have ) . but i watched it all the way to the end just to get let down again with an absolutely terrible ending . wow if this is all that wes craven can produce his time is long up . I 've never seen the first one and will never after watching this . its terrible acting with a terrible plot . hey looks someone is shinning a mirror at us lets go check it out . and the sad part is that when this movie came to DVD it was completely checked out at blockbuster forever . so i feel bad for all the people that saw this junk .
0 No plot , crappy acting , and pointless gore .... <br /><br />This is supposed to be a horror movie ? There 's no fear , or suspense , just BOOM BANG GORE , then done . Some kinda Marines are in the desert for some weird , crappy reason and they get hunted down by those mutated beasts from the first movie , which was good , and should have been left it at that.<br /><br />This is just another excuse for money , and use of pointless violence , just like the " Saw " sequels . They know no matter how pointless the plot is , and the more gore they can add , people will see it . I miss good suspenseful horror movies . Come on Hollywood , you can do much , much better .
0 I 'm no horror movie buff , but my wife 's nieces and nephews are . So , I saw the first movie . It was gruesome , and tense , but not my taste . Still good though . For similar reasons , at this very moment , I am being exposed to a sequel.<br /><br />The premise itself is beyond absurd . I can buy that disasters occur in the desert . I can buy that mutants exists . I can even buy that the events might be so weird and strange that the military may decide to get involved . It is unlikely , yes , but I 'm willing to suspend my belief.<br /><br />HOWEVER , under no circumstances am I willing to believe that the military squad assigned to recon such an area would be unable to fend off the mutants . Being a member of the United States Army , I can assure that while fresh recruits may lack the seasoned eyes and experience of combat soldiers , any such recruits would be integrated into a capable squad.<br /><br />A squad of armed soldiers is not about to be taken out by a few mutants with knives . That 's just the way it works . Squad movements , vastly superior firepower , and of course , radio support , would ensure nothing less than total victory . I 'm not saying you would n't have casualties , but as soon as the area was verified as hostile , military training would take precedence , no - one would go off on their own even to use the bathroom.<br /><br />And if it were discovered that the area was so infested with hostiles that the squad was unable to handle the danger , they would radio in for backup . And believe me , their radios would not be jammed , if there was a chance that normal radios would not do , the squad would have a military issue satellite phone . Chances are , if they were unable to check in every hour , a search would be called.<br /><br />In order to accept this movie , you must accept that our soldiers are incompetent fools , with incompetent leaders , and an incompetent chain of command . While it may still be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and compass , our military forces are filled with intelligent , well - trained , competent soldiers . Mutants with knives are far below our ability to deal with.<br /><br />With the whole execution of the movie depending solidly on the impossible to imagine , the film fails to deliver . Instead , we are expected to believe that our soldiers , sailors , and airmen are incapable of dealing with even the most mediocre threats.<br /><br />As a combat veteran , I find the movie insulting .
0 As has been stated countless times , " The Hills Have Eyes 2 " is NOT a remake of the ( generally disregarded ) mid-'80s sequel to Wes Craven 's 1977 original . But wishing to give this postmodern sequel - to - a - remake the official stamp of Diminishing Returns , Craven himself ( a double threat alongside his son , Jonathan ) has decided to pen a film that is of the same quality -- in plain English , HORRIBLE . Former music - video director Martin Weisz takes the reins from Alexandre Aja , and is clearly in way over his head -- yet one wonders how anyone could have created a watchable film from the Cravens ' Screen writing 101 scrawl . Not only are the characters ( in this case , a gang of goofball National Guards(wo)men sent to investigate the turbulent hills of the original remake ) completely obnoxious and prone to really annoying genre pitfalls ( played without a lick of irony , mind you ) , but they are constantly cracking jokes that are n't funny . After viewing their total ineptitude during a training exercise , their fate against the repulsive , roaming cannibals is painfully obvious . Only this time out -- as in the original ' 80s sequel -- the script is so simplistic ( barely existent , actually ) that any potential subtext is jettisoned in favor of upping the ante in repulsive shocks ( we 're treated to a combo childbirth - murder during the opening credits , plus a gratuitous rape for those who have n't ejected the DVD by the midpoint ! ) . Even the mutants in this outing are personality - free freaks of no memorable stature -- the tacky , rubbery - looking makeup FX seems , like the rest of the film , to be trying to hide its face from embarrassment . I really groaned at the lame ' surprise ' at the end of Aja 's otherwise excellent film , and the producers quite literally go for broke at the end of " Hills 2 , " setting the stage -- VERY lamely setting the stage -- for a third installment ... yet the Cravens and Weisz have created a film that is such a cynical bastardization of what made the 1977/2006 versions work that they 'd be hard - pressed to find an audience after this insulting slap in the face .
0 Alexandre Aja 's remake of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the bright spots of 2006 . Not only was it a remake of a classic horror film , but it was pretty damned good too . So , nearly a year later , we are being treated to the sequel to that remake . While original scripter Wes Craven is back as producer and co scripted , this film just fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake . A group of military trainees stop by in the desert to check in on some scientists and find themselves run afoul of the mutant family from the first film ( at least those that remain plus some new ones ) . There 's plenty of gore to be had here . What annoys me about this film is the utter lack of characterization . The viewer does not give a damn about what happens to any of these people because we have n't gotten into them . Even the mutants had some characterization last time out and this time , nothing . Gore for the sake of gore is pointless . There has to be a reason for this to happen for it to be interesting . Nothing that happens here is interesting . And what is it lately with rape scenes in films ? Here we get yet another one for no real reason . Hopefully this is one set of hills that wo n't be visited again .
0 The film picks up after last years remake with the military setting up electronic surveillance equipment in the desert where the attacks in the first film happened . The crew is killed not long before a group of soldiers on a training exercise show up to find no one around . You can fill in the rest.<br /><br />This is a paycheck picture all around . There seems to be no passion in anyone 's performances , nor in anyone behind the camera . This is a movie that was made for the money and nothing else . On some level this should have worked , it could have been a more horrific Southern Comfort ( where National Guardsmen run afoul of some people in the swamps ) , but instead its not much of anything . In large part you can blame the script , written unbelievably in part by Wes Craven , which hits the same old targets again and again . Add to the mess the fact that the direction is dull and the set up of sequences is so lack luster as to remove any inherent tension in any scene.<br /><br />Its not bad as such , but badly made and dull . Let me put my feelings into context : The reason I saw this film was because a local multiplex screwed up and ran this film instead of the kids flick the Last Mimzy and I wanted to see what caused the out cry(I mean the films have so much in common - he says sarcastically ) . I 'm convinced that this film will only scare those who like the last Mimzy .
0 this movie was just plain dumb i do not think it was scary at all i went in hoping to be shocked and scared but was mostly laughing some of the scenes were just to fake and thrown together blood scenes were extremely over cg and some of the mutants were ridiculously gay looking it also sucked because the acting was just plain horrible u think they could get some good actors and most of the characters i hated just because how stupid and lame they acted even though they were supposed to be in the military i get to watch movies for free and seen many people walking out i m guessing because it was so dumb kinda glad i did n't have to pay for it in short DUMB ASS MOVIE do n't see it ... but then again that s my opinion
0 Just recently , I 've been obsessing over and anticipating this movie so much that I almost had to see it . Well , having just seen it today , the 5.8 rating is completely understandable . I think that if you anticipate something so much that it becomes a dire need , it turns out not to be worth it . < br /><br />Sure , The Hills Have Eyes 2 has its moments . It has a very cool and well - developed storyline that ties in well with the actual product itself , but the whole thing is so self - indulged that it becomes so hard to follow . And if it were n't for Wes Craven 's production on this film , it would n't be anything to do with The original remake . < br /><br />But the whole thing makes you go " Is this supposed to be horror or COMEDY ? " because there are lots of ridiculous , randomly placed jump moments and stupid one liners ( I.E. " There 's a hand in the sh**er ! " or " You motherfu**er ! I 'll kill you all damn sons of b**tches ! " ) and the acting ( God do n't even remind me how bad it was.<br /><br />STORYLINE : ( this part contains spoilers , beware ! ) The movie begins with a woman giving birth to a mutant baby ( ooh la la ! ) , and then the screen fades to black with the movie 's title appearing , and a monologue . Then we go to this office where there are randomly placed war veteran mannequins . We find that this is for this one scientist keeping track of people looking for mutants . The box to keep track of audio feeds is gone , and everyone dies ! After that tone - setting opening , you 'd expect more.<br /><br />Then , we go to this one team of military recruits training in Baghdad . As the captain parades them " A good job at stupidity " , their last day of training is in New Mexico , the desert where the family in the last THHE had stayed because they were stuck . While in training , things go ultimately wrong , people die , and ... do I need to tell you any more ? Because right now I have the attention span of a goldfish just forcing myself to sit here and type this.<br /><br />The thing that 's wrong with THHE2 is that it just dosen't work . No flashbacks here , and the ending is pretty safe ... but with a twist ! A stupid one , that is . I 'm pretty sure the Ultra Super Director 's Cut with a holographic cover and a ticket to The Hills Have Eyes 3 will showcase all of it 's alternate endings , but at this point , I 'm not sure if I care . < br /><br />So by all means , if you loved the first THHE so much it 's almost a sin not to see this , then by all means , see it . But if else , then , Avoid at all costs . It 's for your own good.<br /><br />3/10
0 You know , I went to see " The Hills have eyes 2 " wanting to like it . I really enjoyed the original , and the remake was fairly entertaining . They obviously had more money to throw around than Wes Craven did on special effects the second time around . Even though I still prefer the original film , the remake was done well , and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me . Bloody , intense , and great special effects . In short , a great popcorn movie for any horror fan.<br /><br />Which brings us to " The Hills have eyes 2 " . Man , where do I start ? The plot , or lack of one , is paper thin . We are not exactly breaking new ground here . The military has decided to monitor the area , and all of these people turn up missing . So what do we do now ? Let 's send in the National Guard to investigate . In true Hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumbest , and worst soldiers ever seen . Gee , I 've never seen that premise before . To make a long story short , you have the mutants killing off the moron soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion . Once again the special effects by Nicotero are great , but the kills no matter how graphic become boring , and predictable . Honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck . It was bloody , and graphic , but I found it predictable , boring , and not scary at all . For me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thought . Wes Craven and his son shared the writing duties , and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror films , but sadly this is n't one of them .
0 THHE remake was a superior movie remake in every way . Most remakes end up being total garbage but under the very talented direction of Alexandre Aja became one of the best ever made in terms of remakes and also as far as the mutant inbreed human sub - genre of horror is concerned . In steps part 2 directed by another individual Martin Weisz and written by the father and son combo of Jonathan and Wes " I can not make a good horror movie to save my life anymore " Craven and if this is any indication of Weisz directing skills and young Craven 's writing skills we are all in for a painful future as THHE 2 not only fails to be as good as the first but also fails to entertain on ANY level.<br /><br />We start off with a fairly graphic mutant baby birth which though is rather cool will not prepare you for the utter garbage that is to come , only hint to what could have been in this film . We then get to see a crew of scientists who all to briefly are introduced and dispatched by our radiated rejects . In steps our main cast of army reservist to save the day , this is where the major problems begin.<br /><br />From very sub par acting ( yes even for this kind of movie ) to the horrible characters to the lack of true carnage for most of its running time THHE 2 becomes a labor to watch as a lot of nothing happens as idiotic soldiers make mistake after mistake only to meet there demise not by the mutants but themselves . Think the Marines in Aliens only the exact opposite and you have the idea of how well these soldiers are trained . This is the true shame of the film as most of the Hills occupants do not get the kills you would like to see , like in the first film , in fact if this did not have THHE 2 attachment in the beginning and the brief overview in the beginning tying this loosely to the first this could have nearly been a Sci - Fi Channel original.<br /><br />The Mutant Mountainbillies as well are not as amusing this time around in fact in a lot of way they are far inferior to our prior batch as they all come off as being rather under designed and uninteresting . Also the one that took the cake was the Sloth - like Mutant ( you know Sloth from the Goonies ) who helps them out in the 3rd act . I was waiting for him to ask for a Baby Ruth or start going on about Rocky Road Ice Cream . Truly disappointing and shameful is the only way to describe most of the goings on here.<br /><br />The gore is in the film but not nearly as visceral as the original in fact it seemed toned down for the most part as other than the mutant baby birth scene there really is n't anything that stood out like in the first . Another major strike against this movie . So what did work here , the answer is nothing at all . This felt like a sequel designed specifically to make money off the success of the first and not to make an actually " good " film.<br /><br />I can go on about the crappy Drill SGT . , the radio man that has a speech impediment ( that 's right , he is the kind of guy I want radioing in for help in a real crisis ) or the pacifist fighter that resembles the exact same character mold as our " hero " in the first film but I believe you get the point . This movie is not even in the same league or even the same planet as the first . It should have been given another title and been added to the Saturday Night Line up on The Sci - Fi Channel . A true shame as a solid sequel could have been made but alas it looks like another horror movie that drops the ball on nearly every level and will get one of my lowest scores as I give THHE 2 the same score as its part : 2/10 Dreadful : Words can not describe how bad this movie is a total polar opposite of its predecessor in every way , uninspired and down - right unnecessary . Next time guys if your going to make a sequel this bad ... don't even bother . Please do n't go support this garbage at the theaters , save your money and thank me later ! ! ! !
0 No one goes to a movie like The Hills Have Eyes 2 and expects the second coming of Citizen Kane . The same is true for the majority of low - rent horror flicks , especially those Roger Ebert has dubbed " Dead Teenager Movies . " The Hills Have Eyes 2 definitely qualifies as a Dead Teenager Movie , only here , the teenagers have been given the superficial appearance of military trainees.<br /><br />Some will argue the line " it 's only a movie " when questionable facts are raised in a movie review , but I 've always been a firm believer that all good fantasy must be rooted in reality in order to be effective . In the Hills Have Eyes 2 , we 're to believe the main characters are military people on a training exercise , but they look and talk like high school kids camping in the desert . The dialog is awful and frequently vulgar to excess . Though the films are n't nearly comparable , I kept imagining these " soldiers " being in Platoon , and shuddering with dread.<br /><br />Very little about the characters evokes a soldier other than rifles and fatigues : radio transmissions are carried out like teenage phone conversations ; a Colonel is addresses as " hey , asshole " by a Private . And nobody seems to have the slightest idea what to do , or any sense of command structure , when things begin to go wrong . I think of the soldiers in James Cameron 's Aliens , a film of pure fantasy , and how even those futuristic Marines behaved like real soldiers despite their fantastic situations . Fantasy rooted in reality.<br /><br />I try to begin watching a movie as a 5 on a scale of 10 , and judge it 's strengths and weaknesses from there . You have to allow concessions for the material ; there 's no way Star Wars is as good of a movie as The Godfather , on equal terms . But both are excellent examples of their type.<br /><br />In that respect , while the Hills Have Eyes 2 is a pretty dreadful exercise in amateur and immature writing , it 's only modestly worse in that regard than the typical Dead Teenager Movie . On a technical side , the movie appears to have decent production values and is pretty well made from that perspective . Scenes that are intended to shock , or which are intended to evoke urgency or suspense generally work . So , while watching The Hills Have Eyes 2 may indeed be a fate worse than death , there are certainly far worse horror flicks in circulation.<br /><br />It 's worth a watch for those who enjoy this type of stuff without the usual fanboy baggage , or those who do n't tend towards thinking every movie they see is either the Best Ever or the Worst Ever of all time . If you do n't " get " horror , especially the Dead Teenager variety , you 're not likely to have a good time with this one.<br /><br />4/10
0 This is a weak sequel : it lacks the interest and light touch of the magnificent " Man Called Horse " in nearly every aspect and when compared to each other they hardly seem to be the same genre.<br /><br />The Return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke different Indian ceremonies but comes across as trying way too hard to bottle the magic of the first . In this film the tribe is lost and abandoned , having lost their homelands , modern life has encroached on paradise and they are living in abject misery and poverty . Perhaps this is the point : the first film took us to a place where we would want to be , a simpler time . This takes us to broken Indians in a miserable world and the White Man is the hero and savior which rather negates the whole idea of the film.<br /><br />The beauty of the first lay in the fact that the white man learnt and discovered that real civilization lies in values rather than western materialism . In the second film this is all but lacking and so we end up with a weak film.<br /><br />A huge disappointment .
0 Caught this by accident on a t.v . showing - and could hardly believe how utterly awful the whole experience was . By comparison , the original " A Man Called Horse " was spell - binding because it held one 's interest throughout . But this piece of nonsense - words fail me . It was bad enough to have some kind of a " story " presented with all the impact of a wet loaf of bread , but that error was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles throughout whenever the so - called " Sioux " spoke . For goodness sake , could n't the film - makers have found enough North American Indians who were also actors and near - actors to perform as " Indians " in this farrago instead of the imposters they actually used ? I also found it quite embarrassing watching Richard Harris cavorting all around the countryside at the obvious behest of the director standing just behind camera , telling him to run and jump from pointless Point A to pointless Point B just to make up film footage and minutes . Absolutely terrible in all respects !
0 I thoroughly enjoyed A Man Called Horse when it was released in 1970 , but Return played like a typical sequel . Everything about it -- budget , script , plot , casting , and acting -- was inferior to the original . Gale Sondergaard as Elk Woman , an elder of the Yellow Hand tribe , looks nothing like an Indian , and neither do half of the other " Indians , " who were played by Italians , Mexicans , and Latinos with cheap wigs . And the old guy who played the chief acted more like a fat old squaw than a fierce leader of warriors . He even used the bow like a woman ! Finally , Richard Harris , who did such a superb job in the original , seems to be coasting this time around . I guess he could n't resist the easy paycheck he got for reprising his role as Horse.<br /><br />To be fair , there are some interesting moments in the movie , such as Horse 's undergoing a painful purification ritual to " find his vision " and rally the Yellow Hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors , but on the whole , Return is uneven , boring , corny , and predictable -- just like most sequels .
0 This movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school , watching as the RAWANDAN genocide un - furls around him.<br /><br />The movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of Rawanda . Then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic " NEW - COMER " a young teacher who does n't take life or the situation too seriously . As he and the driver approach a road - block he plays around with his drivers I.D. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver ca n't identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they 'll be killed . And that s how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him . Suddenly realizes that every Rawandan ( including his driver ) is involved and that the Europeans soldiers and tourists can not and will not help . The media cameras can not stop machete 's , and there 's too many machete wielding militia - men too shoot . the title comes from the armies captain saying he 's going to shoot the dogs eating the dead - bodies around his compound , but wo n't shoot the Militia - men that are killing people around the compound . Mainly because they have n't fired at the soldiers yet . Finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims , flees with his tail in - between his legs , rather than face immanent death with the school kids he 's promised not to leave behind.<br /><br />It 's more of character study , and a come to Jesus moment for one character , than a story about the genocide in " RAWANDA " . This movie did n't have to take place in RAWANDA , it could have taken place any one of the Genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time .
0 Serge Farnel made a very precise critics of this film in the revue " The Rwandese night " ( www.lanuitrwandaise.net)<br /><br />A critics which shows how France was behind all the situation undergone by the United Nations in Rwanda.<br /><br />The UN soldiers were in a dangerous situation while the french soldiers were warmly welcomed by the genocide forces.<br /><br />The day before , ten UN soldiers had been killed by the genocide forces.<br /><br />That is why the UN soldiers decided to protect their own lives by driving behind the french trucks.<br /><br />By doing so , they gave up the Tutsi which is unforgivable of course.<br /><br />But we must keep in mind that the french soldiers organized this situation .
0 This film was basically Velvet Goldmine if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a t.v . movie . The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine had which was good acting , writing , and basically everything else . The film had some of the worst writing I 've seen since Wild Wild West . It definitely needed to be interesting . I know vh 1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows . which are a lot better than all this which would have worked if it was a behind the music episode but did n't and feel flat on it 's face .
0 The majority of Stephen King 's short stories are little gems , with original ideas that do n't take a long time to develop ; basically lean and mean -- he sets them up quickly in a scarce number of pages , you read 'em , and you 're finished before you know you 've begun . They 're like the equivalent of a carton of McDonald 's fries -- they taste Really good and you know there 's not much nutritional value in them ( re : from a literary standpoint , they do n't say much about the universal human condition ) , but you 're still gon na scarf 'em down , just do n't be a pig and go for the extra - super - sized portion and fill up on too much grease ( " too much grease " is a metaphor for the prose in King 's novels when find yourself reading one of them and saying come on -- enough with the pop - cultural observations or clever Yankee asides -- get on with the story already ! ) He has compiled four books of short story collections . I 've read them all -- from NightShift to the latest , Everything 's Eventual , and they all display an efficiency of getting - to - the - point which is sometimes sorely lacking in his tome - sized novels.<br /><br />But his short stories never overstay their welcome ... which brings us to the TV adaptations of Nightmares And Dreamscapes ... <br /><br />How in the hell did they ( the series ' producers ) get a green - light to turn stories that usually averaged 15 pages into 50 minute episodes ? I 'll tell you how -- two words--"Stephen King . " Stories with his name on them probably did n't come cheap , and one hour shows enable more advertising than half hour ones , so ... what should have been an anthology of mostly 23 or 24 minute episodes is turned into double that length , and double the commercial time ... Ka - Ching!<br /><br />I'm not going to waste time synopsizing the plots of these stories -- this review supposes you have already read the stories and/or seen the show ; what follows is merely my gut reactions to what TNT presented ... Of the four installments so far , here 's my ten cent assessment ( from first to worst ) : < br /><br />Battleground-- Not a classic by any means , but hey , how could anyone argue with keeping William Hurt from opening his trap by filming this episode without a single line of dialog ? And the tongue - in - cheek reference and destruction of the killer Zuni doll from Trilogy Of Terror proved to me the producers ( and the writer of the teleplay , who is Richard Matheson 's son -- the writer of TOT ) knew their mission with this one was to make the action deadly , yet at the same time , fun . It took longer to get to Hurt 's apartment than it should have , but I think it fulfilled it 's objective . 8/10<br /><br />Umney 's Last Case-- Liked this one primarily because of William H. Macy 's performance . I think the writer / Umney should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eye / Umney beginning because he was the actual reality of the story , and anyone familiar with the King short story ( probably half , if not more of the audience ) knew the Chandleresque set - up was due to get interrupted by the writer 's reality , so let 's get on with it already , and cut - out the cute and clever hard - boiled repartee ' Private Dick banter already . Once the writer / Umney 's family tragedy began to reveal though , I thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer ( me , at least ) , feel sympathy for the real - life Macy 's attempt to escape his sorrows by usurping his fictional creation 's exciting life . 6/10 < br /><br />The End Of The Whole Mess-- Uh , this title is how I felt about this episode when it was over . After twenty minutes , I was ready to scream at the TV -- OK , we get it already , the younger brother is a Mega Mensa Genius Prodigy Extraordinaire ! We know from Ron Livingston talking to the camera ( " time is running out for me "-- not fast enough , I thought ) that the young whiz kid is going to discover something really bad for humanity -- we know this because he 's already built an airplane but almost died because he could n't steer it out of the path of a tree ; and , he blew up his chemistry lab while teaching himself chemistry ( to think the end of the world could have been prevented if only this kid had some more parental supervision ) . So much time was wasted on establishing the uber - genius of Henry Thomas , when we finally get to the resolution of his discovery -- the end of the world through unintended idiocy -- how much do we get to see of the world " ending ?"-- a cheap video shot of a reporter starting to forget what she 's reporting on , and brief radio broadcasts announcing the day of judgement is at hand . Oh , and the brother 's parents drooling and singing old songs . My point is , if your story is really about the " end of the whole mess ( world ) " , I wanna see the " mess " as it goes up in flames and crashes and burns . Talk about ending with a whimper , indeed . 2/10 < br /><br />Crouch End-- This episode just ticked me off totally . I could have lived with the taking - forever exposition of the happy couple arriving at their hotel , playing slap - and - tickle , having lunch , and getting a taxi ( that was half the episode right there ) , if once they finally crossed - over into Crouch End the episode delivered the chills , but it failed miserabley . Not only was n't it scary , it was practically laughable . Ooh , look -- a kitty ... wait , it turns ... oh my god ! Look at it 's scary eye ! Uh - huh . They could have gone a long way towards filming the Crouch End sequence at night instead of in daylight , too . Things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows . But I guess the budget was n't high enough to shoot at night on the fake London sets they slapped together for this one . On the page , this is a very scary story about tourists wandering into places they should n't and the terrible things that might lurk just around a corner there . The only terror in this adaptation was the directing and acting -- those were truly horrifying . 1/10 < br /><br />Overall Series Average ( so far ) : 4/10
0 The first episode set the bar quite high i thought . It starred William Hurt as a hit - man who is contracted to kill a toymaker . We are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill , indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all . Returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers , this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business . But he is in for a night of hell , the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war , driving jeeps , shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters!. The special effects are good for a TV show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive , sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not . I wo nt spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist . This gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment , the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one . Stephen King adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception
0 Man , I really wanted to like these shows . I am starving for some good television and I applaud TNT for providing these " opportunites " . But , sadly , I am in the minority I guess when it comes to the Cinematic Stephen King . As brilliant as King 's writing is , the irony is that it simply does n't translate well to the screen , big or small . With few exceptions ( very few ) , the King experience can not be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read . Many people would disagree with this , but I 'm sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed King story is but a pale memory of the one they read . The reason is simple . The average King story takes place in the mind - scape of the characters in the story . He gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts , their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view . In short , King takes the reader places where you ca n't put a Panavision camera . As an audience watching the filmed King , we 're left with less than half the information than the reader has access to . It 's not too far a stretch to claim that One becomes a character in a King story they read , whereas One is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed . For as long as King writes , Hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor , without any regard to whether or not they should . I do n't blame the filmmakers for trying , but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive Stephen King adaptation that works . The task is akin to turning lead into gold , or some arcane Zen mastery . Oh well , better luck next time .
0 i usually do n't write reviews but i ca n't understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average TV watchers.<br /><br />i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so cliché , it was n't even funny any more . the same old stories you 've probably seen / read a couple of times already - living toys , evil things from other dimensions ... and it 's not just that these stories are n't innovative , they are also pretty bad versions of those clichés . i 'd prefer e.g. " chucky " and " silent hill " over those two episodes anytime . and do n't even ask about the visual effects ... the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second ... awful . looks like some film student 's project gone wrong . blood ... or gore ... erm ... nothing worth mentioning.<br /><br />it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably has n't seen / read that many scary stories yet ( although i 'd rather recommend " beyond belief " - now that 's what i call a decent mystery TV show ) . but for an adult horror fan this is worthless . i only gave the 3 points because there is in fact some beautiful cinematography ( especially in the second episode ) and some nice acting .
0 I just saw the third week of Stephen Kings ' Nightmares and Dreamscapes mini series ; meaning , I saw 6 episodes so far . I have to say that the stories are really weak . I have read Stephen King 's Skeleton Crew , a collection of his short stories that was published way back . I recall most of the stories were average to poor but there was one that was really excellent , if not outstanding.<br /><br />What I 'm trying to say is that just because this mini series is from a collection of stories from Stephen King does not mean that it will be any good . In fact , if his previous collection of short stories are of any indication , then most of this mini series will be average to poor.<br /><br />In Stephen King 's defense , I have not read these new short stories . Perhaps they are good as stories in a book and not readily adaptable to television , or perhaps it was the fault of the scriptwriters in trying to write an interesting script . Who knows . Also , these short stories may have been made exclusively for this mini series and not not for print purpose . Maybe that may have been the problem . If Stephen King had submitted these crap stories to an editor , I am sure the editor would have immediately told him to make it more interesting because as is , it is simply boring.<br /><br />What is clear from all of this is that the problem is with the stories / script and not the actors and actresses because this mini series has some excellent people acting on it.<br /><br />Seeing this mini series really makes me appreciate those old " Twilight Zone " series . Each series was only half an hour but it was compelling and riveting . I do n't understand why this mini series could not accomplish similar feat . I am sure this mini series had a good deal of money to make a good mini series but unfortunately , something must not have clicked.<br /><br />For instance , this week there were two episodes shown . The first involved a horror story writer who buys a picture drawn by an artist who committed suicide . The writer begins to see changes in the picture as he is driving homeward . Feeling uncomfortable , he throws away the painting but it keeps appearing near him . Also , the portrait of an individual in that picture is killing people and is out to kill him . ( I will not even mention the second episode for this week involving criminals and their loot because it was even more boring than this episode!)<br /><br />This premise is interesting and so the story should be good but after seeing it , I was frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story as well as extraneous materials that was shown that did nothing to help the story . After the last scene , I was left with more questions than answers.<br /><br />I tried for 3 weeks to get into this mini series but it was just too aggravating due to poor stories / script . If this was a movie , I would have recommended that people should wait for the movie to come out on cable or such . I would not even recommend that it be rented in your video store . However , given that this is on TNT , a cable channel , I would say if you have not seen it already , then try it for one week . If you do not like it that week , then you will not like the past series nor the future ones , since they all share the same boring trait .
0 I 've barely just made it through one episode ( " Crouch End " ) . The dialog was stilted and down - right cringe worthy . The acting was tragic . Eion Bailey , despite his best attempts to be dramatic , remains mostly expressionless . His eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment . Claire Forlani could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie . The characters were cartoons , each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random , meandering plot . Cheesy special effects can be excused given the TV miniseries budget . But attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the unwatchability . I get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising , but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story . If I had to compare it 's overall quality to something else , I 'd put this episode of " Nightmares and Dreamscapes " on par with the NBC 's Hercules .
0 With its companion piece MASTERS OF HORROR , NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that began so auspiciously with THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE OUTER LIMITS.<br /><br />Of course , part of the problem is that it does nothing to be of any interest to a comparatively adult audience , instead aiming at TEN - YEAR - OLDS , who are only able to count body - bags , and scarcely that . And so grossness is king , and King is grossness.<br /><br />Stephen King is simply illiterate  in general he has the aptitude for storytelling of Bart Simpson . Since he can not read his sole inspiration is the movies.<br /><br />True , the cinema is not such a bad place to start , since it has generally escaped the onslaught of " Realism " . But these films are only the rumor , not the thing , and if you want to WRITE , you have to dig deeper.<br /><br />Of course , only PICKMAN had monsters as close acquaintances . But even so , it should be clear to any undergraduate that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi.<br /><br />At least AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR is a clear indication of what is wrong . One can almost imagine this pathetic dolt sitting as his desk trying to come up with something SCARY.<br /><br />Not , mind you , trying to describe accurately the horror of the system of which he is an integral part , making the stupid stupider , but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew . Suppose , you were paralyzed , and people thought you were dead and started to cut you open like they do at those autopsy things ! Would n't that be gross ? And that , boys and girls , is the story.<br /><br />What about characterization ? Oh yes , he 's one of these suits , who never really appreciated life , you know , and now it 's too late , right ? And he 's shouting  well , they ca n't actually hear him , you know  he 's saying that he 's going to sue the hospital , but he 's not such a big shot anymore , you see , lying there ( or is it laying , I can never remember ) and all . And he 's thinking : Oh no please , please do n't cut me and this is terrible , lying ( or laying ) like that  now , would n't that be a great story ? You know I read somewhere that a snake bite can do that , I think it was that great medical authority Agatha Christie . What was the name of that snake again , oh yeah , a BOOMSLANG  has quite a ring to it , does n't it.<br /><br />Let 's make it a PERUVIAN BOOMSLANG ! Sure , Steve , that 's great  except that BOOMSLANG is Afrikaans , you moron ! But how can you really tell that the target audience is children , and not simply mental defects ? It 's easy : There 's no sex.<br /><br />Well , there is , but it 's the kind glimpsed through a crack in the door to our parent 's bedroom . Modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre , the monster , the female victim , the chase.<br /><br />But unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON they have no idea what 's going on . All that 's really left is the giggling outside the SM club and the Fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are intrinsically evil.<br /><br />In spite of a certain discrepancy in size , King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay Wray . Freddy Krueger can only kill her.<br /><br />And since there 's no real titillation in that , he has to torture her first  not in any way that might excite her , you understand , since that would upset our puritan sentiments . And so , horror and romanticism become simply unpleasantness and the grooming of psychopaths.<br /><br />Our hero , you see , is a rubber fetishist , and can only get a boner if someone touches him you know down there with you know  rubber gloves ( giggle ) . And that 's what they use in autopsies , and that 's how they discover that he is , in fact , you know.<br /><br />Obviously , this is the author at the height of his inspirational powers . Too bad , they cut it out , since it might have upset the FIVE - YEAR - OLDS watching the show !
0 So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been erratic and disappointing . The first segment , directed by Brian Henson , may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares , but at least it was well - directed , suspenseful , and visually interesting , with solid acting by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini - series.<br /><br />However , the second story in the series was just dreadful , and not in the good way . The screenplay is bad , requiring the shallow , unlikable protagonists to act illogically in order to move the plot , and having characters ramble on endlessly for the purposes of clunky , unnecessary exposition . The acting is overdone and unconvincing , and I felt far more empathy for a cold - blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second . The director used a million tricks to try to make the narrative spooky , but with the amateurish acting and writing , the end result looks like a freshman - year film school project , with camera moves for their own sake , and little in the way of plot or tension.<br /><br />If the rest of the series continues like this , I 'll be sorely let down . I look forward to William H. Macy 's installment , and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment . So far the quality is far too inconsistent to predict either way .
0 The beginning of the 90s brought many " quirky " and " off - beat " independent films , a particular sub - genre of which is the semi - spiritual desert crime movie . Others of note are " Wild at Heart " , " From Dusk Til Dawn " , and to a certain extent " Natural Born Killers " . Good films like those spawned junk like " Highway 666 " , " Destiny Turns on the Radio " and this ineptly surreal anti - masterpiece " Under The Hula Moon " . It 's a comedy that aims for a certain emotional tone , attains it , but keeps going to the point of irritation . While the pursuit across the spirit - world of the desert and the casting of Chris Penn are good ideas , the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime movie , and is n't focused enough on laughs to really be a comedy . I wo n't blow the ending , but let 's just say it 's bad . The film is basically a bad side effect of genre - cancer . This is the dregs of indie - mania .
0 Along with 2 days in the Valley , I think this is one of worst movies I 've ever seen . Just another of the long line of Tarantino rip - offs that have emerged since Pulp Fiction . The atmosphere the movie creates is amusing for the first five minutes , but then the film makers make the unforgivable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to up the " hip " quotient . You 're better off skipping this one .
0 First , let me just comment on what I liked about the movie . The special effects were fantastic , and very rarely did I feel like I was watching a video game . There , that is the last nice thing I have to say about this film . In fact , I would just like everyone reading this to take note that I ca n't even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing . < br /><br />I have innumerable complaints about the film , but four major complaints jump to mind . My first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the " plot twist " ( if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away ) where Lois 's 5 year - old son turns out to be the super - powered child of Superman . When the crying super - child throws a piano at Lex 's henchman to save his mother , I almost got up and left the theater . Singer could have made a much better Superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super - powered illegitimate child . It 's been 5 days since I saw the movie and I still want to vomit . < br /><br />My next major complaint has to do with the fact that Superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space . It does n't take comic book guy from the Simpsons to point out what 's wrong with that . I do n't know how many comic books Brian Singer has read , but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet . Whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any Superman - related projects ever again . The concept is as ridiculous as making a Dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun . Why not just have Superman eat kryptonite ? He can eat it and then brush his teeth with it , and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas . That 's not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re - entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground . < br /><br />My third major complaint has to do with the fact that Singer slaps movie - goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie . I have to take issue with his characterization of Superman as the only son of a God - like Jor - el sent to Earth to be a savior . Jor - el was n't all - wise , he was just a scientist . And he did n't send his son to earth to be a savior , he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode . I 'll buy the Christ allegory if Brian Singer can show me the part in the Bible where God sends Christ to Earth because Heaven was about to explode , and then radioactive pieces of Heaven become Christ 's primary weakness . Furthermore , the " crucifixion " scene where Luthor stabs Superman in the side with a kryptonite " spear " just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until I 'm too brain - dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future . They might as well rename this movie " Superman Returns : the Passion of the Christ." < br /><br />And speaking of Luthor , my last major complaint has to do with Singer 's depiction of Lex Luthor . Lex Luthor is a shrewd , cold - hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for President ( which he does in the comics ) than try to destroy the world . The man wants money and power ; he wants to be in charge , not wreck everything . Yet the Luthor we see Superman Returns , as well as all the previous Superman movies , is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world . If Singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the ( quite awful ) previous Superman movies , this film might not be such an unbearable travesty . Maybe Singer 's next project can be a Batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of Batman from 1960s TV show . ZAM ! WHAP ! POW!!<br /><br />To summarize , I do n't know what I hate more , the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews . Everyone is entitled to their opinion , but if you do n't hate this movie then your opinion is wrong . I sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you have n't already . Do n't see it , do n't buy it when it comes out on DVD , do n't rent it ... basically do n't contribute any money towards it in any way . This movie does not deserve to make any money . In fact , I think that for every person that sees this movie , Bryan Singer should be fined 45 billion dollars . If you 're a Superman fan and you really want to see this movie , just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you 'll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time .
0 Special effects ? Good.<br /><br />Script ? Terrible . No plot . No depth . No meaning . This film rendered Superman as a meaningless hero , a hero with no archetype . In the original film , he represented America in the Cold War . Here , he represented nothing but a Hulk.<br /><br />Sure , the actors were fine . Kevin Spacey was a fine choice , among others.<br /><br />This still does not resolve the problem that this film had no depth whatsoever . I can not see how anyone can come away with anything meaningful from this film , when Superman was , and is , daily created to be a meaningful hero in not only comics but also in people 's minds . This was a real waste of money considering how many directions this film could have taken.<br /><br />Just a few instances : Lex Luthor could have been a villain of global corporatism , political domination , totalitarianism , and on and on and on . He was just another goofball Hackman incarnation.<br /><br />And Superman ? For what did he stand in this film ? Nothing but another hack " savior " figure.<br /><br />Wait until it comes to the dollar theater if you see it at all .
0 I guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first Superman film , as it is just as crummy and painfully long as the original.<br /><br />After an opening scene consisting solely of murky intergalactic visuals , the credits pay homage to the even - crummy - looking - for - their - time futuristic sweeping credits of the original Superman film.<br /><br />Then there is some more murky stuff . Ma Kent sees some kind of murky ruckus on the farm , and spends a good portion of my life slowly walking up to some debris in the cornfield . Then Superman sneaks up on her and faints.<br /><br />Next we catch up with Lex Luthor in a scene about many murky close - ups of an old lady as she dies . We do n't see Luthor 's face until the end of the scene , an early instance of the film 's drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned . Lex Luthor is a guy who does n't like Superman because he is not human . Also , he probably does n't like humans either , as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot about Lex Luthor planning to kill most of Earth 's population.<br /><br />After a while , Clark Kent shows up back at his old job ( I forgot to mention , he had been away on a five year trip where nothing happened ) . Then he finds out Lois Lane has an illegitimate kid and is dating Cyclops . It upsets him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame.<br /><br />At this point we see that Miss Lane is on some kind of jet attached to some kind of space shuttle . It is some kind of important event on account of it is on television . Then we learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event . There are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit . The film then reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summer.<br /><br />As the events leading up to the inevitable disaster started to build , I excused myself to get a soda . I accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched that movie about Al Gore showing slides in its entirety . I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns , but I somehow wandered into Prairie Home Companion , which I watched twice in a row . Then it was time to stop messing around.<br /><br />I walked back into the first theater , found my seat , and looked up to see that the impending Lois Lane space shuttle disaster was almost upon us . Still , it seemed to be taking forever , so I wandered around the theater , met a girl , got married , raised a son and sent him off to college . While attending my son 's medical school graduation , I remembered that I should probably check in on Superman Returns , so I excused myself and raced back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry . It still took about another half hour before things went wrong for Space Shuttle Lane . When they did , Superman saved everybody , which was pretty cool.<br /><br />. And then there is a a subplot where Superman turns really creepy and starts stalking Lois Lane and her family with his x - ray vision and super - hearing . Then he tries to get her to cheat on Cyclops , who seems like a good guy.<br /><br />Meanwhile , Lex Luthor is involved in some kind of contest to display every possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie . I forgot to bring my scorecard home with me ( they give you one at the door ) , but I think he scored damn close to one hundred percent . I hope he wins the million dollars.<br /><br />At this point , things start to gear up for the big murky finale . I think maybe the projector was broken , on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here . I remember seeing murky things growing out of the water , Superman getting sick , Superman getting better , back to the murky things , he 's sick again , no wait , he 's okay again.<br /><br />Then Lex Luthor unleashed his final bad guy move : yelling at his girlfriend a little bit.<br /><br />Then Superman died and came back to life . I thought the movie was over , so I left.<br /><br />Ninety years later , the nursing home where I lived felt a little chilly . I realized I left my sweatshirt back in the theater , and I went to retrieve it . When I did , I was slightly surprised to find that Superman Returns was n't over yet . I tried to ask some of the viewers what I missed , but most of them were only skeletons with long gray beards by now.<br /><br />I sat back in my old seat and watched as Lois Lane puttered around her house for a while . Then Superman showed up and started quoting the beginning of the movie , and since I already saw that part I thought it was okay to leave.<br /><br />So that is my review of Superman Returns.<br /><br />Oh , also , if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog , you will love this movie . On account of there are two jokes like that in it .
0 I saw the movie last night and I really wanted to like it . My expectations for the movie had been going up and down ever since I heard it was being made . Some days I 'd see something spectacular and some days I 'd be disappointed.<br /><br />Yet being the kind of fan I am , I had high hopes for this movie but in the end I was sorely disappointed.<br /><br />While I love the Richard Donner movies I did n't like their sometimes campy nature or the changes they made to Superman 's character and his powers.<br /><br />Singer however chose to take the worst elements of the Donner movies and put them in his version.<br /><br />While his Lex Luthor is slightly darker he 's still nothing more than a shyster , a conman and a common criminal . He 's no more intelligent than when Gene Hackman played him . Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor well but ultimately he falls victim to shoddy writing and unremarkable dialog.<br /><br />His henchmen are more two dimensional than even comic book henchmen . Most of them literally have no dialog in the movie.<br /><br />****SPOILERS AHEAD * * * * Kitty Kowalski is almost exactly the same character as Ms. Tesmacher . She seems to be as evil and cold as Lex Luthor but she proves to be just an underling who melts after seeing Superman in trouble and quite predictably betrays Luthor.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment in the movie was Frank Langella as Perry White . I was n't a huge fan of the over the top Perry White in the Donner movies but at least he had a soul . He was after all said and done , a veteran reporter who cared about the truth and a good story . Langella 's Perry White is nothing but a corporate stooge . He wants everyone to concentrate on the Superman related stories because they sell papers even though every other paper is doing the same thing . He does n't care about the real stories , the real mysteries like the black out and what Lex Luthor is up to now that he 's out of prison.<br /><br />The worst thing about Langella is that he 's DULL ! Some actors can be quiet and sober and yet have an undercurrent that lets you know that still waters run deep . Frank Langella is puddle.<br /><br />Brandon Routh is not a bad actor . He 's OK but again there is not a single memorable line in the whole movie . Not the actor 's fault . His movements are clearly meant to look graceful , like even the slightest movement of his fingers effects the way he flies . But it still looks choreographed and artificial.<br /><br />Lois Lane while badly written was surprisingly well acted by Kate Bosworth . Unfortunately , again , for a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and writer , she is about as eloquent as any teenage on Dawson 's Creek.<br /><br />James Marsden was my favorite actor in the whole movie , mostly because he looks more like Superman than even Routh . Without any superpowers he manages to figure out Lois Lane 's message , flies a plane to the location , gets on board Luthor 's yacht and rescues Lois and her son.<br /><br />The only moving moment in the movie is when they are all trapped pantry as it is flooding with water and the ship is sinking . You see them slowly going being immersed in the water . You know Superman 's going to come by at the last moment to rescue them but still you ca n't help but feel sorry for them.<br /><br />As I said before the plot is very haphazard . Unlike Singer has said , this is not a movie about a superhero returning and trying to find his place in the world . As soon as he returns the world welcomes him back with open arms . Lois is the only one who 's not happy to see him back . Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because it gives him a chance to settle the score with the man of steel.<br /><br />Superman is shown to be probably one of the dumbest heroes in the universe . A big green piece of meteorite is stolen from a museum , Lex Luthor is out of prison , he now has knowledge about Superman 's powers and weaknesses , and yet he 's still not able to connect the dots enough to know Luthor would be using kryptonite against him.<br /><br />According to the movie the only thing Superman is good for is lifting really , really heavy things . The action sequences are all incredibly predictable .
0 This movie was extremely poorly conceived from every angle except technological . I stood and watched everyone waddle out of the theater , their faces drained like their lives flashed before their eyes -- eyes wandering at their neighbor , wondering if it was just them . I mean , how could the movie really be bad . Nobody'll admit it , it 's a classic case of The Emperor Wears No Clothes . " Who am I to question a movie containing a guy who stops a jet liner ? " But the fact remains , every member of the audience is thinking what I 'm writing right now . I actually plagiarized their faces.<br /><br />Obviously Lois is only aroused by power , she wo n't even have a cup of coffee with the Superman With Glasses who does n't stop jet liners . It ca n't be the look in " his " eyes to the depths of his soul or anything like that . In the old Supermans , she had some level of connection with him , he was n't priority number 1 , obviously , but it strengthened her character that she was " torn " . I bet Henry Kissinger would have even won this Lois over before Clark Kent.<br /><br />And now it 's official , Kryptonite does to Superman what eating at McDonalds does to the avg . person.<br /><br />SUPERMAN " ONE " He loses his earth dad , then finds his real super dad , the story is captivating every step of the way . He 's human , he relates to people and he feels love for people , he relates to highschool students , he relates to people who feel different . He relates . The Superman Returns superman seems to relate only to Superpeople and it seems he 's just " doing a job " when he 's saving people.<br /><br />There 's something about Clark that Lois likes , she 's really internally in love with him but ca n't admit it , and when he comes into the picture as Superman , it throws a kink in the on - the - rocks love . Without Superman , she would 've fallen in love with Clark ( at least that 's what the movie points to , whether it was the intention or not ) . Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN , Clark is like a pile of horse maneur to Lois . Literally.<br /><br />SUPERMAN TWO I just watched it again . As a kid , I " thought " I enjoyed the action , but now I know it was the STORY that held me then too , watching it over and over again . If I saw Superman Returns as a child , I would 've hated it then too , I think.<br /><br />There is so much heart and soul and superpower going around in this movie , it 's sick . Superman gives up his powers for love as a world plot is going on and meanwhile , MEANWHILE , Lex Luther 's got something fantastic up his sleeve.<br /><br />SUPERMAN THREE Now there 's a three - way love story between Superman and Lana and Clark , only humanity wins and Clark 's inner nature beats Superman 's power , because when his SUPERmoral nature is gone and he 's SuperHUMAN ( who does human things with his superpowers ) , she sees it 's not the power of Superman that she 's in love with , it 's not SUPERpowerman , but SUPERMORTALman that she loves -- and who 's really SUPER . And when she tells Clark she " prefers " him to Superman , he is elated , he has made a human connection again . He wants to be accepted for who he is , not just for his ability to bend steel . THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT 'S MISSING FROM SUPERMAN RETURNS.<br /><br />Clark super - sneezes to help the kid get a strike - humanity again . Plus , it 's an INERESTING use of superpowers . He 's not just using straight brute strength.<br /><br />He crushes the coal into a diamond for his woman because she had to sell hers , love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than for saving.<br /><br />It seems there 's nothing at stake in Superman Returns . Even in Superman Three , we see the damages caused by the nemesis ' world domination plot .. we see suffering , we see how it effects Pryor and others and people in the middle of it .. there 's no damage , esp . emotional from Lex 's plot to sink the US . We see a glob of crystal thrown into space .. Superman had to get very creative in the first three Supermans in order to stop the plot against him , he could n't just " access " his superpowers . In the first one , he had to stop two missiles going in different directions and then break his universal mandate and erase history to save Lois ' life ... ( this was THIRTY YEARS AGO ! ! " ) In the second one , he had to outsmart three guys that he was already more POWERFUL than , but combined with Lex 's genius , and the villains ' immoral tactics , Superman 's overpowering was n't enough , he had to work one against the other and outsmart them ... In Superman III , again , his superpowers were n't enough to win .. He had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything it saw . He could n't use straight aggression on the computer because it calculated it in advance , so he had to use a benign acid that would only become deadly to the computer after the computer responded to the aggression . And he found that acid earlier when he could n't simply use his superpowers to BLOW out a fire because it was a chemical fire , so he had to use his superbrains -- he could n't carry water , so he froze a lake and dropped it on the fire .. Now in Superman Returns , he simply lunges the island into outerspace , like a night temp for UPS . He does n't need to figure anything out , he just uses his " super strength " . And Lex Luther 's brilliance was shown at the premeditation level of a junkie who just ran out of junk.<br /><br />To say nothing of the fact that he threw that island into outerspace after getting stabbed with a KNIFE of kyrptonite right in the bloodstream AND the island itself was dripping kryptonite spores in his face , but he just averted his eyes and nose like it was n't Grey Poupon he was looking at .
0 This movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classical theme . I used to love Superman movies , but this one made me want to shoot myself . Very poor acting , outrageous special effects , and a plot equal to zero . To summarize : Superman leaves earth , because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet , some were in space ( duh ) , does n't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving ( duh again ) , takes off in a spaceship ( ? ! ? ) , comes back i think 5 years later , and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again ( who is now razing his son , which son , in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old ) . And what about that Lex Luthor ? Trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land ? Please ! ! < br /><br />I vote 1 out of 10 for this movie , only because i am not allowed to vote 0 . If you have anything else to do with your time , do n't go to see this movie , and even if you do n't have anything else to do , stay home and watch TV !
0 Did the movie - makers even preview this before they released it ? The script jumps from place to place without giving much explanation . The beginning does n't clarify if its a prequel or not . It starts with Superman 's beginnings on Earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie - but does n't really alert the viewer of this . VERY confusing ! Superman himself is weak and in need of Prozac . He is portrayed as a potential home - wrecker , a stalker , and someone who is clearly depressed and confused . This type of character rarely makes for an interesting hero . The ending is absolutely ridiculous . Superman ending up in a hospital just made me want to kill him off myself . I 'm seriously waiting for a SNL skit where Superman appears on Maury Povich and Maury says , " The results are in - in the case of the child , Superman , you ARE the father . " To sum up - OK acting by this Superman and Kevin Spacey , but HORRIBLE script . The movie is basically unwatchable .
0 or : It 's a bird ? It 's a plane ? No , look ... It 's a disaster ! or : No need to look up in the sky.<br /><br />or : ( ... OK , that 's enough . ) If singer tried to make a romantic titanic like movie to crash the box office record , he failed . The SR structure ca n't do this , the dark and restricted color scheme ( I would call it " wishi - washi " ) , the boring usual dialogs , the clown with advanced alien technology , the missing fun and magic , etc . makes the movie completely disappointing.<br /><br />It simply does n't work.<br /><br />The main thing at a character like superman is , that he is a superhero . That 's the core , the most important thing.<br /><br />Love trouble and a sadly lost depressive Supersoftie can maximal only be a facet in a 2:40 long Superman movie , not the whole time.<br /><br />Because then it is not a superman or superhero movie anymore . It 's like a ( and in this case a very bad and boring ) social study , where every 30 minutes a person flies around.<br /><br />That 's a big difference.<br /><br />This movie is a joke . Holy skywalker , this is Superman , so give us Supervillains , Superaction and the most important thing , Superfun.<br /><br />We want ENTERTAINMENT ! Singer , if you want to make a 2:40 long soul love trouble drama about lost and sadly people ? Then take normal human characters and make a yentl remake.<br /><br />They say : Superman returns . And then , supersadlysoftie stands in the door.<br /><br />Maybe singer has tried to kill the legend without kryptonite , but one bad movie ca n't do this . Do n't give up , they plan a sequel ... <br /><br />Next time singer ( and Warner Brothers ) , make a superhero movie , not a depressive superlame soap , or let it be . A superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with a lot of fun and magic.<br /><br />This movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with a super cover . Yes , technically there are all sorts in , yes , there is a lot of small talks , there are a few jokes , a view action scenes , etc , but the only one what all these worse pieces have in common is their poor quality.<br /><br />It 's not more than a super boring patchwork and one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my live.<br /><br />The ridiculous cast strategy ( Cast them young as possible , so we can make sequels in the next 25 years ) gives the rest . Kate Bosworth plays a 22 year old star reporter , she 's looking like 19 . Superman was full five years away , so he slept with her 6 years ago , so she was 16 , ( looking like 13 ) and a daily planet reporter , wroting " I spend a night with superman " . Warner Brothers , that 's too much.<br /><br />Routh is not so bad , he is playing a little bit wooden , but the whole movie is wooden , so ... ? ! Temporary good were marsden and sometimes posey . The rest , forget it . Even spacey , this is not his terrain.<br /><br />Reeve / Hackman / Kidder were acting so easy , with fun . What a difference.<br /><br />The Jesus poses at the end are ridiculous too . What the hell should that be ? The problem here is , they mean this serious , not as a joke . Next time Spiderman or Batman or Ironman falls and rises like Jesus or angels ? Or they speak with god directly . Why not ? They are superheroes , saving human lives every day . So at least one talk with god every week should be possible ... Oh my god.<br /><br />Maybe this was not the real announced movie , instead it is from a bizarre dull parallel universe.<br /><br />For the warner brothers this superlame depressive flick will be possibly the greatest disaster in history . Not only because of the money.<br /><br />I understand how difficult it ( maybe ) was to create and transport some messages or feelings , but showing lone , lost and sadly people is n't new and thousands of movies or TV - Shows did it better , in very old or new ones like magnolia . And the flying frogs there were more impressive than this flying superwoman , sorry , superman of course.<br /><br />Singer and WB , that 's simply nothing . In fact it 's even more than nothing , it 's like a black hole that destroys the passion for ( comic / superhero ) movies and steals us three hours of our life.<br /><br />Mrs . Smilla 's little brother . ( Very angry and green like the hulk . )
0 ... This would be the worst film i 'd ever seen . Hmmm , OK maybe tied with Boogeyman then . Awful , truly awful.<br /><br />I had low expectations and it failed to meet them ! I honestly ca nt think of one good thing . so here are the worst points ... <br /><br />1 . THE ACTING 2 . THE PLOT 3 . THE CGI ( Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously ) 4 . THE PLOT 5 . THE DIALOGUE and finally .... 6 . THE PLOT < br /><br />There are so many unanswered questions , Did they make a 2:32 hour long movie then realize they had n't put Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no - one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than Superman 's son and the henchman he kills?!!<br /><br />Was half the budget spent on persuading Kevin Spacey to do it?<br /><br />When Superman goes to hospital , why do n't the doctors ask " What the F * * * do you want us to do ? ! He 's a F***ing alien ! We do n't know jack about his anatomy ! " ? < br /><br />What happened in the 5 years Superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years ? < br /><br />Where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie?<br /><br />and finally , Why ? Just , Why ? < br /><br />BTW , for those of you wondering how come Superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite , i think i 've figured it out ... <br /><br /> ... since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks , it is clearly all in his head . therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock .... <br /><br />either that or the writers are slack - jawed half - wits who did n't think that was a fairly obvious mistake .
0 I usually do n't walk out of a movie , but halfway thru I did . This movie promised something different , but I kept thinking have n't I seen that before ? Spoiler Alert ! Back in 1 , the spaceship crashes and lands on earth , well , all these years later , with a super adult on board no less , this thing still manages to burn up and crash ! What , this advanced civilization ca n't seem to develop landing gear ? For an industry that 's so liberal , we get to see another Woody Allen movie , no blacks please ! Superman runs around saving people , making sure he sticks to Europe and the US , do n't go into darkie areas please . Maybe I could stomach this about 30 years ago , but now now .
0 at the beginning i was happy to know about a new superman movie , i though that will be great but it wasn't.<br /><br />is a bad copy of the Richard Donner work , Lex is again a villain that makes no more else , even played by Kevin spice.<br /><br />the evil plan is the same of the first movie of Donner just a lot forced.<br /><br />the script is predictable and simple ( all stuff Luthor finds in a museum or an old lady).<br /><br />the story is the wrong thing , it must be the Kevin Smith Script and may be it could be better.<br /><br />i just hope a sequel without Brian Singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copy.<br /><br />all read you later
0 It really does n't matter that Superman comic books are unbelievably naive and their target is ten year old . What matters is that " Superman Returns " is bad movie . < br /><br />In the beginning , a question for You Dear Readers , how many of You actually believe that Superman will be defeated by bald Kevin Spacey ? Anyone ? Just as I thought . No spoilers here . So let 's get to some major issues right now.<br /><br />Firstly , this movie looks like commercial ( scene in the bar with Superman / Clark Kent drinking Budweiser is only scene which looks as it supposed to ) . Imagine commercial of Superman , two and half hour long . Let 's be serious this is n't " Amadeus " or " The Departed " . You actually feel , that this movie is way too long . And special effects are not so special by the way.<br /><br />Secondly , scenario is silly . Sometimes even if something is acceptable in comic , in cinema it looks just stupid . And it 's like that in this case . Of course dialogs are disgrace . I ca n't believe somebody took money to write them . How many times we will be fed with villain making speeches ? How many times laws of physics will be raped ? ( Jesus , it 's not only the matter of Superman 's strength but also a resistance of materials his dealing with . ) How many times Lois Lane will be fooled by Kent ? How many times Hollywood producers will seek for a story in a trashy comic books ? Since there 's hard to make a good story , why having a weak story for a starter ? It just does n't work . Guys , get a grip . Try harder , please . Or just stay on this strike forever , who cares . I got the feeling that WGA is permanently on strike . No offense . I 'm not questioning the lame money those people are paid , but the quality of the product they deliver . In this case there is no quality at all . ( At this point You may ask yourself : is it that bad ? Yes it is.)<br /><br />Thirdly , acting is weak , which is quite a surprise since Bryan Singer ( Usual Suspects ) is directing . Kevin Spacey is having fun , but he 's the only one . Audience is rather not in the mood for jokes . Thing is that comic book hero can be developed into real personality , with clear motivations but also with doubts , fears , some depth . In this case nobody did that job , and characters are n't really interesting.<br /><br />Finally , whole effort of creators turns this movie into parody . Second unit is so bad that attracts attention , since there 's nothing interesting going on on screen anyway . The harder they try ( if they try ) , the funnier it gets ( but it is n't laugh You could expect).<br /><br />Final conclusion ? One word : shame . < br /><br />This particular movie , ladies and gents , is camp . Do n't waste Your time and do n't waste Your money too . Stay home , read a book .
0 As a long - time fan of Superman from the comics , through the 1950s series , the first two of the Chris Reeves films and Lois & Clark , and finally Smallville , I was * really * hoping for something clever with " Superman Returns".<br /><br />Instead we got Lex Luthor making * another * attempt at real - estate conversion , another Superman - beaten - up - while - wearing - kryptonite sequence , and internal inconsistencies : he could n't stop himself falling into the ocean when stuck with 6 " of kryptonite , but when Lois breaks off 3 " of it , * leaving the rest embedded in him * , he can lift * a continent * into space ? ? Really , the only hero in the story was Lois ' partner - I ca n't remember his name off - hand . He did all kinds of life - saving , heroic things with nothing but guts and skill - no superpowers , no invulnerability ... just a normal human.<br /><br />They keep making Superman so small . Why ca n't we have Superman battling Brainiac or fighting to save the universe from General Zod instead of Lex 's petty schemes . Oh , I forgot ... they're doing that in Smallville.<br /><br />Yeah ... I think I 'll stick to Smallville ... <br /><br />You probably should , too ...
0 After a long period in the space , looking for the remains of planet Krypton , Superman ( Brandon Routh ) returns to Earth . He misses Lois Lane ( Kate Bosworth ) , who got married and has a son with Richard White ( James Marsden ) . Meanwhile , Lex Luthor ( Kevin Spacey ) plots an evil plan , using crystals he stole from the Fortress of Solitude , to create a new land and submerge the USA.<br /><br />After so many delightful movies of Superman with the unforgettable Christopher Reeve , or TV shows like " Lois and Clark " ( and Teri Hatcher ) or " Smallville " , a great expectation was created for the return of Superman in this Bryan Singer 's version . Unfortunately , the awful story is too long and boring , with many unnecessary parts , lack of emotion and overrated in IMDb . In addition , the romance between Lois Lane and Superman is something shamefully ridiculous . The twenty - two years old actress Kate Bosworth is wrongly miscast , playing the role of a mature reporter and experienced mother of a five years old boy . Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling , who plays a teenager Clark Kent in " Smallville " . The character of Parker Posey , Kitty Kowalski , is actually a silly caricature . Last but not the least and in spite of being a terrific Lex Luthor , Kevin Spacey is forty - five years old , therefore older and older than the rest of the lead cast . The corny conclusion looks like a soap opera and is terrible . My vote is four.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Superman Returns "
0 In my eyes this is almost the perfect example of Hollywood ego , only beaten by the new king kong movie . Superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears tights . Brandon Routh was the worst superman I 've ever seen , from the start of the movie u just wanna shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat . He looks just silly wearing the costume . But enough about him , Kate Bosworth was a bad choise for lois lane , she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter , but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl . The plot was weak and predictable ( WOW , He is actually supermans son , who would have ever thought .... ) and the acting was horrible . This movie has one good thing going for it , and it 's name is Kevin Spacey . His portrayal of Lex Luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie . What this movie needed was the cast of " lois and clark " ( except Kevin Spacey of course ) and a different story . I watched this movie after watching " the hills have eyes " and I was chocked to learn that there existed worse movies then that .
0 In a summer that also boasted such repugnant stinkers as Snakes on a Plane and The Da Vinci Code , that 's a pretty bold statement . But I stand by it nonetheless . Superman Returns , like King Kong 6 months before it , is overlong , hyper - indulgent and with CGI up to the eyeballs . My God , this stuff is doing my head in.<br /><br />Richard Donner had the idea of ' keep it real ' for his 2 outings . And I do find his approach to the special and optical effects to be the most appropriate . Brian Singer bombards us with so much CGI that it really takes you out of the story and constantly reminds you that you are watching a wannabe blockbuster that thinks that the only way to impress an audience is to spend $ 250 million ( a totally irresponsible amount of money ) on obnoxious visual effects that do n't live up to the hype . We 've seen everything and been everywhere that CGI can take us . There 's no real atmosphere or involvement in this . And for a film that is 95 % made up of this crap ... well you figure it out.<br /><br />I've read so many reviews from fanboy critics about how the movie has ' soul ' or ' a human heart ' or ' tender character moments ' . Puh - lease ! We 've already had brooding superheros silently screaming ' you 'd love me if you knew who I am ' dozens of times already in recent years and SR offers absolutely NOTHING new in this regard . Even the plot is recycled garbage . Lex Luthor ( a seriously mis - cast and hammy Kevin Spacey ) plotting to destroy the landmass of America was done in the first film already ! And , well ... that 's your lot ! It 's amazing that they managed to draw out this junk to 2.5 painful hours ! Even if the cast were likable it would make it less unbearable . But Brandon Routh has the on screen personality of a mahogany hat - stand , Kate Bosworth is completely unconvincing as a Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist , James Marsden is 250 % wooden , as usual and Kevin Spacey really needs to either fire his agent or acquire some better judgement . The only cast member I liked was the lovely Parker Posey . But I 'm into weird - looking girls.<br /><br />Every year films like this get bigger and more bombastic . Pretty soon we 'll have $ 300 million films . Studios need to realise that maybe they should start looking down instead of looking up . For all the money that Warner spent on this pile of crap , for all the resources that this movie cost to make ... was it worth it ? In my opinion , certainly not ! This garbage has put me of Superman for life !
0 Here 's how you do it : Believe in God and repent for your sins . Then things should turn around within the next day or so . < br /><br />Until the last fifteen minutes , this movie just plays as a bad recap of a drunk 's crappy life . His mom dies . His stepmom 's a b_tch . His dad dies . He drinks . He gets married . He has kids . He drinks some more . His wife gets mad . He disappoints his kids . The wife threatens to leave . He calls up a reverend late night b / c he wants to kill himself . Then after the recap happens , that 's when we get the " Left Behind "- like subtle message.<br /><br />"He needed a paycheck " . This is the phrase I had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so I would n't lose my respect for Madsen.<br /><br />Madsen drops to his knees and begs Christ 's forgiveness . Once he does , he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way . He tells his wife that he 's found God and that 's good enough for her . Flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church . End the movie as Madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with Christ and without alcohol . Final moment ? He gives a little dismissive wave to the bar ( i.e. sin house ) and give a gay , Miami - Vice , after - school special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freeze - frames . See why I had to repeat the phrase ? " He needed a paycheck".<br /><br />Man this movie is bad . The B - Grade 80 's production values do n't help much . The script could have easily been a " Touched By An Angel " episode . It could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials . The acting is wooden and never believable . Even Madsen , of whom I 'm a big fan and is the sole reason I sat through this , makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he does n't know his a$$ from his elbow yet on camera . 45 minutes into it I started to get discouraged . This thing was like homework . I just wanted to put it away and say that alright , I saw half of it . That 's good enough . But no . If I sat through Cheerleader Ninjas , I could sit throughout this.<br /><br />The only reason I 'm not giving this thing a 1 is for two points : 1 ) I love Madsen . I know it 's not fair . But it 's great seeing the opening title " Introducing Michael Madsen " . Sue me . 2 ) Some of the Dialogue is so bad that it 's classic . I 'll stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them too.<br /><br />That 's about it . To wrap it up , this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the turds . But hey ! Look ! Michael Madsen ! ( See also TILT , EXECUTIVE TARGET , MY BOSS 'S DAUGHTER , etc ) . Now I 've got ta rewatch Reservoir Dogs and watch Madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him . See ya , Kids.<br /><br />"This stuff 's gon na make me go blind , but I 'm gon na drink it anyway " - Madsen 's first taste of cheap alcohol < br /><br />"I do n't understand ! Everything seems so beautiful ! " - Madsen walking outside after confessing to God < br /><br />"I'm going downtown later and pick up a bible and I 'm gon na get a haircut too " - Madsen after converting at the dinner table , because Satan lives in your hair
0 Against All Hope is a very poorly made , sometimes painfully so , movie . This is Michael Madsen 's first movie , and it shows , he is n't that good in it . Some people might find the story laughable ; an alcoholic realizes his life and family are falling apart so he calls a preacher as a last resort for help . After telling the preacher his story , he accepts Jesus Christ into his heart . < br /><br />I actually found many of the religious scenes , as when Cecil Moe ( Madsen ) goes to a church but walks away from it , pretty realistic . I also liked how Cecil knows his life is breaking apart and tries to get help , but realizes only God can help him . At the end he realizes with the help of God he can go through life without drinking again.<br /><br />This movie is not well made at all . The acting is bad , the script could use some work , and looks worse than my home videos , but it has a good message . Now , just because you become a Christian does n't mean you will automatically be able to stop an addiction or heal your broken family , and Cecil realizes this and works hard to stay on track . Overall , if your a Christian you will appreciate how this movie portrays Christianity and if you are n't , you may find yourself being called to find out more about the faith .
0 Definitely an odd debut for Michael Madsen . Madsen plays Cecil Moe , an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him . Cecil grabs a phone book , looks up the name of a preacher , and calls him in the middle of the night . He goes to the preacher 's home and discusses his problems . The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart . That makes everything all better . Ahh ... if only everything in life were that easy . The fact that this " film " looks as if it was made with about $ 500 certainly does n't help . 1/10
0 I am a huge Michael Madsen fan , so needless to say , i bought this movie without even renting it or anything ... This movie was so horrible , i did n't even take it back to the store , i would n't want anyone else to be subjected to this human poison , i just threw it in the trash , never mind the money , it was worth the price to be able to throw it away . The acting was n't that bad , it was n't good or anything . The story was horrible , and the ending was something i despise . He was a broken man , alcoholic . his life was a bunch of junk . i thought his horse , peanuts , was an awful device to show his childhood innocence , a dog would have been much much better . i also hate religion , so this ending without a doubt angered me . Jesus heals all ... i hate that i know people just like this that are huge Christians and catholics , and time will show that god does n't heal all , or anything . It was a horrible movie , if u have the option to see it , pass , or better yet buy it , or rent it , and throw it in the garbage , and leave the coffee grounds on it in the morning
0 I have anticipated the various Sci - fi and thriller type movies this summer but was so disappointed about this particular film . While some people walked out of the film , I decided to stay , only to laugh along with the other moviegoers at the acting , lack of suspense , ridiculous ending and difficult to follow story line . I found myself almost as confused as the main character in the film . The only redeeming quality of the film was the soundtrack . This is one of those budding star films which they later regret doing . In retrospect , I would n't even rent this one , let alone pay more than $ 5 to see .
0 I 'm just quite disappointed with " Soul Survivors " . It does n't worth even a comment in this forum . The script is very poor as well as all the " acting " and for our entertainment it features a pointless plot.<br /><br />Please , do yourselves a favor ! Be a real " Survivor" ... Don't waste your time in this piece of crap ! Someday you 'll thank me !
0 May I start off by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work very much . I wish he was in more movies that showcased his talent . With this said , Soul Survivors was a very , very bad movie . Very bad.<br /><br />I would have to say that I lay almost all the blame on the poor script . Affleck is a very talented actress , Wes Bentley had an outstanding performance in American Beauty , Melissa Sagemiller did well , and Eliza Dushku is currently the it girl in Hollywood . I do n't think any of the actors really got into the script , and I understand why . To say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an overstatement . It did have the twists and turns you would expect , but they just did n't lead anywhere ... except to more confusion . I just found the ending very anti - climatic , because it just did n't seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions that I had about the storyline.<br /><br />I wish I could give this movie a good review , but I ca n't . In all honesty , the only thing I think you will find scary about this movie is that you paid for it .
0 What a bad , bad movie ! I tried watching without fast forwarding ... That failed . After about 30 minutes I stopped the movie , went on - line to see how many minutes this disaster was . ( Only 84 minutes , Whew ! ) It was a confusing , boring movie . I do n't think anyone can get knocked down by getting hit with a fluorescent bulb much less gutted by one ! ! The one funny thing is that I watched " The Killer Cut " version of the movie . The box boldly states " More Blood ! " " More Sex ! " " More Terror than the theatrical release ! " Yikes ! If this movie was horrible with all those claims I wonder just how lame the " UN - Killer Cut " was ? ? ? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the living & the world of the dead watch any of The Night of the Living Dead series ! !
0 This film concerns a very young girl , Cassie , ( Melissa Sagemiller ) who leaves her family and heads off to become a college freshman . One night Cassie and her friends decide to go to a wild party with plenty of drinking and dancing and Cassie is riding with her boyfriend who she likes but never told him she loved him . As Cassie was driving , a car was stopped in the middle of the road and she was unable to avoid an accident and as a result there is a bloody loss of lives along with her boyfriend . Cassie becomes very emotionally upset and has nightmares which cause her to have hallucinations about her boyfriend coming back to life and encounters men trying to murder her and she is struggling to find out who her real friends are , who wants her dead and will she survive this entire horror ordeal . Cassie dreams she is being made love to by her boyfriend after he died and finds another guy in her bed and is told she was asking him to make love . This is a way out film , and not very good at all .
0 Having seen the hot Eliza Dushku in the pretty good Wrong Turn , I decided to pick this one up instead of Return of the Living Dead , of all movies . Have n't seen that one yet , but , considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever , safe to say I made the wrong choice . There is simply nothing to recommend this movie , and I am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut . It did n't even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Valentine or Urban Legend . It simply made no sense , held no excitement , had very little interesting acting or compelling writing . The release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running , and the reason is obvious . The whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly , to meaningless effect . Get Wrong Turn instead , if you want to see Dushku . I would like to see a movie with her and the super - hot Elisabeth Harnois -- but I do n't think even that would have made this movie watchable . Casey Affleck , so promising in Good Will Hunting , is awful here -- he seems to lack both intelligence and guts . That 's enough on this one .
0 What 's wrong with this film ? Many , many things . The editing tries too hard to look good , and does nothing but confuse the viewer whilst also supplying him / her with a powerful headache . The plot is muddled and obviously prolonged from what started as a short ( story or film ) . The plot only makes for less than ten minutes of good story , and this is just stretched out painfully until it reached the minimum length for a feature film . We all know what happens to things when we stretch them , right ? Exactly . They get thinner . In the end , the plot is just so paper - thin that you might even miss it , if you are n't paying attention , which is hard to do when watching this movie . The acting is not even slightly impressive . The characters are poorly written and dull , uninteresting . One of the worst things that are wrong with this film is that apparently , whoever was in charge of the score / soundtrack had no idea what the movie was , or what it was supposed to be about(not that I blame him , I could n't figure it out either ) . As a result , half of the music in the film does n't fit the scenes at all . Also , what was with all the sexual undertones between Eliza Dushku and the main character ? Naturally , this was in order to attract young males , but it was just so cheaply done . And did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film ? On any conceivable level ? At all ? The two creepy guys did n't seem to have anything to do with the film at all , they were just there in order to have some chase scenes . I doubt anyone would really enjoy a film so poorly put together and such a shameless and awful Hollywood - like attempt at a somewhat interesting idea . But I digress . I recommend this to teenagers with low attention spans who do n't mind a really bad horror - thriller as long as there 's some sex and gore in it(although that may only be true for the Killer Cut , which I saw ) . 1/10
0 Inept , boring , and incoherent supernatural " thriller " in which college student Cassie ( Melissa Sagemiller ) is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of her boyfriend Sean ( Casey Affleck).<br /><br />I ca n't begin to tell you how bad this is ... nothing of any importance ever happens nor is there ever any sort of actual entertainment value . I did not like this cast in this particular film - they are all sadly unconvincing ( then again , their roles are no good ) . To promote this as a horror film is a joke . Where are the scares ? There 's no sense or suspense - there are a few good songs but that 's about it.<br /><br />How on Earth did this project get the green light ? Writer - director Steve Carpenter has no discernible vision or talent that I can sense . Worst of all , the conclusion really makes the whole movie pointless.<br /><br />The alleged " killer cut " that I watched is 86 minutes of pure tedium.<br /><br />1/10
0 The film began with Wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend . Her aunt ( Edna May Oliver -- a person too talented for this film ) did n't like Wheeler -- a sentiment I can easily relate to . The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler . They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king . At about the same time , Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king . So when Wheeler arrived , it was up to the boys to fight it out , but they refused because they are already friends -- which greatly disappointed the people , as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood -- the silent era through the 1940s . I have seen and reviewed hundreds , if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been able to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey -- the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers ! Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood ( cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey ) , I ca n't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better . For example , there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the Marx Brother 's film , DUCK SOUP , yet CRACKED NUTS never made me laugh and DUCK SOUP was a silly and highly enjoyable romp . At times , Woolsey talked a bit like Groucho , but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny ! In fact , he just seemed to prattle pointlessly . His only funny quality was that he looked goofy -- surely not enough reason to put him on film . Additionally , Wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese -- a piece of cheese that sang very poorly ! A missed opportunity was the old Vaudeville routine later popularized by Abbott and Costello as " who 's on first " which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing . In fact , soon after they started their spiel , they just ended the routine -- so prematurely that you are left frustrated . I knew that " who 's on first " had been around for many years and used by many teams , but I really wanted to see Wheeler and Woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist.<br /><br />Once again , I have found yet another sub - par film by this duo . While I must admit that I liked a few of their films mildly ( such as SILLY BILLIES and THE RAINMAKERS -- which I actually gave 6 's to on IMDb ) , this one was a major endurance test to complete -- something that I find happens all too often when I view the films of Wheeler and Woolsey . Where was all the humor ? !
0 Oh dear , what a horrid movie.<br /><br />The production was so cheap and nasty ... Remember the shot from " the Natural " , where the lightning hits the tree ( leaving a glowing stump ) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat from ? ? Well the producers of this movie used that same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the house.<br /><br />I wonder if they paid to use the footage from The Natural , or did they just hope that no - one who would watch the film would pick it up ? < br /><br />Then at the end where they were getting trying to get away in the truck . Such over - acting in the cabin . < br /><br />A really bad film , a really bad film .
0 As a premise , this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline had promise.<br /><br />However , director Eric Red 's inability to render a convincing hurricane leads to a deluge of continuity and lighting errors.<br /><br />Ultimately , the viewer is more spellbound by the bizarre weather effects than the intended storyline . Intermittent spates of ham - fisted over - direction are similarly distracting.<br /><br />Charles Dance , doing an ' inbred backwoods hardass ' schtick , does his best to save the movie . But ultimately , Undertow squeals like a pig ... and has more ham to boot .
0 I sat through this turkey because I had n't seen it before , and because the premise sounded like it had potential . It was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence . At the height of the storm , the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house , yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving ! In fact , when the characters move outside the house , bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops . At that point , whatever credence the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film . Too bad all hurricanes are n't like this one , it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the Sunshine State .
0 The viewer leaves wondering why he bothered to watch this one , or why , for that matter , anyone bothered to make it . There is no plot - just random scenes of ridiculous action . Mia Sara 's shower scene appeals to the male libido , but that 's not much reason to make a movie .
0 just below the surface lies what ? a simply awful movie is what.<br /><br />as other viewers have justifiably commented , the storm sequences are just plain ridiculous . chopping already sodden firewood in the pouring rain ? now that 's smart . menace ? foreboding ? sexual tension ? for those read dull & contrived , dull & contrived and dull & overly contrived.<br /><br />i want to say thank god for mia sara 's shower scene but in retrospect i think the producers of the film , having seen the completed mess realised that they had to put something in to make it half way worthwhile at all . so it just becomes yet another contrivance . do yourself a favour and give this a miss .
0 A warning to you not to be seduced by the names Bigelow and Red . _ Undertow _ is pointless and unengaging , and made me think often of a phrase by Twain about wishing all the characters would be drowned together . When someone brings up the category of Worst Films Ever Made , it 's not the likes of _ Plan 9 _ or _ Attack of the Killer Shrews _ that I think of ; it 's the likes of this . What a complete waste of time -- my own and everyone who was involved with this flick .
0 Suppose you 've been on a deserted island the last ten years . Have n't heard of Scream and left when Halloween part 1 entered the cinema . Then this movie would have been a blast and a completely new vision on the horror scene.<br /><br />At the moment , a 2.7 rating is on IMDb and it does n't deserve a that low appreciation . Slashing all the way , like " I know what you did " , and a who - is - it that when getting to the end convinced me of that who - and - why.<br /><br />No big surprise , just a nice flick to watch with a cola , popcorn and no urge to get a difficult plot , deep characters . If the video rental is out of the top titles , you can take it without a risk , but do n't expect a masterwork . I 've seen a lot worse .
0 Simply awful slasher , molded from the I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER type of fodder , has beautiful wealthy college students spending spring break in a Florida condo being murdered one by one . A misfire in every category imaginable from properly built suspense to the executed death sequences .. nothing is handled properly and the characters leave little more than caricatures you root to see decimated as quick as possible . Del Tenney(The Curse of the Living Corpse;I Eat Your Skin ) , of all people , executive produced , co - wrote , and stars as a priest in a pivotal role whose relationship to the killer I guess means something to why he 's psychotic . The revelation of the killer is awkwardly handled and ineffective , probably not surprising a soul who watches it . There are a lot of attempted jump scares , with one character popping out to frighten their friend , which could n't even manufacture a few cheap thrills , because they are so calculated in such a tepid way . Most of the attacks occur off - screen with bleeding throat cuts( .. or pools)representing the only real display of violence . The protracted finale , where the killer goes on and on with the actor desperately trying to make his villain as diabolical and demented as possible , is embarrassing and tense - less . There 's not one single positive to derive from this clichéd and dull exercise with the pretty cast making little effort to rise past their one - dimensional roles . And , for pity sake , they could 've at least allowed us to see Joey Lawrence get decapitated or something for withstanding the misery of sitting through this junk heap for 90 agonizing minutes.<br /><br />Dorie Barton , as the heroine final girl , Beth Morgan , who the killer seems to be obsessed with , could n't be more vacuous and uninteresting( .. oh , she was in rehab , and takes pills for her nightmares;such intriguing exposition ) . Chad Allen , cast against type as a very intimidating " friend " of the group( .. who happens to disappear from the film first , setting up the idea that he 's the first victim ) , has a tough hill to climb with his role , so steep he eventually stumbles , rolling uncontrollably with no end in sight . Jeff Conaway , needing some cash I guess , has the beleaguered FBI agent role , whose daughter 's murder motivates him to seek out the killer , leading him to Florida . Jack McGee has his usual a$$hole role as a smart - mouth Florida Police Chief who is often nose to nose with Conaway 's agent.<br /><br />Oh , the answer to the title 's question .. not really . Because once you get the answer , you will wonder why you bothered with this anyway .
0 No ? Did n't think so ! Well , in that case all you have to do is stay far , far away from " Do You Wanna Know A Secret " , as it 's just the umpteenth pointless post-"Scream " slasher with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever . The plot is extremely ridiculous ; the characters are insufferably dumb , the gore - factor is negligible and the whole thing is just plain boring ! As you can derive from the title already , this film is mainly inspired by " I Still Know What You Did Last Summer " , as the events take place in a similar setting and the killer 's motivations are equally stupid . Why anyone would want to steal ideas from junk like " IKWYDLS " is a complete mystery to me , anyway . At least that film could depend on the precious rack of Jennifer Love Hewitt , whereas the girls in this junk are , apart from brainless , also terribly unattractive . One year after the still unsolved murder of her boyfriend , Beth Morgan , her new adulterous lover and four other simple - minded college students go to Florida to spend their Spring Break holiday in a fancy beach house . The killer has n't made a move all year , but now he follows the posse to Florida and starts butchering them whilst leaving behind the titular message as some sort of business card . You really do n't need to be a horror - expert in order to quickly figure out which face hides behind the unspeakably ridiculous mask and the writers ' attempts to put you on the wrong track are downright embarrassing . Since the plot is so thin , most of the film is purely irrelevant padding , including the sub plots regarding the incompetent Floridian police force and the ' mysterious ' FBI inspector who seems to have a personal score to settle . The murder inexplicably happen off screen ( do n't you hate it when that happens ? ) , there is n't even any gratuitous T&A to enjoy and you better do n't get me started on the quality of the dialogs . Suffering through crap like this only makes you realize that the delightful spirit of the 80 's slashers is gone for good .
0 I am so confused . What in the world was this movie about ? What was the killer 's motivation ? He seemed quite angry , but I have yet to figure out why . Nothing in this movie made sense . It had zero depth . Or less than zero depth . Which I guess would make it a hill . Or a pile . Of crap . The acting was horrible . When I searched for a few of the actors in this movie , they had been in very few things that I had heard of , and that came as absolutely no surprise . I ca n't decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in a movie this bad , or to feel that they should never be offered another acting job again . Starting . . . NOW ! ( Seinfeld reference . ) Really , though , do n't waste your time with this . There 's so little substance that there 's nothing there even just to make fun of . This was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks -- NO , one of the worst flicks of ANY KIND , that I have ever had the misfortune to watch , and I 've seen quite a few .
0 Well OK , I watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now I pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and I must say , I actually think this movie is good . This movie caught a buzz as the bootleg I Know What You Did Last Summer 3 , much like Final Stab was to Scream 4 , and well this movie is n't that bad . I mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick , this movie is not half bad . It has some scares , and some really hot women I might add . Plus it shows off Joey Lawrence 's new beefy look though obviously even that has n't won him any big Hollywood roles either ...... I feel bad for the man , he had such a career in the early and mid 90 's with blossom , some Disney movies and the everlasting Lawrence brothers show ..... Joey Lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene , but then like in a 360 degree turn , his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one.<br /><br />The movie also throws you off guard in , it makes you think between the crew , there really is a secret that someone knows , to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret . It also throws you off on who the killer is , I had an idea but still woulnd't think the killer was who he was , but his motives combined with the secret was a huge letdown . Now , had there been a secret that was let out ? This movie could 've been one of the better b rated movies . But also I am a sucker for college themes and I also in college went on spring break in a mansion sized beach house similar to the one in here so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie.<br /><br />A so - so slasher flick . Good for a midnight movie .
0 I normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie , however this was an unique case . This movie was so bad that I actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted . Needless to say I was brutally disappointed . Set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation , this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing . First , there are gaping plot holes . Second , very few of the C - list ( i do n't even dare call them B ) actors can act worth a damn , so any scenes that have potential fail miserably . Third , the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult , leading to very few surprises for the audience . Fourth and most importantly , the ending is completely anti - climatic partially because of how it ends ( setting / who the killer turns out to be ) and partially because the dialog is just atrocious . To the films credit , it is the only movie that I will ever say is the worst movie I have ever scene , and i 've seen a lot.<br /><br />So , just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing , the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no , you really do n't as you run in the opposite direction .
0 The secret is ... this movie blows . Sorry , but it just did . < br /><br />****SPOILER****<br /><br />In this bad riff on I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and SCREAM , Beth , played admirably by Dorie Barton , joins several friends on a Spring Break trip . The group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation . Then , the deaths begin . First one then another then another of the friends is murdered , leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results . < br /><br />One note , Dorie Barton is the poor man 's Reese Witherspoonshe looks like Reese , acts like Reese and could pass for Reese in a police lineup . Maybe that 's how they cast her ? Anyhoo , decent cinematography and fair acting could not quite make up for bad dialog and terrible writing .
0 Good Deaths . Good Mask . Cool Axe . Good Looking Girls .... But Watch Out ! ! ! No Plot and Little Scares Completely lower it 's Standards . They Tried to make an " I Know what you Did Last Summer " , but ended up making A " Scream " . But Hey , What do people Expect From a Horror Movie ? Answers Totally Vary . Rent It If You Want , but I Regret Ever Seeing It .
0 In a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe . His girlfriend Beth ( Dorie Barton ) discovers him and tries to commit suicide . She 's institutionalized . A year later she 's out , has a new boyfriend named Hank ( Joseph Lawrence ) and is about to spend Spring Break with Hank and four other mindless friends in a BIG , beautiful condo in Florida . Naturally the killer pops up ( for no reason ) and starts killing again.<br /><br />Lousy slasher thriller -- a textbook example of how NOT to do a low - budget horror movie . For starters , large portions of this film are ENDLESS filler of these six idiots videotaping themselves , having " fun " ( more fun than the audience ) , getting drunk , acting stupid etc etc . Also there is NO nudity in here at all . I 'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but ANYTHING to liven this up would have helped . None of the deaths are really shown ( you hear them ) , are only a little bloody and there is no gore . There 's one REAL gruesome one -- but that 's not till the end.<br /><br />With a few exceptions the acting sucks . Dorie Barton is dreadful as the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is lousy as Oz . Chad Allen pops up as Brad and he 's TERRIBLE . Lawrence is actually very good -- handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all . And Jeff Conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job.<br /><br />Logic lapses abound -- after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex ; Baston 's non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and WHAT happens to Lawrence ? His character disappears without a trace at the end ! Dull , stupid , no gore , no nudity -- skip this one.<br /><br />Rated R for Graphic Violence and some Profanity .
0 This mindless movie is a piece of crap and boring like the full house repetitions . For all the people who want to see a great , exciting and cool horror movie should n't even think about watching this bunch of mindless work . a F- in my opinion . I have one question , what were they thinking ? Let 's make a list : 1 ) bad script 2 ) bad script 3 ) bad script 4 ) bad acting 5 ) bad directing and last but not least a bad script . I mean I am not like grumping about every movie , but I was disappointed when I watched it . This movie should be banned into a box , locked and sunk down into the sea . So please do n't do something like this again , please , please , please ! ! ! !
0 * * SPOILERS * * Redicules slasher film that makes no sense at all with a killer running around dressed in a black robe and wearing what looks like a pull - over Peter Lorre rubber mask . Were told early in the movie , almost the very first scene , that young Beth Morgan was in rehab due to heavy drug use after her boyfriend was murdered in Tennyson Collage about a year ago.<br /><br />It 's also brought out that FBI Agent Sacker 's ( Jeff Conaway ) , who 's obsessed in catching the killer , daughter was also murdered in Tennyson around the same time . By the time the movie " Do You Wanna Know A Secret " is over it 's never explained just what those two killings back in Connecticute has to do with the slaughter in Florida of some half dozen collage students a year later ? other that the killer , at least in the murder of Beth 's boyfriend , wore the same silly Halloween outfit . < br /><br />At spring break in the Sunshine State the six students spend their vacation at a beach house and before you know it they start getting knocked off one at a time . Starting with computer geek Brad Clyton , Chad Allen , the killing even spill over into town with a number of people who have nothing to do with the targeted student including the police chief Gavin , Jack McGee , getting sliced open . < br /><br />The masked killer saves Beth for last in this weird ceremony at a deserted church , in what looks like the Florida Everglades . He then finally reveals who his is and what he intentions are which make as much sense as the movie does , none . Trying to scare it 's audience all the movie does is confuse and bewilder it with a number of not - too convincing slasher scenes . The most effective ones having the victim Oz Washington , Tom Jay Jones , survive at least three attempts on his life and ending up , together with Agent Sacker , the hero in the film . < br /><br />Oz also had a vicious cut on is foot from a large splinter of glass that almost cut it in half and crippled him but later he miraculously recovered , after getting arrested for a murder he did n't commit , in fact he had it out two more time with the killer with him not as much as having a slight limp in his walk ! It also made no sense at all why Oz and Beth went on their own to tack down and catch the killer instead of calling the police , with a cellphone that Oz had , instead ? < br /><br />Beth 's boyfriend , who loses his head over her , in the movie Hank Ford , Joseph Lawrence , is also very unconvincing as well as the two girls at the beach house . They together with with Beth Oz end up being the killers victims and then somehow disappearing from sight ! for a moment you did n't know if they were really killed at all or if it was some kind of hallucination on Oz 's or the local police part . Until the off - the - wall final scene where they popped up in the church.<br /><br />We also get an insight on a previous relationship between Tina and Hank with her , drunk and acting obnoxious , trying to get it on with Hank as Beth walks in without Hank and Tina even noticing her . That seemed to have upset Beth even more then her boyfriend being murdered at the beginning of the movie !
0 OK , a slasher movie . a very , very stupid slasher movie.<br /><br />We got your stereotypical teenagers in a house thing going . We got a FBI agent that 's seen Dirty Harry one time too many . " So what 's the secret .... punks ? " We got about 4 different little camera shots and scene that make no sense at all . " Hey man , i 'm fixing the sprinklers " ( ( that guy was my favorite part of the movie ) ) Suddenly there 's a preacher tied up on a couch watching home movies , he gets killed.<br /><br />they follow the killer into the middle of nowhere , with no cops . suddenly she 's in a church , wearing a wedding dress . i swear this is the stupidest slasher movie i 've ever seen .
0 Do you guys wanna know a secret ? . This movie sucks . Well actually i do n't know because if you allow yourself to be indulged by plagiarised versions of original movies , then perhaps you may find this movie astounding ( this movie being a plagiarised copy of i know what you did last summer ) . The first 30 minutes of the movie is based on a typical story setting ; a bunch of so - called cool teenagers relishing their vacation in Florida and being themselves by behaving very much like the juveniles they are . The only insight we get at this point is the extent to which the director succeeded in illustrating a pretentious sense of adolescent decadence within the characters . The second half hour of the movie gains a little momentum and begins to illustrate a start to the no- where - near unprecedented killings . The third half hour of the movie will most definitely remain a mystery to me because i switched it off before i could further delude myself into thinking that the movie may still have something interesting and original left to show . As far as the story is concerned , it can easily be explained in a few lines . A bunch of teenagers go to Florida on vacation . While they are busy partying , they slowly ( and i mean SLOWLY ) begin to get killed because they know some sort of silly secret . The only thread to the killings is that all victims were matriculates of a common high school . One thing that did however amaze me about this movie , was how much betty ( i m not sure about her name .. the blonde character ) looks like reese witherspoon . Another thing that amazed me about the movie was that it made me jump from my seat a few times . Does that make it a work of art ? absolutely not because my 12 year old niece made me drop a glass of orange juice because she " boo'ed " me when i was just about to go through the guest room door .. whats the difference between the director and my 12 year old niece ? ? ? ? < br /><br />Do you wanna know a secret ? ? ? I 'm not sure about you guys , but i do n't ..
0 This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen ... Unfortunately , I am a horror movie buff and will rent any horror movie unless it 's not made for t.v . When looking at the box it says it is rated R for gore and some language ... Where was the gore ? Was their one good death scene where you actually saw gore ? I could have overlooked that if there had been some brief nudity or some good dialogue . There was n't even one remotely witty or amusing line in this lame movie . Sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid , but this was just sad .
0 I know slashers are always supposed to be bad , but come on , what the hell is this?It 's like a bunch of 10-year - olds saved their lunch money and started filming this by the end of their week.<br /><br />Anyway , six young people all go to the same house to get killed off screen . We have the brainy one , the slut , the other slut , the black guy , the killer , stereotypes like that . After one gets eaten by a shaking boat , the others all get stalked by some guy who wears a mask the people at the poor box rejected . There 's one pretty decent murder somewhere in the middle , but then it 's back to even more boredom , and especially more false scares . Seriously , we actually know it ca n't be the killer when a person gets attacked because the guy sure loves to take his sweet time for everything.<br /><br />After every character you expected to die dies , the standard ugly blonde chick and her soon - to - be - boyfriend eventually get captured by the killer(they get like , pushed down and then faint)and the killer reveals himself . I think the writers of this movie just took a blindfold and a pen and put it somewhere on the list of characters . The motive is just lame and do n't even get me started on the damn secret . The killer then of course takes way too much time to explain everything(and then about ten minutes extra in which he slices up his own arm for some reason)and eventually gets overpowered by a guy with a gun . Hey , no fair!<br /><br />Really one of the most awful movies I 've ever seen . I could enjoy myself more by watching a Lindsay Lohan - movie , I swear . I mean sure , most 80 's slashers sucked as well but at least they threw in some T&A.This movie just has nothing going for it .
0 In a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe . His girlfriend Beth ( Dorie Barton ) discovers him and tries to commit suicide . She 's institutionalized . A year later she 's out , has a new boyfriend named Hank ( Joseph Lawrence ) and is about to spend Spring Break with Hank and four other mindless friends in a BIG , beautiful condo in Florida . Naturally the killer pops up ( for no reason ) and starts killing again.<br /><br />Lousy slasher thriller -- a textbook example of how NOT to do a low - budget horror movie . For starters , large portions of this film are ENDLESS filler of these six idiots videotaping themselves , having " fun " ( more fun than the audience ) , getting drunk , acting stupid etc etc . Also there is NO nudity in here at all . I 'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but ANYTHING to liven this up would have helped . None of the deaths are really shown ( you hear them ) , are only a little bloody and there is no gore . There 's one REAL gruesome one -- but that 's not till the end.<br /><br />With a few exceptions the acting sucks . Dorie Barton is dreadful as the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is lousy as Oz . Chad Allen pops up as Brad and he 's TERRIBLE . Lawrence is actually very good -- handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all . And Jeff Conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job.<br /><br />Logic lapses abound -- after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex ; Baston 's non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and WHAT happens to Lawrence ? His character disappears without a trace at the end ! Dull , stupid , no gore , no nudity -- skip this one .
0 This had a great cast with big - name stars like Tyrone Power , Henry Fonda , Randolph Scott , Nancy Kelly , Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a bunch more lesser - but - known names with shorter roles . It also had Technicolor , one of the few movies made with it in 1939.<br /><br />Now the bad news ....... regrettably , I ca n't say much positive for the story . It portrayed the James boys in a totally positive light .... and Hollywood has done that ever since . Why these criminals are always shown to be the " good guys " is beyond me . This film glamorizes them and made their enemies - the railroad people - into vicious human beings . The latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous . Well , that 's the film world for you : evil is good ; good is bad.<br /><br />Hey Hollywood : here 's a news flash - The James boys were criminals ! Really - look it up !
0 The American Humane Association , which is the source of the familiar disclaimer " No animals were harmed ... " ( the registered trademark of the AHA ) , began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago , after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film Jesse James ( 1939 ) . Needless to say , the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me . I suppose one could say that at least the horse did n't die in vain , since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making , but I ca n't help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice , this sure would n't have been the path he would have taken !
0 Not too keen on this really . The story is pretty horrid and unconvincing . I enjoyed the first 10 minutes , bill nunns good . After that it was pretty appalling . Tim does n't fit the role , he comes across as a smug self inflated ass & Pruitt taylor vince is entirely unconvincing as a trumpet player . It 's a idealist film and as a musician , feel slightly offended after watching it . There 's no scenes of 1900 practising or playing with his fellow band mates , he 's completely self indulgent . I find it hard to build any relationship with this kind of character , maybe i 'm watching the wrong film . If you have no real passion for life or sense of what musics all about then happily indulge in the suspension of disbelief and watch this waffle .
0 a friend of mine bought this ( very cheaply ) and decided to give it to me as a birthday present . i thought i 'd never watch it 'cause i knew it was a joke and the cover of the DVD looked pathetic , but then my friends and i got really bored and watched it . from start till finish ! i know quite an accomplishment but it really is a masterpiece . it 's hard to describe . you should see it , it 's a real lesson on what people are capable of when they believe they 're creative and smart and really are n't . The " acting " is sous - terrain ( you can actually see the " leading lady " laugh on some occasions , she 's definitely the worst ) . the " story " is to stupid to be summed up and really everything in this film sucked . please , pay special attention to " the sheriff " . the guy is an adult and therefor has absolutely no excuse to be involved in this . he 's extremely bad as well . whatever it did have some hilarious moments . check it out , haha
0 Please ! Do not waste any money on this movie . It really is nothing more than a boring German Blair Witch ripoff made by some high school kids . I could n't finish watching it , and usually I like watching all kinds of B - movies . How on earth could they find a distributor for it ? ! ! ! Funny however : Check out Wikipedia for " dark area " . The guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind . Maybe he got loads of money from the producers . Money that should have been spend on actors , camera and editing . Even that would n't have helped , since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film . Unfortunately " dark area " has already gotten too much attention . Please , director , producer and author of this movie , STOP making movies like that ... you are not doing yourself a favor . The world would be a better place without this film .
0 I watched this movie . To the end . And that was really not easy . It is so boring , bad played and in nearly every detail stolen from " BLAIR WITCH PROJECT " that you ca n't believe the makers take this serious . Even harder to believe , is how this " product " made it onto VHS and DVD.<br /><br />So , if want to see a horror - movie , just watch " Scream " , but if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time , watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability , watch dark area .
0 It makes one wonder how this show is still on the air . There 's been one couple that has stayed together , married , and has children , but everyone else has broken up . What 's the point of continuing this ? The show can be entertaining at the beginning . You see all the girls swooning over one man , that almost all of them like instantly . It 's just like in real life ! The girls start to take sides , bitch one another out , and show their true selves ( or so we think ) . But that one man is left to decide who to pick that he thinks he can marry and live happily ever after.<br /><br />What is true love exactly ? How can you fall for someone when you 're forced to pick them ? This show is unbelievable . You thought dating online was bad , but people have to go on TV to find love ? It 's not realistic . How could a girl be with a man when he is going out with several others , making out with them ? None of these questions are answered , and finally when the show ends , you know there wo n't be a happy ending in the future . For all we know , everything is scripted .
0 Yes , even as a fan of shows like survivor and the apprentice , this show is pretty bad . I did n't mind the first couple of shows , but then realizing how pathetic everyone was to actually go on the show in the first place . The antics of Alex and Aaron giving men a bad name at the way they cheated on or dumped their choice at the first opportunity really was not a good look for the show.<br /><br />Ryan , you can have Trista . She had the most annoying voice I 've ever heard on television , and she definitely was n't the smartest girl around ( very media savvy , but I doubt there 's much more there).<br /><br />I have n't really watched any of the shows since , apart from the occastional re - run on daytime TV . I think the point of reality TV is to treat it as " entertaining trash " . View it as something you can laugh over , and do n't have to think too hard about ( I do n't watch CSI its like reality TV - tired and clichéd , but you have to think too much anyway while watching).<br /><br />A couple of thoughts on some reasons fro going on the show . At the very first ' the woman tell all " Woman such as Amy ( who had a lot of class about her ) commented that she had tried every scene aka the bar and club scene to meet a guy and it was n't happening for her . Hey Amy , how about joining a club ? getting a hobby ? doing charity work ? changing your job to one where you meet more guys ? gees , all I know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner.<br /><br />Amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of meeting " the perfect man ' . Clue to ladies : he does n't exist . There are , however , many great guys out there that would make great husbands , some who may be right for you ! they may not earn six figures a year or be a JFK junior look alike , but they are great guys all the same . The shallowness of woman on this show is quite unbelievable . I m still a youngster , at was lead to believe that woman gradually grew out of their shallowness as they got older and more realistic about their future partner . This show is proving otherwise.<br /><br />Overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how woman view men in society . It really is a terrible show and I think all of these types of shows should just stop being made . The best dating shows by a country mile are Blind Date and The Fifth Wheel because they are fun . Nothing is manned more between the " couples " than a simple night out . the bachelor , sadly takes itself way too seriously .
0 Sitting down to watch the 14th season of the Bachelor ( " On the Wings of Love " ) , I knew I would be in for an " interesting " time . I had watched some of the previous seasons of the Bachelor in passing ; watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so . I find that the Bachelor is often appealing and intriguing , though its quality and morality are often lacking.<br /><br />"On the Wings of Love " details the journey taken by Jake , a 31 year old commercial pilot from Dallas , Texas , to find true love , as true a love as one can find in a season - long reality - drama dating show . Jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country . He begins to get to know them a bit , but it is mostly superficial ; how well can you get to know someone in a few 5 minute conversations ? Jake tries to make his true intentions known from the very beginning , at least to the audience . He noted that he does n't just want love or a good time , but he wants a fiancé or wife . We can only assume that he has made this clear to the women in the competition as well . If that is the case , it might explain , to a degree , some of the women 's actions . The women are super competitive . While they do n't even know Jake at all yet , they are still in it to win it no matter what the cost.<br /><br />Not only were the women competitive , but they were also confident and catty . Threats , backstabbing , and warnings of " Watch out ! " all show that these women were n't there for a good time either . Jake noted that he was not just looking for sex appeal , but looking for " a connection . " However , the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress Jake with said sex appeal . They arrived at the mansion in skimpy dresses  either low - cut or short.<br /><br />While some girls seemed to maintain their sense of decorum , others missed that memo altogether . One girl , Channy , noted that Jake was a " good guy " to whom she could be a " naughty girl . " She went on to say that Jake could land on her " runway anytime . " She got flack from the other girls for her provocative statement which showed their take on these situations.<br /><br />So , a reality dating show could n't be that bad , could it ? Besides the obvious issue of sex - driven attraction , there are other issues that mar this seemingly harmless show . Is this the right way to find a future mate ; vying for someone 's attention by flaunting oneself to extreme proportions ? Unfortunately , however , that is what America has reduced dating to these days : pleasure and sex without commitment and a little happiness on the side.<br /><br />Another problem is the premature emotional attachment by which many of the girls bound themselves to Jake . A few girls in particular seemed to be overly attached . One girl said " If I do n't get that first impression rose it will kill me ! " As mentioned before , they do n't even know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose , not just one of the 15 roses to keep from being eliminated.<br /><br />Michelle , in particular , seemed to have some issues with attachment to Jake . The other girls noticed it too . After one particular Michelle outburst , Vienna asserted that Michelle had a " mental breakdown and we 've only been here an hour . " Michelle got the last rose of the evening on the first show  narrowly missing elimination  and was extremely emotional about it . The other girls thought it was simply ridiculous . Another girl also cried , but because she was eliminated.<br /><br />It began with Survivor , and from there it just took off  reality TV . It shows our entertainment interests as a country ; if we were n't watching the shows and giving them good ratings , the networks would not continue to run them . The only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that enough of America is hooked . One thing is clear : America ( in general ) loves reality TV and its ensuing trappings.<br /><br />This begs me to question : why is it that we even like reality TV ? What is it about it that draws us to it ? Is it because we see the similarities to our own lives , or is it because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others ? Whatever it is that draws us to it , we should be careful of the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds . I 'm not saying that all reality TV shows are bad ; however , I am saying that we need to evaluate each one.<br /><br />Episodes used for critique : Season Premier and Episode 2 .
0 After watching this movie on DVD , I watched the trailer . The voice - over describes the movie as surreal . Well , there 's surreal , and there 's surreal . < br /><br />There was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me , but frankly , it was more confusing than surreal . The other unusual imagery , particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor , were so nonsensical they had no meaning . I do n't mind imagery that does n't mean anything , but these scenes just seemed irrelevant.<br /><br />My impression is that the director was trying to convey Logan 's inner monologue . I do n't know what else would explain what was going on . Unfortunately , nothing I saw gave me any clue what Logan was thinking about , what his perspective was , or even his emotional state . All I could tell was that he was n't particularly happy with his physical appearance , and that he had a crush on an older boy . < br /><br />I thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become , but not much else did . Purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision . < br /><br />Still , as tiresome and as content - free the movie was for me , it was a definite change of pace . I very much liked Madagascar Skin , and I had the feeling this movie aspired to that kind of narrative , and perhaps even style . It did n't even come close . For me there 's no question about it : this movie deserves an A for effort , but a D for execution .
0 I see that someone already thought of a similar analogy , which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after I watched this movie . They said that the ingredients were there but there was no plot . Besides the sexual scenes which bordered on child - porn ( which I feel could have been edited out or been presented more suggestively in nature rather than graphically , I would liken this movie to a recipe that 's been torn in half . It 's kind of like being handed a list of ingredients , with no directions on how to put them together into a finished product . From the start , character development and story development are lacking ... unfortunately , many times in this monotonous drivel we are teased with bits of plot and we think " Ahh - OK ... finally we are going to find out something more about WHY this scene is going on ... or ... WHO this character is ... or maybe we are finally going to get to know and appreciate this character more ... or understand and get involved more with this inter - character relationship ... etc . " But no such luck ! On the contrary , many times I was tempted to just turn it off more than once but stuck it out when the carrot was dangled , only to find that whatever mini - plot within whatever mini - plot ( and that poorly presented ) was just a ruse . Why I stayed with it till the end is a mystery , other than usually IFC has better selections and they gave it 2 - 1/2 stars ( another mystery ) . It 's not that the characters are n't likable to SOME degree , or that you ca n't identify with them or their humanness at all ... it 's just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort . I notice this was shot around Santa Cruz and find myself wondering if it was someone 's film school project . I wish I could have given this a better review but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half .
0 Visually disjointed and full of itself , the director apparently chose to seek faux - depth to expand a 5 minute plot into an 81 minute snore - fest . < br /><br />The moments that work in this film are VERY limited , and the characters do n't even feel real . How could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal ? < br /><br />Substantively AND stylistically , it all feels like a quirky dream sequence . Jarring irregular camera work , awkward silences and gaps in action , and what 's with the little spider image crawling across the screen ? Whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school . It added no meaning , just cheese , and did n't even stylistically work with the rest of the film ( assuming the film even had a style , which is a close call ) . What a flop .
0 had some lovely poetic bits but is really just an artsy - fartsy toss - together with no direction or resolution . how do these people get through film school ? who gives them money to make this crap ? could have been so much more , fine lead actor , and i always like Fairuza Balk , but come on , the alt - rock metaphor of just staring vacantly unable to find anything compelling is just so tired , and it sure does n't make for good films . the director needs to go away and live life for a good long while and not come back to the camera until they really have something to say . this is like the throw - spaghetti - at - the - wall school of art - making , just juxtapose a bunch of earnest imagery and hope hope hope like hell that poetry emerges . that can work , if the director actually has any kind of vision , or has a brain that knows when it 's in the presence of potential , but here it 's just space filler , of no consequence . i felt the lazy ending coming moments before it hit , and was yelling " you lazy bastard " at the screen when the credits popped up .
0 I read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly . I have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful . It pains me to write that since I would have hoped this would have been great , or I would n't have bothered to see it the other day . I like supporting indie cinema , especially if they are gay - themed , but this movie is almost too much to tolerate . Those that walked out , as I considered doing after about three minutes , probably did n't mind shelling out $ 11.00 , or just figured it was going nowhere , fast , and not going to improve . Maybe I am slightly more optimistic than they are .. either that or they did n't pay to get in in the first place.<br /><br />Logan is bored . He 's a klutz . He 's gay . I 'm okay with that . The problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also ! There are ENDLESS scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry , re - establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene , and the second scene , etc . , etc ... Nothing or no one goes anywhere . NO ONE says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting . Probably most appalling of all is that I did n't feel the slightest bit of empathy for Logan . That in itself is a major accomplishment . He did n't grow , he did n't change , he did n't learn ( there is no one to teach him anything ) , he DIDN'T DO ANYTHING , and neither did the movie ! Scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make.<br /><br />Additionally , the title makes no sense at all . 1/10 .
0 Wow , I hated this movie . The subject matter should have resulted in a really fine film , and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the topic , but the script - if there even * was * a script - is a mess . This is less a movie than a random slide show that goes nowhere . I 'd say it goes nowhere fast , except that it 's actually the longest 81 minutes you 'll ever sit through . As I 've mentioned , the lead actor is good . So is Faruza Baulk ( SP ? ) , as his sometimes - harsh - but - ultimately - loving - and - accepting mother . The film makers have a lot to answer for here , because this is a mess . A real shame , because I really wanted to like this movie , but it 's basically out - takes from a movie that never got made . Skip this one - it was n't even worth the $ 6 I shelled out for pay - per - view .
0 I have n't actually finished the film . You may say that in this case I have no right to review it , especially so negatively . But I do , only because I stopped it on account of I could n't watch anymore ... I got over halfway , and I only got there by promising myself something good was just around the corner . This film is so tiresome , so lackluster that I was actually insulted . I have n't read many of the other reviews , so I 'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered through it , but I am homosexual , and I did go through " similar " revelations , day dreams , issues etc etc . There were maybe two moments where I actually felt this film could go somewhere , where I felt it may have some inkling of meaning , or relativity , but these hopes were dashed the moment the next set of cliché - ridden narration came on . I mean , just look at the quotes on the IMDb page . Unfortunately you 're not able to hear the scratchy play back , nor the echo - ey fades if you 're just read the quotes , because they are just too painful / ridiculous / stupid to miss . I did give the film three stars , and all three of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to transform Archer 's tired " concepts " into something watchable . Mind you , I pray he was n't the one who decided to include all the long shots of TV closeups ... another unnecessary cliché already over done in films such as Korine 's Gummo ... I think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at Sundance ( only because Archer had connections in the festival via volunteer work he did , by the way ... ) because Sundance seems to be the one festival where cliché heavy drivel like this is still accepted as " arthouse " . No , it 's not art house , I 'm afraid it 's just plain s**t - house . Do not watch .
0 First of all , this film is GLACIALLY slow - moving , and I can see most viewers losing patience with it altogether in the first thirty minutes.<br /><br />The film 's subject matter was one I think would form the basis of an excellent film ; what was most lacking here was a plot that would advance the underlying themes.<br /><br />It 's unfortunate , because in the hands of a writer like ( say ) Lanford Wilson , I think symbolism like a mountain - lion invading a school campus could take on great , Tragic proportions without being heavy - handed.<br /><br />I think , with a good script supporting the film , the same filmmaker , with the same tastes , and even with the same actors ( who did n't really even get a chance to impress me ) , might have been able to present a meaningful and touching depiction of the pains and struggles that a boy goes through when he develops a powerful " crush " on an older boy that he admires.<br /><br />However , I 'm sorry to say that without this foundation , and armed with a vague , dull - witted , and vastly uninteresting script , without any sort of plot in sight , and lacking any sort of sensible structure ( for example , after viewing it , I believe you will find that you can not point to climactic scenes , and instead , will find yourself enumerating " well , maybe that scene , or that one , were climaxes ... ")--the result is 95 minutes of tedium.<br /><br />Without a good plot , we never get terribly interested in any of the characters ; their trials and difficulties are simply dull and boring.<br /><br />Without a good plot , dramatic devices and surrealistic directorial liberties become puzzling and confusing rather than enhancements to the story - line . I never really could believe , for example , the creation of " Leah " and I think that most viewers would be utterly baffled by the conventional way in which her telephone calls were filmed.<br /><br />As the film stands , I 'm afraid it 's one I can not recommend at all . What I can never understand is why a film like THIS one is n't re - made by an enterprising film - maker ... instead of all the mediocre remakes of films that were superlatively good in the first release ! All it needs is a good script , written by good writers , and I think this film could be easily turned into an unforgettable classic about an aspect of male coming - of - age that is rarely treated in drama . All the elements that were so tedious and seemed so recherche in the film ( the messages written on the boy 's belly , the " Leah " scenes , the television - screen fantasies ) could become rich if underpinned with a good STORYLINE.<br /><br />I see in quite a few comments that people are talking of this film as somehow being about a " gay " subject , and I think that 's mistaken . Obviously , the " crush " depicted is that of a newly pubescent boy on an older adolescent boy , but the character of Logan is far too young to have settled on any particular sexual choices , and , indeed , in his depicted masturbation fantasies , we see all sorts of stimuli , sexual and non - sexual , as we would expect in a very young boy like him . I believe " crushes " such as Logan 's are common among male youths who grow up to have a decided preference for female sex - partners .
0 About the only thing I liked about this film is that there was JUST enough in it to keep me in my seat to the end ... I kept thinking that maybe in the NEXT scene things would gel ... Alas ... <br /><br />Those who like Gus Van Sant 's films - especially his later ones - will probably like this . Personally , I find van Sant 's films to be dull , pretentious and facile . Well , he was an executive producer for this film , so it is no surprise that the film could almost have been made by him - although personally I actually liked this better than van Sant 's latest efforts ( e.g. Elephant).<br /><br />Contrary to many here , I did not think the film was difficult to understand or disjointed , I thought that above all it is a film that wishes to portray a certain mood - the mood of an adolescent moving slowly into the adult world - but so slowly that the changes are barely visible if at all . But I feel that the problem with the film is that " mood " is not enough ... and not only that , but that the mood painted here is , to my mind , incorrectly chosen for the story that is supposedly happening . The dream - like quality , so closely linked to nature , is beautifully captured here , but it is a mood which belongs much more to a much younger child , one who really still does get totally caught up in watching nature unfold ( waves on a beach , grasses and flowers , spiders etc ) . The rhythm of the film reminds me of my summers when I was about eight or nine . There is a LANGUOR to the film that is in opposition to what SHOULD be a very tense time in an adolescent life . When you are caught up in a crush on someone - or being the object of bullying at school - you are anything BUT languorous ! There are only two moments that truly worked for me in the film ... SPOILERS HERE - first when Logan drops the groceries and his mother throws a bit of a fit . The frustrations of an adult dealing with a klutzy kid - especially with no father present - seemed real to me.<br /><br />The second , and ONLY part of the film with any tension to it , were the scenes where " Leah " ( Logan 's re - creation of himself ) phones Rodeo and tries to seduce him into phone - sex . The first reason I liked it is because the person who did the voice - over of " Leah " was the most convincing actor in the entire film . ( It made me think of Claire Danes from My So - Called Life ... the voice even sounded like Claire . ) She and Rodeo had the only scenes that seemed totally believable between the kids . And what I especially liked was the fact that Rodeo only pretended to play along ... it was perhaps the best moment in the film as - finally ! - we got some character development.<br /><br />All in all , a somewhat misplaced effort ... we will have to see what he does in his next film before we can really say much about the director 's possible talents . In the meantime , if he can get away from van Sant 's influence , it might do him a world of good . Who is this director anyhow - one of van Sant 's boy toys ?
0 " Wild Tigers I have Known . " It will only be showing in big cities , to be sure . It is one of those films SO artsy , that it makes no sense what so ever , except to the director ! I HATE those ! And all of those oh - so - alternative / artsy people try DESPERATELY to find " metaphors " in what is EVIDENT horseshit.<br /><br />There was NO plot , no story , no moral , no chronology , and nothing amusing or even touching . To me , it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with one another , and were all for " show " to show how " artsy " and " visual " they could get . It was an ATTEMPT at yet ANOTHER teen angst film , but missed the mark on every level humanly possible . Then the credits roll ! I was waiting for it to make SENSE ! I was waiting for " the good part . " I own about 60 independent films in my DVD collection , many of which could arguably be called " art house " films . This will NOT be amongst them . You will be very angry at yourself for paying to see this film , much less ever buying it on DVD .
0 One would think that a film about a young person 's coming to terms with his burgeoning homosexuality would be anything but boring . Think again . This production should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because it 's about ten times as potent as any sleep aid on the market . It 's almost as if the film maker * considered * making a movie , but got lazy and decided instead to run a series of random ( and randomly BORING ) images and go - nowhere scenes , throw in a couple of actual scenes featuring actual acting , pretend that good lighting ins't important in the film - making process , and wrap it up under the auspices of an " arthouse " film . This is exactly kind of crappy product that makes it easy for a lot of traditional film - makers to poo - poo the indie film movement , and which keeps the general public from more easily embracing indie films.<br /><br />If you 're interested in films covering this subject matter , you 'd be much better off tuning in to some of the great short films available at Logo 's website or renting Get Real . Better yet , read Stone Butch Blues . Whatever you do , skip this long - winded piece of dreck .
0 As a lesbian , I am always on the lookout for films relating to gays & lesbians . However , with this kind of crap out there -- it would be enough to discourage any audience.<br /><br />I kept waiting for something to happen -- anything!--a story to develop , or just for it to make some kind of sense . Neither occurred . It was just meaningless scenes , unconnected in any way with anything . The film failed to conveyed any kind of story or depth to the character.<br /><br />After an hour or more of this nonsense , I simply turned it off.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this absurdity.<br /><br />1 Star - and it does n't even deserve that .
0 I really must have caught a different film from the rest of the commentators on this site because at a screening of the film last night the audience was so mortified by the dialoge that ( I 'm not even kidding)half walked out . Shot as if the filmmaker thought he were approaching some daring new territory by presenting a homosexual coming - of - age story , the film utilizes David Lynch inspired visuals with Fassbinder inspired acting . The performances in this film are so dull and bored that I figured one of the actors was going to pass out by how uninspired they seemed to be by the script . What 's worse is that it 's colored like an episode of Miami Vice . I do n't know who this director thinks he is ; maybe he has pretensions of the surreal like Bunuel , Jordowsky , etc . But the problem is that all of the afore mentioned directors display a level of erudite sensibility that is sorely lacking here . I could understand the meaningfulness of this film about ten years ago , but when we 've got masterpieces such as Bad Eduction , Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love why bother with this cinematic turd ? There is nothing new to be seen here .
0 I am very surprised by the positive comments because there were four of us that saw this at one screening and we all walked out . We personally felt that it was painfully slow to watch and could n't sit through the whole movie . And we really tried to stick with it . In particular , those in the group who really wanted to like it because of their personal experiences with sexual orientation alienation in the school years depicted did n't like or identify with it at all . : ( < br /><br />That said , it is great to see that this film really resonated with a lot of people here on the boards and with reviewers . That 's the beauty of the subjective art form of film . :)
0 In The Lost Son , a private eye searching for a missing man stumbles upon a child prostitution ring . This film incorporates all of the worst stereotypes you could imagine in a worst - case scenario that exists only in the minds of Hollywood , the press and AG John Asscrap . If you get a chance to see this , you 'd be better off getting lost yourself .
0 For Daniel Auteuil , ` Queen Margot ' was much better . For Nastassja Kinski , ` Paris , Texas ' was much better . The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges ( ` CrissCross ' and ` A World Apart ' can not even be compared with this one ) , and Goran Bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from ` Queen Margot ' for this movie ( Attention to the end of the film ) . If this was an American pop movie , I would not feel surprised at all ; but for a European film with more independent actors and director , a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple - minded and disappointing . There are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people . There are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone . And finally , there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys . Every character is shown in simple black and white terms : the good versus the evil . Plus , from the very beginning , I could understand how the story would end . Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse ? I believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie . I think this movie was not disturbing , but very disappointing .
0 I really , really did n't expect this type of a film outside of America . How anyone can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turn it into a " thriller " is just sick . Auteuil ( whom I had previously admired ) going around like some sort of child - saving Rambo was ignorant and insulting to all the children being sexually exploited around the world.<br /><br />What 's doubly depressing is that the stunning and ground - breaking film " Happiness " came out the year BEFORE this film . Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves . It 's admirable to read some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there . They were able to see the shoddy and ridiculous handling of this topic . Those of you who think this is great cinema display a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to watch " Happiness " to open your minds to the true horrors of pedophilia.<br /><br />Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor , teacher , friend or even a relative ? Hmm ... I wonder . If they are going to make a film about international child slavery of whatever kind they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally involving instead of this button - pushing crap . 1/10
0 What this movie does well is combine action and horror with comedy and drama in a unique way that teases more emotion form the audience than a typical horror movie . Unfortunately with disjointed storytelling , frustrating plot - holes , and contradictory scenes this movie mainly caused me frustration and is hardly " the greatest monster movie ever . " < br /><br />Let 's start with the good stuff : comedy , acting and special effects . From the get - go , this movie starts off fast paced and cheeky . The opening scene - the monster 's origin - is campy and quick , paying homage the the classic ' environmental ' disasters that have given birth to so many other monsters . The pacing is fast , which was a welcome break from the long and often pointlessly dramatic opening scene from other monster flicks and allows the movie to jump right into the action . With in the course of 10 minutes you get the ' why ' , ' where , ' and ' how ' of the beast and are ready for action . In this the movie delivers.<br /><br />After another short and well shot sequence the characters are introduced : the lazy son and his precocious little girl , kind grandfather , and talented sister ( aunt ) and , of course , the monster . The characters are introduced in context to each other and their conflicts are instantly apparent , allowing the audience to feel for them when the monster shows up suddenly to wreak havoc in the river area where they live and work . < br /><br />The monster it 's self looks great : alien yet familiar - kinda like a dog and fish pooped out by a squid . The effects of the creature are second to none and although it looks strange it is believable and at no point in the movie could you ' see it 's strings . ' Even the movement of the monster was horribly familiar , like a growing and excited rottweiler on linoleum the monster barrels through the crowd , slipping on surfaces , crushing and eating those in it 's path . When the monster 's path intersects with the family and tragedy ensues it truly is a painful moment , and you can feel the need for revenge but from there on out the movie 's appeal begins to unravel.<br /><br />Following the dynamite beginning the movie quickly loses focus and continuity . Plot - lines are introduced , then abandoned , characters change their position for no apparent reason , and comedy is interlaced into dramatic scenes confusing intent , while obstacles appear and disappear seemingly at random . < br /><br />As for the comedy , let me say this : I 'm willing to accept that a lot of the humor is probably cultural . I am not familiar with Korean humor so maybe things were lost in translation . However , as an Asian studies major in college and as someone who has been living in Japan for the last 5 years ( still here ) I 'd like to think I have a better grasp on Asian humor than the average white - guy . That being said there were many parts of the movie that I understood were supposed to be funny , but , to me , were n't . < br /><br / > * * * * * * * * * * * SPOILER * * * * * * * * * * * * * For example : after the initial attack where the young daughter is lost the family is at the funeral ; everyone is mourning . A new character is introduced - a brother - and tension is raised even higher as it becomes obvious that the two brothers are at odds with one another . They both begin to grieve for their loss and wind up competing with each other over who is grieving harder . This competition is , at it 's core , funny : two brothers who dislike each - other so much they even compete at a funeral - it shows the prickly nature of familial love common in Asian comedy . This subtle slap - stick comedy poking fun at family and ritualized mourning is supposed to be funny but , seemed really out of place in the context of a lost little girl . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * END SPOILER * * * * * * * * * * * * * * < br /><br />Then come the plot holes . there are so many points brought up in this movie that are never explained , or , worse , are explained and fretted over only to be proved impotent and pointless in the end . Finding out an obstacle is n't an obstacle can be a good thing for a character , but you 'd expect some comment to that nature . Instead the audience is barraged by moments of anti - climax when problems just ' are n't there ' anymore and no one gives an indication that it was ever a problem to start . So I ask you : why even bring it up in the first place ? < br /><br />This was prevalent through out the film as problems gave rise to new problems , and suddenly the world of the movie is filled with opposing forces that never resolved each other . Of course introducing new and greater problems is a time - tested story telling tradition , but if the introduction of a new arc leads the the forced shortening of another you would expect at least that the new arc gets full explanation . Not in this movie . Instead it was as if you get several stories , each only explained 20 % of the way and , in the end , the parts never converge to complete the whole.<br /><br />Again , I 'm willing to accept that a lot of this might be ' cultural . ' Maybe its in Korean story- telling tradition to put comedy inside a tragedy . Maybe it 's normal for stories to go all over like a child who colors outside the lines on every - page , but never finishes one . Maybe it 's OK to present a problem in order to develop the plot but then remove that problem randomly without any apparent solution or catharsis . Or maybe these are all hallmarks of sloppy work and bad storytelling rampant in a movie that seems to have a much better reputation than it deserves .
0 Gwoemul ( The Host ) - Due to pollution in the Han river a mutated beast goes on the rampage . The youngest member of the Park family is snatched by the beast , and it is up to the rest of her family to find her , before she becomes the beast 's latest meal.<br /><br />Firstly , I love monster movies : Mutated bears , over - sized alligators , packs of ravening Komodo dragons , the whole lot . Creature features are my favourite kind of Horror film . So , I really wanted to like The Host , but it was n't to be . < br /><br />There were three major problems with it:<br /><br />The first can be seen with a quick look at it 's IMDb page < br /><br />Genre : Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci - Fi / Thriller < br /><br />Too many damned genres . It took itself too seriously to be a comedy , and yet was too light hearted to have any real message ( though it did seem to be trying to make some kind of statement . Anti - pollution , anti - American or anti - government ) . The drama was misplaced and mixed in a confusing mish - mash with all the other styles.<br /><br />Secondly , after the initial monster attack nothing happens for almost the entire film . The central family wander about looking for one of their own while the governments of Korea and America , apparently , do nothing . And that 's it , they just wander about , occasionally hitting one another , presumably for a bit of comedy relief . This lack of action made my attention wander , and apparently it did the same for the director , as whole plot threads go unresolved ( a mystery plague invented by the evil Americans is completely forgotten about , and is never resolved).<br /><br />And lastly , the film is clumsily political . It paints the Americans as being stupid and evil , but gives us no American characters with any more depth than a cartoon villain . The opening scene has the most obvious stupid American vs wise Korean moment . With a Korean morgue assistant asking his boss , the coroner , not to pour chemicals into the Han river . The American coroner all but cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to carry on . As well as being racist , it 's lazy film - making and there is no excuse for that.<br /><br />On the plus side , the monster is good , kind of a mix of The Relic and Deep Rising . Some of the movement effects are quite cool , and the initial monster chase through the park is a lot of fun . There are also some nice shots in the film . Some of which remind me , strangely , of the way Firefly was filmed ( shuddering cameras , out of focus shots etc).There is also a nice scene at the end , where the hero and a little boy he has saved are sitting in the family 's mobile food stall . It 's night - time and snow is falling , the street - lamp is giving out a cold light , but the food stall has a warm glow coming from it.<br /><br />Overall , I was really disappointed by this film . I 'd been looking forward to a decent creature flick , and instead I get some pseudo - political , horror - comedy lite . Looking at the comments on IMDb I ca n't help but think that if this had been a US production it would have been slated . Just 'cause it 's a foreign flick does n't mean it 's any good . There have been some great movies out of Korea in recent years ( The vengeance trilogy and Brotherhood , for example ) , but this certainly is n't one of them . < br /><br />For once I 'm in favour of a remake . Tighten up the directing , improve the scripting and this could have been a nice film . As it is , it 's not worth a couple of hours of anyone 's time .
0 First of all let me say the first 20 minutes are great , the monster looks superb and the CGI is reasonably done . It 's a shame then that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment , < br /><br / > * * * * * * * * SPOILERS BELOW * * * * * * * * < br /><br />From the opening scene we can see this movie is anti - American , normally this sort of stereotyping would n't bother me ( we Brits get enough from Hollywood ) but here it 's not subtle about making the Americans brain - dead morons . It goes past the point of realism and your left wondering if a Yank has raped the directors mother.<br /><br />The grieving scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts going downhill.<br /><br />Here we are introduced to the Olympic medallist Auntie and drunk Uncle who walk into the memorial and start blaming the father for his daughters death , then hitting him before they all start rolling around on the floor crying . Hardly realistic bonding at a time of crisis!<br /><br />The whole virus sideline is ridiculous . If the Americans know there is n't a virus , why are they wasting time , money and resources investigating ? The US government agent orders the brain drilling of an innocent Korean for nothing , making the Americans look evil ( or stupid ) , it was n't helped by the fact this guy was cross - eyed for comical effect.<br /><br />The movie is about hunting the monster . US and Korean special forces are assigned to finding the creature although through - out the movie they are invisible . The only people hunting the monster , in the whole of Korea , is the main family and some random tramp who appears at the end to save the day ! Naturally a few US / Korean agents try to stop them along the way.<br /><br />The sister was only included in the movie so she could make the vital shot at the end . It was clichéd , you knew it was going to happen but to make it worse she does bugger all until that part ! and my final annoyance , how the hell did that kid survive at the end ? the monster had been swimming with it 's head underwater for about 5 minutes ! why did n't the monster eat the kids in the first place ?
0 Do n't be deceived as I was by the ' glowing ' reviews quoted on the DVD box . " Wildly entertaining . " , " a seriously scary freakout . " , and the worst of all , " ON PAR WITH JAWS . " This movie is none of the above.<br /><br />Normally I do n't bother with writing bad reviews for films but I ca n't believe this one is resting at a comfortable 7 on IMDb . It does n't deserve it.<br /><br />After a so - so opening daylight attack by a monster created by , what else , chemicals dumped by lazy scientists , this movie goes absolutely nowhere and it goes there sloooowly . Basically and improbably , a girl is snagged by the monster ( I 'll give them points for a good creature design but this ai n't no WETA creation ) and her semi - comical family spend an hour - and - a - half tracking her down ... in the sewers surrounding the Han river . Their search lacks any suspense - again , someone called this on par with Jaws ?- and by the time they find her you realize it was all pretty much pointless . Other than that , a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one funny scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop.<br /><br />Blech . This was bad . I 'm not kidding . You want to see a rotten monster movie ? Rent Deep Rising . At least you 'll save 30 minutes of your life .
0 What a terrible movie . Rotten tomatoes had a good rating for this too . do n't be fooled by the positive comments ; It was n't scary . It was n't funny . It was n't clever . It wo n't even hold your attention . I just wasted 2 hours of my life viewing this crap - fest . the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times . after about 15 minutes it no longer entertained . the dialogue was terrible , must be a translation thing . another negative that stood out was the idiot Americans . 3 were portrayed and they were all lacking character , intelligence and judgment . Now I will write a couple of lines to pad this since we have to have 10 . The employees at the video store should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter .
0 MONSTER - He was great ; I loved the special - effects which created this monster which looked like an updated version of " The Creature From the Black Lagoon . " The scenes with this beast roaming the land and capturing people ranged from good to jaw - dropping.<br /><br />SOCIAL COMMENTARY : Much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as the doctors ( under orders from the government ) state that SARS - like disease is out there . In a nutshell , we get the familiar government cover - up story . You know , I expect this Liberal paranoid mindset with Hollywood films always painting our government as corrupt , but it looks like the Koreans are copying the format , and it 's very tedious . In here , it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this " monster . " It just drags the film down . The main family featured in the film has to watch from a distance while the young girl in their family , presumed dead , was hauled off by the creature.<br /><br />MORAL : A typical " do n't pollute the water " message because this is what can happen - a horrible mutated monster . This used to be the anti - nuclear bomb message from the 1950 when radiation caused giants ants , spiders , fish or whatever in those schlocky sci - fi films . Now its " environmental issues " that are the focus.<br /><br />THE HUMOR This was mostly stupid . I normally laugh at slapstick but this was n't funny . I do n't know if the Korean sense of humor is that pitiful , or the film was purposely trying to be ultra - corny with a take on the old " Godzilla " movies . Let 's hope it 's the latter.<br /><br />TRANSFER - The video transfer was good . This was a sharp - looking picture and sound was decent with a lot rear - speaker crowd noise . I watched this in Korean with the English subtitles . That might have been a mistake as the Korean guttural voice sounds got annoying after a half hour.<br /><br />OVERALL - This had a promise but turned out to be a big letdown and even boring in too many spots , which is inexcusable for a modern - day monster film . Two hours was WAY too long for this story . How this film drew record crowds in Korea I do n't know . They must not have much in the way of films to enjoy and support .
0 I already know that critics and some audiences say that it was a satire , there were numerous political and social messages , the names make refer to some other names etc . It might be . I can not realize such things ( I do n't want to do anyway ) because I am not interested in , I am interested in ' cinema ' . As for the movie itself , again it is said that the movie is clever and dramatically powerful . I could not see anything which we do n't see in monster movies except the scene which takes place in a office in the second half . Yes , that scene says somethings about humanity , but it does not make the movie brilliant . The movie is entertaining ( mildly ) and exciting in some moments or scenes , but no more than that . As for the biggest flaw of the movie , it is visual effects . It was just shocking , I could not pull myself together for a while , because I had expected a realistic monster , because it is not one of the old Gojira movies , it was made in 2006 , but it was not . It is like if you do n't believe that there is a monster , you can not care about . If you agree with me about this , I highly recommend you Cloverfield that is extremely realistic . The design of the monster is not interesting , but at least planned , there is an effort . Dramatically powerful critique . Some critics talk about it as if it is a Kurosawa movie . Yes , it is rather a drama than a thriller or action , but it should not mean that it is dramatically powerful . I do n't want to compare The Host with other monster movies , but I try to mean that The Host does not do something that other monster movies do not do . By the way , may be some people call the movie masterpiece because of their sympathy for Asian cinema . Yes , I like Asian cinema too , but this is the fact .
0 this by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life . I gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot . the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot . my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it . borrowing some ideas from movies like Resident Evil and Aliens does n't result in a movie like them . if this going to be a top Korean movie , I 'd rather wo n't bother to see even a Korean movie trailer ... <br /><br />By the way , this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising . I think every Korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the 8 , even though has no clue what it is about .
0 Not only was he invariably annoying to listen to , but he had NO jokes . I swear , some fobby Asian guy telling yo momma jokes would 've been funnier than Leary 's crap . ( Well , maybe funny for a couple minutes but at least I 'll be able to laugh at least once ! ) Leary claimed he stopped taking drugs during one of his " jokes " ... apparently he was still high on something ; he was just some crackhead imprecating rants mostly drug related . One of his jokes was something like , ' I would n't use crack , especially having the same name as between my ass ' - Oh man , how did he come up with that one ? ! I swear the only guy that needs to shut the f**k up is Denis Leary . Thank god I did n't have to see him live . This guy totally sucks.<br /><br />If you 're easily amused by swearing , and " jokes " where you can come up with yourself , then waste your time with this junk .
0 Even for a tired movie model as the nature vs. man cycle that prevailed so predominantly in the 1970s , ants falls miserably short of being even somewhat effective(though entertaining for reasons it was not intending ) . It is sooooo preposterous . Apparently these ants that are bulldozed near an inn have been eating poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted by emitting poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites being fatal . Watching actors of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black specks is painfully funny in a not - so - good - but very - bad way . So many scenes just look ludicrous : a boy trying to fall in a dumpster whilst being attacked , Suzanne Sommers crying out in horror while lounging in bed , Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathing through pieces of wallpaper , Bernie Casey faking a gam leg , and the list goes on and on . The peril shown ranges from ants crawling from a drain to black lines of ants all over the walls . The cast for the film is not bad on paper , but none of these actors seem to believe in the material . Poor Myrna Loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror . I hope she found a good use for the money , for it is obvious that was the ONLY reason a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense . Although it is quite a bad film , it is watchable - once for me , and does have many of those seventies bad film qualities - start - studded actors embarrassing themselves , that made - for - TV feel , and the dreaded creatures of nature reeking vengeance on man . This time man must push his hand into a pile of ants to be affected . Really quite dreadful .
0 Is there a book titled " How to Make a Movie with Every ' Man vs. Nature ' Cliché Imaginable " ? If not , Ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects . Ants does n't have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime . I suppose the most surprising thing about Ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes . The set - up , the characters , the various sub - plots , the death scenes , and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases , much better . It 's amazing that so many of these Insects on a Rampage films were made in the 70s because they 're all basically the same movie.<br /><br />And can someone please tell me what in God 's name Myrna Loy is doing in this monkey - turd of a movie ? A woman as talented and classy as Loy deserved better than Ants as one of her final movies .
0 I remember watching this movie when I was young , but could not recall the title to it then going through horror movies I find it and think to myself " that is the title ? " This movie is a kind of combination disaster film / insect attack film with fewer notable stars in it . It is also somewhat boring too , as it has that television vibe to it where you can see the movie fade out for commercials and such . The plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants . I think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby , but do not quote me on that . The most memorable ant attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being swarmed and of course Summers attack scene too . What else stands out in this one is the very goofy ending where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breath through . In the end though like most television movies this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of ants .
0 A pretty worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer insect script . Ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel . I think it is from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant bed . There is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either . Watching a bunch of ants sting their victims is not very terrifying.<br /><br />Spoilers section The stupidity of the hero is near incredible . He is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero . It has to be a mysterious virus . After the inspector says this , the hero takes his bulldozer and wrecks the huge ant colony . This disturbs the millions of ants and traps the people in the hotel.<br /><br />End spoilers Overall , this movie is extremely lame . I do n't understand why it got a DVD release when so many deserving movies have none . My only guess for the DVD release is that Suzanne Summers is featured in the film . This is a movie to avoid .
0 This is another one of those ' humans vs insects / eco - horror ' features ; a theme that was popular in the late 70 's . Only you ca n't really call it horror . There 's zero suspense and no gruesome events . In other words : this movie is pretty lame . It 's not that it 's really bad or something ; it 's just very boring . A construction site near a hotel uncovers a big nest of ants . Later on we learn that , probably due to different sorts of pesticides used in the past , their bite became poisonous . Some people get bitten and rushed to the hospital and it takes ages for the residents of the hospital to figure out what 's going on . Robert Foxworth figures it out first and then you can see him go berserk with a digging machine for what seems like several hours . Then they flee in the house , waiting to get rescued . And , man , you should see all the efforts they make for rescuing them . I wo n't spoil too much , but at one point they even use a big helicopter . All the time when I was watching this , I sat there thinking " Come on , people , you all got shoes on . Just run out of the building . I 'm sure a bunch of ants wo n't catch up with you . " It 's all pretty ridiculous.<br /><br />Of course , lots of close - ups of crawling ants are shown throughout the whole movie . Ants in the garden . Ants in the garbage . Ants in the kitchen . Ants on the roof . Ants in the bedroom . Ants in the sink . And the best part : Ants crawling on people 's faces while the actors are breathing through straws . But when you see groups of ants in wider shots , they indeed look like black rice the set designers glued to the wall.<br /><br />One small surprise came near the end . No , it has nothing to do with a twist in the plot . It was just that Brian Dennehy made an appearance as a chief - fireman . Ehrr ... What more can I say ? This movie is called IT HAPPENED AT LAKEWOOD MANOR but the box - art of my copy read ANTS and the title during the opening credits was PANIC AT LAKEWOOD MANOR . There you have it . Now , since this is a made - for - TV movie from the 70 's , I 'll be once again extremely mild in my final rating . Now , THE SAVAGE BEES , another ' humans vs insects ' TV - movie from 1976 was much better than this one . I even feel I have to go back and add a few points to its rating after having seen ANTS . Lacking suspense , action , thrills , shocks and creepiness , the only thing you 'll be left with after seeing ANTS is an annoying itch .
0 I remember seeing this movie a long time ago on television . I remember the premise of the movie being about a bunch of hotel occupants being attacked by man - eating ants . What I did n't remember was HOW AWFUL IT WAS!!!<br /><br />I recently caught this movie on television late at night . I 'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existance and are never to be found again ! Suzanne Somers ( at the pinnacle of her career playing Chrissy on ' Three 's Company ' ) plays a vacationer at Lakewood Manor . Constructions workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturb an ants ' nest . Or should I say , a * MAN - EATING ANTS ' NEST * ! ! One of the workers actually gets attacked by the ants . One minute he 's picking them off his clothes one by one , the next minute he 's covered in them . The next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt.<br /><br />If you thought that was pretty far - fetched , you should see Myrna Loy playing a wheel - chair bound resident who gets airlifted out of the Manor via helicopter ! I could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was getting airlifted out of the movie!<br /><br />The final scenes depict Suzanne , Robert Foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with their backs to each other , blowing through straws and covered in ants.<br /><br />That 's basically the movie . There 's really no " disaster " appeal or " big - star " draw to the film . It was intended to be a ' grand - scale ' television event at the time . Now , it 's lucky if it gets dumped in a 4:00am timeslot on your local television station.<br /><br />If you want to catch Suzanne Somers at her best , then watch an episode of Three 's Company . If you want to see Myrna Loy doing anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills , then watch this movie.<br /><br />0/10
0 Paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt . It does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood , and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences.<br /><br />Unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife , a conflict over a road construction project , the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters , a mysterious man who lives in the woods , a bunch of racist hooligans , at least three different carnivals , the intricacies of local church politics , and on and on and on . And all of that does n't even include the actual central plot , which is only about the hopes , dreams , and frustrations of two girls ( and their entire families ) at the turning point of their lives . I was actually shocked when I realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer ( and that so much movie got accomplished in 1.5 hours ! ) < br /><br />Ultimately the movie is melodramatic , every plot point is predictable , major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later ... and some of those events are extremely distasteful . Most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime ( in a totally predictable " twist " ) and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on . Similarly , a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another " twist . " It 's all totally mechanical , right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends ( well not all of them , just the ones the movie thinks you care about . )
0 ' Anita and Me ' is a drama about growing up in multi - ethnic Britain , rather like ' Bend it Like Beckham ' , or more closely , ' East is East ' , with which it shares a 1970s setting . The tone is resolutely chirpy ( in spite of the dour Black Country accents ) , but the film lacks ' East is East 's vigour and the result seems rather thin and trite . Moreover , the portrayal of the film 's central relationship , between an Asian girl and her white friend , is insufficiently deep to justify the way that the movie is structured around it . I have also grown tired of films where the hero years to be a writer , this is naturally often something that real writers have experienced , but hardly a fresh element in a fictional story . ' East is East ' was fun and sharp ; ' Anita and Me ' seems obvious and dull in comparison .
0 I had high expectations following " My Beautiful Laundrette " , " Bend it like Beckham " and ( less so ) " East is East " . The histories of British Asians fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen , as well as a number of excellent TV and radio series ( Goodness gracious me , etc ) . This one falls flat . Inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hill.<br /><br />Ultimately this was a horribly typical BBC effort , complete with strong regional accents , whacky over - acting characters , a " those were the days " soundtrack , and lots of " issues " in an attempt to be worthy.<br /><br />I found myself cringing at many points during this film . The writing is predictable . Every possible cliche was dragged out and aired . In fact , I have trouble thinking of any cross - cultural / cross - generational devices that could have been used that were n't . The characters were thin and cliched : the eccentric non - conformist minister ; the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman ; the over weight , overbearing aunt ; the pushy Indian parents ; the working class neighbour ; the ' wise ' profound grandmother ; the motorbike riding thug . The script was weak , with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken . And why it had to be set in the 70 's ( apart from needing an excuse for a 70 's soundtrack ) is a mystery . Possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979 . I do n't know.<br /><br />Even these things aside , good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity . Instead , the usual " BBC comedy " suspects were wheeled out to ham it up . " Bend it like Beckham " had far better comic acting ( and serious acting , in fact ) than this , with a virtually unknown cast.<br /><br />In summary , a lazy cliched script , over acted , in a dull predictable story . Give it a miss.<br /><br / >
0 Anita and Me seems to be little more than an excuse for Meera Syal , the author of the novel and screenplay , to air her prejudices , grievances and general antipathy towards the English . The general sentiment of Indian superiority over the English in this film is foul.<br /><br />The English people in this film are portrayed as overweight , violent , foul - mouthed , promiscuous , engaging in child neglect , stupid , uneducated , racist , ugly , eating poor food , and dim - witted -- tellingly , only by turning to Indian culture can the local priest be " redeemed " at the end of the film.<br /><br />By contrast , the Indian family are beautiful , clever , educated , can speak many languages , are caring and loving parents , and grammar - school fodder . The film is so insidiously prejudicial that I am astonished the BBC funded it at all . Had it been the other way round , an English family in an Indian community depicted this way , the film would have been seen as racist.<br /><br />There were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead , I thought it would lodge in my hairline . First , the gossip scene between the women at the Divali celebration -- undertext : the English are dirty and promiscuous -- and the men -- undertext : English women are prostitutes . Second , the meal with Anita where Neema 's family lie to her about cutlery -- undertext : the English are so stupid , you can make them do anything.<br /><br />But the underlying contempt towards anything English -- even English weddings are an object of scorn -- is evident all the way through the film . The character of Anita was drawn so appallingly -- almost the fallen woman trope -- that I finished the film feeling angry.<br /><br />This is not a " Bend it like Beckham " where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community 's behaviour and customs from somebody within that community , and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together . Instead , Anita and Me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable , as the English are almost an version of the Indian Untouchable caste , and this is underscored by a thinly - veiled series of attacks upon the film 's " other " community : the English.<br /><br />I felt Anita and Me is a hate - filled , grievance - based piece of work . On that basis , the BBC should not have funded its production .
0 I 'm sure this was one of those " WOAH ! " attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened , but now it 's just silly . The film 's message is cliché . The Circle - Vision is disorienting . And that awful song at the end is grating . And I really wish they 'd install seats . After so much walking , all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes . And when you hear there 's a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous ! You get entertained while sitting down , right ? WRONG ! You 're standing there for 18 + minutes leaning against a short little railing . Disney should make a newer Maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull , lackluster film . NOT FUN . Skip it . In fact , skip Canada altogether unless you 're eating there . Move directly to the United Kingdom .
0 " Rois et Reine " is a sprawling mess of a movie which will probably irritate as many viewers as it delights . It focuses by turns on ex - lovers Nora ( Emanuelle Devos)and Ismael ( Mathieu Amalric ) as they each confront a major crisis in their now separate lives . While Nora 's story is played straight and is sombre in tone , Ismael 's is played mainly for laughs , although it 's not particularly funny . Nora 's crisis is triggered by the terminal illness of her father Louis ( Maurice Garrel ) , and Ismael 's by his sudden incarceration in a mental hospital at the instigation of a mysterious third party . Ismael and Louis are just two of the males who have shaped Nora 's life , and in turn have been shaped by her , the most notable others being her now deceased first lover Pierre and their young son Elias . As events past and present are played out for the audience , and the ex - lovers become involved in each other 's lives once more , it gradually emerges that Nora 's personal take on her life story may be less reliable than first meets the eye.<br /><br />Cult director Arnaud Desplechin has fashioned a considerable oddity here , one which has garnered major plaudits in France . He wilfully eschews established narrative convention and develops the movie via a series of dramatic shifts in mood and tone . Had this approach been founded on a coherent unifying core idea or theme it might have worked , but it 's not clear in the end what exactly Desplechin 's film is actually about . Heavy - handed allusions to Greek mythology and Freudian theory are evidently freighted with meaning but , at least for this unschooled movie - goer , remain less than helpful in illuminating and interpreting the lives of the characters . At other times the treatment lapses into kitsch but the use of the anodyne " Moon River " as the film 's theme tune suggests this is probably deliberate.<br /><br />**Spoiler alert * * I suspect a major theme of the movie is the not very original observation that how we see ourselves can differ radically from how others see us or even how we think others see us . This idea is most obviously represented in the film by the violent death of Pierre and the revelation contained in Louis ' secret diary , but unfortunately both events seem entirely disconnected from what has otherwise been revealed to the audience of Pierre and Louis ' respective relationships with Nora . This seems a cheat on Desplechin 's part , as if he is thrusting the idea upon us in unmediated form rather than illustrating it more subtly in the natural course of the narrative . One or two darkly surreal touches imply the presence of an alternative but largely unconscious world of persons stripped frighteningly bare , but again these are felt more as pretentious intrusions of film - making technique rather than eruptions from a deeper reservoir of truth inherent in the story . In fact , for all its heavy - handed hints at depth , the characters are curiously undeveloped and unnuanced , as if they function more as ciphers for their creator 's many ideas about people rather than as real people in their own right . Much of the detail of their lives seems arbitrarily applied rather than organic . For example , Ismael , as we are constantly reminded , is a viola player , but more than two hours pass before we actually see or hear him play , and the effect of his chosen instrument or profession upon his personality is never elaborated . Hence , he may just as well be a marine biologist or a trapeze artist . < br /><br />Amalric brings a certain manic charm to the unhinged but ultimately sane Ismael , but I found Devos cloying and monotone ( which may be intentional , however ) as the elusive Nora . Meanwhile Jean - Paul Roussillon as Ismael 's father , Elsa Wolliaston as his psychoanalyst and Magalie Woch as the psychically wounded but defiant Sinologist he befriends in hospital make the biggest impact amongst the supporting actors . Catherine Deneuve 's in it , too , though her role is little more than a self - referential cameo.<br /><br />Ultimately , " Rois et Reine " is very much an acquired taste . Should it fail to push your buttons , it 's very likely that Desplechin 's undisciplined and florid approach will frustrate and exasperate even as you somehow keep watching .
0 " Kings and Queen " is a bloated French drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty - two minutes to no discernible point or purpose.<br /><br />The film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie . The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life , including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live . The other story involves a young man named Ismael , a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly , he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party . After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile , these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that Ismael is a former lover of Nora 's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier , tragic relationship.<br /><br />With a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining , " Kings and Queen " might have been a potent , engrossing drama about modern day relationships . It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power , and the performances are , for the most part , complex and touching . But , taken as a whole , the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that , quite frankly , it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on . Even more distressing is the fact that , even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people , we really do n't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over . For instance , Nora 's father , on his deathbed , writes a withering diatribe against his daughter 's character that simply does n't gibe with the woman we 've been looking at for well over two hours . Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa ( then , again , who is ? ) , but she certainly does n't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father . Nora could be accused of being confused , indecisive , a bit self - absorbed at times , but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place ? I do n't think so.<br /><br />Perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom . But my suspicion is that even writer Roger Bohbot and co - writer / director Arnaud Desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here . This is a well acted , pretentious bore of a film that takes the viewer on a long , rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises , a journey that leaves him no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning .
0 Too many secondary plot lines without a primary one . Too many hot buttons are pushed without any reason , they managed to stuff this boring film , that does not say anything , with every drama element that is out there : death , divorce , money issues , parenting problems , suicide , psychological problems , drug abuse , adoption , rejected love , traveling problems , sex , generations misunderstandings , robbery , legal issues , guns , medical ethics , " deep real love "   You would think that it would make for an interesting movie , but hell no  all these events are secondary to something primary which is not there . Boring . Not to mention that the " super - deep " ( and super - long ) lecture to the child at the end of the film is a total nonsense . Pity.<br /><br />Oh , forgot to mention : the actors , all of them , are quite good . That 's what kept me from turning it off . To bad their talents went to waste , The film is well shot , too : the light , the motion etc . of every episode -- that 's all in place . It 's just the meaning that 's missing .
0 In sum , overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes ! The director and co - writer says he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy . Well , at least here , these two mix like vinegar and oil . To boot , the comedy is not very funny and juvenile . Additionally , the film is not really realistic . Liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing French Citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in French Hospitals . I watched this film on my big screen TV at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on . Eventually toward the end I fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex - lover 's son . By that time I was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover , marriage of convenience and a nutty ex - lover . At times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them - either Ismael or primarily Nora . To the detriment of the audience , viewpoints keep changing from Nora and Ismael , her ex - lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital . There probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed . The epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub - plots and seems to want the viewer to believe Nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball 's chance in hell . The actors do their best and are appealing , but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing , editing and lack of focus .
0 It 's hard to tell if Noonan and Marshall are trying to ape Abbott & Costello , Martin & Lewis , Curley & Larry , or some other comedy team , but whoever it was they were trying to imitate , they failed miserably . There 's barely one weak laugh in this whole incredibly stupid picture . Noonan ( who helped write the alleged " script " ) and Marshall have no chemistry whatsoever ; Marshall seems to be trying for a Dean Martin type of devil - may - care coolness , but he does n't come even remotely close . God knows what Noonan thought he was doing , but being funny sure was n't it . He seems to think that flapping his arms and legs a lot and staring dumbly at everyone and everything is the height of screen comedy ; maybe for him it is , but not for the audience . I remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out . It was on the bottom of a double bill with a three - year - old Jeff Chandler western ( " Pillars of the Sky , " which was pretty good ) and a Three Stooges short ( " Sappy Bullfighters " , which was n't ) , and about 20 minutes into this thing all the kids in the audience were throwing stuff at the screen ; it was so staggeringly unfunny that it did n't even measure up to the worst of the Three Stooges shorts . I stayed around for the end of it ( not that I wanted to , but my folks were n't due to pick me up until after the movie ended ) , and by the time this mess was over , I was the only one in the theater . I saw it again about 15 or so years ago on cable one night , and stuck around to watch it to see if it was as bad as I remembered . It was worse . The only thing it had going for it was Julie Newmar , who was as smokingly hot as ever ; other than her , this thing has absolutely NOTHING to recommend it . The two of them also play Japanese soldiers , and the way they do it makes Jerry Lewis ' infamous playing of Japanese characters as thick - lensed , buck - toothed , gibbering mental defectives look benign by comparison . Marshall went on to host " Hollywood Squares , " and Noonan kept trying his hand at making movies , but most of them were almost as bad as this . Not quite , though , as I do n't think ANYTHING could be quite as bad as this . A truly pathetic waste of film . Do n't waste your time on it .
0 The Rookie suffers from so much . There are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie , the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make Jerry Lewis blush . Noonan and Leavitt just do n't know when to quit . It takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked . Then the guys start playing Japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day . It is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when Noonan and Leavitt are playing the stupid , stereotyped Japanese guys . But , it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters . Then it just abruptly ends . Even a naked Julie Newmar in a towel ca n't save this one.<br /><br />There is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long . The story just flounders along trying to set up funny situations and failing . Stick to Martin & Lewis . At least Deano had charm and Jerry had that animated face .
0 This service comedy , for which Peter Marshall ( Joanne Dru 's brother and later perennial host of The Hollywood Squares ) and Tommy Noonan were hyped as ' the new Lewis and Martin ' is just shy of dreadful : a few random sight gags are inserted , everyone talks fast and nothing works quite right -- there 's one scene in which Noonan is throwing grenades at officers and politicians in anger ; they 're about five feet apart , Noonan is throwing them in between , and the total reaction is that everyone flinches.<br /><br />In the midst of an awfulness relieved only by the fetching Julie Newmar , there are a few moments of brightness : Marshall and Noonan engage in occasional bouts of double talk and argufying , and their timing is nigh unto perfect -- clearly they were a well honed comedy pair.<br /><br />It is n't enough to save this turkey , alas .
0 This film was slow but tedious and the acting often drifted into the land of ham . Redgrave 's character was unappealing as the 60 something woman trying to compete with Thurman 's 20 something for the love of Fox 's character ( why is beyond me ) . The title of the movie should have been " Shallow people on the lake " . The actors played like they were in a rehearsal . A dreadfully predictable ending to boot . I ca n't believe this is on this website as a comedy !
0 This film really disappointed me . The acting is atrocious . Unbelievable . And it 's about actors . The story is incredibly obvious : A group of independent actors stage a Passion Play and , in turn , they start to live out the lives of the characters they play . I 've been watching a lot of movies lately , thanks to Netflix , and this is the first one I have n't watched all the way through in a long time . I felt I did n't need to see the end ; we all know the end of this story.<br /><br />For some , it seems , this " modernization " of the Gospels is either sacrilegious or enlightening . I can not speak to any of this as I was n't raised in the Christian church . That being said , I was raised in the US and I live in an increasingly Christian culture . I 'm curious enough about Jesus and about the modernization of the religion , for better or worse . I have n't seen Mel Gibson 's version , but I 'm guessing that those who liked that one will like this , except for the most conservative . I just wish this was a better film.<br /><br />Lots of these reviews praise Arcand 's direction and especially the cinematography . I liked neither . The film itself is rather prudish and preachy . I did n't believe the characters ' personae and I was never involved with their on screen lives . The play within the play is very much dated and would not , I think , carry it 's own weight in a real time production . But that 's beside the point . What I really needed for this to work would have been stronger development of the characters and the plot to support the philosophical and theological questions the film would like to be about . And the musical choices are obvious and unoriginal.<br /><br />There were two examples of this that come easily to mind . Firstly , there is a reenactment of the parable of Jesus driving the money lenders from the temple : the lead actor , who has fallen for the woman who will play Magdalene and who is also a model and dancer , becomes enraged that she must debase herself by auditioning for a commercial ( with a wicked producer and plenty of panting men in the audience ) with her pants off . He trashes the place and chases them all out . I guess this is the level that the film wishes to reach . The romance between these two is entirely arbitrary and not at all emotionally realized and the scene is played out like a high - school rendering of Death of a Salesman , i.e. , not well . Please stop hitting me over the head with this high - handed " significance . " The other is the relationship between the other female lead and the priest who has asked them to do the play and who , eventually , turns against them and betrays them to the nowadays - corrupt Church . Why . Why does she sleep with this guy . " It brings him so much pleasure and me so little pain . " Ah , the saintly whore and the lovable old coot . It seems to be just enough for Arcand to signify but not worth the trouble to enrich and enliven these characters . They are going through the motions and I 'm reaching for the eject button.<br /><br />Feel free to write me off as bored , jaded or just not interested . Feel free to watch this movie and see the Passion , in all its beauty , sadness and inspiration , delivered as an amateurish and gimmicky charade . Feel free to have all your preconceived ideas affirmed and see any shred of artistic integrity forsaken for monotonous drivel . But do n't say I did n't warn you .
0 Well , Jesus of Montreal is basically an intelligent movie . The actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay . But , although I was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion ( I am an atheist ) , it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end . Why is this movie so incredibly boring ? I do n't know . It just is and so it is not recommendable .
0 You believe in God or you do n't . You believe in Jesus or you do n't . You believe He is the Son of God or you do n't . The choice is up to you.<br /><br />Director Denys Arcand has really done everything he could to bring back Jesus to a mere historic figure , social worker , son of two humans , instead of the Son of God the Holy Spirit and Mary , Who opened Heaven again for us . Encouraging the Big Bang , a world come from evolution , instead of seeing the beauty of creation . The film depicts a theologian bringing some " modern findings " to the actor who plays Jesus in the Passion Play , who happily incorporates them in his play.<br /><br />The depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the Passion Play is performed in Montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the Passion Play instead of showing his love for God through celibacy . More often than not the director 's abhorrence of the Church is clearly visible.<br /><br />The director has tried to make a parallel between Jesus ' life and the Passion Play actor 's life . This is an admirable attempt , but depicting the Resurrection with the transplantation of the Passion Play actor 's organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about Jesus.<br /><br />My opinion is not important , God 's opinion is , but I would n't want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before Jesus ' throne .
0 As I sat in front of the TV watching this movie , I thought , " Oh , what Alfred Hitchcock , or even Brian DePalma , could have done with this ! " Chances are , you will too . It does start out intrigueing . A British park ranger living in Los Angeles ( Collin Firth ) marries a pretty , demure brunette woman ( Lisa Zane ) whom he met in a park only a short time ago . Then , one day she dissappears . The police are unable to find any documentation that she ever existed , and Firth conducts his own search . So far , so good . Just as he 's about to give up , he turns to his womanizing best friend ( Billy Zane ) , and they stumble onto her former life in L.A. 's sordid underground of drugs , nightclubs , and ametuer filmmaking , and then to her history of mental instability . At that point , Firth 's life is in danger , and the film falls apart . None of the characters from Lisa Zane 's past are remotely interesting . The film moves slowly , and there 's very little action . There is a subplot regarding missing drug money , but it 's just a throwaway . No chases , no cliffhanging sequences , and no suspense . Just some dull beatings and a lot of chat by boring characters . One thing worth noting , Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister , but they never appear in a scene together . By the end of the movie , you 're torn between wondering what might have been and trying to stay awake .
0 It 's interesting at first . A naive park ranger ( Colin Firth ) marries a pretty , mysterious woman ( Lisa Zane ) he 's only known for a short time . They seem to be happy , then she disappears without warning . He searches for her and , after a few dead ends , stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past , which may include criminal activity . And then , it seems the filmmakers did n't know what to do with the story . The beginning , while not as suspenseful as it sounds , is at least watchable . Then it ceases to be interesting or even make much sense . And the ending is so lame , so dull , and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence , you 'll think the screenwriters did n't know what to do with it and got bored trying . What a sorry waste of a good idea !
0 I go to a lot of movies , often I bring my 5 year old son , I am so glad I did not bring him to this one . There are many references to sex and a skinny dipping scene , however , that is not the primary reason I would not take him to it . The trailers lead you to believe it is a light - hearted comedy ; nevertheless , virtually all of the funny moments are in the previews . I kept waiting for it to get interesting , funny , or anything but serious ; however , I nearly fell asleep as the plot - less story dragged on . I understand that dogs can be great company , that being said , the entire story focused on a poorly behaving dog that the owners were not savvy enough to train . If a human caused this much damage and mayhem that person would be banned . The worst movie I 've ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson , a waste of their talent . The best way to sum up this movie is , couple gets unruly dog , couple falls in love with dog , dog dies , couple sad . The End .
0 I love B movies .. but come on .... this was n't even worth a grade ... The ending was dumb ... b / c THERE WAS NO REAL ENDING!!! .. not to mention that it comes to life on its own ... I mean no lighting storm or crazy demonic powers ? ? Slow as hell and then they just start killing off the characters one by one in like a 15 min time period ... and i wo n't even start on the part of the thing killing the one guy without its head .... and then you do n't even get to see what Jigsaw even does with his so called " new jigsaw puzzle" .... Unless you have nothing better to do ... Id watch paint dry before I d recommend this God - forsaken movie to anyone else ... oh and to make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing the one creature in the basement scene from the window .. that was funny as hell and probably the only good part of watching that waste of film
0 I am not sure who is writing these < br /><br />glowing reviews for this movie but trust me it STKINKS . I have seen hundreds of horror films and slasher flicks and this one is LAME it is only about 80min long and believe me that is all I could take . Plot is terrible , acting is even worse . And there is no development at all.<br /><br />Even the David Cocteau films are better than this . RUN AWAY from JIGSAW . I expected to hate the acting , which can be forgiven in direct to video movies , if the plot is good.<br /><br />This had no scares , very little Gore,<br /><br />and a truly unattractive cast.<br /><br />I watched this with three other friends < br /><br />who I hope are still talking to me!<br /><br />They wanted me to fling the disc out the window . I can not believe anyone could have < br /><br />given this tripe a good review .
0 Whether you want to spend nearly 2 hours of your life watching this depends how you like your horror movies . If you like them so god damn awful they 're hysterical , watch away . Jigsaw is without a doubt the worst movie i 've seen in my life ( and i 've seen ' Long Time Dead ' ) , and i say this as a fan of the low - budget horror / gore genre and having seen a good few to compare it to . I 'm not even going to go into the specifics of what makes this movie was bad as it is , the only good thing about it is it 's so so terrible it 's one of the funniest things i 've seen in years . If you can find this to rent cheap it 's definitely worth watching , if you were involved in making it - shame on you . :o) IMDb need to introduce a 0/10 ranking especially for this movie , it thoroughly deserves it .
0 OK another film bought by me and Joe Swatman . OK this is n't the worst film i 've reviewed this week but it still sucked royaly . we had a lot of fun watching this piece of crap.<br /><br />The Monster Jigsaw is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional students ideas , u just know ur in for trouble when someone equips him with a buzzsaw and a sawed of shotgun , the film was n't as gory as we hoped , i mean on of the deaths is a heart attack . Again i think the acting sucks , sum of the actors must be porn stars and one get into her undies for what ever reason . < br /><br />The absolute worst part is the ending , it leaves it open for a bit of a Jigsaw 2 but that s never gunna happen lets face it.<br /><br />My ratings:<br /><br />funny 4/100 mock ( how much fun we had mocking it ) 73/100 acting 8/100 generally 12/100
0 We 've all been there , sitting with some friends watching a bad movie , laughing at how terribly it was made and how poor the acting was ; eventually the credits roll and everyone looks around and says " how is it possible such a movie was made ? who paid money to have this script made into a feature film ? " Well Jigsaw is not that kind of film , instead of asking how this garbage was budgeted you wonder why the makers were shot out of a cannon into the sun . Yes , Jigsaw is quite possibly the worst movie ever made or conceived , this coming from a guy who has seen Campfire Stories and Fever Lake . The film starts out in some kind of college class , what kind of class I am unsure , but it is imagined to be an art class . Now these dorks have been given a final project by their idiot teacher , five of them are given pieces of a mannequin and told to design it in any way they see fit , and since there are only five pieces the other students in the class receive and automatic A , oddly enough there are only six students in this entire class so the one goth chic gets a free A , good for her ! A week passes and the five students , plus teacher , plus one hillbilly husband meet in a bar to discuss their and complete their project , they put the pieces together , head , arms , legs and inform the others why they chose their specifics designs , now these creative geniuses used the week to their full advantage , one puts a saw blade in the left hand , the other gets a sawed off shotgun , the right leg gets a bunch of broken ceramic glued to it and the left some magazine clippings , the head is the worst getting a camera in the eye , ala Hellraiser 3 , with some bottle rockets for a stylish mo - hawk . After they have all spilled their guts about their specifics designs the now drunk teacher says they are to burn the mannequin , now aptly named Jigsaw . Now up to this point it has been standard horrible movie fair , bad acting , dialog and everything else , but has still been pretty plausible , yet after Jigsaw catches fire things take a turn for the worst ... Jigsaw comes alive .. How you ask ? I have no idea , he just does because the writers could n't think of a realistic way for two pounds worth of molded plastic to become alive ( Come on guys , a bolt of lighting , a traveling voodoo priest , anything could have worked . ) So once Jigsaw comes to life he uses his new abilities of walking very slow and stilted with the use of his molded fingers to wreak havoc . First he kills the cool guy with some barb wire , this guy who was about to get it on with a hot chic decides drinking ground beer off in the distance is more important than what is in front of him . With him gone Jigsaw shoots the sexy girl in the face and then gives an old man a heart attack with a slight twist of his head , he then saws up a nasty looking southern woman and then her hillbilly husband ; Jigsaw then kills the nerdy guy with some headless deception . Did I mention Jigsaw was taking body parts off his victims to make a human version of himself ? No ! Well its not important they do n't even show his macabre creation , they do n't even show him steal away a torso from his poor creators ( Maybe he was trying to create the head detective from In Living Color ) . So after these five have been killed the teacher and the nerdy girl are all who is left , the teacher figures out that Jigsaw only needs a head to finish his masterpiece , since he is still uninterested in that torso thing . So being the coward he is the teacher ties up the girl as a sacrifice to Jigsaw who comes in only to go for the teacher with his electric buzz saw which is n't even plugged in . That is where the freaking movie ends , we do n't even get to see the teacher get killed or what happens to the girl , let alone an explanation why Jigsaw came to life or how he cleaned himself off after being burned . This movie is so shameful it has too be seen , it is only 71 minutes so it is a small part of your day ; For the memories of a lifetime , Jigsaw , Jigsaw , Jigsaw . Thank you Total Recall ! The Judge has ruled , watch Jigsaw only if your plans of severing off your genitals seems played out .
0 I might not be a huge admirer of the original " Creepshow " , but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection ! And to think I was going into this expecting to like this one more . Five years after its predecessor , George Romero gets back on board the EC Comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for Steve King 's three stories . Though , the direction is handed off to Michael Gornick . The film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by Gornick . But most of the blame would have to go to Romero 's dreadfully static and unbearably cringe - like script ( especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story ) . Moralistic messages ( that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters ) simply took over the black humour . Oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture . Loosely linking the three tales ( Old Chief Woodenhead , The Raft and The Hitchhiker ) together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia ( 80s ) animation form . I rather liked this segment and the wisecracking Creep character was a glowing light . < br /><br / > # The first story " Old Chief Woodenhead " sees two elderly proprietors ( George Kennedy & Dorothy Lamour ) of a general store in a dying native community , Dead River . Get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in Hollywood . In front of the store is a wooden statue of an Indian Chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths . < br /><br />-Listen to George Kennedy waffle .. And waffle on for 10 minutes about how he 's committed to his ' great ' community . What a nice touchy feely time . Well , just like Kennedy 's speeches , this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise . The overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so . These two factors really added to my headache . When the Indian comes alive and turns avenger , the goons meet a very quick ( though grisly ) death in the proper fashion . The effects were commendably done , but what about that free flowing hair . How could Hollywood knock that lock of hair back ? Ugh ! < br /><br / > # Second story " The Raft " follows a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens heading up to a secluded lake . After swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake , they get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water . < br /><br />-Now this is much better , MUCH better . What starts of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a mysteriously creepy set - up that 's full of tight and claustrophobic tension . And it does n't even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter . Quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too . The surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it . The performances from the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark . Gornick 's direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey side . While , the alarming music score on this occasion pressed the right chords . The sludge - like creature in the lake ( like many have mentioned ) looks like an icky black tarpaulin ( yeah you 're reading that right ! ) floating on the water . < br /><br / > # Finally number three concludes with " The Hitchhiker " . A wealthy , but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after being with her male gigolo , but she 's is running late . Thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if needed , she skids off the road and accidentally hit 's a hitchhiker . Instead of checking or getting help , she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband . Soon enough she 's being terrorised by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhiker.<br /><br />-Not awful , but I really did n't get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all . Compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead . Lois Chiles was okay in the lead role , but that constant assuring and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired . The vivid make - up effects are well - displayed and dripping with vision . When she hit 's the hitchhiker that 's when it becomes hectic , cheesy and over - the - top in its execution . From there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat   and repeat the line , " Thanks for the ride lady ! " This happens every time she decides to run over him . Have a little courtesy for the dead darling . < br /><br />In all , the second short story " The Raft " and the unpleasantly , well - conceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel .
0 CREEPSHOW 2 is the ill - fated sequel to the George Romero 's ( overrated ) original , CREEPSHOW . Any sequel following a Romero film that 's not directed by Romero himself has got some large shoes to fill , mostly because of the Romero fans out there who think he 's God . I did n't care much for the first film and funny enough , I did n't care much for the sequel . The film series had so much potential but it was short - lived because both films were less than stellar . < br /><br />The biggest problem with CREEPSHOW 2 was that it only had three stories ( excluding the in - between story ) , and because the first story sucked beyond belief , it only left the chance for almost half of the movie to be * really * good . I saw CS 2 at the movies and the first segment was a real groaner . Anything dramatic with George ' I ca n't act ' Kennedy is automatically doomed and the Indian Statue story was too hokey and simply did n't belong in this sequel . So after a really trite and dull start , there were only two other stories left to reverse the fiasco of the aborted beginning and unfortunately the two other stories were n't great enough for me to forget the first story . THE RAFT and THE HITCHHIKER are moderately successful , moderately because though the two other segments have their moments , they still sorta fall flat . The two last stories are basically stretched out for too long . It 's not that I wanted the stories to happen at a dizzying pace and end fast , but both good ideas found within those stories were sorta nullified by the fact that they were slow and padded and eventually fell flat when the segments needed to be more energized , more erratic and with punchier endings . Also , if the two last stories had n't been stretched out to pad the movie or had all three segments been more brief with better editing and direction , they could have added a much needed fourth story to the bunch . Having only three padded segments made for a boring feast.<br /><br />The acting and writing in both THE RAFT and THE HITCHHIKER segments are from awful to good . I like Lois Chiles in the last segment . It 's probably her best moment on screen aside from her role as Bond Girl Holly Goodhead in MOONRAKER and in DEATH ON THE NILE . But even her role is difficult to understand at times because of the serviceable direction and the unfocused story . Are we supposed to hate her or sympathize with her ? Are we supposed to sympathize with the annoying hitchhiker ? If the hitchhiker 's body was found by other people on the road , what was he when he attacked Chiles ? Was he a ghost or a zombie or what ? How did the body eventually left the presence of the other people who found him dead in order to attack Chiles ? The whole thing is not very clear , even for a supernatural story . And the ending is rather dull and uneventful.<br /><br />As for the infamous THE RAFT story , well , the acting is mostly on the awful side and none of the characters are sympathetic or interesting . The characters would have been more interesting had the actors played themselves . None of the actors are convincing in their specific roles . Paul Satterfield looks smarter than the dumb jock he 's playing and the actress who plays his girlfriend is not very convincing as the typical bitchy slut . She seems too timid . The same could be said with the two others who play the " plain " teens . The idea of the killer oil slick is interesting and creepy but not well executed . There should have been a fifth character to the story , maybe a homeless man or a ranger who lurks around the lake and knows about the oil slick and could have been the watery monster 's alter ego of sorts . As creepy as the oil slick is , it does n't make for a compelling " character " . And the way the story ends , everything seems pointless . No punch to it whatsoever.<br /><br />Except for the few titillating aspects which always seems to make boring things worthwhile , seeing CREEPSHOW 2 at a theater was basically a waste of money and time . CS 2 is more rental material than something you pay to see on the big screen .
0 Creepshow 2 had a lot of potential , they just did n't put enough time in perfecting it . The stories were pretty cool and creepy enough , but it was lacking . It 's a good movie , but after you 've seen it once , you might want to see it again . This movie could of been better .
0 " Creepshow 2 " is little more than a pale imitation of the original , designed with little purpose other than to cash in on the name of the previous film . It even amplifies the flaws of its predecessor , which was often predictable and heavy - handed . Still , the first time around , there were enough thrills to make up for it 's periodic lulls , resulting in an uneven but overall fairly entertaining effort . The sequel has few worthwhile moments , so the transparency of the stories are even more apparent . Once in a while , it delivers , but most of the time , it just lingers there.<br /><br />As in the original , all the stories revolve around the common theme of revenge and just desserts . A wooden Indian comes to life , wreaking vengeance upon the killers of its owner . Teenagers are devoured by an aquatic monster . A hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless motorist . None of these premises are inherently bad in themselves , but they are utterly lacking in inspiration . There are few surprises and no scares . This a textbook example of unmotivated , by - the - numbers filmmaking . It does n't help that this cheap - looking movie suffers from a flat directorial style , although to be honest , there was n't much to work with . In the end , the second story comes off best , but not by much . < br /><br />For the most part , the performances are okay at best . George Kennedy , as the ill - fated general store owner , does an adequate , if not particularly inspired job . Dorothy Lamour , on the other hand , is quite good as the guilt - ridden motorist , evoking sympathy for her plight despite the predictable , redundant material . However , most of the characters are pretty thin overall . < br /><br />One would think that " Creepshow 2 " would have turned out better . George Romero , who directed the original , returned to pen the screenplay , based on more of Stephen King 's stories . Makeup effects artist Tom Savini turns in some good , gory work . So why is the film a letdown ? I guess Romero did n't really want to make a second film , but was forced to do so for financial reasons . It was a decade of horror sequels , clones , rip - offs , and whatnot , so this one was certainly inevitable . I can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry , picking up his paycheck , and running off . I guess he had to do what was necessary to get his own projects financed ; we ca n't blame him.<br /><br />Rating : * 1/2 ( out of * * * * ) < br /><br />Released by New World Pictures
0 I am a big fan of old horror movies , and since I am middle aged , old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920 's to 1960 's period . I am not a big fan of more modern horror movies , with one exception being Creepshow 1 , which I thought was great . I could reminisce about the stories there but I really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with Hal Holbrook , and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending . All the stories were great though . So why did I like them so much ? The characters had some decent development , the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad , the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear , and the funny bits were really funny ! This sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent ! I am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on IMDb.com , lol . When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get top billing it 's telling you something ..... 4 of 10 . Also , Romero 's expertise is hard to find here , they must had told him to tone it down to a PG standard ( I do n't know what this was rated at but it looks PG to me ) , and that 's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on . It 's shown on the Encore cable channel if your dieing ( yuck yuck ) to see it .
0 Sequels have a nasty habit of being disappointing , and the best credit I can give this is that it maintains that old tradition . These three tales are n't anything as good as any from the original Creepshow.<br /><br />By far the best of the trio involves a wooden idol which comes to life to take revenge on the thugs who killed its owners . The second story is about a lake monster which seems to be nothing more than a lot of floating slop , makes you wonder how anybody could possibly be scared of it . The third story includes a cameo from Stephen King as a truck driver , but other than that is a pretty unmemorable tale concerning the victim of a road traffic accident who comes back from the dead for the person who knocked him down.<br /><br />Watch the original Creepshow instead , or if you already have done then be happy with that .
0 Five years after the original Creepshow , another inferior horror sequel is penned by George A. Romero and Stephen King : Creepshow 2 . This time there are only three stories instead of five . None of the three stories is really original or distinguished either . The first story is a horror staple , formulaic story about a wooden Indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners . The effects are really neat in this story , but it 's just too familiar to be compelling enough . George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the elderly store owners . The second story , " The Raft " , is a Stephen King story . It 's about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake . Soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a watery blob does each of them in for no apparent reason . However , instead of being suspenseful , the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopey - headed behavior , preventing us from really caring about what happens next . There is also some unintentional humor in this segment . The third and final story is " The Hitch - hiker " , which is actually a retread re - adapted for Creepshow 2 . The original story , by Lucille Fletcher , was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film . Then it was adapted for a famous Twilight Zone episode featuring Inger Stevens . " The Hitch - hiker " works the best out of these three offerings , but it 's not without its problems either . Lois Chiles plays a cheating spouse , who ends up running over a hitch - hiker , or so she thinks . However , we do n't know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her . As in many average stories of this type , the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns . The wrap around story with the bullies seems a bit out of place . Tom Savini appears as the " creep " in this installment . The good thing is there have n't been any more sequels . * 1/2 of 4 stars .
0 I rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid . I snuck downstairs really early one morning , started watching HBO , and The Raft ( segment 2 ) terrorized me good . This time around , I still enjoyed The Raft , although I could n't tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short . The other two segments were complete trash . I ca n't believe a producer somewhere payed to make this junk . All I 've accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory . Creepshow 2 will now join Rad among my list of tainted childhood classics . 4/10
0 Andy Lau stars in another cop undercover tale . Daniel Wu plays Nick who is working for the cops and is also close to the top of a drug dealing gang(Lau ) . The movie begins as we watch the police try to make a drug bust only to see it go to pieces . We then are introduced to the young drug addicted mother and her daughter living near Nick and to his cronies and the cops , and 45 minutes in I shut off the movie and put on the news . Well acted and great to look at this is as uninvolving a movie as I 've seen in a long time . Its not bad as such its just you really do n't care . I mean I really did n't care at all . I actually started to do something else completely forgetting I had on a subtitled movie on , that s how much I did n't care . I wish I could have hated the film but the film is such a nonentity that it made almost no impression on me ( its not even something I could sleep to its just something to ignore ) . Come on the box called it the Chinese Scarface , what after he was dead ? This is one to avoid .
0 Protégé runs in a linear fashion ; expect no fast - paced action , and neither will you find yourself with baited breath because there are simply no seating - on - the - edge moments.<br /><br />There is not much of a crux , so do n't expect one either . I would not fault the acting - the show would have been much worst if not for Wu 's acting which was the film 's only saving grace . And , oh that cute little girl too.<br /><br />The humour is at best , weak , and the show must as well pass off as an anti - drug campaign which employs the usual shock - tactic ( esp in the scenes with Zhang ) to tell us stuff that we already know - i.e. drugs break up families , heroin drives you crazy , it is not so easy to wean off , you will fall into a vicious cycle.<br /><br />I know it may seem all a little harsh , but I feel that the show is far from seamless and somewhat patchy ( * SPOILER ALERT * : Take for example when Andy Lau got brought to the police station : what ? we were just told ' oh we have all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997 ' , and THAT is how he got caught . Nope , no chasing - car action , just a jump - of - scene , which kind of undermined Wu 's role as an undercover in the first place . ) I suspect the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that it is after all , a production of Mediacorp Raintree - a Singaporean production film company .
0 Whoa . In the Twin Cities , we have a station that shows a " Big Bad Movie " Monday through Friday . Tonight 's nugget was a film with Carrie Fisher called " She 's Back " about a really annoying woman who ends up getting murdered when thugs break into her house . Bea ( Beatrice ) comes back to haunt her husband . She wants him to seek revenge on her killers , hence " she 's back " . And she wo n't let him rest until he does so . She irritates him endlessly ... and the viewers , too ! This movie is truly one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . Hey , I like bad movies , though ( my fave movie is Xanadu ) . I was really shaking my head throughout the whole film , wondering who thought this would be a good idea for a movie . Bea is just so annoying . The plot is silly ; the acting is bad ; the story ... well , you get my drift . Anyway , if you wanna see a really bad movie - really really bad movie , check this one out . You wo n't be disappointed . Heh .
0 This movie should be number one on the bottom 100 . The acting is so horrible that when my son and I watched it we nearly got physically ill . And the story is worse . I could go on and on about how bad it is but all I really wanted to do was add a warning to frankbob 's review as I see no one else has gone to the trouble of doing so yet . Do n't waste your time , money , energy or anything else on this movie . Thank goodness we saw it on TV so we did n't spend anything on it . Had we , I would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and be forced to hurl an execration in their general direction . In conclusion , I would like to say that I have always enjoyed watching Carrie Fisher act . But I am sad to say that she is not worth watching in this particular film . Do n't spoil your opinion of Carrie by viewing it .
0 Carrie Fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem , and she does n't remember very much of it . That would explain why she made this film , but it does n't explain why anyone else in the cast or crew did ; I ca n't believe that EVERYBODY had a coke problem . This has to be one of the absolute worst movies ever made , and that 's saying something . The blame ca n't be laid at the feet of " director " Tim Kincaid or " writer " Buddy Giovinazzo , as it is obvious that this picture was n't written or directed by anyone . Apparently it just spontaneously came together , as there is little evidence of coherency , consistency , design , plot , sense , intelligence or anything else . What is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop . Co - star Robert Joy has done good work in other films , and composer Jimmie Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are both industry veterans , Marks also having been a director , and not a bad one . Why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension . Tim Kincaid , the alleged " director " , has made quite a few low - rent sci - fi and horror films , and , having seen most of them , I can tell you that not a one of them is any good . This one , though , is by far the worst thing he 's ever done , and that is a major accomplishment on his part . Everything , absolutely EVERYTHING , about this movie is 12th - rate -- at best . The cinematography is terrible , the acting is laughable , the " special effects " make " Plan 9 From Outer Space " look like " Spider - Man " , the story is trite , derivative and stupid . Do n't waste your time even looking at the video box cover , let alone renting it . A complete , utter , annoying , total dud .
0 OK this movie was really " unique " shall we say . Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented in the movie , even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie . but she said that she ca n't remember to much of it . well that s her excuse but what s everyone else 's ? ? ? i ca n't imagine they all had a coke problem.whatever it was n't all that bad i mean i guess the plot was OK and it had some pretty funny moments . although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste . oh well i guess i was disappointed cause Carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her .
0 While the acting and directing could be argued as having some merit - the storyline is a very poor wannabe Vietnam movie with the country name simply changed.<br /><br />At the very least , for a movie to hold some credibility , try and have some semblance of accuracy in equipment , weapons and tactics . Nevermind the gross misrepresentation of the behaviour of the troops as a norm.<br /><br />Aside for the limited use as silly propaganda about the South African Defence Force , it serves little purpose - definitely no entertainment value.<br /><br />Aspiring movie makers - this is how not to make a war movie . Do some research , and have some pride in your product .
0 I am a relative latecomer to the transcendent work of film auteur Yasujiro Ozu , whose masterfully understated views of Japanese life , especially in the post - WWII era , illuminate universal truths . Having now seen several of his landmark films such as 1949 's " Late Spring " and 1953 's " Tokyo Story " , I am convinced that Ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift of conveying the range of feelings arising from intergenerational conflict through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery . It is Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao - hsien 's keen aspiration to pay homage to Ozu on his centenary with this generally enervating 2003 film . Among with co - screenwriter T'ien - wen Chu , Hsiao - hsien appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the glacial pacing tolerable.<br /><br />The story concerns Yôko , a young Japanese writer researching the life of mid-20th century Taiwanese composer Jiang Wen - Ye in Tokyo after coming back from Taiwan where she taught Japanese . After 25 drawn - out minutes of character set - up , she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in Taiwan . At the same time , Yôko 's coffeehouse friend Hajime , who runs a used bookstore , has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her . Hsiao - hsien connects this slim plot line with a series of shots held for inordinately lengthy takes as the frame composition changes . There are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains . While these techniques are consistent with Ozu 's style , Hsiao - hsien can not seem to dive into the characters ' psyches the way Ozu did with maximal fluidity and minimal theatrics , in particular , Yôko 's plight seems rather non - committal in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents ' reaction overly passive to hold much interest . In fact , the whole film has an atmosphere of exhaustion about it , which makes the film feel interminable.<br /><br />The performances are unobtrusive though hardly memorable . J - pop music star Yo Hitoto brings a natural ease to Yôko , while Tadanobu Asano is something of a cipher as Hajime . The rest of the characters barely register , even Nenji Kobayashi and Kimiko Yo as Yôko 's parents . Cinematographer Lee Ping - Bing provides expert work though he violates a cardinal rule of Ozu films by not keeping the camera stable during shots . Hitoto speak - sings the fetching pop song used over he ending credits , " Hito - Shian " . The DVD includes an hour long , French - made documentary , " Métro Lumière " , which actually does help provide some of the context for Hsiao - hsien 's approach to the film . It includes excerpts from Ozu 's films , in particular , " Equinox Flower " , to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either " Tokyo Story " or " Early Summer " , the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation set - ups . There are also edited interview clips of Hitoto , Asano and Hsiao - hsien , as well as the film 's trailer .
0 I 've given ' Kôhî jikô ' a low score not because it was a bad movie , but because it does n't do anything worth praising.<br /><br />I've not seen any of Hsiao - hsien Hou 's work before , but for the uninitiated ( me included ) ' Kôhî jikô ' is advertised as a homage to Yasujiro Ozu . ( A Japanese director whose last film was way , way in 1962 ) The film is an extremely sparse work ... containing very little dialogue , story , music or emotion.<br /><br />Yo Hitoto plays ' Yoko ' a jobless , wandering character who spends her time in her local coffee shop or loosely investigating a Taiwanese composer she likes . Tadanobu Asano plays her friend , who works in a cd shop and occasionally indulges his otaku interest in trains . And that 's about all it.<br /><br />We watch as Yoko drinks coffee alone ... walks around ... waits for a train ... catches a train ... falls asleep on the train . The kind of mundane reality anybody in Japan can see on a daily basis . Hou captures these ordinary moments of these characters life , but without any meaning to these vignettes it 's an entirely pointless film to make or watch .
0 Cafe Lumiere is a beautifully photographed nullity . Unacquainted with the work of the director , I am well - acquainted with the filmmaker he is supposedly paying tribute to - Ozu Yasujiro . While not even approaching Ozu in greatness , Hou has communicated nothing of Ozu 's depth of emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space . One of the things he misses entirely is Ozu 's attention to character - we are not even " introduced " by Hou to his lead character ( a perfect blank page ) . There are no medium or close shots of his people . One of the DVD extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what Hou does n't - a good look at their faces.<br /><br />There was a great Spanish film by Bardem called Nunca Pasa Nada , which translates to something like " Nothing Ever Happens " . That would be a far better title to this pointless exercise . All through the film we are given clues about an obscure Taiwanese composer some of whose work we hear on the soundtrack . But the clues , like everything else , add up to nothing . Unless you 're a trainspotter , this film has nothing to recommend it .
0 It 's official , folks -- Hou Hsiao - Hsien does n't have a thought in his pretty little head . Are you wondering why he chose Shu Qi as his muse?<br /><br />Shu ( or is that Qi ? ) does n't appear in this one . Instead we get a snaggletoothed Yo Hitoto , apparently a pop star in Japan -- judging by her song at the end , she 's a pop star just like the girl who serves you at Rockin ' Curry is " a actriss " -- and a wasted Tadanobu Asano , typically an indicator of quality , who is required to do nothing here but stand around and look like a mumbling Asian hipster and is too old to manage even that . < br /><br />Hou 's philosophy ? Life is limbo , a big nothing , feel it and move on . I 'd like to do that but Hou gives us nothing to feel in Cafe Lumiere beyond a bland photo essay of Life in Tokyo Circa 2003 and the flabbergasting observation that people are ships that pass in the night , no , make that trains that pass in the day , never connecting , each hurtling to its own destination , usually some variant of a dark tunnel or maybe a bridge if they 're lucky . Yikes . Flowers of Shanghai is one of the most rarefied , technically accomplished and mesmerizing films of all time . How could the same director who created the opening shot of that film , which features about twelve actors conversing at machine - gun speed for about ten straight minutes -- an impossible directorial feat -- get trapped making this laconic sub - Jarmusch reality porn for two films in a row now ? Millennium Mambo may be dead weight , but at least it has two great shots , shots that hint at Hou 's true calling as the film equivalent of Odilon Redon : Those shots are the sex scene with the arrhythmically blinking lights and the opening shot of Shu Qi floating down a blue corridor . His M.O. while making Cafe Lumiere seems to have been to remove the two great shots from Millennium Mambo to make it more consistent . You be the judge if that sounds appealing . < br /><br />Hou does not need to refine -- you can not refine the limbo idea further than Flowers of Shanghai . He needs to expand , to bloat outwards , to release the inner expressionist and genre - revitalizer that is being squandered so senselessly on clichéd minimalism . It 's time for him to do a live - action remake of Akira or something . This kind of art film where the actors are supposed to be authentic because they are held facelessly in long - shot and speak in monosyllables is now every last bit as safe , ghettoized and stagnant as the Hollywood action blockbuster . ( What is the connection between " reality " and people who ca n't talk ? It seems to me that people " in real life " never stop jabbering . ) Then again , considering that 2005 alone brought big - budget movies as diverse and rich in ideas as Aeon Flux , The Island , and King Kong , it 's now safe to say that even Michael Bay has surpassed Hou , and that 's really sad.<br /><br />The good news is that , though Hou is in his 50s , it frankly feels to me as if he has n't even begun . There are a couple moments in this film that show the promise is still there , such as a moody bit early on in the bookstore when the room dims to a bloody sunset - red while Hitoto talks about babies with the faces of goblins . But whatever fear is holding him back , however comfortable it is to make the same film over and over and be hailed by the gullible and pretentious as the savior of cinema , Hou , your time as the darling of the Rotterdam , Venice , Toronto , Berlin and whatever else film festivals is almost up and people are catching onto your ruse double - quick . Two words for you : Atom Egoyan . Two more words , or maybe three : Tsai Ming - Liang . You are now cribbing from both of these tedious frauds who are about to go up their own dark tunnels forever . Risk your shirt on a sci - fi epic , sell out , be reviled -- but leave the social critiques to people that have no eye and no heart . Let your painterly talent express itself to the full . You 're not going to ever get out of limbo otherwise .
0 " The seventh sign " borrows a lot from " Rosemary 's baby " and " the omen " ( it actually blends the two stories).Even its title recalls Bergman ' s " the seventh seal " .<br /><br />Nevertheless , it begins well enough , with all the omens scattered on the whole earth , and in parallel , a -seemingly- distinct plot with Moore 's husband trying to save a poor boy ( who killed his parents who were brother and sister)from death penalty . This time , both Christian and Jewish religions are called to the rescue ( even the Wandering Jew is involved),which makes the lines sometimes unintentionally funny ( Have you ever been to Sunday school ? But they taught me that God was love!).The best scene IMHO , is the short dialog between priest John Heard -who does not seem to take things seriously , too bad he was not given a more important part because his laid - back acting is priceless - and the young Jew.<br /><br />Demi Moore probably registered the same desire as ex - husband Bruce Willis : saving the world . She does not save the movie for all that .
0 When I saw this film on FearNet , I thought it would be a scary movie . Apparently , it was n't . I have no clue how this movie was allowed to be featured on that site . FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful from all the actors . I hated the story . The story was stupid . The movie starts out with a man with a scroll with a signia stamped onto it . He breaks the seal and certain disasters happen . The water turns to blood , the oceans die out , the moon turns red , etc . < br /><br />The female character was annoying as well . A lot of the stuff she did did n't make sense . Like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it . Coincidentally , it 's the date she 's expected to give birth to her baby and she starts freaking out about it and starts researching it and asking religious people what it all means.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert * < br /><br />The two worst things happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that God told him to murder his parents and the end where Demi Moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul into it.<br /><br />Here 's what happens . The mentally retarded person gets shot and killed and the apocalypse begins . Demi Moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child . She touches her child 's head , transferring her soul into the child and then dies . Then , the apocalypse stops.<br /><br />Why does God all of a sudden have a change of heart ? He gets furious when the Governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man then he 's all about forgiveness once a lone woman transfers her soul into her baby ? < br /><br />*End Spoiler * < br /><br />The movie is pretty stupid . It 's another religious end of the world propaganda piece . The acting from Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everybody else is excellent . That 's about all there is.<br /><br />I give this movie 2 stars out of 10 . Good acting with a lot of nonsense !
0 one word boring.<br /><br />the young demi looks good , but she 's pregnant ( - point for that =D ) the movie is not scary at all ... <br /><br />the first scenes looked little crappy , i could render better clouds with my laptop , and after effects . but that was then ... and now is now . some movies do not get old well ... this is one of them.<br /><br />not worth renting or buying ... get something better instead like the exorcist , ... < br /><br />next = D < br /><br />oh the drama part in the beginning just and simply suxor =D
0 The movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level . By presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to the status of martyr for Christ . Somehow , according to the plot , god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it 's self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds . Yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer . The lead character , an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman , ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer . In other threads of the underdeveloped plot Jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of God . The modern lackluster incarnation of Christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well . He is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it 's self . Meanwhile , with little help from Jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty . I also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels . This movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that I could clearly interpret except to mock people 's beliefs . It raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer . It disregards the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment . Silly
0 < br /><br />Dull Demi , going thru the motions . Ditto Prochnow . Ominous portents that elicit yawns . Michael Biehn trying to be dynamic , which ai n't his shtick.<br /><br />To quote Buffy Summers , " If the apocalypse comes ... beep me." < br /><br />Going back to sleep now .
0 THE SEVENTH SIGN has a great opening hook as the Israeli defence force come across a terrorist base . This is the type of hook that is a must when writing a script , it grabs the reader / audience and the introduction of David Bannon as he rents a room from Abby and Russell Quinnn telegraphs the point that this is a man who`s not who he says he is . However after the great opening third I found the rest of the movie confusing and uninvolving with a large number of plotholes and isn`t all that different from umpteen other supernatural thrillers that I`ve seen
0 Really . Does any week go by that Oprah does n't remind us that she was abused as child?<br /><br />She makes herself the focus of every interview.<br /><br />Oprah can not resist commenting on the answer to every question she asks . She often interrupts guests before an answer is finished to interject her own aside or anecdote . Directors are obviously instructed to focus on her closeup reaction rather than guest 's faces because that 's what counts - what Oprah feels , what Oprah says.<br /><br />Oprah , Oprah , Oprah . It 's always all about Oprah.<br /><br />Oprah says - Feel sorry for me , I was so poor . Feel the pain of my battle with my weight . Feel my hurt when I 'm turned away from a fancy store after they 've already closed . Feel good for buying my magazines and books . Feel good for my success . Feel good when you give to my charity to make me look good . Feel good for making me rich beyond belief.<br /><br />My interpretation of her point of view : YOU VIEWERS ARE ALL DEEPLY FLAWED AND YOU NEED MY DAILY ADVICE . I have all the answers for your life though I have nothing in common with you plebes . I have never been married nor do I want to be . I have never had to raise a family - but I know all about it . I have little respect for men or marriage . I clearly prefer people like me over others - witness " Legends Ball 2006 " . Gayle is my best friend but we are not gay.<br /><br />As of 7/31/2006 , the heading on her website actually reads : " Oprah.com is your leading source for information about love , life , self , relationships , food , home , spirit and health . " How presumptive and obnoxious is that ? < br /><br />In June 2006 , she crashed two private wedding receptions in Oklahoma to gather footage for her September 2006 shows . She keeps promising to quit TV but her yapfest drags on with no end in sight.<br /><br />Contrary to what she thinks , Oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess nor on a personal mission from God . She 's just one very lucky , overweight , black woman who copied Phil Donahue 's style and called it her own . She happened to be in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to suck up to the right demographic . < br /><br />Oprah is the P.T. Barnum of this age and it amazes me that people can not see through her facade . < br /><br />So ladies and gentlemen , boys and girls and you too Oprah if you can fit that inflated ego through the door - This way now to the great egress ...
0 As the 2000 's came to a close , king Kong 's adopted daughter went ahead and made a tearful announcement her show as coming to an end.<br /><br />While Miss Winfrey was tearing up , i was laughing and screaming like a wild Indian from the old west.<br /><br />So what does Oprah do ? she takes famous people , and puts them on her show . what kind of famous people ? people who 've suffered ( just like her , except these people have lost more than their virginity ) they 've suffered melted faces ( true story ) , missing limbs ( True story , see end of paragraph ) , and spousal abuse ( too many to count ) . and somehow they come on the show and tell their story , as if we have n't heard it before tons and tons of times ( Bethany Hamilton , i 've heard your tale about losing an arm to a shark since day one , which was October 31st , 2003 . do n't tell me you have no hard feelings . ) But the biggest thing probably on Oprah was Michael Jackson 's interview in 1993 , after being accused of being a child molester . sadly , Mr. Jackson has since passed away . but that one particular show told about Michael 's personal life , something not many people knew about at the time.<br /><br />Oprah 's Real influence comes from middle aged women and soccer moms . They seem to think she 's like a personal Jesus sometimes . but all i see in Oprah is some big ghetto lady who made it big , and she 's just showing off how rich she is.<br /><br />I'm glad her shows going to end soon . we need better television programs .
0 Guy de Maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man , a poor man , without any moral qualities . He only wanted to success in a society where all the people , the politic men , the businessmen , the journalists , the women are corrupt . The only king is MONEY . The Maupassant hero , Charles Forestier is going higher and higher in the society scale thanks to his seduction poser . He is in love with all the women who could help him in his action to climb the society stapes . At the end of the novel , he married himself with the biggest daily paper owner 's daughter , in the greatest church of Paris : " La Madeleine " . " Le Tout Paris " is there . He has a fortune and more , he will become a member of Parliament and later a Minister . The " useless " women are out of his view , but he is always keeping in touch with the pretty and the usefull women . The picture " THE PRIVATE AFFAIRS OF BEL AMI " is a story of MORALITY . It is everything , but not a story in the Maupassant idea . Why had they put " BEL AMI " in its title ?
0 From the decrepit ranks of the already over - saturated ' Hillybilly Horror ' sub - genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks . Sound familiar ? Well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre . There is absolutely new here . The film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clichés ( deformed hicks , a peaceful family turned gun - toting killers when push comes to show , the rebellious daughter , the one ' freak ' who 's good at heart , etcetera ... ) , but does even that half - heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time . This is forgettable dreck , but humorously enough lead J.D. Hart once starred in a movie called " Films that Suck " earlier in his career , quite an ironic omen indeed.<br /><br />My Grade : D-
0 A family looking for some old roadside attractions to include in the father 's coffee - table book come across an ancient , decrepit old freak show run by an eccentric one - eyed man . When their family van breaks down upon leaving the sideshow , they 're forced to stay at a nearly abandoned fishing camp that was the site of a prison break decades prior.<br /><br />There have been many films in the ' freak ' subgenre of horror , ranging from Tod Browning 's beloved ' Freaks ' ( 1932 ) to Alex Winter 's hilarious ' Freaked ' ( 1993 ) . Those are both classics ( or soon - to - be with ' Freaked ' ) . ' Side Sho , ' however , never will be . And if it ever does reach classic status . . . well , it will be an obvious clue to the sad state of our genre . From the ridiculously bad opening song to the 17-year - old daughter that 's obviously older than her natural mother , this film did not have much going for it . The writing was subpar , but not completely awful . . . just boring . The direction was poor , and the rare freak effects were pretty horrendous and unbelievable . The acting was abysmal and the casting was even worse . Anyone who would believe the ages of these two camp - age teenagers must not have met a teenager in a long , long time . There was far from enough gore & violence to make up for the lack of any other quality . . . and when there was a bit of violence , it was not well done at all . And , I ca n't forget to mention the ending fight scenes which were , with all honesty , some of the worst I 've ever , ever seen in a film . Overall , this is an easily forgettable and poorly made horror film that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the dollar bin.<br /><br />Final verdict : 2.5/10 .
0 After 30 seconds , you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap knock - off . The story is taken from great movies like " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " and " Hills have Eyes " . I like those kind of movies , even if they 're duplicated well ( Wrong Turn , Timber Falls , Carver ) . < br /><br />But " Side Sho " is hard to watch : the actors are really bad , the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and totally misplaced . You do not care at all what happens to the characters . The so - called bad guys are also not interesting at all and rather stereotypical . So how about the blood and gore ? Well there is some , although it is rather cheap and the action is executed very poorly . 2 Points , just for the gore and blood but do understand that this is hardly worth a look , even for the gore - hounds ..
0 Yet ANOTHER movie about a group of less - than - intelligent individuals on a road trip who wander off their original travel route for either a short - cut or , in this case , to visit a run - down side show attraction . The results , as expected , are not at all good , as this particular side show is home to a bunch of lunatic , in - bred residents who were escaped prison inmates from years before . The father , who is apparently a professionally photographer , just HAS to stop and take pictures of the place , only to find that it still inhabited . The various members of the family wander off to view the various attractions , only to be scared away . Thinking they made it safely on their way , the van tire explodes ( surprise ! ) , leaving them to seek refuge and accommodations in the small town , which we find out is inhabited solely by the freaks ( surprise!).<br /><br />This film plays out as expected , with the family being stalked and killed by the freaks . There is some fighting back on the families part , but these are probably among the worst scenes in the film , as they are badly executed . There is nothing remotely original here , unless you count the totally inappropriate soundtrack that is played during particular scenes that completely ruins the atmosphere and mood of the film . The acting is about as bad as I have seen in quite some time by everyone involved ( it is pretty bad when your cast is out - acted by the cast of " Camp Blood ) . The special effects are lousy and the ending made me want to punch my television.<br /><br />Still , though , despite all the negatives , I somewhat enjoyed this film . It definitely has a " so bad it 's good " vibe to it . I made it through the entire movie and was even pleasantly entertained once I got past the ridiculously clichéd plot , terrible acting , and cheesy special effects . Though the ending left me feeling cheated and angry , particularly because the film is not that great to begin with and the ending makes the entire film pointless.<br /><br />Bottom line , I can list countless films that if you have seen them , you have seen this . The difference is most of those film are better . Though not a complete waste , this film is pretty bad and not remotely scary.<br /><br />My Grade : D
0 " Fred Claus " somehow avoids becoming this year 's " The Santa Clause " by at least having a bit more amusing moments than that Tim Allen starrer , but it does n't mean that it 's got enough going for it that 's worth a trip to the theater.<br /><br />As holiday movies go , it 's contrived and sentimental . But actually , that could be the least of one 's concern as " Fred Claus , " boasting of having David Dobkin ( " Shanghai Knights , " " The Wedding Crashers " ) at the helm , contains virtually nary a genuinely funny moment as it clumsily treads the line between a boorish Vince Vaughn vehicle and a fuzzy Christmas film . In the end , it amounts to not much of both . And with a cast that comprises of Paul Giamatti , Kevin Spacey , Rachel Weisz , and Kathy Bates , all the more it leaves one disappointed.<br /><br />Vaughn plays Fred , Nick 's ( Giamatti ) older and estranged brother , who once upon a time , left him and their parents ( Bates and Trevor Peacock ) after having had enough of enduring his parents ' favoritism of his younger sibling . Nick grows up to be Santa Claus ( and as the voice - over tells us , time freezes on you and your family when you become a saint ) , while Fred becomes a Yuletide - jaded repo man in Chicago who 's having a hard time remembering his girlfriend Wanda 's ( Weisz ) birthday.<br /><br />He runs in trouble with the law and had to call his younger brother ( who eerily looks at least a decade older than him ) to bail him out of jail . Nick agrees but only if Fred agrees to help out on the toy - wrapping business up in the North Pole . Fred reluctantly agrees but his cynicism clashes with Santa and the elves ' perpetually cheery nature , even as an efficiency expert ( Spacey ) is checking on the toy factory operations , only too happy to have the whole Arctic operations shut down if things fail.<br /><br />The film , as said , does have its moments , but the padded running length stretches them thin across its duration . In between are piles of Christmas film clichés that were handled better in , say , " Elf " and the attempts at sentimentality are as endearing as last year 's fruitcake.<br /><br />Vaugn , as usual , brings on his coarse charm to the table , but the neutered script of Dan Fogelman keeps him from REALLY doing his thing . Giamatti , underneath the bad fat suit , brings a jolly old charm to his iconic character , but unfortunately , has to play second fiddle to Fred . Spacey brings his game face , but his turns usually end as unfunnily vapid.<br /><br />Ultimately , " Fred Claus " becomes a forgettable film that falls below what those involved in it deserve . Sure , there are worse ways to start the season at the cinema , but there are certainly far better ways .
0 My Take : A tired formula Christmas comedy . The laughs are tired and the talents behind it seem to be too.<br /><br />I love the holidays as much as the next guy ( even if I often have a bad case of the holiday blues ) , but it seems it 's just being a dumping ground for a bunch of Holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year , but that does n't make them any less painful during the season . As if we already had enough SANTA CLAUSE movies ( three and * gulp * still counting ) , who wants to see a movie about his brother ? In a plot that would be at home with Disney 's SANTA CLAUSE franchise ( save the occasionally crude humor and Santa 's " Little " Helper wearing a short skirt ) , FRED CLAUS is a one - joke premise that goes on for 116 minutes . Sure , Jolly Ol' Saint Nick has a brother , but where does it go from there ? < br /><br />It 's a shame really . FRED CLAUS is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable Christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow , but it would have been so much better than this . Vince Vaughn is your typical snob , but we are led to believe he 's really the long lost brother of the never - aging Santa ( Paul Giamatti ) , who invites his good ol' brother to visit . Mrs. Claus ( Miranda Richardson ) is reluctant , and worse , an efficiency expert ( Kevin Spacey ) has come to keep a watchful eye on Father Christmas , and his THIS close to being shut down . Hah ! And guess who plays Santa 's mother ! Kathy Bates of course . Elizabeth Banks is Santa 's Helper Charlene , John Michael Higgins is one of the elves , and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred 's girlfriend ! SI do n't know if I 'd praise the casting or to bash it . Here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality , but they 're given way too little to work with.<br /><br />As for humor , the best that FRED CLAUS could possibly come up with is Santa 's brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a DJ elf . I have to admit I had a few giggles involving Fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers ( where he is joined by Stephen Baldwin , Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone ) , but the giggles begin and end there . Worse still , the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that 's supposed to make us " feel good " and teach us a lesson about " what Christmas really means " . Apparently , what Christmas means to Hollywood is getting as much of our leftover Christmas shopping money as they can.<br /><br />Rating : * * out of 5 .
0 It 's always tough having a sibling doing better in their life than you , always a struggle to get out from under that shadow and not let bitterness keep you away from your family . So , imagine that your older brother is Santa and then imagine how tough that must be . That 's the premise here.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn plays the titular Fred , an embittered loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people do n't go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother , Santa ( played by Paul Giamatti ) , too much praise for simply being the limelight - hogging , fame - hungry , slightly creepy guy that Fred would want to portray him as . Then , would n't you know it , Fred needs a financial favour and so has to make up for it by helping his brother on the run up to Christmas . And hilarity and life lessons ensue.<br /><br />Well , that 's what should happen . The reality is that we get a Christmas movie featuring a few good moments of Vaughn 's patented fast - talking , a ridiculously out - of - nowhere music video moment , Kevin Spacey playing an auditor out to close down Santa 's operation ( and he 's one of the weakest baddies I have seen in some time ) , not enough of the gorgeous Elizabeth Banks in a lush Christmas outfit , too much of John Michael Higgins in his elf outfit ( to be fair , he 's a highlight though ) and a movie that 's too swimming in bitterness to feel like good seasonal fare yet too schmaltzy in it 's latter half to feel like a fun poke at all the bad things about the commercialism of the time.<br /><br />Rachel Weisz is along for the ride too , as is Kathy Bates , but it 's really nothing more than a movie for Vaughn and if you like his style you will find something to enjoy here . Unfortunately , there 's very little else to recommend this seasonal stinker . Outside of Vaughn 's rantings the script barely throws up anything decent with the exception of one particularly good scene involving a hilarious support group dealing with a very specific problem.<br /><br />David Dobkin 's direction is as mediocre and staid as the 20p Christmas card that you send the auntie you have n't seen in 10 years and he seems to think that simply putting the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care taken will guarantee a delicious Christmas pudding . Nope , we get a burnt , bland lump with too much sugar on top . Forget this and stick the hilarious Elf on again if you want a great , modern Christmas comedy.<br /><br />See this if you like : The Santa Clause 2 , Santa Baby , The Santa Clause 3 : The Escape Clause .
0 The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is its conceit that if one becomes a saint , he or she and his or her family and his or her significant other live forever . Let 's forget that in order to become a saint , the saint must be dead , and saints do n't have significant others . That , for a millennium , Nick has been the Jolly Elf to Fred 's Scrooge is never even hinted at ! Open on Nick learning how to make toys , then on Fred learning how to run numbers ; Nick giving a sick child a dolly , Fred repossessing the dolly , along with the family farm ! After a few more such episodes , morph to present - day Fred venting his spleen at Siblings Anonymous as his fellow losers nod in empathy . There , I just wrote a more cohesive storyline than this idiocy!<br /><br />This Santa , who is one " ho , ho , ho , ho , ho " away from a massive coronary , is a neurotic wuss saddled with the Queen of the Harpies , an operation straight out of Mega - Mall Hell , and answers to a Board ( huh ? ) which just gave the Easter Bunny his pink egg . Oh , and his right - hand man is a ditzy blonde in a skin - tight mini - dress and go - go boots . Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho!<br /><br />But what really sent me over the edge was Slam being named # 1 on the Naughty List . Should n't a Naughty List be reserved for the future Hitlers and Stalins ? Children who are the true embodiments of evil ? Nope , to Old Sausage - Fingers , a good boy who lashes out because he is unwanted and unloved is the Demon Seed!<br /><br />The nimrods behind Fred Claus should be boiled in their own pudding ! Bah !
0 I went into this movie expecting it to be really god - awful . And it was . I really felt sorry for the star - studded cast- Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress ... before she made this movie- Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointing as usual but Miranda Richardson could n't put in one of the fabulous performances I know and love her for . Fred 's dad , played by Trevor Peacock ( of Vicar of Dibley fame , amongst others ) , had about one line.<br /><br />The plot was predictable and all over the place , and the humour was ... lacking . ( However , there was one part of the movie where Santa enters the house of a Jewish family ... that made me laugh just because their expressions were classic ) Do n't see this movie unless your only other alternative is having a head - on collision with a train ( actually- maybe the train would be better ... )
0 Did anyone read the script . This has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year . Three great actors , Paul Giamatti , Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson could n't pull this one out . About two - thirds it looked like Giamatti eyes were saying , I ca n't believe I signed the contract . It 's not the worst movie I ever saw , but it 's on the really really bad Christmas movie list . Not enough lines , but what else can be said ? Okay , the movie just does n't move with Vaughn 's con - man dialogue , his character is just a creepy guy that you just ca n't get past . It was just a lackluster walk through , that no one seemed to be able to get into .
0 Oh my . I decided to go out to the cinemas with some friends , wanting to watch one of those mild , feel - good Christmas movies , and I walk out disgusted . The movie failed . Full - stop . Paul Giamatti who I consider as a good actor played his character and roll just horribly , along with Vince Vaughn who has always been a personal favourite of mine . They try and turn a Christmas movie , into some new - style . Sort of bad , mixed with good , but it all turned out very wrong . The first ten or so minutes were n't too bad , but once we saw Santa , it was over . It did n't get any better , the rate stayed the same , there was NO character development , and certainly is one of the worst Christmas movies ever invented . Do n't watch it , whatever you do .
0 This is almost like two films -- one literate and engaging , the other stupid and clichéd . It 's really a shame all the problems were n't worked out with the writing , but considering how quickly most B - movies were written and produced , this is n't too unusual . It 's a real shame , though , as this could have been a very good film.<br /><br />First the good . The movie is original and involves WWII code - breakers . This is pretty fascinating and I liked watching the leading man ( Lee Bowman ) go through his paces as a master code - breaker . In fact , the first two - thirds of the film was very good . But now for the bad , the film just went on way too long and lost steam at about 50 minutes . Additionally , Jean Rogers ' role as the " kooky girlfriend " must rank as one of the worst - written and distracting roles in film history ! ! For every smart move made by Bowman , the idiot Rogers then stepped in to screw things up as some sort of misguided " comedy relief " . If her role had been intelligently written , the overall film would have improved immensely ! Instead , watching her , it 's hard to understand how we actually won WWII ! !
0 This is a rather tame fluff piece concerning WW II codes being broken , stolen , etc . The acting is about what I expected from this cast of MGM " B " actors.<br /><br />One big caution . Jean Rogers , who did such a great job playing the very sexy Dale Arden in the first two Flash Gordon serials is just awful in this movie . Her character is extremely annoying . She absolutely never lets - up with her overacting . We are supposed to believe that during the height of a World War in what would obviously be a Top Secret code facility , she would be allowed to just pop in and out of any office of her choosing although she has no official function . From that standpoint I 'm sorry that I ever watched this film . It has forever changed my perception of Ms. Rogers . Talentwise , she is an extreme lightweight.<br /><br />Lee Bowman is his usual self , meaning that he is merely adequate.<br /><br / >
0 Ludicrous violations of the most basic security regs are only the beginning . It 's hard to see how they achieved such abysmal trash on such a low budget . I turned it off once , then got curious to see if it could get any worse . It did .
0 I went to see this movie ( actually I went to see Family Portraits , which contains Cutting Moments + 2 other short films by Douglas Buck ) at the Mar del Plata festival ( Argentina ) ... I just could n't watch it ! I had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of Cutting Moments and take a peek every once in a while . By the time it was over , my stomach was upside down and I felt light headed . I just HAD to leave the cinema a few minutes after the 2nd short begun ( BTW , of course I was not the only one who left the room ) . It was WAAAAY too violent and disgusting for me ! I am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it . I just do n't get how you can love that kind of movies ! The shocking and bloody and horrible images I saw got really stuck in my head for like two days ! ! I also try to analyze the story ( my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it ) and I just do n't think it makes any sense . I mean , that amount of violence and stuff , makes no other sense than to try to shock people . And that 's not a good enough reason , I think . There 's absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say " Well , at least ' x ' thing about it was good " . But well , I guess I will never understand that kind of films .
0 The reason the DVD releases of this film are in black and white is because nobody can get their hands on a color print of this public domain film , a modest sea story at best.<br /><br />Distributed for television thru Allied Artists , DVD 's ( or VHS ) on the market at this time for this title are all coming from the same 16MM television print . Films distributed for television prior to 1963 were often distributed in b / w prints , because the bulk of viewers did not have color sets anyway . Striking b / w prints for television was also cheaper , as it often involved quite a few prints to cover all stations running a film on a syndicated basis .

" Manfish " is the name of their boat , not a monster . The skeleton who gives muscular Captain John Bromfield ( as Brannigan ) his half of the treasure map is very good . Old salt Victor Jory ( as Professor ) provides the other half of the map .

0 Have you ever sat watching a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have gone by and suddenly you realize that you have actually seen the movie before ? That happened to me with " The Young Graduates " . The cover of the video box , if you can find the video , is extremely deceiving . I 'd swear that the two women on the cover are n't even in the film.<br /><br />Anyway , I was either born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points of this film or ... it is simply pointless junk . I 'm heavily leaning toward the latter but I guess some out there have developed a connection to this movie.<br /><br />Hmm ... plot . A plot . Let 's see ... there must be a plot around here somewhere . Nope , I ca n't find it . It 's pretty much about some high school seniors acting dopey and doing drugs and speaking in a language that became outdated decades ago . One of the female students has a crush on her teacher . The teacher has a frigid wife ( whom he indeed refers to as an iceberg ) so he is receptive to the girl 's advances.<br /><br />There 's a lot of driving around and inane dialogue and plenty of spastic dancing . Our cat , BooBoo , was transfixed by the dancing high school kids . She watched with amazing intensity as the dancers gyrated and shook out on the dance floor . It 's nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic . 1/10
0 90 minutes of Mindy ... Mindy is a tease to boyfriend Bill ... Mindy prances at the high school dance ... Mindy hitchhikes to Big Sur , shoplifts a loaf of " shepherd 's bread , " Mindy nearly gets gang - raped ... Ah , the pleasures of Crown International drive - in features . You must remember that these films were never designed to be watched start to finish on DVD players . They were made as 90 minutes of ambiance so the teens of the 70s would have a soundtrack as they got it on in their Pintos and Citations . The lack of pacing and structure did n't matter to the original audience -- they probably only tuned in when the T & A on screen matched what they were up to , out in the parking lot . The film is really irritating when watched as a story . It 's a lot more fun to talk about it than watch it . My favorite inanities : 1 ) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy . With no luggage or change of underwear , they spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher , just like in real life . 2)After being abducted and nearly raped by depraved bikers , and after their innocent friend " Pan " is savagely beaten , Mindy and her girlfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road . Mindy immediately brightens up and chirps , " I 'm going ' to Big Sur ! ! " But again , it 's a lot more fun to talk / read about than sit through .
0 I watched this film last night with anticipation , but really was n't very impressed.<br /><br />With the exception of ' Combo ' , I thought the acting was poor and the narrative was limited . It came across like a ' made for TV ' drama.<br /><br />I felt that the film was very contrived . The whole set up of hammering in the context at the start ( yes , we get that this is 80s Britain - you can stop now ) was tiresome , and gave a very one - sided view of what life was like in 80s Britain - poverty , war juxtaposed with royalty , Margaret Thatcher , yet nothing in between ? There were actually middle - classes who existed back then - just ordinary working people , with a decent wage and a mortgage . The Falklands clips also seemed to be added randomly towards the end , for ' dramatic effect ' , I presume.<br /><br />The sequence of events felt a tad disjointed , as the characters moved one one action to the next without us seeing how their mindset could 've changed so quickly.<br /><br />The relationship between ' Shaun ' and ' Smell ' was toe - curling . I could n't even look during the snogging scene . I find it very hard to believe that she would 've been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger , but also looked so much younger . I know there were only four years between them , but four years is nothing once you reach your twenties , yet it 's a huge difference in your teens ! In my experience , that kind of teen age difference only occurs when the girl is the younger one , since girls mature so much quicker , and are more on the wavelength of boys a few years older . Sorry , but I did n't buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for shock value.<br /><br />The ending was somewhat abrupt and , again , contrived . If the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic , then it fell somewhat short in my eyes.<br /><br />It bugs me that British films only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the poverty - stricken . Do n't get me wrong , I love Trainspotting , and Four Weddings has its charms , but ca n't we Brits come up with anything different ? Why are our films always so hung up on the class system ? I was born in 1973 , so was n't much different in age to ' Shaun ' would 've been in 1983 . I grew up in a single parent family on a fairly down - trodden council estate in a city in England . However , my childhood experiences were vastly different to those portrayed in the film - I do n't even remember racism being an issue ( although i 'm not saying it did n't exist ) . ' This is England ' ? Not in my experience.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I felt this film lacked substance , and I was completely bored and unimpressed throughout .
0 The mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80 's well with some good performances.<br /><br />However ..... < br /><br />The script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where I expect it was intended to be edgy . The characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichés that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front . The biggest problem is this movie has no real story . It ticks all the right " arty " boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was.<br /><br />Very disappointing
0 The title of this obscure and ( almost righteously ) forgotten 80 's slasher inevitably reminds me of The Cure 's mega - smash - monster hit song with the same title , hence a piece of the lyrics in the title - section of this user comment . Also , I did n't have anything else to say that was useful , anyway . But hey , " The Forest " is n't totally hopeless and not even * that * bad , actually . If nothing else , at least it obeys the , admittedly unwritten , first rule of 80 's slasher : kill someone within the first 10 minutes of playtime . Sure you 've heard about the basic premise of this film a dozen times before , but do n't let that discourage you from watching it , as " The Forest " has a couple of things more to offer than just an appealingly sinister cover image . It 's actually a bit of an atypical 80 's slasher ! The main characters are n't ordinary brainless teenagers and the script has solid ambitions towards supernaturalism . The concept is n't always successful , let alone plausible , but it 's more than interesting enough to hold your attention and there are even are a couple of surprisingly strong moments of tension and plot twists to enjoy . Two married couples decide to go camping in the most isolated woods of California , but due to a stupid bet the wives travel separately from their husbands . Barely set up for the night , they receive uncanny visits from a mother looking for her two children , the children themselves and finally the father who 's out hunting for human flesh . The demented family may be real or imaginary , but the women are definitely in danger and by the time their husbands arrive , they have already vanished . The men too encounter the family , and they find out more about the slightly dysfunction background . " The Forest " is a weird and unusual film , to say the least . It 's not exactly a masterpiece of plotting , but the thoroughly strange atmosphere will certainly appeal to open - minded fans of 80 's horror . The murders are fairly gruesome and will - filmed , including a slit throat and a painful saw - massacre , and the filming locations are stunningly beautiful . The more you contemplate about the story and its abrupt twists , the less it makes any sense , so my advice would just be to enjoy this odd viewing experience for as long as it lasts and not a minute longer . The acting performances are just above average , the music is okay and at least director Donald Jones ( also responsible for the 70 's exploitation - sickie " Schoolgirls in Chains " ) tried to be a little more creative that the majority of 80 's horror films . Too bad it ultimately fails .
0 One of the most boring slashers ever .. If you can even call it that . I would n't watch this if it even ended up being some kind of porno movie , which it completely resembles . The fact that you 're watching a small group of middle - aged people in the woods is really unbearable . They made these kinds of movies for teens , so who were they really aiming for when they made this sleep - fest ? My favorite part of this movie is the cover art and it 's the only reason I chose to seek out this movie , which happened to be part of a Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack .. and after seeing the other movies in this 50 pack , you 'll realize that it belongs nowhere else . So if you 're in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods , I recommend Just Before Dawn and The Final Terror .
0 A cannibalistic backwoods killer is on the prowl and two bickering couples might be his next source of protein in this bargain basement Friday the 13th - clone cheapie . There s literally nothing of interest to see in this one , the killings are surprisingly sparse and when they do happen , completely amateurish . It also adds ghosts into the mix for no reason what so ever . I felt drained after watching it as if my brain was liquefying and draining out my nose . And it remains without a doubt Donald Jones ' worst movie . If you 're thinking of renting it because of Code Red 's snazzy new DVD re - release Do n't bother < br /><br />My Grade : F
0 I mean of all the obscure , overlooked , low budget horror movies waiting to be re - discovered in a DVD release , why pick THE FOREST ? I love ultra low budget direct to home video or other alternative release horror . I love 80s hacker horror . I love backwoods slashers with fools wandering off into the night to be chased , murdered and eaten by psychopaths . I am all for the idea of non - professionals working on a horror movie as a way to maybe break into the industry or just making a movie because they want to make one . I am all for using found public locations , non - actors , no name talent behind the camera and in the studio . NO PROBLEM ! The most evocative image from THE FOREST is it 's opening shot of a couple walking in the distance across a forest into the woods : We see them as tiny , vulnerable creatures entering a dank gloomy world where humans may not be the top of the food chain or most feared predator . Then the film takes a dive & never recovers -- we briefly meet the backpacking couple just as they realize that they are being stalked . They get separated , both are butchered , and then we meet the movie 's protagonists as they drive their car in a traffic jam . They meet up with their respective mates and decide to take a camping trip . Sounds of snoring fill the room as people who came over to watch a movie fiddle with their cell phones text messaging people not there telling them how much the movie sucks.<br /><br />This film is too slow , this movie is too boring , and this movie is too talky . Which would n't be such a bad thing if the writers had given the people something to say other than the most stupid , asinine and unnecessary things . You know your horror movie is in trouble when the character with the most interesting lines is the droopy - faced park ranger who warns everyone away from the Cannibal Woods . And speaking of these " woods " they look about as far away from civilization as the overgrown vacant lot behind the soccer fields , only with bigger rocks and a stream flowing through it . There are impressive shots of the forest primeval , but no real sense of being out in the middle of it . If any one of the characters just sat down on the trail and waited long enough someone would amble by.<br /><br />What is worse about the film is that it fails to generate any human interest : I do n't know who these couples are and do n't care what happens to them . The hermit cannibal slasher guy is uninteresting even when pretending to saw freshly cooked meat off the leg of one of his victims to serve grisly bites to her boyfriend , who just happens to seek shelter in his cave . The irony of which is the epitome of " underwhelming " . Coupled with a deliberately ominous synthesizer music score , cinematography that suspiciously looks like someone strapped a camera on a dog and it follow people 's movements , a lack of appreciable gore , nudity , lurid thrills and unwholesome atmosphere and what we have here is a horror movie that is n't even as frightening as a PBS educational TV show about how magnets work.<br /><br />I do n't mean to " dish it out " to the people behind this film , since they obviously went into the project with next to nothing , did not push themselves to be creative and ended up with just another boring movie about some maggot chasing women through the woods with a knife . There is nothing wrong with that concept , what is wrong is the unimaginative and utterly pedestrian way this was executed , right down to the utterly pointless conclusion when the film simply peters out at about the 80 minute mark . The best thing that you can say about THE FOREST is that it is over relatively quickly and there is n't much to command a repeat screening -- Hence my confusion at why anyone would feel the need for a DVD release . It was fine as a Prism Video rental years oddity , as a DVD it will be $ 5.99 rack fare inside a month of hitting the shelves . There is little or no urgency to see the film , unless you are considering making your own ultra low budget backwoods hacker set in a public park where nobody can charge you money for filming there . Here is a guide of steps to avoid making.<br /><br />With all that said and done , the film did have one interesting sequence , or rather one sequence that was so pathetic and ineptly thought out that it becomes an enigma in an otherwise cut & dried film : The madman comes home to find his wife in bed with the local contractor . He dispatches his beloved , arms himself with a kitchen knife that looks like it was made just to be used in a horror film and takes off after the interloper . The guy corners and attacks his quarry , who sidesteps & runs away , only to have the psycho materialize in his footsteps with a bigger , badder weapon . The psycho attacks again , and the guy gets away . The psycho materializes AGAIN , and once more the guy gets away . Then AGAIN ! Finally on the fifth try the psycho trips the dude so to fall on some sort of a bladed contraption . How did he keep materializing armed with bigger badder weapons like that ? Is there some supernatural element to this psycho ? Since the film never makes it clear either way the scene is just an enigma , staged to build some tension . It 's purpose remains unclear . The whole film is like that really , existing without any need to be made and executed in such a ham - fisted , uninteresting manner that one can not help but wonder what the point of it was.<br /><br />3/10 , and ample evidence that just because you can release a movie on DVD that does n't mean you necessarily should .
0 A friend and I went through a phase some ( alot of ) years ago of selecting the crappest horror films in the video shop for an evening 's entertainment . For some reason , I ended up buying this one ( probably v. v. cheap).<br /><br />The cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre . There 's also a few very amusing scenes . Among them is a scene where a man 's being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects , it made me laugh at the time ( does n't seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you go).<br /><br />Apart from that it 's total crap , mind you . But probably worth a watch if you like films like " Chopping Mall " . Yes , I 've seen that too .
0 The movie starts with a pair of campers , a man and a woman presumably together , hiking alone in the vast wilderness . Sure enough the man hears something and it pangs him so much he goes to investigate it . Our killer greets him with a stab to the stomach . He then chases the girl and slashes her throat . The camera during the opening scene is from the point of view as the killer.<br /><br />We next meet our four main characters , two couples , one in which is on the rocks . The men joke about how the woman would never be able to handle camping alone at a double date , sparking the token blonde 's ambition to leave a week early . Unexpectedly , the men leave the same day and their car breaks down .. They end up arriving in the evening . When the men arrive , they are warned about people disappearing in the forest by a crazy Ralph doppleganger . They ignore the warning and venture into the blackening night and an eighties song plays in the background with lyrics about being murdered in the dark forest . The men get lost.<br /><br />In the next scene we realize that this is n't just another The Burning clone , but a ghost story ! The women , scared and lonely are huddling together by the fire . Two children appear in the shadows and decide to play peeping Tom . Well they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices echo ! Their mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if they 've seen her children , before disappearing of course . < br /><br />The children run home to papa and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river . This causes quite a stir and he gets up , grabbing his knife from atop the fireplace . " Daddy 's going hunting , " The little girl , exclaims with bad acting . It is apparent here , that the dad is n't a ghost like his children.<br /><br />Freaked out by something in the woods , the token blonde splits , running blindly into the night , carrying a knife . She encounters the father who explains he 's starving and it will be quick . This does n't make sense because of the panther growls we heard earlier ( Maybe he 's allergic ! Are panthers honestly even in California ? ) She ends up wounding him slightly before getting stabbed in the head . A thunderstorm erupts and the men seek shelter , which turns out to be where papa resides . Clearly someone lives here because there 's a fire and something weird is roasting over it . The children appear and warn them of papa , who shows up moments later . They disappear as soon as he arrives.<br /><br />For whatever reason , our killer only goes after females . He invites the men to have something to eat and tells us the story about his ex wife . We are given a flashback of his wife getting caught cheating . The old man does n't tell them however that he kills her and her lover afterwards , but daydreams about it . We are n't given the reason for the children 's demise . The men go to sleep and are left unharmed . The next morning the men discover the empty campground of their wives . After a brief discussion they split up . One is to stay at the campsite , while the other goes and gets help . The one that is going back to his car breaks his leg . We are then reunited with the children as they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves from being sad about their mother . They agree to help the woman reunite with her friends < br /><br />The following scene defies the logic of the movie when papa kills the guy waiting at the campsite . He was also dating or married to the blonde . Somehow the children realize he is murdered and tell the woman about it . She decides to see it for herself and obviously runs into the killer . Luckily the children make him stop by threatening to leave him forever . You know where this is going.<br /><br />Overall the movie deserves four stars out of ten , and that 's being generous . For all its misgivings , the musical score is well done . It 's still watchable too . There are some camera angles that look professional , and some of the sets are done well . The plot is unbelievable . There is such a thing as willing suspension of disbelief , but with the toad 6 miles away ; I ca n't imagine the token blonde would take off like that in the middle of the night . I mean , come on!<br /><br />- Alan " Skip " Bannacheck
0 A truly disturbed , cannibalistic psychopath , John(Gary Kent , under the pseudonym Michael Brody ) who lives in a cave , stalks campers who make the unfortunate mistake of backpacking in his wilderness . Steve(Dean Russell)and his buddy Charlie(John Batis)get into a playful argument with their wives , Sharon(Tomi Barrett , the late real - life wife of Gary Kent ) ) & Teddi(Ann Wilkinson)over surviving in the woods camping by themselves . To prove a point , the gals decide to head for the wilderness out of Los Angeles for a camping trip disturbing their partners to the point that they soon follow afterward . Falling prey to John , Teddi is soon killed as Sharon runs for her life as the men arrive late to the wilderness due to their truck 's overheating . Afraid , tired , and paranoid , Sharon receives some very unusual assistance .. John 's ghost children ! That 's right , John 's children remain in the wilderness , ghostly apparitions which spy on those who exist in the woods , taking a special liking to Sharon , helping guide her to safety and her friends . Meanwhile , Steve and Charlie soon find shelter from a down pour and the darkness of night in the very cave where John lives . Cooking over a burning fire , the meat simmering is actually from Charlie 's wife , Teddi ! Unknowingly Charlie eats from the meat when offered by John who finds the outsiders inside his dwelling place ! Anyway , soon , worried about their wives , Steve and Charlie set out to find them as morning breaks . Meanwhile , John goes a hunting , with Charlie , Steve , and Sharon in a fight for survival . When Steve suffers a compound fracture stumbling between two massive rocks over a flowing river , he will be handicapped only increasing such an already nightmare scenario , with Sharon following her ghostly young friends to potential safety .. they even , at one point , plead with their father to not kill her . Charlie , unfortunately , does n't have such friends.<br /><br />Director Donald Jones( .. who also wrote it and went broke funding the film)smartly shoots the film in such a breathtaking , gorgeous location in the Sequoia National Park , in California , where those gargantuan trees tower to great heights , and I basically watch backwoods slashers for this very purpose . For some strange reason , I did n't particularly find Jones ' direction of the setting very atmospheric .. the dread was missing , although there are some rather disturbing attacks by John using his knife( .. shot in a clever way , Jones ' camera suggests more than what is actually on screen , yet , somehow , still achieves that gasp at what John is doing to victims ) . Within such a picturesque landscape , to see innocents preyed upon by a maniac , that kind of increases the terror . City folk attempting to spend a nice few days in a different place , to smell the clean , fresh air , enjoy the sights of a lovely view , only to find themselves stalked by a creepy predator with a very intimidating knife . Providing the back - story to why John is the monster he is , Jones allows us to witness his memory flashback in discovering his wife 's adultery and reacting accordingly( .. she is also a ghost in the wilderness looking for her children , wishing to punish them for " being naughty")killing both her and the lover in bed( .. a refrigerator repairman ) . The children , sad and depressed committed suicide and now " haunt " the wilderness , still interacting with their pa or whoever they so choose . I realize such a novelty as ghost children in a backwoods slasher is unique and appreciated by some , but I found the idea rather hokey and too silly to take serious . They do help our heroine escape a few potentially dangerous situations , but it was awfully hard for me to keep from giggling uncontrollably . The music I found hideously 80 's and the performances are n't mind - blowing . I mean I could react to the situation they were in , because it is indeed quite terrifying to find yourselves in an unfamiliar and hostile territory being hunted by someone who knows the area so well . I think the film is similar in many ways to DON'T GO INTO THE WOODS .. ALONE ! , except that THE FOREST has the aforementioned ghost children( .. their voices echo when talking to Sharon , their father , or each other ) . Gary Kent looks like a filthy George Lucas , with tattered clothes , and humanity lost . As I mentioned above , the violence is n't as grisly as what is suggested because director Jones is able to effectively cut away from a great deal of knife penetration , yet the way he stages the set pieces leave you rather unsettled( .. such as Teddi 's murder , the violence mostly silhouetted on the surface of a nearby huge stone formation , her pleas for John to stop and , once stabbed several times , attempts to crawl away from her predator only to be finished off;a hanging corpse John is skinning ) . I 've seen better and worse of this type of slasher film , it 's rather mediocre , at best , with some effectively shot scenery . I do n't really think it 's particularly memorable , for the exception of the ghost children .
0 The Forest is n't just your everyday standard slasher / backwoods cannibal fare , it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well . The story is about two couples that hike into the forest on a camping trip . A cave dwelling , cannibalistic woodsmen and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorize them . There is something you do n't see every slasher . Director Don Jones gets an " A " for effort although the film itself falls flat on just about every level , the acting is just simply average except for Jeanette Kelly who plays the dead wife of the woodsman ( Michael Brody aka Gary Kent).<br /><br />The film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple hiking through a valley and into a forest . They realize too late that someone is stalking them . They are both dispatched in typical slasher fare . Our killer uses a trusty hunting knife throughout the entire film , except during a flashback when he implements a handsaw , pitchfork and rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wife 's lover.<br /><br />The Forest has a good story line but the movie just does n't work along with it I found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting . 4/10
0 I sought out a copy of The Forest because I was watching a VH1 special , I think " Where Are They Now " , and saw the video box flash across the screen during a segment on the actor Corky Pigeon . He played the male child ghost in this B horror horrible , but I remember him from his character Freddy on the Silver Spoons television show . This flick 's a major letdown . There 's nothing here . It actually took me four months to watch it from start to finish . I kept stopping it in boredom , setting it aside and forgetting about it , then stumbling on it and trying once again to get through it . Obviously , the angle of this film that was intended to set it apart from its counterparts was the supernatural element , the apparitions . And obviously , here , that does n't work . I ca n't stand the male leads . I kept expecting them to look down at their palms during the longer dialogue scenes in order to read cheat lines . The situation at the beginning where the couples decide to go camping separately is awkward and plain dumb . I guess the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg , you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh . It 's fairly good gore makeup there . Man , I 'm really reaching for a positive now , huh . The only other no - budget horror film on a level as bad as this one would be Home Sweet Home .
0 It 's a ghost story . It 's a cannibalism story . It 's a revenge story . It 's a very poorly done film with a lot of violence . I suppose it follows cheaply along the lines of every slasher movie you 've ever seen . It has the usual isolated place , the cocky campers , heading off to the wilderness . Granted , there are some pretty intense scenes . It 's just so dull . Bad editing and the whole works . There are ghost children who sound like they are talking into a wastebasket . I 'm not really sure what rules the ghosts and the psycho with the seed cap are playing by . It also has the gross out scene where a man eats a piece of meat which is actually what 's left of his wife . A friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous , sick violence . I fear that it 's just another step in our desensitized evolution . Three is no cleverness here , no tongue in cheek , only a sad waste of time . Lots of blood ; little plot .
0 I saw this movie at an actual movie theater ( probably the $ 2.00 one ) with my cousin and uncle . We were around 11 and 12 , I guess , and really into scary movies . I remember being so excited to see it because my cool uncle let us pick the movie ( and we probably never got to do that again ! ) and sooo disappointed afterwards ! ! Just boring and not scary . The only redeeming thing I can remember was Corky Pigeon from Silver Spoons , and that was n't all that great , just someone I recognized . I 've seen bad movies before and this one has always stuck out in my mind as the worst . This was from what I can recall , one of the most boring , non - scary , waste of our collective $ 6 , and a waste of film . I have read some of the reviews that say it is worth a watch and I say , " Too each his own " , but I would n't even bother . Not even so bad it 's good .
0 I agree with everything people said on this one but I must add that the soundtrack is probably the WORST one I have ever heard my entire life ! There are actual vocals during times when you are supposed to be listening to the actors talk ! And the vocals are like a broadway version of Danzig singing , " The darkness of the forest ! Oh the darkness of the dark , dark forest ! " or something else so unthreatening . The singer has a terrible vibrato and has been recorded with a treble - y microphone over some synthed - up string section and fake drum beats . It 's horrible ! ! < br /><br />Yes , the male leads are awful . So are the female ones . This is one bad case of gender stereotyping - it 's so bad ! Everything they say revolves around being a male or a female , just playing up the stereotypes to the max . Makes me sick . Soooo boring ! ! ! < br /><br />The children were so echoey in their lines , you could n't understand them . And why do female ghost children always wear cute little bows in their hair , pretty blue dresses and long hair ? And ghost boys always wear clean cut slacks with cute little shiny blond hair ? Not scary - STUPID.<br /><br />Daddy 's face was way too blemish free and clean to be that of a man living in a cave . Nice beard and bangs , pa . Did you perfectly cut those with a knife yourself or did you stroll into town and go to the salon?<br /><br />Stupid movie .
0 Your attitude going into Prom Night II will determine how much joy you take away from the film . If you 're expecting a horror masterpiece , look elsewhere . If you like campy movies that are rather fun to watch unfold , you 'll like this . Lisa Schrage has the time of her life playing an over the top Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd channels Schrage 's rage perfectly during her time " possessed".<br /><br />Not classic cinema but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with a wicked ending.<br /><br / >
0 Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957.<br /><br />Well , the movie mainly takes place in 1986 . The movie falls into the 80 's trap of weird / stupid special effects , including some weird demented looking rocking horse.<br /><br />Anyway , Mary Lou 's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person 's body . Whether or not she succeeds , you 'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />Anyway , the movie is largely boring and based around a bunch of worthless characters . This also is n't really a sequel , the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school . It has the avg . horror flick fall backs , gore , pointless nudity , knocks against the catholic church . Basic stuff , boring movie.<br /><br />The acting is decent enough to give it a 3 out of 10 . You can waste your time doing something else .
0 and not in a fun - to - watch way . it 's just bad . it 's shocking that people have posted positive things about it here . the story sucks , the acting is bad , it 's not scary , the special effects are n't special -- oh no ! the blackboard has hands coming out of it ! oh gee -- the mirror turned into water ! the hair , clothes and makeup in the ' 50s scenes are n't accurate , and they got a middle - aged man with a receding hairline to play the high - school version of himself . this is like later - on nightmare on elm street stuff . i enjoy sitting down to watch a cheesy horror movie as much as anyone else , but there are better bad ones out there to choose from .
0 This is only related to the first movie by the name . The plot has nothing to do with the first and the whole movie stinks ! ! ! I have no idea what they were thinking but this movie is so bad . Avoid this at all costs , the first movie in the series is acceptable as a slasher flick and so is the fourth but this one and the 3rd are rubbish ! !
0 What is the point of creating sequels that have absolutely no relevance to the original film ? No point . This is why the Prom Night sequels are so embarrassingly bad.<br /><br />The original film entailed a group of children hiding a dark secret that eventually get them all killed , bar one , in a brutal act of revenge . Can someone please explain to me what a dead prom queen - to - be rising from the grave to steel the crown has to do with the first movie then ? Prom Night 2 had continuous plot holes that left the audience constantly wondering how did that happen and why should that happen ? But in the end , i guess you could call it one of those movies that is so bad , you end up laughing yourself through it .
0 Hello Mary Lou : Prom Night II starts at the Hamilton High School prom of 1957 where Mary Lou Maloney ( Lisa Schrage ) is cheating on her date Bill Nordham ( Steve Atkinson ) with Bud Cooper ( Robert Lewis ) . Bill finds out & is devastated , meanwhile Mary Lou is announced prom queen 1957 & takes to the stage to accept her award . Bill , still hurting , decides to play a practical joke on Mary Lou so he throws a firecracker on stage but the still lit fuse catches Mary Lou 's dress setting it & her on fire , within seconds Mary Lou is toast . 30 years later & Hamilton High is soon to hold it 's annual prom night . Bill ( Micheal Ironside ) is now the principal & has a teenage son named Craig ( Justin Louis ) who is dating Vicki Carpenter ( Wendy Lyon ) & are both planning on going to the prom together . Bud ( Richard Monette ) is now a priest , that terrible night 30 years ago still haunt both Bill & Bud . One day Vicki is looking around the schools basement when she discovers a large trunk which she opens , this turns out to be a bad move as the vengeful spirit of Mary Lou is set free & is intent on claiming her crown as prom queen & in her spare time sets out to avenge her untimely death . First up is Jess Browning ( Beth Gondek ) whose death is put down to a suicide , Mary Lou begins to posses Vicki 's body as the night of the prom draws nearer . After disposing of some competition in the shape of Kelly Hennenlotter ( Terri Hawkes ) who tries to fix the prom so she wins . Mary Lou in Vicki 's body is crowned Hamilton High prom queen which allows Mary Lou herself to come back from the dead to make an unexpected appearance & really liven the party up ... <br /><br />With absolutely no connection to the original Prom Night ( 1980 ) & directed by Bruce Pittman I thought Hello Mary Lou : Prom Night II was n't a particularly good film . The script by Ron Oliver concentrates more on supernatural elements rather than cheap teen slasher themes , whether this was a good or bad decision will depend on your expectations I suppose . Personally I found these different elements did n't really gel or work that well together at all . The whole film was far to slow to be really enjoyable , after the opening sequence where Mary Lou dies no one else is killed until the half hour mark & then the film plods along for another half an hour until Vicki is finally possessed & the film finally picks up momentum for the climax where an evil Mary Lou kills a whole one person at the prom before she is supposedly defeated , come on horror film fans you did expect that clichéd ' killer not dead & ready for a sequel ' ending did n't you ? Do n't expect a hight body count , just five throughout the entire film & none particularly graphic although I did like the way Monica ( Beverley Hendry as Beverly Hendry ) tried to hide in a shower room locker which Mary Lou crushed & resulting in poor Monica 's blood oozing out . The supernatural side of Hello Mary Lou : Prom Night II is depicted by Vicki having lots of hallucinations for the first hour & Mary Lou controlling objects during the latter stages including a couple of creepy shots of a rocking horse which comes to life , the blackboard scene is quite good as well as it turns into water & zombie hands drag Vicki into it . The slasher side of Hello Mary Lou : Prom Night II is n't outstanding , I did like Mary Lou herself as she churns out the obligatory one - liners & she made for a good villain even if she did n't get to kill enough people . Oh , & yes I did get the running homages to various other horror film director 's with almost all of the character 's sharing last names with one , this obviously adds nothing to the film but is a nice little touch I suppose . The acting is OK but the normally dependable Micheal Ironside looks lost & uninterested almost as if he 's asking himself what he 's doing in this & if he 'll ever work again . Forget about any gore , someone is hanged , there is a stabbing with a crucifix that happens off screen , someone is impaled with a neon light , a computer goes crazy & electrocutes someones face ( ! ? ) & Mary Lou bursts out of Vicki 's body at first as a rotting zombie which was quite a cool scene . There are some full frontal nudity shots in the girls shower as well , if that 's your thing . To give it some credit Hello Mary Lou : Prom Night II is OK to watch , has reasonable production values throughout & is generally well made . Overall I was disappointed by Hello Mary Lou : Prom Night II , it was just too slow & ultimately uneventful to maintain my interest for nearly 100 minutes . I 'm not sure whether it deserves a 3 or 4 star rating , I 'll give it a 4 as there 's nothing specifically wrong with it I suppose & I 've sat through much worse films but it just did n't really do anything for me I 'm afraid .
0 Prom Night 2 is an OK horror movie but prom night is way better and this movies about how the prom Queen Mary Lou in 1957 gets killed by her boyfriend and comes back 30 years later for revenge . The best actor in this movie is Micheal Ironside and the movie stars other OK actors and actress like Justin Louis ( I),Wendy Lyon , Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette(I).And there are some good gore scenes like when Mary Lou kills the girl that is trying to hide in her locker by crushing the lockers together and how one of the students are on the computer and Mary Lou electrocutes him to death . Over all this is an OK / good horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10 .
0 I actually prefer Robin Williams in his more serious roles ( e.g. Good Will Hunting , The Fisher King , The World According to Garp ) . These are my favorite Robin Williams movies . But Seize the Day , although well - acted , is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen and certainly the worst Robin Williams movie ( even worse than Death to Smoochy , Club Paradise , and Alladin on Ice).<br /><br />Every good story is going to have its ups and downs . This movie , however , is one giant down . I do n't need a feel - good Hollywood cheese - fest , but I 've got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness . This movie reminds me of " Love Liza " ( which is actually worse ) because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall . The answer ? Who cares .
0 The long list of " big " names in this flick ( including the ubiquitous John Mills ) did n't bowl me over to the extent that I could n't judge the film on its actual merits . It is FULL of stereotypes , caricatures , and standard , set scenes , from the humble air - ace hero to the loud - mouthed yank flyer . The music track was such that at one point , about an hour before the end , I thought the film was over : loud , rising crescendo , grand flourish and finish then silence , but then the movie continued ! I found no real storyline , haphazard writing , but smartly - pressed uniforms and the pretty Jean Simmons ( pre - nose job ) with a rousing little ditty . I can not say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great . I found it maudlin , mawkish and minor .
0 THE TOY BOX ( 1971 ) BOMB < br /><br />Sure , I like looking at nude women . While I prefer hardcore porn flicks , I 'll take softcore exploitation grindhouse junk like this too under the right circumstances . Well , these are n't the right circumstances . These are n't ANY circumstances . There 's supposed to be a horrific subplot lurking in here somewhere , but I 'll be damned if I can untangle it . This is another of those amateurish steaming piles of badly made manure that bores you to tears rather than stimulates you , despite all the simulated sex going on all over the place . Bah -- if I want to see good sex scenes , I 'll watch the real stuff .
0 " Do n't Drink the Water " is an unbelievably bad film . It 's based on a 1966 Broadway play by Woody Allen . It stars Jackie Gleason , the comic genius behind " The Honeymooners " . The director , Howard Morris , has appeared in several Mel Brooks comedies ( Life Stinks , High Anxiety , Silent Movie)and has made a mark in animation ( characters he has voiced include Gopher from " Pooh " , Jughead ( Archie)and Beetle Bailey ) What went wrong?<br /><br />I think the problem is that the premise is played out too seriously to work effectively . Allen 's original play was tongue - in - cheek , which is why it worked on Broadway and in Allen 's 1994 remake . The screenplay by R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock beats the premise to death and makes too many changes from the original play . Making Gleason 's wife an airhead in this version when she was a headstrong woman in the original is just one example of why this does n't work.<br /><br />The acting is n't much better . Gleason does the best he can with the material , but he ca n't save this . Gleason was a comic genius , but also a fine actor as he demonstrated in " The Hustler " and " Soldier in the Rain " . His abrasive personality could have worked here , but the lousy script does n't even give him a chance . Too bad . Estelle Parsons ' airhead wife will drive you nuts after 20 minutes . See how soon it 'll take for YOU to want to strangle her . That is also a shame because she is also a fine actress , having turned in two exceptional performances in " Bonnie and Clyde " and " Rachel , Rachel " None of the other actors do particularly well either.<br /><br />Woody Allen hated this film so much that he remade the film in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner ( Marge Simpson ) in the leads . They manage to hit all the right notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece . It 's finally on video after a long battle over rights . Do go out and find that version . All the 1969 original is good for is clearing out unwanted guests who overstay their welcome.<br /><br />1/2 * out of 4 stars
0 Leslie Sands ' stilted play " Deadlock " becomes a poor - choice vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill , just after their joint - success in " All About Eve " . After killing her spouse , a scheming woman is visited by her husband 's best friend , who passes himself off as her husband once others begin stopping by the house . Irving Rapper , one of Bette 's best directors from her peak years , is sadly unable to elevate this ridiculous material , in which Davis is curiously aloof and restrained until the outrageous finale ( where she thankfully pulls out all the stops ) . Production and supporting cast strictly second - rate ; only for Bette Davis completists . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 If you want an undemanding and reasonably amusing hour or so , then it 's OK to watch this . It 's not all that bad , really . Yeah , it 's got more lapses in logic than I care to describe here and might tax the patience of people - like myself , I have to admit - who are inclined to throw things at the TV on occasion , but it 's funny at least . Just because it 's not always INTENTIONALLY funny , there 's no need to let that get you down.<br /><br />However , if you 've read the book - or any of the other books by Brookmyre - then you 'd probably best avoid it . I 've read them all and when I first watched this film , I despised it . I 've trashed it in detail and at great length on another site , in fact . The TV plot bears practically no relevance at all to that of the book and served only to outrage and infuriate many faithful ( and admittedly rabid ) Brookmyre fans.<br /><br />Best bit of advice .. ? Watch this , then read the book and only THEN make your comparisons and submit your judgement .
0 What an absolute pile of pants . Having read Chris Brookmyre 's books religiously since I came across " Quite Ugly ... " , I was delighted to find out that this drama had been commissioned.<br /><br />I obviously had too much faith . < br /><br />Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even he does n't quite fit . How anyone can read the book , and then adapt it to this piece of dross is beyond me.<br /><br />Entire characters are changed , situations are dropped , and to see Parlablane 's dramatic break - in reduced to Nesbitt doing a quick chin up and sliding open a bay window ... it brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />I dread to think what 's going to happen with " Country Of The Blind " if this is the benchmark ... <br /><br />Please , just avoid it ...
0 Did I miss something here ? This " adaptation " has everything that Brookmyres first novel had . Everything apart from the story , the laughs , the black humour , the political intrigue , the characterisations , the plot , and some semblance of sense.<br /><br />Spoilers;<br /><br />Godamnawful , from beginning to end . They made a mockery of the plot , they had a romance between Parablane and a cop , and what was that all about , Dr Slaughter was portrayed as a bystander , and who the hell was Annette Crosby supposed to be?<br /><br />It looked like they had made a three hour adaptation , then chopped it down to 90 minutes . ( Even though the 90 minutes seemed to last forever . ) Please , please , do not do this to any other of Brookmyres books , ( especially " Country of the blind . )
0 This movie was a confusing piece of garbage . You never knew what was going on . The characters were poorly written and for the most part they were totally unsympathetic except for Gus ( played masterfully by George Eads ) . I hate this movie but compared to others ( Dark Harvest , Dracula 's Curse ) it should have won an academy award . It was particularly sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a disgraceful and tacky film . Lifetime you have sunken to whole new low . Someone needs to make sure that this director never works in movies again . Also was this supposed to be a horror film because it was a lot more funny than scary . For shame Lifetime , For shame .
0 1st watched 11/7/2002 - 2 out of 10(Dir - John Bianco ) : Pretty lame gangster movie about a Godfather - like family in Brooklyn who like to say four - letter words a lot and kill people . The only thing of interest here was their attempt to show the feds being a lot like the gang . This is the only attempt at good film - making . The rest of the movie was predictable , and cheaply - made . The quality of the photography on some of the scenes inside bars and floozy joints almost made you think there was a problem with your DVD player because of the bad contrasts and some of the actors were hard to hear at times because of the bad sound . The acting was pretty - much characatures of all your favorite gangsters from better movies with corny names like Vinnie ` Knuckles ' and Jimmie ` Tattoos ' , and the plot pretty much followed those patterns as well . So , go see a better gangster movie before you put your money out for this one .
0 This film is so bad I ca n't believe it was actually shot . People who voted 10 or 9 , 8 and even 7 , are you insane ? Did we really watch the same movie ? Or the same sh * * should I say . Everything is bad in this film . The story ( is there a story ? ) is going nowhere , completely incoherent , the acting ( some dialogs are simply just ridiculous ) , the music score ( what the * * * * is that ? ) , the editing , and especially the artistic direction , a pure disaster . Reminds me the old Macist movies ... To give you an example of the amateurism of the production , the mermaid 's costume is a sleeping bag with spangles sticked on it . I 'm not joking , that 's exactly what it is.<br /><br />Another example of the enormous mistakes we find here : you see in a scene an extra , a fat woman of about 200 pounds , who 's talking on her cell phone . The next shot , which is in a complete different location , you can see this same woman , still talking on her cell phone ( ! ) Yes , it goes that far . < br /><br />A big , huge , waste of money . Useless .
0 I just saw this at the 2006 Vancouver international film festival . The synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good so we decided to check this one out . I 'm sorry to say I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Besides being poorly written , it was boring . I wo n't take away from the actors as there is not much they could do with this bad script.<br /><br />First bite was cliché without being ironic , over the top seriousness without being funny . The movie would have been better had Hunt Hoe went with a campy horror feel . Instead he took himself to seriously and this resulted with a boring film . I ca n't recommend this film . It felt too long and all in all just plain weak .
0 I had the distinct displeasure of seeing this movie at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival . I have been attending this festival for over 5 years , and I have certainly seen some poor movies on occasion . However , ' First Bite ' has reached a brand new low in film . In spite of being shot in beautiful locations , with the occasional , exquisite close up of fabulous food , the movie contorts an excessive number of plot twists and stilted characters until I was practically begging for it to end.<br /><br />The lead actor , David La Haye , completely failed to show any character development throughout the movie , portraying a pompous chef from beginning to end . Additional sub - plots , such as eating disorders , were developed so poorly and completely did not fit within any context that the movie had shown up to that point.<br /><br />A theme of mysticism was used as a poor attempt to conceal a movie that achieves nothing , goes nowhere , and completely disappoints .
0 After being bitten by a bat in a cave , a doctor named John Beck undergoes an accelerating transformation into a man - bat creature . His wife assures him that there 's nothing wrong with him , it 's all just due to rabies or the anti - rabies drugs he 's taking . The local cop thinks that John is responsible for several gruesome murders."The Bat People " by Jerry Jameson is one hell of a horrible film . The script is deadly dull and there is no gore nor nudity . This pointless piece of crap is so mind - numbingly boring that you 'll scratch your head in a total disbelief after suffering through it . Even the design of a man - bat creature by a young Stan Winston is completely pathetic and unmemorable . Avoid this stinker like the plague.2 out of 10 .
0 Watching It Lives By Night makes you wonder , just who in the world greenlit this crap . A newlywed couple go spelunking on their honeymoon , get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people . And where exactly are they ? They 're in the desert , then they 're skiing , then they 're in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby . The town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against whiny doctor boy . The ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle . There 's no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with anger . Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston did the effects for this movie . I guess you have to start somewhere .
0 I saw this movie on mystery science theater when it was called " It lives by night " . That title is much less misleading than " Batpeople " . In fact it would more accurately be called Batperson . This movie is about a doctor who studies bats I am thinking because he wants to make a better cure for rabies . This is not really clear . What is clear is that he and his wife take a tour of a cave and he gets bitten by a bat . Why a scientist needs to take a tour to study bats is beyond me . Should n't he be able to go in by himself . Well after being bitten he and his wife go on their honeymoon where he starts having fits . They go to the worst doctor ever . The guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse . In the end the guy kills 3 - 4 people and his wife stands by him and you are supposed to be rooting for him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders .
0 Or maybe that 's what it feels like . Anyway , " The Bat People " is about as flat as a rug , bland as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock ... and as intelligent as all three combined.<br /><br />Okay , plot in a nutshell ( fitting vessel , that ... ) : a doctor ( Moss ) gets bitten by a bat while checking out a cave with his wife ( McAndrew ) and subsequently turns into a bat - well , not exactly a bat but a bat - like creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims in a first - person camera viewpoint .... <br /><br />But then there 's the business of the sheriff ( Pataki ) , who is about the WORST kind of sheriff : the hick kind . He hassles people , he leers at married women , he steals handkerchiefs from haberdasheries ( the FIEND ! ) , he smokes with one of those cigarette holders in his mouth and talks at the same time , making him look and sound like Buford T. Justice in " Smokey and the Bandit " and ( this is the worst part ) ... HE 'S THE MOST LIKEABLE CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE FILM!<br /><br />The whole film , though , is just TV movie - of - the - week - like crapola ( guano , in this case ) . It 's an AIP , for crying out loud ! What did you expect , Oscar caliber stuff?<br /><br />And what else can you say about a film that not even MST3 K can save?<br /><br />How about ... no stars for " The Bat People " , full version OR MST3 K version!<br /><br />By the way , if there 's ever a sequel for this movie , I 'm burying my TV .
0 " The Bat People " is a proud resident of the IMDb Bottom 100 . Every once and a while the movie suddenly vanishes from the infamous list , depending on whether there are new movies with Paris Hilton in the lead or documentaries about American Idol stars , but it always reliably returns sooner or later . And why ? Because , unlike the majority of crap in that list , " The Bat People " is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or internet buzz ! This nearly is n't the worst film ever made , since the basic concept definitely has a certain charm and ingenuity , but it 's still indescribably difficult to sit through the whole thing . The script is incredibly boring , with absolutely unnecessary padding footage and gigantic gaps in continuity , and yet the main characters still remain total strangers throughout the entire film . Other than a sensible screenplay , the film also lacks spectacular killing sequences and the make - up effects  although courtesy of a young Stan Winston  are ludicrously inept and remain largely unseen until the end of the film . The film 's title is inaccurate , as " people " refers to a number in plural whereas the story actually just revolves on one Bat Person . Much more than Bruce Wayne , the real Batman plays in this movie and he as well has a genuine Bat - cave and a Bat - mobile ( a stolen ambulance ) ! The plot introduces a young couple on their honeymoon - weekend exploring caves . They wander off from a guided tour group and he gets bitten by a bat whilst trying to protect his wife from the animal 's vicious attack . Worried that he might be infected with rabies , he undergoes an intense treatment at the local hospital , but still this does n't prevent him from slowly transforming into a bloodthirsty bat creature . He kills random people at night and toys around with the suspicious police sergeant whilst his loving wife is still vastly convinced the awkward behavior is exclusively due to allergic reactions to the rabies treatment . Sure , honey ! The script never explains why a bat would attack people and how come John always changes back into a normal human being at the dawn of a new day instead of gradually turning into a permanent state of bat - guano . So basically , " The Bat People " is a variation on the good old werewolf - theme , but obviously not a very interesting one . The concept showed a lot of potential , but somehow the sub plots center on whiny drunks and perverted Sheriffs instead of on ghastly monsters . Some of the settings and exterior filming locations look impressive , the misfit song playing during the credits is strangely catchy , there 's a nice bit of gore during the climax ( finally ! ) and main actress Marianne McAndrew is ravishing to look at ( though not to listen to ) . This truly bad and boring film 's current listing in the bottom 100 is spot number 80 , and personally I hope it sticks somewhere in that region . The list simply would n't feel and traditional without " The Bat People " .
0 Stewart Moss stars as a scientist who is on a working trip with his wife , and one gets the feeling that he was picked for this role for his ability to roll his eyes back in his head ... imagine the auditions for this .. "can you ... no , that 's not quite it , thank you , next ! " . Anyway , he 's bitten by a bat , and then , he 's either changing into some kind of bat creature and killing people or .... he 's not . For no one else sees his strange transformations , but he himself seems to think that he 's changing because his wedding ring pops off when his hands turn into claws , etc . To its credit the movie does kind of hold back on whether he 's just nuts or whether he 's actually transforming into something until almost the very end . This has some good locations & sort of a decent atmosphere at times but unfortunately none of that can make up for the somewhat lame story and the wonderfully bad acting . Kind of fun in a " so bad it 's good " way , but leans more towards just plain bad . 4 out of 10 .
0 Ok , so ..... guy gets bitten by a bat and then turns into a bat ( well , sorta ) . I can only assume this made sense to SOMEONE at the time ! Are n't bats supposed to fly , use radar , and eat bugs instead of attacking humans tho ?
0 This movie promised bat people . It did n't deliver . There was a guy who got bit by a bat , but what was with the seizures ? And the stupid transformation ? Where was the plot ? Where was the acting ? Who came up with the idea to make this ? Why was it allowed to be made ? Why ? Why ? I guess we 'll never know .
0 A man wakes from a nightmare about bats . He and his wife go out into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon . He seems to hear a strange noise , and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling across their picnic blanket . He wants to go on a tour of a cave , which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing , but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon . She relents . They go on the tour , but leave the group to make out . She falls down a slope , where she is disturbed by insects . He follows her . He hears the strange noise again , and seems to know a bat is approaching ; one does , and gets in her hair . He fights it off her , and it attacks him , biting his forehead.<br /><br />They get out of the cave , but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort , he starts having seizures in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people . He becomes angry when this happens . He 's unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out . His wife worries about rabies , and he starts a Pasteur treatment for that , but reacts violently to the injection.<br /><br />And then some people are killed . We see parts of the man 's transformation into a bat person . It seems it is not just in his mind . Whether the bat bite causes these transformations is not clear , since he already was having some symptoms prior to the bite.<br /><br />While the title seems inappropriate , the implication at the end is that the same thing is happening to another person . Not a very good movie , but I liked the variety of the desert , cave , and ski - slope locations , and some of the weirder scenes . I did n't think this was as bad as other people do , and I did n't think the 1999 movie Bats was as bad as others think either ( I rated that one a 5/10 ) .
0 The movie is just as fun as staring at the sun . Sheriff Pataki is a total retard that loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear making a smoke ring from his puffy cigars and drinking booze while the doctor acts like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucking up all that so called " Blood " which in reality seemed like Fruit Punch.<br /><br />Most of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a movie . The rest of the characters in this movie are total wastes of time , the ending was awful , the outlines were cheesy , and the scenes were terrible . What else more should I say to you viewers out there ? My advice would be to get your Rabies shot if you 've already watched the movie . This movie may give you the foam in the mouth if you did n't get your up - to - date shots .
0 Really , the use of stock nature documentary of swarming bats employed by THE BAT PEOPLE is some of the most effective ever . There are shots of teeming bats hanging from the ceilings of caves , swarming bats flying out of caves or swirling about near the mouths of caves . That alone is enough to be unsettling : Imagine all of them swarming after you ? And they do indeed swarm in what should have been a show - stopper sequence that happened at about the forty minute mark , a downright inappropriately hilarious sequence where a teeming swarm of bats seem to attack a police car , splattering across the windshield like bloody broken eggs . The problem is that this sequence happens about fifty minutes too late to save the film , most of which consists of one or more people running around , screaming , waving their arms about at jabbering excitedly about some poor goofball who managed to get bitten by a bat during his vacation.<br /><br />The fear is that he is coming down with rabies , which does indeed suck , so their vacation is ruined , as the plot synopsis on the top of THE BAT PEOPLE 's reference page does indeed point out . So here is an effective summary of the movie : A young couple goes on a romantic getaway which is ruined when the guy is bitten by a bat . They bravely try to stick it out but he starts raving , trying to convince those around him that it 's a bit more involved than rabies , that he ca n't control himself , and they everyone should KEEP AWAY.<br /><br />Now , when some one is frothing at the mouth , covered with sweat , eyes boggling about like one of the cheaper Muppets and screaming at you to GET AWAY FROM ME , you get away from him . You do n't try to give him drugs , you do n't try to tell him you love him , you give the guy his space , go home , and try that scenic getaway next year.<br /><br />But no , the people in this movie all behave like morons , insist on pushing the guy to his brink , and he flips out , mutates into a part man part bat type creature , and kills a bunch of non - essential secondary characters . Nothing wrong with that , but the movie forgets that it 's a low budget Creature Feature and tries to be some sort of psychological study . Instead of a monster movie , we get lots of people running around trying to get this guy to take a chill pill , and eventually he runs off into the hills looking very much more human than he should have , people insist on trying to chase him down and pay the expected price.<br /><br />The main thing wrong with the movie is that this should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes , thirty tops , and the movie should have been about the guy AFTER he had turned into a Bat Person , rather than about the journey there . It takes a good eighty minutes to really pick up steam on that front , with some interesting character sketches along the way involving the always entertaining Michael Pataki as a small town cop who 's lost his moral edge , and the late Paul Carr as a physician friend who does n't quite get the message.<br /><br />The movie is dreadfully boring , about fifteen minutes too long and missed the opportunity to be a nice , forgettable little Creature Feature about a mutant run amok like the Italian horror favorite RATMAN , which I watched today and was sadly inspired to try this one after seeing . Me and my bright ideas , though the scene with the cop car was a howler : Too bad we could n't have had another twenty minutes of that.<br /><br />3/10
0 Unless the title is supposed to be some kind of spoiler for the wife 's transformation ( the fiends ! ruining it for us ) . Anycase , if this movie was n't Made - For - TV , it should have been , it 's so remarkably low - budget , underscripted , underacted , and hits every 70 's cliche except disco . Nobody is likeable , and you could careless what happens to anyone in this one . Eminently forgetable except for the bad , bad performances .
0 While exploring some caves with his wife , a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some alarming side effects ... <br /><br />Occasionally creepy atmosphere and some decent ( though under used ) makeup effects do n't save this B horror flick from being a sub - par tale of man - becomes - creature . The Bat People aka It Lives By Night suffers from its senseless story that 's awkwardly plotted and lackluster in pacing . The plot never seems to go anywhere much and the movie never offers an explanation for what happens , or even a satisfying conclusion for it all . The cast is fairly mediocre in their performances.<br /><br />Still I give the film some points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations . The makeup work of the late Stan Winston is pretty good too , but it does n't get much of a showcase here . A missed opportunity for sure . < br /><br />Definitely one of the lesser man - creature flicks out there.<br /><br / > * 1/2 out of * * * *
0 I dunno sometimes ... you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the B thru Z grade movies out there , but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved . " Bat People " ( which I saw under the title " It Lives By Night " ) is just such a movie . You ca n't watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on " Night Gallery " , and not one of the better ones , either . < br /><br />The movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a Were - Bat who drinks human blood . ( Actually , you 'd think if he was turning into a real bat , he 'd be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket , but because this is a cheap , lurid horror movie , blood 's the word . ) In spite of the fact that he has grand - mal seizures at the drop of a hat , and black - out episodes almost every night , his friend and fellow physician , Dr. Mustache Aspen - Extreme , insists that he 's just having an ' allergic reaction ' to the rabies shots . Meanwhile , the world 's most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls ( and one wino ) . Also meanwhile , the doctor 's wife decides that denial IS a river in Egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction . < br /><br />It 's not so much that the acting is bad - you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices , and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script , even the guy who plays the sheriff . ( Okay , it IS pretty bad , but it 's bad in a clichéd , wooden , professional way ) . It 's just that everything about the acting , the way the scenes are paced , the costumes , the dialog , the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to , well , slap everyone involved.<br /><br />I think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky , unsettling little cult favorite , BUT:<br /><br />1)The director needed to beat Michael Pataki , an experienced character actor , with a chair until Pataki agreed to ACT , and not just channel Dennis Weaver . < br /><br />2)He also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole " Bat Bites Human , Who Then Turns Into A Bat " scenario . < br /><br />3 ) He also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his ' episodes ' , instead of resorting to " Man Has A Seizure " page from the Little Golden Book of Clichéd Acting Mannerisms . < br /><br />4 ) He needed to rework the whole ' wife ' character , make her both more intelligent , less shrill and waaaaay more observant . < br /><br />I would never voluntarily watch this film again , except with the help of Mike and the Bots . It 's bad , but it is n't bad in a silly , humorous or interesting way . Still better than " Battlefield Earth " or " Waterworld " , though .
0 OK , do n't let my summary fool you . This movie SUCKS HARD . But the worst movie ever ? This movie was terrible in ways people should n't have to rack their brains to describe . But it is in no way worse than Manos : the hands of fate , hobgobblins , horrors of spider island , or a small handful of movies . As a review the movie sucks , it 's terrible . Do n't see it with out MST or you may develop health problems . But there are worse movies .
0 Currently , this film is listed on IMDb as the 42nd worst film ever made -- which is exactly why I rented it from NetFlix . However , I am saddened to report that the film , while bad , is no where near bad enough to merit being in the bottom 100 films ever made list . I have personally seen at least 100 films worse than this one . Hardly a glowing endorsement , but it just did n't meet the expected level of awfulness to be included on this infamous list.<br /><br />The film begin with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their belated honeymoon ( by the way , they are married in real life as well ) . He 's a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists they go to a nearby cave . Once there , they behave very , very , very stupidly ( hallmark of a bad film ) and are soon bitten by a bat . According to this film , bats love to attack people and there are vampire bats in the US -- both of which are not true at all.<br /><br />Oddly , after being bitten , the man does n't even bother going to the hospital ! ! The first thing on anyone 's mind ( especially a doctor ) is to get medical help immediately , but not this boob . Soon , he 's having seizures -- yet he STILL is n't interested in seeking help ! Again and again you keep thinking that this must be the stupidest couple in film history ! ! < br /><br />After a while , he eventually goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital . But , by then it 's too late and his attacks become more violent and he begins killing people to suck their blood . When it 's totally obvious to everyone that the man is a crazed killing machine , the wife ( who , like her husband , has a grapefruit for a brain ) refuses to believe he 's dangerous -- even after he attacks people , steals an ambulance and runs a police car off the road ! ! < br /><br />Now most of the time Moss is going through these episodes , his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person . Oddly , however , a couple times he develops bat - like hands and towards the end they used some nice prosthetics on him to make him look quite bat - like . Had this been really cheesy , the film would have merited a 1.<br /><br />In the very end , in a twist that hardly made any sense at all , the wife inexplicably turned into a crazed bat lady and had a swarm of bats kill the evil sheriff . How all this was arranged was a mystery as was Moss ' and McAndrew 's belief that this film would somehow help their careers -- though they both have had reasonably long careers on TV playing bit roles since 1974.<br /><br />Overall , very dumb . The plot is silly and makes no sense and strongly relies on people acting way too dumb to be real . Not a good film at all , but not among the worst films of all time either.<br /><br />NOTE : For some reason , IMDb shows the graphic for the three DVD set for IT 'S ALIVE and it 's two sequels of the web page for THE BAT PEOPLE . While THE BAT PEOPLE has been seen with the title " It 's Alive " , the two movies are not at all related . It 's easy to understand the mistake -- especially since they both came out in 1974 , but the movie I just reviewed starred Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew and the other film starred John Ryan and Sharon Farrell .
0 I did n't think this was as absolutely horrible as some people apparently do . It passes as one of those cheesy horror movies you might waste time with in the middle of the night when you ca n't sleep , although admittedly it 's no better quality than that . It 's true that the acting is n't great - I thought Marianne McAndrew as Cathy Beck , for example , came across as completely passionless - but the main problem is that several aspects of the plot did n't really make sense to me . The Becks are on a trip described by John ( Stewart Moss ) as part work and partly the honeymoon they never had ( now that 's romantic ! ) The work part has something to do with touring caves , which in itself sounds strange ( how does being part of a tour group through a cave relate to anyone 's work ? ) but it gets stranger when we find out that he 's a doctor doing research in the area of preventative medicine ( huh ? That connection completely lost me . ) Bitten by a bat while he 's in the cave , he begins to transform into what I guess was supposed to be a human - bat hybrid ( although when we finally see him in makeup he looks a lot more like an ape - man of some sort ) and a killing spree starts . Here 's another problem . The first killing is a nurse in a hospital . At first , everyone thinks her death was an accident . The second murder is of a young girl , who is described as having her throat ripped out . The sheriff ( Michael Pataki ) then tells us that her death was similar to the nurse 's ( meaning throat ripped out ? - How could anyone think that was an accident ? ) And what 's with the sheriff ? He seems pretty no - nonsense until the scene in Cathy 's hotel room when he takes a swig of liquor and then almost rapes her , after which everything seems to go back to normal . It 's saddled with an ending that left almost everything unresolved , and also with one of the most irritating theme songs I 've ever heard in a movie . Even for all that , there was something here that kept me watching . Sometimes pure cheesiness can get you through an hour and a half . Pretty bad , yeah - but not as awful as some people say .
0 " The Bat People " is a really bad film that deserved the MST3 K treatment just as well like that other film " The Creeping Terror." < br /><br />In it , we are in some sort of mountainous terrain full of bats . We see many things happen , like bats flying out and attacking and stuff , station wagon chases , mishaps at the emergency room , and much more ! All this , plus the cheesy mediocrity of the 1970s ( hey , think " Mitchell " here ! ) , making " The Bat People " actually one of the very best of the last " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " episodes made in the series ! Moviewise , it 's awful . It should be avoided like the plague , unless Tom Servo and Crow are watching with you.<br /><br />"The Bat People " - more like " The Bad People ! ! ! ! ! " LOL < br /><br />1/10 of course ! ! ! ! !
0 The movie that shoots scenes of a scenic caverns tour.<br /><br />Remember no one from this movie except for Michael Pataki who dished out extreme pain as JC in " Five the Hard Way " . He 's the really annoying sheriff who I did applaud when he practices nightstick on our rabid doctor . Probably the most laughs you will have is with Dr. Beck 's epileptic seizures out of nowhere . Could Mrs. Beck be anymore wooden ? Seriously , if you took a 4 foot branch , stuck it in a hot tub , you would n't be able to notice a difference . The dread and suspense is looking over at the clock wondering when the credits will roll.<br /><br />Watch it as a late night movie , MSTified , but do n't go out of your way .
0 ( spoilers)Wow , this is a bad one . I did a double take when watching an old Star Trek episode the other day - it was the one where everyone gets infected with that space sickness and then go a bit nuts - and there was Stewart Moss , a.k.a the unlikable ' hero ' of It Lives by Night ! He played the first crewmember infected , who dies from terminal depression . All I could think was that he 'd watched his own movie too many times , that 's what caused the depression . This movie is full of truly unlikable people . There is no redeeming character in the film , not one . It 's very hard to feel bad about Dr. Beck 's turning into a bat(or whatever he actually turned into ) , because you just do n't like him . And you do n't like his shrill , bony wife , or the nasty sleazy Sgt . Ward , or Dr. Mustache Love ... So why would you invest any time or energy in this movie ? Where there is no empathy with the characters , there is no reason to bother caring about it . Not to mention the horrible cinematography , which made it look like they 'd filmed the movie through urine , and the five cent bat special effects , many of which appeared to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate hordes of bats flying . Not the worst film I 've ever seen on MST3 K , but down there in the bottom ranks , definitely .
0 Painful to watch , and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters . Two of the main characters , Cynthia the mother and Monica the acknowledged daughter , spend the great bulk of the film pathetically mewling and bitterly bitching respectively . Their characters are so firmly established that their redemption into tolerable personalities after a quick family catharsis is unbelievable . It was n't worth the wait . I wish a worthy pitch for honesty among families was less of a headache to view .
0 Time is precious . This film is n't . I must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like Fargo and this complete waste of time.<br /><br />The theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction : Is this the film the critics are raving about ? What a piece of crap!<br /><br />The hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family . Get it?<br /><br />The acting is superb.<br /><br />The production ( lighting , sets , editing , sound ) is about 2 steps above a 60 minutes story . The characters are shallow and unintelligent . I was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience ; the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say next.<br /><br />I have had more fun doing the laundry .
0 At least among those movies with 100 votes or more . Nominated for best screenplay written directly for the screen ? Brenda Blethyn nominated for best actress in a leading role ? ? Nominated for best picture ? ? I always disagree with many of the Oscar picks , but this movie might very well be the worst movie of all time to be honored by the Academy . The writing and acting were both horrible . Blethyn 's perfomance in particular was one of the worst I 've ever seen , and probably the most over - rated acting performance of all time . Awful movie , not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of any cable or television channel that has ever played it , including HBO(where I saw it ) . I am only thankful I did n't actually pay to see one of the most over - rated movies of all time .
0 First of all there was n't really anything in this movie that grabbed me really . It was n't a bad movie , just another movie where I said " Well , that was n't anything special " after I 'd seen it . There was probably drama and stuff , but it simply did n't grab me , but more seamed semi - dull . As I said in the headline it seamed very cheap in a way . The quality of the film itself ( the images ) seamed like a low quality and reminded me more of some cheap made for TV - movie than a well respected English film - maker . The camera angles and shots were very amateur like in my opinion . Did n't really have any close up shots or similar effects to produce interesting scenes . I have n't seen many English films and the ones I 've seen did n't really impress me more than this and they seamed kind of similar done with the camera work , colors and such . " Game " tried to be more cool , hip & smart ( see my review of " Lola Rennt " about this if you wish ) , but did n't succeed for me either . Overall just a little indifferent movie that was n't anything special ( at best , I 'm afraid ) and basically unfortunately over two hours wasted .
0 Well , EYEboy , I must say that it pleases me to no end when someone singles me out and tries to make fun of me , especially when it is someone who seems as intelligent as you do . My favorite part of your post was " But no big bang - bang good - guy bad - guy here , kimosabe . Me suggest you stick to movie with lotsa bang bang." < br /><br />Well said ! I do like action movies , especially if they are well done , but I also like movies that do n't have a whole lot of action , as long as THEY are well done . I 'm sorry , but Secret 's and Lies does not fit into that category and is simply a very bad movie . I really do n't see very many non - American films , so maybe I was spoiled , and did n't realize how bad foreign films really were when I saw Secrets and Lies . Perhaps if I judge foreign movies by a different standard I could some day see how Secrets and Lies could possibly be one of the highest rated movies on the IMDB . Hmm ... If true , that is very scary.<br /><br />Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net(new e - mail )
0 " Horrible People " ought to be the subtitle of this horrible film . If you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things , then look out of your window at real life . But if you want to see unpleasant people doing dull things , you 'll have to watch this horrible film by Mike Leigh . The characters talk at length , but never actually manage to communicate with each other . Why not ? Presumably because Leigh things that all of us are as ineffective and pathetic as his actors , and he wants to film real life . But we 're not , and he failed .
0 I have seen a lot of movies ... this is the first one I ever walked out of the theater on . Do n't even bother renting it . This is about as boring a soap opera as one can see ... at least you do n't have to pay to watch a soap opera , though .
0 This movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure , and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it , and did n't have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school ! Admittedly , the storyline was decent ... but i found the acting terrible ! The exception was Marianne Jean - Baptiste , i thought her performance was wonderful . She was the only highlight , without her , i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film . Every time i hear somebody say " daarling " i cringe ! i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said " it " . It made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life!<br /><br />(i apologise if this has offended anybody , i am only expressing my opinion )
0 ... mainly because Ju - on 2 boasts an outrageous FORTY minutes ' worth of material literally taken straight out of the first Ju - on - and when you consider that the sequel only runs for 76 minutes , that leaves you with 36 original minutes ' worth of film . Ho - hum . I found that deeply irritating - as if viewers simply would n't remember the same stuff ! - not to mention dull , having to watch it all over again.<br /><br />OK , that complaint aside , the byline for Ju - on 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of the unanswered questions from the first movie , which frankly , over 36 minutes , simply does n't go far enough to making any kind of sense of the original 's highly convoluted storyline.<br /><br />There are , however , some really nice new horror sequences which show how good the film might have been , had it had some time to develop ; and some of the questions raised by the original - some , but not all - are answered.<br /><br />So in conclusion - if you loved the first original movie and want to see some further developments on the story , go for it - but just remember to keep your remote control to hand with your finger on the fast - forward button for forty minutes .
0 POPEYE AND BIG FOOT * * ; POPEYE 'S ENGINE COMPANY * * ; GETTING POPEYE 'S GOAT * * 1/2<br /><br />I used to lap these up as a kid but , catching an episode of the series comprising three cartoons back - to - back now i.e. several years later ( they preceded the theatrical screening of the pirate yarn RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [ 1953 ] ) , I can see how they do n't hold up all that well ! The character of Popeye is n't exactly sympathetic to begin with , Olive Oyl distinctly overbearing and Bluto 's antics failed to elicit much interest either  in short , the scripts were alarmingly thin , fairly awful and generally unfunny to boot . They 're strictly juvenile fare , yet I doubt today 's kids would even have the patience to stick with them ! ; furthermore , the animation style is unattractive.<br /><br />Taking each short per se , I guess they improved from one to the other : after the initial shock , one adapted to its mediocre quality as it were , so that the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot  Popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose immense appetite causes him no end of mischief ( hardly original , I know , but always an amusing ploy ) . One interesting element here was that the shorts were bookended with Popeye delivering moralistic bits of wisdom to the kids in the audience .
0 Hanna - Barbera sucks the life out of another famous property . The violence is watered down , the stories are formulaic , the animation is bad , the music is obnoxious and repetitive , and frankly , the show just is n't funny.<br /><br />At the time , H - B put every one of its series through the same clichéd situations , regardless if it fit the world of the cartoon or not . Thus , Popeye and Bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen ( " Hey ! Popeye is popular , and the Flinstones are popular . Put 'em together , and you ca n't miss ! " ) . Also , in an apparent ripoff of " Private Benjamin , " Olive Oyl and the Goon have a regular segment that features them as new army recruits . Seriously ! Why ? < br /><br />Adding to the annoyance factor are the public service announcements in every episode ( standard practice at the time for cartoons , but still annoying ) . Popeye lectures his nephews on crossing the street safely , recycling , and - are you ready for this ? - the dangers of smoking ! ( I swear I 'm not making that up.)<br /><br />The only charm remaining from the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer , the voice of Popeye from the early days , continues the role here.<br /><br />Worth checking out once just to get a new appreciation for the old Fleischer shorts . Otherwise , avoid at all costs .
0 Another great movie by Costa - Gavras . It 's a great presentation of the situation is Latin America and the US involvement in Latin American politics . The facts might or might not be accurate but it is a fact that the US was deeply involved in coups and support of Latin American dictatorships.<br /><br />Despite this though the spirit of the movie follows the typical leftist / communist propaganda of the Cold War era . Costa - Gavras is a well - known communist sympathizer and his movies are always biased . For example he presents the US actions as brutal and inhumane , while representing Tupamaros ' extremist activities as something positive.<br /><br />As it turned out it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of the Latin America that the US got involved . Europe is filled with poor East European prostitutes . I never heard of poor Uruguayan or Chilean girls prostituting themselves en masse as it happens in most East European countries . The US was fighting a dirty war and god bless us all the monster of Soviet Communism was defeated . It is unfortunate the US had to do what it did in Latin America ( and elsewhere ) but sometimes you need to play dirty . This is not an idealistic world as Costa - Gavras and Matamoros like to believe . Had Matamoros come to power in Uruguay , we would 've had another Ukraine in Latin America.<br /><br />All in all this movie follows corrupt and bankrupt leftist ideology of times past and tries to pass it as idealistic and morally correct .
0 I think Phillip Kaufman read the cliff 's Notes version of the Kundera novel and then set about making this film . Okay , of course it wo n't have the punch of the original . Kundera 's novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept , his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs . This film does not even try ! The one dream sequence of Tereza 's , so vital to the atmosphere of the book , is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever . Also , and this is perhaps a lesser point , Daniel Day - Lewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller in this ( I know it 's not really a valid complaint , but hey ) . A perfect example of the Hollywood - izing of otherwise fine literature .
0 * * * Contains Spoilers * * * < br /><br />I did not like this movie at all.<br /><br />I found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made , irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes : given that eventually we have to die , how should we approach life ? In a " light " way , like Tomas ; in a " heavy " way like Tereza ; or should we find ways not to face that question , like Sabina ? How much is fidelity important in a relationship ? How much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones ? How much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our Country?<br /><br />Unfortunately , I have n't read Kundera 's novel but after having being let down by the movie I certainly will : I want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation ( which is my guess ) or if it was dull from the beginning.<br /><br />I disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece . I simply do n't see the reasons why . What I see are many flaws , and a sample of them follows.<br /><br />1 ) The three main characters are thrown at you and it 's very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices.<br /><br />2 ) The " secondary " characters are there just to fill the gaps but they do n't add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary.<br /><br />3 ) I did not like how Tomas was impersonated . Nothing is good for him . He is so self - centered and selfish . He is not human , in some sense . But when his self - confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone , I did not find the interpretation credible.<br /><br />4 ) It 's very unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968 . On top of that , the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions , which sounds strange to me . a ) how can Tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer ? b ) how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed?<br /><br />5 ) The fake accents of the English spoken by the actors are laughable . And I am not even mother tongue . Moreover , the letter that Sabina receives while in the US is written in Czech , which I found very inconsistent.<br /><br />6 ) Many comments praised the movie saying that Prague was beautifully rendered : I guess that most of the movie was shot on location , so it 's not difficult to give the movie a Eastern European feeling , and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague is not even difficult to make it look good.<br /><br />7 ) I found the ending sort of trivial . Tereza and Tomas , finally happy in the countryside , far away from the temptations of the " metropoly " , distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living , detached from their professional lives , die in a car accident . But they die after having realized that they are happy , indeed . So what ? Had they died unhappy , would the message of the movie have been different ? I do n't think so . I considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience.<br /><br />8 ) The only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters . You see them for almost three hours , but in the end you are left with nothing . You do n't feel empathy , you do n't relate to them , you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say.<br /><br />9 ) I hated the " stop the music in the restaurant " scene ( which some comments praised a lot ) . Why Sabina has got such a strong reaction ? Why Franz agrees with her ? I really do n't see the point . The only thing you learn is that Sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality . That 's it . What 's so special and unique about it?<br /><br />After all these negative comments , let me point tout that there are two scenes that I liked a lot ( that 's why I gave it a two).<br /><br />The " Naked women Photoshoot " , where the envy , the jealousy , and the insecurities of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented.<br /><br />The other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians . Tereza pictures , taken to let the world know about what is going on in Prague , are used to identify the people taking part to the riots . I found it quite original and Tereza 's sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed.<br /><br />Finally , there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally " designed " in such a way that " Tomas types " are going to like it and " Tereza ones " are going to hate it . If this is the case ( I strongly doubt it , though ) then my comment should be revised drastically .
0 After reading the book , which had a lot of meaning for me , the movie did n't give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed . This makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else . Either that or he is simply bad . Most importantly where is the lightness ? ! From the very first scene , music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling , and this continues right through the movie . I think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie , this would make the story feel light- however they have completely failed here . Instead the music manages to give everything that ' movie feel ' , in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them , so that everything actually feels heavy.<br /><br />Another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic . In the movie we see Franz passing Tomas on the street , who is on his way to see Sabina . The introduction of this chance meeting / passing , which i m sure did n't happen in the book , gives Tomas ' story more significance than it does make it light.<br /><br />There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed , imo for the worst , however this might have been done because the book simply does n't convert well into a movie , such is Kundera 's style . This makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book AND movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film . A film which is as long as it is uncompelling . For those who have n't read the book yet I recommend just reading that . For those who have , I have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay - clear warnings .
0 This film is quite boring . There are snippets of naked flesh tossed around in a lame attempt to keep the viewer awake but they do n't succeed.<br /><br />The best thing about the movie is Lena Olin -- she does a masterful job handling her character , but Day - Lewis garbles most of his lines.<br /><br />Kaufman clearly had no idea how to film this . The incongruities in bouncing between domestic household / marriage issues and political crises are badly matched . Character attitudes change without explanation throughout . Badly disjointed .
0 Seriously , Why do American and Frech actors pretending to be Czechs need to speak perfect English with a fake Russian accent ? I am a man , so i enjoyed the gratuitous nudity -- but a soft porn flick would have more of that , and at least would n't pretend it 's artistic.<br /><br />All the political statements where painfully didactic- has the director heard of subtlety ? The acting was also woody and melodramatic , and the comic relief was never funny . The characters were very shallow , and I just could n't identify with them at all.<br /><br />The bit where I did laugh was when they cut the actors into archival footage of the demonstrations in Prague - and they were black and white and then sepia to match the footage - just ludicrous.<br /><br />I read many of Kundera 's short stories ( not The Unbearable Lightness of Being ) , and there are good things about his style of writing ( although his themes are one big male fantasy)-and I have to say , the film did NOT convey any of the goodness of Kunderas style .
0 Harsh , yes , but I call 'em like I see ' em.<br /><br />I saw this in the late 80 's , and it was truly one of the most awful , boring films I 've ever forced myself to watch.<br /><br />Yes , the cinematography is lovely . The Czech settings are truly stunning . The political backdrop is enticing , but unlike similar " historically set " stories ( e.g. _ Dr. Zhivago _ ( qv ) ) , this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story , or even interesting.<br /><br />Sure , Olin and Binoche are beautiful . But this film manages to make even " erotic " scenes plodding and slow . I 'm all for romance , but this movie was so boring , I started hoping the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery.<br /><br />I'm sure if I 'd read the book , the story would have made a bit more sense . However , life 's too short to expend any more time on this one .
0 yeah cheap shot i know , but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of ' deepness ' ( political turmoil , love / lust ) can be combined haphazardly to great critical acclaim ( see also ' american beauty ' ) . kaufman 's movie plods along with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialog sequences ( in one scene i counted three different ' generic European ' accents affected by the actors ) and displays of state might run amok , yet fails to tie them together into the coherent meditation kundera offered . and in its over - long three hours it manages almost completely to gloss over franz , the missing fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot , and in this manner sacrifices the novel 's central mechanism of displaying the spectrum of emotions and of power relations that obtain in love affairs . it also fails to even include token screen time for tomas ' son , used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points kundera was making in the novel . combined with the overweening soundtrack , these flaws make this movie 's three hours unbearably weighty in tone yet light in content .
0 This is possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen . I do n't care what the critics say , it 's bad . I think the problem is with Kundera 's novel . It 's not that it 's unfilmable ; it 's just that like 99 % of his work , it 's pretentious and overdrawn . He seems to be enamored with himself , his characters come off as navel - gazing , and his novels as a whole are misogynistic . I have read many of his works ( even his Socialist Realist poetry . That was truly awful ) -- I just do n't understand what the fuss is about . Characteristics ( like the self - absorption ) in his novels make for infuriating reading . In a movie , all the things that I dislike about Kundera were magnified . Maybe I just missed something , but I do n't think so . On a side note , I can not believe that this is a Criterion Collection DVD . No way is this movie THAT essential .
0 Oh , I heard so much good about this movie . Went to see it with my best friend ( she 's female , I 'm male ) . Now please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream . After the first couple of dozen " take off your clothes , " we both felt a very strange combination of silliness and boredom . We laughed ( at it , not with it ) , we dozed ( and would have been better off staying in bed ) , we were convinced we had spent money in vain . And we had . The plot was incoherent , and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care . A waste of money , a waste of celluloid . This movie does n't even deserve one out of ten votes , but that 's the lowest available . I 'm not sure why this movie has the reputation that it does of being excellent ; I do n't recommend it to anyone who has even a modicum of taste or intelligence .
0 It 's frequently said that movies can never equal the original book . Well , in this case , not only the movie is not " as good " as the book , but is an insult to the book . I 'd rather see Milan Kundera 's novel turned on fire than into this " something , " which the director probably calls " adaptation." < br /><br />All the beautiful philosophy that asks " is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders , or cope with the unbearable lightness of being ? " is put aside , and instead , all the movie deals with is Daniel Day Lewis ' ( I can not say Tomas ) sexual adventures with his dumb wife , his mistress , and his other mistresses . François Truffaut already said it : bad directors make bad movies . Do n't waste your time and money . Read the book instead , it 's really worth it .
0 Bonfires of the Vanities is a film drenched in flop sweat . I can recall no film that has tried so hard to be so unrelentingly outrageous , provocative and important , yet failed so consistently across the board . It is like a stand up comic who 's not getting laughs , but ca n't leave the stage . The harder the film tries , the louder each attempt at a laugh results in a resounding thud . The desperation the film displays is so glaring it almost rouses pity for all those involved.<br /><br />The film achieves laugh - out - loud status only twice . Once is in the sight of Geraldo Rivera playing an obnoxious , arrogant and amoral TV tabloid journalist -- which is funny only because he apparently does n't realize he is playing himself . The other scene that deserves to be laughed at is the film 's final " big moment , " wherein the judge played by Morgan Freeman delivers the sanctimonious lecture about what morality is ( " it 's what your mama taught ya ! " ) . The pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd . < br /><br />Yet , one must admit it is a noble effort . It does have a good , if poorly cast , band of actors , who try to make characters out of cardboard thin caricatures . The film looks professionally made and the little cinematic flourishes that director Brian DePalma just loves are apparent , if not particularly effective . But the film , which apparently wishes to be a commentary on modern morals and ethics , never arises above the level of cartoon . Satire requires style . Farce requires energy . Even sitcom requires timing . But the best Bonfires can muster is desperation . In the end , you do n't want to laugh , you just want to turn away .
0 This was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there . But the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie . Hanks is a great actor to be sure , but lacks the smarmy , morally ambivalent characteristics needed for the lead role . Jeff Daniels would have been my choice.<br /><br />Putting Melanie Griffiths in , for eye candy reasons , is understandable , but again , she did not portray the depth or ambivalence , so need to pull this off.<br /><br />This movie is a great example of how every decision , even those early on in the movie production can make or break a file .
0 This is one of the most atrocious rewrites I 've ever viewed . If they want to make a movie with a lousy story , they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book . There is hardly a relation between Wolfe 's book and this movie other than the title . I do n't mind changes if they help a story flow on screen . At least the changes should n't hurt the final product . The last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing . The actors are miscast . The director and/or screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon.<br /><br />If you 've seen this movie and disliked it , try the book . If you 've seen this movie and liked it , read the book .
0 Regarded by many critics as one of the biggest stinkers of all time ( certainly the biggest stinker of director Brian De Palma 's career).<br /><br />Sherman McCoy ( Tom Hanks ) is a smug rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover Maria Ruskin ( Melanie Griffith ) are involved in a hit - and - run . His story is chronicled by another smug guy , reporter Peter Fallow ( Bruce Willis).<br /><br />Well , as I said in my summary ... <br /><br />What is this movie supposed to be ? It seems to combine comedy , drama , and satire , but it sure does n't add up to much . It 's undermined by unimaginably loathsome , one - dimensional characters who you 'd never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life.<br /><br />I'm no big fan of the novel ( I started reading it once , but could n't finish it because it was n't to my liking ) but it 's obvious to me that those who did / do enjoy the novel consider this film to be a complete travesty.<br /><br />I've never seen so many talented actors strive to hard to give a below - average movie some semblance of quality and fail . What a waste.<br /><br />The problems start with casting nice guy Tom Hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be UNsympathetic . And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was that of a Brit . Bruce Willis is badly , BADLY miscast in the role . What was the thinking there.<br /><br />Alas , not even Morgan Freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact , being obliged to deliver a lame , heavy - handed lecture on ' decency ' after the climax.<br /><br />This movie ends up turning into an absurd farce.<br /><br />I liked the assemblage of talent ; for that I will give it four out of ten , but I 'm sure some people will say a MUCH better movie could have been made from the source material .
0 Most book adaptations are bad but this film left out key parts of the storyline and changed the description and some characters . They rewired the storyline and combined scenes and changed the order . They added ridiculous things into it that never happened in the book and would never happen.<br /><br />If i had n't read the book beforehand it would have been an incredibly dull film , it did n't make you care about the characters , like them or dislike them . It turns the characters into jokes.<br /><br />Awful.<br /><br />Ridiculous.<br /><br />Waste of two hours of my life .
0 The point of Wolfe 's original novel -- indeed the point of the whole story -- is that things take place because of a carefully calculated sense of expediency . The goal is survival within a particular kind of life style . The novel is full of malice . The only relationship that rings emotionally true is that between Sherman and his daughter , Campbell , and that 's only touched upon . That aside , everyone is out for what he can get in the way of publicity , power , money or self aggrandizement.<br /><br />Wolfe was criticized for hitting every character and every social segment of New York City over the head . His response was a denial . After all , he lived in New York himself and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations , exactly the qualifications one would want on his resume in order to deny that he disliked New Yorkers . ( Wolfe has a PhD in American Studies from Yale and is no dummy . ) Those supposed weaknesses are what made the novel memorable . Nobody was any good . And Sherman McCoy wound up broke , a professional protester for social justice . The movie throws all of that away and imposes a moral frame on the story that simply does n't fit . Wolfe did his homework . The novel was rooted in reality . Every event was not only possible but thoroughly believable . Wolfe might have made a great cultural anthropologist -- he knows how to get inside a system and record its details.<br /><br />Yes , any of us might have found ourselves , as Sherman and his mistress do , stuck in the South Bronx , threatened by a couple of black kids , and making a getaway after bumping into one of them . That scene is transferred neatly from print to celluloid . < br /><br />But after that scene the movie seems not to trust its audience and at times become frantic in its attempt to spell out its message , however nebulous the message is . < br /><br />Sherman might accidentally hit some kid and be arrested for it as he is in the novel , but he would not immediately upon his release from jail go back to his phenomenally expensive condo , take out a shotgun , and start shooting into the ceiling with it , as he does in the movee . In what 's supposed to be a funny scene , ceiling plaster falls all over the party guests and they scurry away , shrieking . It simply would not have happened . The movie has left the novel 's unspeakably detailed reality in the dust . Wolfe 's sensibility , the work he put into capturing the real , has been lost . What we get instead is a noisy , fantastic , and silly scene that does n't do anything except wake the audience up . Similar empty scenes follow , screaming out for Wolfe 's verisimilitude.<br /><br />The movie also fails because it thrusts a lot of sin and redemption into an entertaining story of moral nihilism . Here we see " Don Juan in Hell " at the opera . We get lectures on redemption from a poet with AIDs . We see a lot of guilt in Sherman . A black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of those final speeches about how we all have to start behaving nicely again . A reporter who feels sorry for Sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb . And a happy ending in which Sherman gets off by breaking the law with an idiotic grin . The scene sits on the movie like a jester 's cap on a circus elephant 's head . < br /><br />The movie not only makes points that are already trite and unoriginal , it overstates them , as if the audience were incapable of absorbing any subtleties.<br /><br />It 's not the acting or the direction that 's poor . The film 's not bad in those respects . And the photography is pretty good too , including two rather spectacular shots -- the gargoyles of the Chrysler building and the landing of the Concorde . It 's the script that is thoroughly botched.<br /><br />The first half of the movie , roughly , is okay in conception and execution . It keeps some of the little details from the novel . Sherman and Judy 's dog is named Marshall . Who the hell would name a dog Marshall ? It loses its focus almost completely in the second half and on the whole is barely worth watching.<br /><br />Wolfe 's cynical redneck right - wingism may be offensive to a lot of people , but he 's got the cojones to lay his percepts out . Alas the writers and producers did not have the courage to pick them up and thus blew the chance to make a fascinating study of New Yorkers .
0 As someone who has both read the novel and seen the film , I have a different take on why the film was such a flop . First , any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial . They are two different animals.<br /><br />The novel is probably intended as a satire , but it arrives as a cross between tragedy and polemic instead . Any comedic elements such as those which later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are merely incidental to the author 's uniformly cynical thrust . And lest the omnipresent white suit of the author fool you into thinking this is another Mark Twain , think again . A more apt literary precedent would be the spectre of Ambrose Bierce in a top hat and tails . Tom Wolfe is equal parts clown and hack , more celebrity than author , always looking for new grist for his self - absorbed mill . < br /><br />It is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction lavished on the making of the film were doomed from the start . Unlike true satire , which translates very well into film , polemics are grounded not in universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior , but in a single - minded attack on specific people -- whether real or fictional straw men -- who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer . Any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start , free of the writer 's influence or interference.<br /><br />Having said that , I too find fault with the casting . It is not merely that incompetents like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith fail to measure up , but that real talents like Tom Hanks , F. Murray Abraham , and Morgan Freeman are either totally wasted or given roles that are mere caricatures.<br /><br />There is enough topical material here for a truly great film satire , but it fails to come even close .
0 Based on Tom Wolfe 's satirical novel that was praised by all ( i have not read it yet ) Tom Hanks stars as a wall streeter who accidentally kills a black boy while lost in a bad part of NYC Willis stars as the reporter who starts Hanks on his downward spiral .. The characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire there are nt a lot of laughs either .. Melanie Griffith had her breasts done during filming so a fun thing to do is to see if her boobs change size during different parts of the film .. This will keep your mind off other things like the lack of script or humor .. On a scale of one to ten .. 3
0 Tom Wolfe 's sprawling , brilliantly observed satiric novel of life among New York snobbery gets a glossy look here but is nevertheless not well served . The film suffers not merely from the miscasting of everyman Tom Hanks as an uncaring Yuppie , Kewpie - doll Melanie Griffith as a manipulative southern belle and Bruce Willis ( ? ! ) as the darling of New York 's literati . The most serious miscasting was in the director 's chair . Robert Altman might have breathed life into these unlikeable characters and made them interesting , but Brian De Palma , for all of his visual sophistication , has never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience . The resulting film looks good but seems blah toward its subject of dehumanization in favor of status . Honestly , if a satire does not make the viewer angry , what is the point ?
0 ( This is a review of the later English release by Disney , featuring Alison Lohman , Patrick Stewart , and co. ) < br /><br />I really wanted this film to be good . Really , really . I 'm a huge fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away , and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier Miyazaki film , I was eager to see it . But I was shocked , shocked I say , at the quality of this film . Those later films boast well - crafted plots , 3-dimensional characters , and the best film music since ... well ... ever . This film just does n't come close.<br /><br />Might as well start w/ the positive aspects , though . Like all Miyazaki films , this one is still very imaginative , with a bizarre fantasy / sci - fi setting , in a post - apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species . Nausicaa can also boast some far superior animation to other films from its time . ( though not as beautiful and fluid as Miyazaki 's later films ) And the English voice acting is quite well done.<br /><br />But this film ... just ... isn't ... good ... The characters are all cardboard - from saccharine sweet little Nausicaa , to the ruthlessly evil Tolmekians , to everyone in between . Once you 've seen each of them for 30 seconds , you 've seen all there is . And the fact that the plot just ambles along does n't help.<br /><br />Then there 's the music ... Now , Hisaichi is hands down my favorite film composer , but Nausicaa does n't do him justice . Half the music is 80 's keyboards on overdrive , and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it distracts the visuals rather than helping them . I highly suspect that Hisaichi was told to compose a lot of the music before he even saw the picture.<br /><br />But wait ! There 's a great message with this film , right ? ! Let 's all save the environment ! Too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a sledgehammer . There is a scene in which Nausicaa hugs a tree . No , really . I ai n't kidding.<br /><br />It makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is . But for some reason all the other reviews on IMDb seem to adore it . And when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what 's going on , that 's lame.<br /><br />If you 're the kind of person who worships anime , enjoys 80 's music , and plants a tree every Arbor day , you will probably like this film . Otherwise , save your money for his later films , because they rock big time .
0 I am partly a fan of Miyazaki 's work . I say " partly " because most of his films fall into two categories : brilliant , and boring . Sadly this film falls into the later category.<br /><br />This film suffers from the same fundamental problems as Miyazaki 's recent film " Howl 's Moving Castle " . An intriguing premise is set up , but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it.<br /><br />The first third of the film reveals the post - apocalyptic world the story is set in , and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold . From then on things go down hill . The middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly - veiled eco - propaganda , and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of Japanese animated films.<br /><br />Overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators . What is left is something which is visually stunning ( although sadly the version I saw was an Nth - generation copy , with poor colour - which gives rise to the common myth that Nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying ) , but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused .
0 I do n't know what it is about Donald Sutherland 's acting style , or vocal style , but he always seems to be acting from behind a massive wad of soggy Kleenex . He 's just ... I do n't know , THICK ? Somnambulistic ? On meds ? Weird.<br /><br />That said , I just saw the flick again for the first time since its original release , and frankly , I do n't remember it ending anything LIKE that . A bad ending , too , because nothing gets tied off . What about the dead husband ? The annoying child ( and was the kid dubbed ? ) ? The Scotland Yard and military pursuers ? I would have liked something wrapping things up and giving some dramatic closure to it all , not just the big panoramic pull - away.<br /><br />And what woman sleeps with the man she knows just killed her husband ? Even if she was trying to allay Needle 's suspicions to protect her kid , she could always have had a headache . That last encounter made me feel way too itchy and uncomfortable ...
0 To make a good movie you either need excellent actors or an excellent director . You need at least one of the two . In this Eye of the Needle we have none.<br /><br />I do n't even remember the name of the director . He must n't have done much in his career . I like very much Donald Sutherland but he absolutely can not be the main actor in a movie . He falls short . Sutherland is excellent in a movie when he appears for not more than 15 minutes . I would say for instance that Sutherland was excellent in JFK of Oliver Stone when he talked to Kevin Costner on the bench of a park for 10 minutes non - stop without even taking a breath . Wonderful . But Sutherland being the principal actor in a movie is no good.<br /><br />Kate Nelligan ? She is probably good for TV series . The DVD is awful . Terrible colors . Terrible light . I could n't even appreciate the scenery of Storm Island for how lousy the photography was.<br /><br />This Ken Follett story was good but it 's a pity they turned it into an uninteresting movie .
0 The movie lacks credence with the helicopters which did n't exist until the 1950s . But no woman would do what was done here , even a woman before the women 's movement of the 60s and 70s . About the only portion of the movie that you could believe in was that Germany would want to know where the landing would be . Ignore for the moment that the British had captured all the spies but even if they had not , they would n't have let one roam around like this just to reassure the Germans that the landing would be at Calais . It is n't one major thing that makes the movie not work . It is the culmination of all the things wrong that makes the movie fail . Bad directing , bad scripts , no attempt at authenticity ( at all ) all combine to just make the movie fall flat . Generally speaking spies should fade into the woodwork . The suspense comes in with the spy wondering if the information they have is valid or not and worrying about being detected . On this one that game was over from the start . This spy was doing anything but spying . Your only chance at getting something that has some credibility and instills some suspense may be to read the book .
0 When I had first heard of " Solar Crisis " then got a load of the cast , I wondered why I had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before . Then I saw it.<br /><br />Now I know.<br /><br />For a movie that encompasses outer space , the sun , vast deserts and sprawling metropolises , this is an awfully cramped and claustrophobic feature ; it feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera wo n't have to pull too far back.<br /><br />And the effects , while good , are pretty underwhelming ; we 're talking about the imminent destruction of the planet Earth if a team of scientists and soldiers can not deflect a deadly solar flare . But other than shouting , sweating and a red glow about everything , there 's no real feel of emergency.<br /><br />Don't get me started about the cast . What Heston , Palance , Matheson , Boyle , et al are doing in this movie without even bothering to act with any feel for the material is anyone 's guess . Makes you wonder who else 's condos are n't paid for in Hollywood .... <br /><br />And as far as the end goes .... Well , let 's just say it 's tense and intriguing but it 's too little too late in an effort like this . If it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film , maybe I would have heard of " Solar Crisis " sooner.<br /><br />Two stars . Mostly for lost opportunities and bad career moves . < br /><br />I wonder how Alan Smithee keeps his job doing junk like this ?
0 Oh the hilarity ! Oh the joy ! Another film that is so bad it 's good ! Or , so I thought . In actual fact , this one misses the " so bad its good " phase and goes , sadly , straight to the " could have been so bad its good , but they screwed it up and made it plain bad".<br /><br />For a start its way too long . Cut half an hour and it might have been more endurable . Then put in such ludicrous plots as " the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the Earth , because he has all the food stockpiled and he 'll be rich if the mission fails ! " . Duh!. Or the " talking bomb " plot device last seen in Dark Star . Guess what .... just like in Dark Star , the bomb has a malfunction ..... hmmmm . Add in a dash of " we ca n't act our way out of a kindergarten play " and you have Solar Crisis in a nutshell.<br /><br />Light relief is to be had in the form of Jack Palance ( or Jack Pants , as we called him in this flick ) , whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a kid around the desert and telephone the kid 's dad to come pick him up .... eventually . Between driving and phoning , Jack dispenses pointless drivel and leers and cackles a lot , but contributes little to the story , such as it is . In short , he 's the best bit of the movie.<br /><br />My award for " The Most Ironic Line Delivered Straight - Faced " goes to Charlton Heston , who , when meeting his eldest son for the first time in ages , comments that his son looks a little " out of shape " whilst he himself is standing there with his gut bulging over his waistband and in dire need of a Captain Kirk Corset.<br /><br />Also amusing is the bad guy 's top henchman , who has a bright white hairstyle that kept making me think of Andy Warhol , for some reason.<br /><br />Apart from these hilarities , there 's little to recommend this movie . The ending is a sequence copied from ( but mercifully shorter than ) the end sequence from 2001.<br /><br />Tips for enjoying this movie more , if you are foolish enough to watch it , like I did:<br /><br />1 . Any time the bomb speaks , imagine it 's called Tarquin ( Trust me , it works!)<br /><br />2 . Whenever Chuck Heston is on screen and about to speak , pre - empt him by reciting a line from Planet of the Apes such as " Get your filthy paws off me ! " or similar.<br /><br />3 . Whenever the female lead is looking stressed ( this is most of the time ) keep hoping against hope that she 's having an aneurism and will die soon.<br /><br />4 . During the interminable " the ship 's broke again " scenes , keep hoping the tech / engineer guys will spout a Scotty - ism like " You cannae change the laws of physics ! " or some such crap.<br /><br />Other than that , do what it takes to get you through this one . I dozed off half way through and woke to realise I had n't missed anything , nor had the plot ( laughable though it is ) advanced any . So do n't worry about tuning out for a few , you wo n't miss anything .
0 I picked this title up from a friend who had it sitting in his exhaustive DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection , so luckily I did n't personally have to pay for it . I had an inkling that it would be a bad film , but I KNOW what a truly bad film is after watching greats like Children Should n't Play With Dead Things and The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed - Up Zombies , and now there is truly nothing that fazes me unless it is astoundingly bad.<br /><br />Solar Crisis is bad , but it does n't reach that sweet spot of absolute pain that some movies are at.<br /><br />Anyway , the general plot is that the sun is about to unleash a huge solar flare towards the earth that will essentially destroy it . In order to counter - act this imminent threat , humanity has assembled a spaceship and crew whose duty it is to fire an antimatter bomb ( which the opening describes as " the biggest explosive ever " ) into the sun , which through some convoluted sci - fi logic will cause the flare to shoot out at a different angle , leaving earth unharmed.<br /><br />Never mind that what I have just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original Star Trek . Even with an ensemble cast ( Charlton Heston , Peter Boyle , and Jack Palance ) , Solar Crisis can barely manage that level of mediocrity , thanks to a plot that starts simple , yet becomes increasingly nonsensical as time wears on.<br /><br />The crowning achievement of this debacle of a movie is the addition of a villain character ( played by Boyle ) who insists on sabotaging the mission . Through means that are never explained , he sends an evil minion with an embarrassingly bad haircut to exercise some sort of vague electronic mind control over the space crew 's genetically engineered scientist , played by female lead Annabel Schofield . Why is he sabotaging the mission ? Because by his moronic viewpoint , he believes the flare wo n't happen and that when it does n't , he will become fabulously wealthy because he has dug his evil claws into the stock market . In effect , you have a villain with the most absurdly stupid motivation imaginable.<br /><br />The film 's plot becomes amazingly convoluted and develops very slowly , in time tapping the use of characters who have only vague or uselessly brief roles in the storyline . I could sit here and explain in detail precisely what happens to demonstrate the sheer inability of the screenwriter to make a plot that actually clicks or holds your attention , but I am sitting here writing this review on Microsoft Word and I know for a fact that this would take three pages , and I would only succeed in losing your interest . But then again , you would probably get the same effect from watching the film.<br /><br />Anyway , the film is miserably bogged down with exceedingly poor dialogue . Imagine if all that ever happened on the Star Trek Enterprise was that the characters spewed sci - fi jargon back and forth at each - other . Yes , I know , they already do that , but imagine if that 's ALL they did , and that they used said jargon to set up vague and near - nonsensical scenes that produce no excitement , tension , or interest in the viewer whatsoever.<br /><br />This is best exemplified at the point when a character in a Zero - G environment screws a bolt back onto a metal box before proceeding to cry in agony for a couple of minutes before suddenly exploding . The script alludes previously to the character risking an explosion , but does n't bother to give any solid answer as to why or how this occurs , nor why he ca n't really escape . In totality , you have a sorry cross between the bizarre and the laughable.<br /><br />Then we have several scenes where dramatic build - up leads to nothing . Jack Palance 's performance is wasted on a character that serves only to drive the boy hero ( do n't ask ) around the desert , before getting roughed up and killed by a bunch of suits . On his death - bed , Palance finally tells our boy hero his last name ( while wearing a horrible bruised makeup job that makes it look like somebody put a balloon under his eyeball ) , which he kept quiet about before . Colonel Travis J. Richards . The boy repeats it quietly after he expires , giving viewers the impression that the name is of some significance later on in the film . Perhaps Charlton Heston 's grizzled admiral character knows him and the plot will advance thereby once his name is repeated . Something . Anything.<br /><br />Nope . Sorry . Any hopes you have will be dashed when this moment turns out only to be another of many pathetic , failed attempts at creating dramafor a character so flat and hackneyed that it will forever be a stain on Palance 's career , just as those of the rest of the cast are similarly marred.<br /><br />Completing the film is a painfully abrupt ending featuring Schofield piloting the bomb into the center of the sun in an effort to redeem her deeds while under the villain 's spell , a climax which features another of the film 's considerably well - done visual effects sequences that , even for the visibly elaborate care put into them , still always manage to make the film look just as chintzy as it really is . The saddest part about this film is the obviously large budget , tragically wasted on a stinker of a script and a supporting cast behind Boyle , Heston , and Palance that manage to nail the coffin shut with pure over - acting.<br /><br />Grade : D-
0 Disowned by Richard C. Sarafian , this disaster stunk up Japanese theaters before coming to the States and going immediately to video , where it was not seen again until the Turner networks needed something other than infomercials to fill their 3am-6am time slots and found this tape at the bottom of their bin . The Smithee name is supposed to be used when the studio hacks the movie so badly that the director no longer wants his name attached to it . But I 'm afraid that Sarafian can not blame the studio entirely on this one . The actors , mostly recent graduates of " Overacting 101 " , deliver one cornball line after another . The plot is convoluted . The special effects are unimpressive . The parts that are n't laughable are just plain boring . The script or the book must have been good - why else would Palance , Matheson , Boyle , or Heston agree to appear in this dud ? But something went horribly wrong from the page to the screen . Summary : Avoid . Not even bad enough to be so - bad - it's - good .
0 It was one of those late night " It 's there " I saw it things . Sometimes they are great . This one was awful , but it really should n't have been.<br /><br />The movie had a really good cast . How can you fail when you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance ? We 're talking Oscar winner turf here . It had good special effects . It even had some really good tits ! And I mean nicely shown , full breast with full nipple and at one point even some beaver . But it did n't compensate for the one missing ingredient - a story ! The plot was ludicrous . I do n't mean the " solar crisis " sun exploding stuff , but that was bad enough . It was the rest of the stuff - the oh so stupid and totally predictable evil corporation stuff . Man that just STANK ! No amount of good acting or cool space ships or fight scenes could get around that one.<br /><br />I have seen the same cast members be incredibly good . I have seen wonderful science fiction movies that had miniscule casts and budgets . All the difference is in the writing .
0 One of the requirements of science fiction , at least before it starts to become satire , is that it be somewhat plausible . I would think that an anti - matter bomb would do considerably more damage than for what it was intended . But I 'll leave that to the physicists who might have seen Solar Crisis.<br /><br />It is a crisis the earth is facing because solar flares are getting totally out of hand . They 're getting close to Earth , so much so that it 's become unseasonably hot , as if the entire Earth were Death Valley . The answer is an anti - matter bomb which a space ship will have to take to the sun and explode it there . That will divert the flares off in say the direction of say Mercury providing it 's not in direct alignment with the Earth . < br /><br />Who to deliver it , but captain Tim Matheson and his crew . That is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on runaway son , Corin Nemec . Taking care of the personal side of the family problems is admiral Charlton Heston , Matheson 's father , and Nemec 's grandfather.<br /><br />There 's a villain here too , Peter Boyle who is the CEO of a multi - national corporation which in this crisis is trying to control the world 's food supply for the survivors . The idea he might not survive does n't enter into his thinking . He 's doing his best to sabotage Matheson 's mission.<br /><br />Solar Crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001 , A Space Odyssey and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea . Boyle seems to be taking his cue from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman , apparently he 's the only one in the cast who realizes he 's in a turkey and overacts accordingly.<br /><br />The rest of the cast are stalwart , true blue and dull . Except possibly desert rat Jack Palance who finds Nemec and cares for him . < br /><br />The key here is that the film was directed by that noted Hollywood purveyor of flop films , Allen Smithee . The film gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a Thanksgiving carving .
0 I had high hopes for this film , since it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance . But those hopes came crashing to earth in the first 20 minutes or so . Palance was ridiculous . Not even Heston 's acting or Annabel Schofield 's beauty ( or brief nude scenes ) could save this film . Some of the space effects were quite good , but others were cheesy . The plot was ludicrous . Even sci - fi fans should skip this one . Grade F
0 Yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash can.<br /><br />Boring direction and performances ( with the exception of the lovely Annabel Schofield who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material , and the ever earnest Charlton Heston ) earn the rating of a real stinker.<br /><br />It 's amazing to watch Heston perform up to his usual par and display how really bad this movie is . He even plays in a sub - plot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back into the main line of the movie . The way they ended up resolving it was that they did n't . It simply falls off the end.<br /><br />Really . Do n't waste your time on this one .
0 The world is facing imminent destruction and a suicide mission is sent to the Sun to avert catastrophe by firing a bomb into its fiery heart : yes , it 's Solar Crisis , aka Crisis 2050 , which burned up a huge chunk of change that 's never apparent on screen back in 1990 and returned barely enough to buy a Happy Meal for each of the cast in Japan before going straight to video ( remember them ? ) in a re - edited version credited to one Alan Smithee . The plot hook 's pretty much the same as Sunshine - suicide mission to the Sun , saboteur on board , logic cast adrift - except that this time they 're not trying to reignite the sun but to prematurely detonate a solar flare before it can reach Earth . With a talking bomb . Voiced by Paul Williams . Who wants to be promoted so the crew will take him more seriously   Given that the cast also includes Jack Palance at his most dementedly OTT , Charlton Heston at his most rigid , top - liner Tim Matheson at his most anonymous , the original Hills Have Eyes ' unforgettable Michael Berryman ( you may not remember the name , but you DO remember that face ) and Peter Boyle as the industrialist out to sabotage the mission because , er , if it succeeds the world will be saved but his share price will go down , you 'd expect if not a laugh - a - minute at least a laugh every reel . No joy . This is the worst kind of bad movie : a boring one . The fate of the world may be hanging in the balance but the whole film is shot with a complete lack of urgency or momentum at the same unvarying deadly slow pace . There 's low - key and there 's walking through it , but here the cast do n't even do that . Instead , they just stand still looking at screens in near darkness for most of the time . You keep on hoping for Paul Williams ' talking bomb to suffer an existential crisis , but instead the film just ... stands there , doing next to nothing . Literally . This is one of the most inert movies ever made  so inert that if Clive Owen had been cast , he 'd almost have looked lively by comparison . Even a poorly explained suicidal repair attempt fails to raise a fritter of interest since it mostly involves , yep , the cast just standing still looking at screens in near darkness . Even when the bomb prematurely goes into countdown before being launched they deal with the new crisis by   standing still looking at screens in near darkness as if they had all the time in the world . Merchant - Ivory films have better action scenes.<br /><br />Things are n't much livelier down on Earth where the movie spends most of it 's running time with Matheson 's son / Chuck 's grandson Corin Nemec trying to hitch a ride to the spaceport across an arid landscape with Palance 's insane desert artist " looking for that note out there while the chicks still dig me " while waylaid by rejects from a Mad Max ripoff and evil corporate suits who track him down so they can   release him on a nice beach . Just do n't expect logic , if you have n't already guessed that much . Best moment ? A ditzy girl in a bar describing Jack Palance as " An old guy with white hair and a face like rotting leather , " though Chucky Baby taking out the villain 's aircraft with a bazooka fired from the hip from an office window or beating up a barfly who likes his beret are welcome morsels of camp in a film that for 99 % of it 's running time offers a whole lot of nuttin ' . Richard C. Sarafian 's slightly longer original cut that played in Japan offers an additional six minutes but cries out to be cut down to a more manageable 17 minutes : the director of Vanishing Point must have thanked his lucky stars when the re - edit gave him an excuse to take his name off the film . A film so bad it 's not good , and painfully unfunny with it
0 I saw this movie a long time ago ... luckily it was for free . I have to be one of the maybe twenty people who saw this movie in the theater . I do n't remember a whole bunch of it , but I do remember I was incredibly bored , the plot made no sense and when I came out of the theater the only thing I could say was at least now I know what the worst movie I ever saw was . I just was incredibly bothered by one thing : if they can make the temperature as they approach the sun low enough for humans to survive , why ca n't they turn it down to a comfortable temperature instead of being all hot and sweaty ? How stupid do they think we are ?
0 This su*k ! Why do they have to make movies that they must know su*k from the beginning ? I mean , look at Alien from 1977 . If the movie you´r about to make is not better than anything made billions of years before , why make it ? I had problems with the plot and who the main character was . That 's not good either .
0 Final Score : 1.8 ( out of 10)<br /><br />After seeing ' Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back ' I must have been on a big Eliza Dushku kick when I rented this movie . ' Soul Survivors ' is a junk " psychological thriller " dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick - even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up - and - comers like Dushku , Wes Bentley ( American Beauty ) , Casey Affleck ( Drowning Mona ) and likable star Melissa Sagemiller . Luke Wilson is also in there , ridiculously miscast as a priest . The movie , the brainchild of writer / director Stephen Carpenter , seems like a mutant offspring of ' Open Your Eyes ' or ' Vanilla Sky ' and movies where a character ( and the audience ) is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accident / death . The movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved . I do n't think these movies are that entertaining- by their very nature- to begin with , but ' SS ' is rock - bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it . The visuals , the script , the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this . Plus , it 's PG-13 so it does n't even deliver the gore or T&A to sustain it as a guilty pleasure ( even the unrated version is tame ) . I had heard that the movie contained some " hot " shower scene between Dushku & Sagemiller . As the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost I found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene - at least I would get something out of this . Then it comes : the two girls get paint on their shirts , they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off . That 's it . People thought this was hot ? ' Soul Survivors ' is one of those drop - dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have ANY feelings at all toward it . It puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about . In the end it leaves us empty . Carpenter 's finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and that 's probably the most lively part . It will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on USA or the Sci - Fi Channel , due to it 's low cost and PG-13 rating - and that 's probably best for it .
0 Like a relative that gives you a bad gift , Soul Survivors has its heart in the right place but trips up with a bad execution . Stephen Carpenter 's writing / directing effort borrows freely from other , better films , such as Jacob 's Ladder and Abre Los Ojos ( Open Your Eyes ) . For those who have n't seen either of these films , I wo n't give the premise away ; suffice to say it 's not nearly as well handled here than in those two superior films.<br /><br />Melissa Sagemiller stars as Cassie , about to go away to college . Her current boyfriend Sean ( Ben Affleck ) and ex - boyfriend Matt ( Wes Bentley ) , both friends , and Annabel ( acerbic Eliza Dushku ) are in a car accident after being pursued by two killers ( ? ) in transparent masks . She survives the wreck , but while attending college has visions of the hospital ordeal and dead people reappear and disappear , leaving her in a state of total confusion : who is dead ? Who 's alive ? What 's real?<br /><br />Soul Survivors has the look of a bad been - there , done - that , gore - filled , blood - splattered , body - stacking teen exploitation flick . True , it has its share of killer - stalking - the - victim scenes ( plentiful , repetitive , and mind - numbing ) , but at least it attempts to build suspense through ideas rather than cliches , unfortunately rather unsuccessfully . It breeds confusion much more often than cohesion , as the story becomes jumbled , messy and incoherent near key points of the mystery ( predictable as it is.)<br /><br />Horror fans who pick up a copy will have no idea they are in for a film that is more concerned with building an uneasy facade of reality than delivering a body count . Credit goes to Carpenter for attempting to create something beyond a derivative teen horror flick ; too bad he 's created a derivative psychological thriller . Sagemiller also deserves kudos for showing strength in the central performance , actually developing her character and evoking some sense of emotion as the unraveling Cassie . It 's great the filmmakers try something different , but the film ends up a mixed bag and failed experiment.<br /><br />4 out of 10
0 If the writer / director is reading this ( and I imagine you are since you should now be out of work ) then I must tell you - I have seen some bad movies in my time but this one gets the distinction of having the worst premise I 've ever heard.<br /><br />SPOILERS - Nothing happens ! < br /><br />A total waste of time . I laughed out loud at the end . < br /><br />SIDE NOTE - ( if the whole movie was her in a coma then does the scene where she sleeps with that guy mean someone raped her while she was knocked out?)<br /><br />Utter rubbish .
0 ( A possible spoiler or two ) < br /><br / > " Soul Survivors " is quite possibly the worst theatrical released movie ever . Nothing makes sense at all , there 's some plot about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead . The entire movie is just a bunch of random shots of things that do n't really tie together , by the end of the film . < br /><br / > Tha acting is non - existent , the camera work is jerky and the script is so confusing , it just makes the movie even harder to watch.<br /><br / > I kept waiting for something to tie the movie together but nothing came . Definitely the worst film of the year . -****1/2 stars .
0 I wanted to watch this movie because of Eliza Dushku , but she only has a smaller part in it , and her character is n't very likable . However , the main character , played by Melissa Sagemiller , is extremely beautiful and a perfect delight to look at throughout the movie . This is really nothing but a showcase for her looks and talent . She does a very good job.<br /><br />The story itself is , on the face of it , pretty nonsensical . After a car crash , some friends are possibly dead , but keeps on living their previous lives , while all sorts of mysterious things happen . Some bad guys are after them , but we never really find out who they are ( possibly they were the ones in the other car , but we certainly do n't hear anything about why they are after them ) . The final scenes especially seem filmically ambitious , but I ca n't get anything coherent out of it . The opening scene , where the bad guys ( who wear some strange masks ) cut a blond girl 's wrist and gather up some of her blood is never explained or followed up on . Unless the bad guys are supposed to be a representation of the surgeons who 're trying to pull Cassie ( Sagemiller ) back from the dead ... but no , that does n't seem to work . The bad guys are just bad guys ; they really just mess up a story that might otherwise have been interesting . In a supernatural story about death and love and sacrifice , who the hell needs bad guys?<br /><br />3 out of 10 .
0 This is not a very good movie , but it 's not a stinker either . It is very confusing and unnecessarily long so rent it at your own risk.<br /><br />My GF and I have figured this movie out ( we think ) so here it is:<br /><br />***MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW***<br /><br />Firstly , this movie is actually quite simple after you remove all of the confusing unconscious - dream - state junk ( 95 % of the movie.)<br /><br />Ignoring the junk , what REALLY happened is this : A group of school friends go to a rave one night . They leave and get into a car accident where everyone but Cassie and Sean die . That 's the simple cut down version . ( That 's right , I said Sean , bear with me)<br /><br />Right after the accident , Cassie lays in the hospital stuck in between life & death right up until the very end of the movie . This is where the dream part starts.<br /><br />The movie is called SOUL Survivors , right ? Cassie 's mind and soul carries on after the accident interacting with the other souls ( Annie , Matt , Raven , the 2 weirdos and Jude ) along with images conjured up by her mind ( Sean , school and everything else around her ) . The souls continue doing what they were defined as : Annie the rave - going chick , the 2 weirdo - killers ( from opening scene ) , Father Jude still helping people etc.<br /><br />We are then taken on a very long ride , shown lots of images ( many of which my GF and I still ca n't tie in ) but it all boils down to it not being Cassie 's time to die.<br /><br />At the end , Cassie wakes up in the hospital after being " dead " for a while . Her family and Sean are there . This is reality again . She 's OK.<br /><br />Then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream snippet of her in the wheelchair being strangled . But this part is really just a nightmare , and she wakes up beside Sean , obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience.<br /><br />Due to space restrictions , we did n't cover every little thing , but feel free to drop us an e - mail if you want to.<br /><br / >
0 An incoherent mess with a gratingly deafening sound track , " Soul Survivors " is the latest entry in the " who 's dead and who 's alive " genre of horror films . Two teenaged couples , Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel , prepare to go off to different colleges , but before they part until Thanksgiving Break , they attend one last fling at a rave - type party in some burnt - out church at the suggestion of lusciously slutty Annabel ( Eliza Dushku , a.k.a . Faith , the other vampire slayer ) . Motiveless creepy guys start paying far too much attention to Cassie ( the generic Melissa Sagemiller ) for reasons that are never explained , and before long , the quartet leave the party . Driving away in their SUV , they are pursued and then passed by the motiveless creepy guys , who promptly and inexplicably do an intentional 180 in the middle of the highway , causing a nasty and fatal accident as the SUV flips over an embankment and plunges into a river . Sean is killed ( or is he ? ) , and Cassie spends the rest of the movie coping with loneliness and guilt ( she was driving ) when she 's not being haunted by Sean 's ghost or chased by those motiveless creepy guys . Much unexplained incoherence follows as Cassie 's mental state degenerates further , until we reach the predictable conclusion . So , who is dead and who is alive ? After ninety minutes of this purgatory , who actually cares ?
0 I did n't have HUGE expectations for this film when renting it for $ 1 at the video store , but the box at least showed a little promise with its " killer cut " of " more gore ! more sex ! " Ca n't go wrong there ! Well ... needless to say , the box is a fraud . How in the hades did actors and actresses of this caliber sign on for a film this low?<br /><br />It all opens with a drunken college girl walking out of a frat house or some other building like that and saying some useless crap to her boyfriend ( ? ) as a camera on a bad steadicam follows her . Then she gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another . They slit her wrists for no real reason and you can see when they " cut " her that someone drew the cuts with what looks like a crayon.<br /><br />From there , repeat the same theme of the girl getting chased / killed unbrutally by two guys for about 84 more minutes . Add in one tit shot . That is Soul Survivors.<br /><br />I would n't have had a problem with this film had the box not frauded me into renting the flick . If I rent a bad film that claims to have more violence and sex .... I want more violence and sex ! One full frontal shot in 85 minutes from a chick who is clearly androginous and gore that would not scare a child does not cut it . If this is the Killer Cut , what is the Theatrical Cut ? ! Of course , I doubt this garbage was actually put into theaters in the first place . Shame on the actors in this film . I could see them making their screen debuts in here because they have not done anything before , but they were all established before this was released . I do n't know if it was filmed before they had all been established and the studio sat on the film until they were semi - big names or not . But what i want to know is .... they really spent $ 14 million on this film ? !
0 First off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies . Nothing , and I mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling . Most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end ! ! Some people want a movie that makes them " think " through the entire thing , to which I say ... "More power to you " ! ! I on the other hand just want to be entertained . Which brings me back to this stinker , entertainment it is not . This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time . Seems that most here agree also . Most of this did n't make any sense , and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and .... well I guess you see where this is going . Avoid , this one sucks .... bad ! !
0 Melissa Sagemiller , Wes Bentley , Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in the town of Middleton . The four teenagers form two love triangles . One night during an ominous full moon they drive and argue along a slippery and twisting mountain road . Not looking properly they careen into another car and one or more of them are killed . The ghostly nightmare begins ... Pretty lousy and politically correct horror flick without gore and nudity . It 's obviously influenced by " Carnival of Souls".The cinematography is decent , unfortunately there is zero suspense.4 out of 10-just another instantly forgettable teeny - bopper trash .
0 Steve Carpenter can not make horror movies . First of all , the casting was very wrong for this movie . The only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer . This movies has no gore(usually a key ingredient to a horror movie ) , no action , no acting , and no suspense(also a key ingredient ) . Wes Bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that it 's sad . There were a few parts that were supposed to be funny(continuing the teen horror / comedy movies ) and no one laughed in the audience . I thought that this movie was rated R , and I did n't pay attention and realized it had been changed to PG-13 . Anyway , see this movie if you liked I Still Know What You Did Last Summer . That 's the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary . And seriously , this is to you Steve Carpenter , stop making horror movies . This movie makes Scream look like Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
0 ... had I watched it in my teenage years . This movie was mildly entertaining . What I liked about Soul Survivors were the gothic atmosphere during the party scenes , and the constant flips between ' dream ' and ' reality.<br /><br />Had there not been movies like ' The 6th Sense ' and ' Do n't Look Now ' I would have been surprised by the ending .
0 Quite unimpressive . The ' twists ' are all pretty predictable , if you 've seen any movies within the last ten years , and the few somewhat interesting parts ( wherein someone utilizes context clues to make a decision ) are few and lack much punch , since the ' secret ' has already been shown before these clues are explained.<br /><br />(spoilers , sorta)<br /><br />The acting is decent enough . The story simply is n't very interesting . The whole ' still awake ' premise becomes nullified by the astral projection stuff(not kidding ) . < br /><br />The surgery scene is initially tense , a bit discomforting , but then becomes utterly banal.<br /><br />Not horrible , but not memorable . Terrence Howard 's least interesting role to date , so far as I 've seen . < br /><br />Kind of boring , overall .
0 I have seen already fantastic stories , but the premises of this one are so unbelievable that it comes very close to being ridiculous . A rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage , and he is somehow witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him . Even if there is a medical explanation to such a phenomenon what next happens is a mixture of dialog among ... say ... souls ? ... maybe and real life where the dedicated mother will do everything to save the life of her son . There is no shade of suspense or thrill , just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life.<br /><br />This is not to say that the film is completely lacking quality - actually first time director Joby Harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors that includes Hayden Christensen at his first major role after having taken off the Anakin Skywalker costume , fabulous Jessica Alba and super - gifted Lena Olin . All would have deserved a better story .
0 For a film about a killer this is surprisingly dull.<br /><br />Nothing much happens and even when things do happen they do n't generate any real excitement or interest.<br /><br />The acting is good from the two leads , Cassetti in particular delivers a great performance combining the certainty and stupidity of Succo but the rest of the cast also do what they need to.<br /><br />The problem is that there is poor writing and direction and the fact that as a true story it is n't interesting , Succo is not a unique character , he is n't interesting or exciting.<br /><br />Films of this sort normally try to generate tension or empathy or outrage and this generates nothing except a feeling of regret that you wasted your time watching it .
0 Cedric Kahn 's films have been character - based , rather than action - based ( I 'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges ) so it is jarring to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some plodding attempts to give character to Succo . I do n't find Stefano Cassetti to be an interesting actor ; he reminds me of pro athletes who are coaxed into movies , like Bret Favre . That blank stare looks like a really vicious deer caught in the headlights . A real actor would have forced us to reflect more on Succo 's personality , rather than admiring his skill at carjacking.<br /><br />The little acting there is comes mainly from Isild le Besco as the needy schoolgirl Succo takes by storm . The interview at the police office is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future blended in . Le Besco apart , there is little to recommend this film .
0 What a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject . There is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight ( or gay ) man working in a gay sexual environment . The dancers keep talking about their art as if it has no erotic component . They may not all be prostitutes for hire , but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered . From the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then end up hiring the " dancers " for private sessions . Even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the " dancers " only playing to the women in the audience . This just is n't the reality of these clubs . It would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples . So what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients ? We learn very little . Instead we get filler . A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers . A manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag acts but offers no insight into the dancers ' lives and attitudes.<br /><br />The pictures of Mexico City are generic . The phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous.<br /><br />This is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing . The rest of the movie is an insult to gay men .
0 I saw Chan Is Missing when it first came out , about four years after moving from San Francisco to New York . Maybe it was the perspective of a few years away , but this movie seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything else I 'd ever seen ( still does ) . It concentrates on one particular community - the Chinese - but that 's fine , because so much of the city 's soul is refracted through the settings , the faces , and the maybe above all the voices of the characters.<br /><br />This is n't the tourists ' San Francisco . The settings are humble and everyday : a taxi cab , the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant , Richmond District row houses , little Chinatown apartments and small - business offices , the piers , a Philippine elder center . This is what the city looks and feels like day to day to the people who live there - even now , in the era of Silicon Gulch urban redevelopment . Unlike , say , Dirty Harry ( in its own way an excellent San Francisco movie as well ) , everything is filmed at street level : We come to understand the characters ' points of view from the perspective their surroundings give them , not from some fancy vertiginous shooting.<br /><br />Wang apparently filmed in B&W because he did n't have the money to do otherwise , yet one of the strongest visual elements of the movie is the natural light he achieves . The often harsh , pervasive quality of the sunlight is one of my closest associations with San Francisco : It seems to expose everything , bringing the buildings , the hills , the other landmarks down in scale and , in a funny way , making the people you pass on the streets seem more individual and potentially closer to you than they might in another place . Wang 's photography perfectly conveys this , and even helps the story along at points.<br /><br />Wang captures the speech and conversational style of Chinese and other San Franciscans better than anyone ever has , I think . If there 's such thing as a true San Francisco " accent , " it 's what you hear from the balding taxi medallion broker ( I think ) who appears talking on the phone in one scene ( listen to the way he calls the person on the other end " ya dingaling!").<br /><br />The story is poignant and , despite a few very small missteps , makes its points beautifully about the longings that pull at the hearts of people living in old immigrant communities - including the justified political and ethnic resentments , and little ironic amusements , that help to fuel them . All this is communicated delicately - perhaps why some respondents here think the film meanders . It does n't - suffice it to say that the two cab drivers ' quest for Chan becomes a quest for something more personal.<br /><br />Chan Is Missing finishes up with a Chinatown travelogue sequence backed by a goofy novelty song from the 1930s ( I guess ) about San Francisco and all its crazy diversity . An American caricature , yes , but somehow not entirely off the mark either .
0 I watched this on a whim because it was available and I 'd heard the Thumb movies were funny . This one was not . The majority of the jokes were based around " Geranium 's " physique and , in turn , Kate Winslet 's . I think it 's really pathetic of the the " Thumbtanic " creators to stoop so low to make jabs at a respected actress just because she ( heaven forbid ) does n't starve herself into the model of ideal modern beauty.<br /><br />My favorite part was the line that goes something like , " Hey , I have a great idea ! Let 's swim over to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see ! " Thirty seconds of amusement out of a 26 minute movie does not redeem its value .
0 The Thumb idea is n't such a winner the second time round . ThumbTanic was n't as good as Thumb Wars for a number of reasons . Primarily , I think , Mr Oedekerk had far less to work with in the Titanic send - up . Unlike Star Wars , the movie Titanic has n't ( yet ? ) become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will resonate with the audience.<br /><br />In ThumbTanic , the holes are filled by one - off jokes which do n't really seem related to anything . For example , the hero 's insinuation that the heroine is n't clean during the " jump off end of ship " scene - it 's not funny . Rather , you just think to yourself , " Did I miss something in the original movie ? " . There were too many of these type of baseless jokes ( cf . arachnid).<br /><br />By contrast , the send - up of the smarmy ship 's designer had meaning and was funny . Also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go " faster " as a maniac running around demanding * everything * be " faster " including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die . These sort of jokes meant something in the Titanic context and lent meaningful humour to Thumbtanic.<br /><br />The thumb " media " , the faces and the voices , are still amusing . The props and sets and the CG animation are worthy of appreciation . Overall , although ThumbTanic proves that quirkiness alone wo n't work , this filmette still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end .
0 What this movie fails from answering is how wrong this war is ( and most US wars recently made only to get some oil).<br /><br />How many innocent civilian casualties there has been , how many lives perished and how blatantly stupid the perpetrators are.<br /><br />So , let me ask you - if American soldier kills women and children apart from enemy , its OK , but if government accidentally kills their own forces by deadly chemicals while killing many civilians as well , it is not ? Your logic fails , gentleman.<br /><br />I'll give it 5 for the solid performance and 1 to everything else , 3 in total .
0 Another vast conspiracy movie that tries to blame the US government and the Armed Forces ( especially the Army ) for every disaster since the Great Flood . Anyone who has ever served time in the US military can see how bogus this film is . Uniforms , equipment , sets , and mannerisms are all wrong . ( And of course , all Senior Officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots . ) Blatant propaganda with no attempt at objectivity . Most of the theories presented have been disproven over the past few years . Uses every cliche ' , rumor , and Urban Legend from the Gulf - all are presented as gospel . ( The truth is , no one knows for sure why some GW vets are sick and others are healthy as horses . ) PS This is not new . War is NOT fun and I know WWII , Korean , and Viet Nam vets with some pretty serious ailments , too . ( And the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them . ) Sensationalistic movies like this will not solve the problem !
0 Apparently none of the previous reviewers , most of whom praise the film for its accuracy , have actually read a biography of Louis Pasteur . The most glaring inaccuracy is in the relationship between Pasteur and Napoleon III.Back in the 1930 's the latter was invariably shown in a bad light . While far from an admirable character - he was an inept politician and a self - appointed " military genius " who allowed France to be dragged into a disastrous war , he was not the stupid reactionary depicted here . He had an intelligent interest in science , and like many other people in the 19th century saw a bright future because of the improvements it would bring . Far from exiling Pasteur , he was his PATRON , building him a laboratory and providing him with all the resources that he needed for his research . While the lab was under construction , Pasteur became gravely ill . A bureaucrat , deciding it was a waste of money to build a laboratory for someone who would soon be dead , ordered work halted on his own authority . When the emperor heard about this , his outrage shook the bureaucracy so that there was a flurry of buck - passing , and work promptly resumed . The Emperor personally visited Pasteur to comfort him and reassure him that he would get his lab . The emperor would often bring members of his court to admire Pasteur 's projects , and it was obvious to everyone that Pasteur was one of the emperor 's favorites . Pasteur 's main worry concerning the Emperor was that Napoleon thought Pasteur was virtually a miracle worker who could do almost anything , and was constantly assigning him tasks outside of his previous experience . Pasteur , a very modest man , was always protesting this , but Napoleon would say that he had complete faith in him , and Pasteur despite his misgivings , always came through . They always had a close and friendly relationship , and after the Emperor was overthrown , Pasteur refused to say a bad word about him , grateful to the end of his life.<br /><br />The part about his daughter having the baby , and Pasteur sacrificing his principles to get a doctor , never happened . The part about the anthrax and rabies , for which he was famous , is generally correct , but the notion that the anthrax experiment raised him from obscurity to fame is false . He was famous and respected at the time this happened . This movie is OK from a dramatic standpoint , but very distorted as biography .
0 Entertainment Tonight has been going down hill for the last few years , but as of last night ( Aug 17th 2006 ) they reached a new low.<br /><br />In an effort to try to hype up their broadcast , they decided to post actual photos of JonBenet Ramsey 's body in their teasers last night ... saying " Pictures from the case you have never seen before " . The two photos were graphic and very disturbing . One was of the side of her face and head / neck and you could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her around her neck , and bruising on her face . This was so hideously awful , I could not believe it . How has this got to do with ANYTHING remotely related to Hollywood Entertainment ? ? Nothing ! ! They have dropped their level of dignity and values to a new low .... and it shows . This used to be THE premiere show to watch ... and it 's just garbage now.<br /><br />I will watch Access Hollywood from now on .
0 This show is unbelievable in that . . . what it represents and what it focuses on and . . . words can not describe how insane ET is . They will report anything . If a celebrity is even remotely indirectly connected to the story ET will report on it . If a dog poop in the Tom Cruise 's yard they will report on it . If a celebrity dies . . . they will talk about it for weeks on end to the point where the public envy that celebrity . If a celebrity is on trial . . . ET will report it for MONTHS on end . There is no end to what this show will reports and no time frame that dictates how long they will focus on a story . Is it even considered legitimates reporting ? The reports are so dang annoying too , with harsh rambling voices and end with an unnecessary pause to convey a sense of important . I can not watch this show without questioning humanity 's existence . ET is one big reason I avoid pre - evening shows in general . I regret that IMDb can only allow a minimum of one star rating and not zero or even in the negatives . For this show deserve -10 Stars .
0 ET 's obsession with Dannielynn Smith is despicable . Leave the child alone . With all the constant attention she 'll most likely grow up psychotic , depressed or worse . Think of Princess Diana and how she longed for privacy . Now poor little rich girl Ashley Olson just wants to be left alone . No wonder Greta Garbo became a recluse and said " I want to be alone " . How much does ET make off this little girl ? Does ET not have anything better to report on ? I bet there 's lots of people who really do n't care what color her birthday cake and balloons were . By the way , I never heard that Anna Nichole ever won any of those court cases over the will and her inheritance . Who is paying for the lifestyle of Larry , Howard and little Dannielynn ? Could it be ET ?
0 Like most people I love " A Christmas Story " . I had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason -- it is awful . Same locale , same narrator , same director but the warm fuzziness of the original was lacking . Charles Grodin was a poor choice to replace Darrin McGavin but I can not imagine anyone being able to replace him . The story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original . The interaction with the neighbors , the Bumpuses , is ridiculous . In " A Christmas Story " Ralphie 's obsession with the BB gun seems cute but his obsession in this movie is boring . Scud Farkus , the original neighborhood bully , is replaced in this film by yet another kid with braces and a weird hat but with little of the Scud Farkus menacing appeal . It would be pretty difficult to equal the original , even if this movie had been made with the original crew .
0 " A Christmas Story " is one of many people 's all - time most beloved films . ACS was able to take the viewer to a time and a place in such a way that very few films ever have . It had a sweetness and goodwill to it that is rare.<br /><br />So I awaited ( and awaited ) its sequel , " It Runs In The Family " . The film was almost released a couple of times , only to be pulled at the last minute . When it finally came out , IRITF was ( and is , I guess ) a total failure.<br /><br />The sets and cinematography were just fine , but the directing totally , completely missed the mark . The film was nothing more than a cash - flow formula of lazy casting , lazy writing , and disconnected acting.<br /><br />The narrator , Jean Shepard , who was one of America 's great humorists and story - tellers , forced upon us a false reprise of the warm wit he used in ACS . He over - emoted , and why he did that I 'll never know . He somehow managed to become an annoying , overwrought parody of himself.<br /><br />The writing and acting in IRITF is inauthentic and forced . The actors may have seen ACS , but whatever wit and nuance that was in ACS must n't have registered at all on any of them . The acting was embarrassingly slapstick and bereft of any of Shepard 's dry humor.<br /><br />ACS will always be a real treasure , but to call IRITF a sequel is to insult all of the fans of Jean Shepard and ACS .
0 Since its release in 1983 , " A Christmas Story " , the Jean Shepherd - narrated story of his alter - ego , Ralphie , has become a true classic . " My Summer Story " , however , still has Shepherd as the narrator , but it has absolutely none of the charm , and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film.<br /><br />"My Summer Story " is basically a mishmash of mediocre and just plain not very interesting stories , which include hillbilly neighbors and battling tops . Charles Grodin , who I normally like , is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father ( more aptly handled by Darren McGavin in the original ) , and his character never seems anything but forced . Kiernan Culkin is a poor substitute for Ralphie , and the little brother is all but forgotten here . Only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps that 's because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on " free dish night".<br /><br />The stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paper - thin . May appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to " A Christmas Story " , it 's a very poor one and not worth most people 's time . 2 out of 10 .
0 Funny how a studio thinks it can make a sequel to what was a classic Christmas story with an entirely new cast and expect it to float . Sure they used various actors for Batman , but in that instance Batman was a classic character before any of the actor donned his cape . In this instance you had a classic character in the blond headed horn rimmed glasses wearing Ralphy that wanted a red ryder bb gun for Christmas ... Somehow we are supposed to forget him and accept another little boy that share no resemblance to the original ... If I had not known it was a sequel I would n't have guessed it from the cast ... except of course Charles Grodin tries so hard to imitate Darrin McGavin that your are constantly reminded that the original was far better ... <br /><br />In the end it might have work if they had cast the movie better . They should have looked for look a likes or simply ignored the original and not tried to copy its look and feel . This one is just a cheap imitation . The Ralphy evokes no sympathy just a desire to seem his character shoot his eye out or die .
0 Really bad . Why anyone thinks this is a good film let alone funny is a true mystery . I like comedies as much as the next man and I LOVED " A Christmas Story . " The fact that it has the same director and was based on the same writer 's memoirs has me completely puzzled as to why this film is such a complete failure on every level . Charles Grodin is woefully miscast as the father for starters . For another it does not seem to have the same pacing -- it just does n't flow well . Everything seems tired and forced . The joy of life that permeated the first film is completely absent here -- you just want the movie to end . I would n't even recommend this movie for curiosity - seekers who enjoyed " A Christmas Story . " It 's that bad . 1/10 .
0 This is an in - name - only sequel to " A Christmas Story , " originally entitled " A Summer Story . " Ralphie narrates his family adventures during the summer when they moved to a small hick - town in the middle of nowhere . Hilarity , unfortunately , does not ensue.<br /><br />The original worked because of its irreverent nature and honesty - everyone could relate to it . This one is simply stupid and not very funny at all . Charles Grodin 's last movie - no wonder ! It 's one of his poorest roles . I felt sorry for him.<br /><br />Mary Steenburgen is given little to do , everything 's formulaic , and you have to wonder why they even bothered.<br /><br />And I mean , come on - a competition with spinning tops ? ! Sadly , it 's the best part of the movie ...
0 A Christmas Story Is A Holiday Classic And My Favorite Movie . So Naturally , I Was Elated When This Movie Came Out In 1994 . I Saw It Opening Day and Was Prepared To Enjoy Myself . I Came Away Revolted And Digusted . The Anticipation that Rang True In A Christmas Story Is Curiously Missing from This mess . A Red Ryder BB Gun Is Better to get than a chinese top . And It Is Not Very Funny At all . Charles Grodin Is Good but the Buck Stops There . Bottom Line:1 Star . Do n't Even Bother .
0 This movie was not very entertaining , certainly NO WHERE as original or as good as A Christmas Story . The characters ( except the youngest ) try to emulate the preceding actors , and they fail . The hillbilly neighbors come out of nowhere as they were n't a part of the first movie . This really sucked , might have been good with the original cast , then again maybe not because the story is so weak . Skip it .
0 Ugh ! Where to begin ... first , Campbell Scott 's non - stop angst becomes a real turn - off after awhile ( a very short while ) as he internalizes his mounting anguish , curiosity and anger . Only we do n't care ! These characters as presented by the writer and director are wholly unlikable , and therein lies the key . They have n't given us anything to make us care if they are adulterous and whether or not they are still in love with one another . When Scott quietly tells his wife , " I could kill you " before their three daughters at the dinner table , after the shock of his selfishly poor timing wore off I almost wished that he had -- and then done the same thing to the smug , wisecracking apparition of Denis Leary before being hauled off the the looney bin . An utter waste of time and perhaps -- only perhaps -- resources .
0 Basically , a dentist husband - wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity . The premise is interesting , the acting is good , and the music , although sometimes abrupt and without direction , is pretty cool.<br /><br />The problem is the plot . The husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show ( she has a minor role ) and then walks back in to give her something , but sees her with another man . The rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode , his visual hallucinations and a macho alter - ego ( Denis Leary , a former patient of his ) and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to " do something about it . " I wo n't tell you the ending , but let me say that the film goes nowhere and the ending is like a sputtering whimper . The motivations of the characters are missing : Why is she cheating on him ? He 's a dentist , decent looking , good father . The film does n't say . Who 's she doing it with ? Do n't expect any answers on that either . Why does he want to keep the marriage going in spite of all this ? Who knows . What purpose does all the kids vomiting serve ? Where is this film going ? Good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis ( and Denis Leary as comic relief)are completely wasted by this stilted nonsense which does n't know if it wants to be American Beauty or a family film . A root canal is more interesting . Avoid it .
0 I tend to like character - driven films . I also think Hope Davis turns in consistently good work , so I had high hopes for this movie . Those hopes were soon dashed.<br /><br />The main flaw with this movie is the direction . There are a lot of scenes that are daydream sequences . The movie makes frequent use of the Denis Leary character as the alter ego of the Campbell Scott character . It does n't work for me at all . This would have worked better as a play than a movie.<br /><br />There are problems with the plot as well . It is important that the characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place different from where they started . I did n't feel that the characters grew in the experiences portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Finally , the editing was n't well done , either . There was a very big sag in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally boring.<br /><br />Except for acting , which I felt was consistently strong , this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema .
0 There may something poetically right in seeing dentists suffer . Suffer they do , in this dreary , truly dreadful film , but they cause the audience to undergo pain of the non - dental variety too . If you ever wanted to see a movie full of screaming kids , barfing kids , sick kids , lots of long , long meaningful glances , a deadpan wife and a concerned husband : it 's all here for you . Boring , overlong , it stands out as one of those examples that scream out : why ? Is there a saving grace ? Yes , there is . There is a short scene from Nabucco , with some pretty good singing . Save your money , or if it 's on TV or cable , save your time . You can always read a book or make an omelette .
0 Yeh , I know -- you 're quivering with excitement . Well , * The Secret Lives of Dentists * will not upset your expectations : it 's solidly made but essentially unimaginative , truthful but dull . It concerns the story of a married couple who happen to be dentists and who share the same practice ( already a recipe for trouble : if it was n't for our separate work - lives , we 'd all ditch our spouses out of sheer irritation ) . Campbell Scott , whose mustache and demeanor do n't recall Everyman so much as Ned Flanders from * The Simpsons * , is the mild - mannered , uber - Dad husband , and Hope Davis is the bored - stiff housewife who channels her frustrations into amateur opera . One night , as Dad & the daughters attend one of Davis ' performances , he discovers that his wife is channeling her frustrations into more than just singing : he witnesses his wife kissing and flirting with the director of opera . ( One nice touch : we never see the opera - director 's face . ) Dreading the prospect of instituting the proceedings for separation , divorce , and custody hearings -- profitable only to the lawyers -- Scott chooses to pretend ignorance of his wife 's indiscretions.<br /><br />Already , the literate among you are starting to yawn : ho - hum , another story about the Pathetic , Sniveling Little Cuckold . But Rudolph , who took the story from a Jane Smiley novella , hopes that the wellworn - ness of the material will be compensated for by a series of flashy , postmodern touches . For instance , one of Scott 's belligerent patients ( Denis Leary , kept relatively -- and blessedly -- in check ) will later become a sort of construction of the dentist 's imagination , emerging as a Devil - on - the - shoulder advocate for the old - fashioned masculine virtues ( " Dump the b --- h ! " , etc . ) . When not egged - on by his imaginary new buddy , Scott is otherwise tormented by fantasies that include his wife engaged in a three - way with two of the male dental - assistants who work in their practice . It 's not going too far to say that this movie is * Eyes Wide Shut * for Real People ( or Grown - Ups , at least ) . Along those lines , Campbell Scott and Hope Davis are certainly recognizable human beings as compared to the glamourpuss pair of Cruise and Kidman . Further , the script for * Secret Lives * is clearly more relevant than Kubrick 's . As proof , I offer the depiction of the dentists ' children , particularly the youngest one who is about 3 or 4 years old , and whose main utterance is " Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! DAD ! ! ! " This is Family Life , all right , with all its charms.<br /><br />The movie would make an interesting double - bill with * Kramer vs. Kramer * , as well . One can easily trace the Feminization of the American Male from 1979 to 2003 . In this movie , Dad is the housewife as in * Kramer * , but he is in no way flustered by the domestic role , unlike Dustin Hoffman , who was too manly to make toast . Here , Scott gets all the plumb chores , such as wiping up the children 's vomit , cooking , cleaning , taking the kids to whatever inane after - school activity is on the docket . And all without complaint . ( And without directorial commentary . It 's just taken for granted.)<br /><br />The film has virtues , mostly having to do with verisimilitude . However , it 's dragged down from greatness by its insistence on trendy distractions , which culminate in a long scene where a horrible five - day stomach flu makes the rounds in the household . We must endure pointless fantasy sequences , initiated by the imaginary ringleader Leary . Whose existence , by the way , is finally reminiscent of the Brad Pitt character in * Fight Club*. And this finally drives home the film 's other big flaw : lack of originality . In this review , I realize it 's been far too easy to reference many other films . Granted , this film is an improvement on most of them , but still . * The Secret Lives of Dentists * is worth seeing , but do n't get too excited about it . ( Not that you were all that excited , anyway . I guess . )
0 It 's common practice for a film about repression to be somewhat muted in style and tone . There 's a difference , however , between using restraint and encouraging narcolepsy among audience members . In " The Secret Lives of Dentists , " starring Campbell Scott and Hope Davis , director Alan Rudolph plays as close to the vest as possible , with the result being a film that never amounts to much beyond a rumination on how teeth are a metaphor for married life.<br /><br />Scott gives a fine performance in the role of David Hurst , a dentist married to another dentist ( Davis ) . Rudolph sets up the dynamic of their relationship quickly - he is completely absorbed in the day - to - day duties of being the parenthood , she is quietly disillusioned with their frantic family life - and then ratchets up the tension when Scott may or may not witness his wife with another man . From this point on , the film focuses on whether or not David is going to confront his wife Dana about her possible adultery , or whether she will beat him to the punch and leave for good . From time to time , David is treated to visits from an imaginary " friend " in the form of a former patient played by Denis Leary ( borrowing heavily from Brad Pitt 's Tyler Durden in " Fight Club").<br /><br />While there is enough uncertainty about Dana 's infidelity and David 's instability to warrant examination , the last two thirds of the film are embarrassingly empty of theme or narrative . Instead , Rudolph creates drama out of a nasty fever that travels slowly through the Hurst family , culminating in a pointless hospital visit at the film 's climax . The film never picks up on the hints at what David is really capable of if he was n't so dedicated to his family ; neither does it spend much time looking at Dana 's precarious balancing act between her family life and her other , more fulfilling ambitions.<br /><br />By choosing to spend the majority of the film worrying over a fever gone awry , Rudolph kills the momentum of his film . By the time the fifth member of the family shows up sweating and sickly , the film has used up all the good graces of Scott 's well - measured performance . David and Dana end up retracing their steps over and over again until a less than cathartic finale . With nothing to build on over the last hour , the conclusion seems awkward and patched - on . " The Secret Lives of Dentists " takes a common theme and does nothing to improve upon it . Altogether , a disappointing , unimaginative film .
0 An idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful . So , no new story lines here . However , the authors managed to create a stupid , disgusting film . If you enjoy watching kids vomiting , or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife 's teeth out in a bloody horror - type , go see ( or rent ) the film . If not , move on to something else ( MY FAIR LADY , anyone ? )
0 Alan Rudolph is a so - so director , without that special touch . As an example , there was one shot in The Secret Lives of Dentists in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife . Rudolph squandered it . The camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways of the two dental offices , with Dana and Dave each alone in their respective rooms . You get the idea of their desolation and isolation , but not much more . The lighting , the colors , the body language , the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon . If I were directing , I would have spent all day , if necessary , to get that shot right . That 's the beauty and power of film : it can express so much , whole lives , in a matter of seconds < br /><br />The shot with the toddler stepping in the puddle of puke could have been improved on . The child should have shown more fascination with the puddle , should have stomped and shuffled her feet , should have had her head bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention . < br /><br />Campbell did n't deliver . He plays a uncommunicative man , true , but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice , gesture , body movement , the film relies on voice - over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter - ego , played by Denis Leary .
0 I 'm sorry , but this is such a bad movie it 's hilarious . Football hooligans arguing in a travel lodge ? Suits ? Shades ? ! Alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he made this , it is as far from the truth as you can get.<br /><br />The casting was atrocious ... Gary Oldman as a football hooligan ? He does n't look scary , act scary or even come across as someone who would like football . And as for Yeti ? What the hell ? Suits , shades and sitting in a travelodge childishly taunting each other with " its about time you got your nappy on " . Please.<br /><br />And the Yeti 's gang spraying the ICC 's underwear ? < br /><br />I do n't see how anyone can even take this film seriously!.<br /><br />4/10 . Its possibly the most inaccurate portrayal of the crisis of the late eighties hooliganism i have ever seen .
0 What a shame that Alan Clarke has to be associated with this tripe . That does n't rule it out however ; get a group of lads and some Stellas together and have a whale of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in tears of laughter . Great wasted night stuff . Al Hunter homes in on a well publicised theme of the late 80s- that hooligans were well organised and not really interested in the football itself- often with respectable jobs ( estate agent ? ? ? ) . But how Clarke can convince us that any of the two - bit actors straying from other TV productions of low quality ( Grange Hill ) or soon to go on to poor quality drama ( Eastenders ) can for a nanosecond make us believe that they are tough football thugs is laughable . Are we really to believe that the ICF ( on whom of course the drama is based ) would EVER go to another town to fight with just SIX blokes?<br /><br />The ICF would crowd out tube stations and the like with HUNDREDS . Andy Nicholls ' Scally needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature . The acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs- Oldman is so camp it is unbelievable . Most of them look as though they should be in a bubble of bath of Mr Matey . A true inspiration to anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a flick- go for it .
0 This is very much a television version of the tale , the film starts out like an episode of ' Xena ... ' , with little meaningful dialog or character description . It does get a bit more substantive after a while , but all characters are still cartoonish . < br /><br />Salma is the exotic beauty . Richard Harris is an evil and sexually repressed Frollo , fiending to bust a nut up in Salma . The other characters , including Quasimodo are quite forgettable . < br /><br />Its also a sorta liberal version of the story , Frollo is a suppressor of Enlightenment ideals , like the abbot in ' Name of the Rose ' , and Quasimodo is a champion of liberty . The shadowy side of the Quas character is ignored , though he does pour liquid led on people . He is really only an outsider in that he looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than the average person . < br /><br />Perhaps the film is intended for children , but I doubt it , considering Frollo flogs himself bloody to amend wanting to spank his monkey . A mostly uninteresting and forgettable , but not awful , and sometimes entertaining , rendition of the tale .
0 -=contains spoiler from both original and movie versions=-<br /><br />i am a huge fan of Notre dame De Paris musical , i also read book this summer and i watched movie today , in the beginning i was hopeful to watch a good film especially when i saw 6.3 IMDb point.first scenes were good but i actually waited for , theaters scene directly from book , but it was normal but when Esmeralda kisses gringoire i felt something is wrong .. they do n't even kiss in book , even in musical .. <br /><br />and there were huge gap why Esmeralda being judged by sorcerer , in the book she teaches her goat how to respond numbers of clock or write word " phoebus " .. wait there were a phoebus were n't there ? in this movie he is some soldier junk nothing more , the creators made Quasimodo 's love to show around and they even canceled Frollo 's love .. but Notre dame was frollo . his thoughts his struggles between love of god and love of human in movie we ca nt find anything like that all we have is , some villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts .. and not mentioning phoebus , not mentioning love of frollo , not mentioning jehan ( brother of frollo ) not mentioning mother of Esmeralda ( maybe it is OK , the storyline would have chopped much)they even not mentioned the real story .. ( another PS : frollo was n't a opus dei or some cult member he actually in interest with alchemy he tries to make gold .. he was stuck in science and religion)<br /><br />finally do n't watch this movie , it is some kind of directors edition to real masterpiece , and if you have watched it before read the book , god have mercy on you .. you must read to book immediately .. <br /><br />this movie is worse than hunchback of Notre dame II the animated movie , spend your time with watching Notre dame De Paris musical .. enough said ..
0 This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen . Jessica Simpson not only lacks any acting skill , but the script is incredibly shallow and lame . You actually hear serious dialogue that goes , " I love you more . " " No , I love YOU more . " I stopped watching the movie ( online ) after the first half hour , I could n't take it anymore . Her " southern girl charm " just does n't work and is really quite annoying ; her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the script right off the page.<br /><br />Poor Luke Wilson . Did he not read the script before agreeing to do this , or did he fall for Papa Joe 's ( Jessica 's dad and also the producer of the movie ) promise of big profits ? Hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie like this . Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate seeing the pained look on his face as he suffers through the bad dialogue.<br /><br />Also , I think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by Papa Joe to give the movie a better rating . No one in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging.<br /><br />Jessica has lots of money , right ? Maybe buy some acting lessons ?
0 Who wrote this ? Some guy named John Cohen . I guess this was the first screenplay he 's ever worked on . Someone should 've told him you 're supposed to write dialog that sounds like something someone actually might say.<br /><br />And who directed this ? Scott Marshal ? Son of Gerry Marshall . My the nut has fallen far from the tree . Someone might have wanted to let him know that you can , in fact , shoot a scene in a cab in New York , and it will look real , and you wo n't have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason . Might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from Jessica Simpson , but hopefully he 's learned that lesson now.<br /><br />And Jessica Simpson ... naturally she ca n't act . Hell , she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn , and yet she 's starring in this movie . OH wait , it was produced by her father . Okay , that 's why she got the part . That 's really the only reason I can think of.<br /><br />So should I be surprised it 's bad ? No . Should I be amazed at how bad it is ? I think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as I did . I mean you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad , but this ... it 's not just bad , it 's the complete opposite of a classic film . Think of a great Woody Allen movie , this film is as bad as that film is good . It 's the Anti - Annie Hall.<br /><br />I am so glad I did n't pay to see it , I stopped watching ten minutes in cus I could n't go on . No doubt I would 've walked out of the theater sooner . In fact I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing . The film starts out laughably bad , and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture . And then , around when the first act is ending , you realize it 'll only get worse , and that 's when you either need to leave , or kill yourself.<br /><br />In conclusion , this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water boarding at Guantanamo Bay . Although some prefer the water boarding .
0 This is an embarrassment to everyone and everything used in making this joke . I personally do n't care one way or another about Jessica Simpson and her talent or whatever so many people find fascinating about her . Just as a movie this is something that would n't even get a passing grade in film school . The script is a mess , the acting is atrocious , and the fact Luke Wilson ( co - writer of " Bottle Rocket " ) did this makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking . He did " Old School " for crying out loud ! This does n't even belong in the same state as my " Old School " DVD ! Please for whatever reason DO NOT WATCH THIS ! I see there is a comment that this is so bad it 's good , but that frankly is too kind . When will we stop seeing singers that obviously ca n't act keep trying to , I hope ends soon . The worst part is that there are actually some decent actors ( Penelope Ann Miller , Rachel Leigh Cook , & Luke Wilson ) who are part of this dump . As far as the plot , well it is almost non - existent and so poorly done and written ( yes I know it 's another rehash ) I very much doubt anyone will remember anything about this . Please whatever you do do n't waste your time , but if you do , feel sorry for the ACTUAL actors involved for wasting their time doing this bomb . Jessica Simpson you 're pretty , but stick to singing , although I 'm not much a fan of that either . And whoever did this film , I would n't put this on your resume . 1/10 because you ca n't give a zero .
0 By now you should already know about this film , the Jessica Simpson " bomb " that pretty much went straight to video ( limited , anemic theatrical run ) . Basically , Ms. Simpson 's Katie travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend , to surprise him , only to find him in bed with another woman . She is stranded , but has one friend ( Rachel Leigh Cook , whom I wish we saw more often in film ) , who lets her stay . Katie ends up getting a job via two conniving co - workers ( Penelope Ann Miller and the always amusing Andy Dick ) who are just using Katie to get the president of the firm ( Larry Miller ) ousted . This is strictly a b movie , its not meant to be profound . Jessica Simpson is not a great actress by any means , but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying . The film is watchable in that its not an abomination , but its throwaway fluff . In a cameo , Penny Marshall is funny ( a subtle in - joke about Milwaukee made me chuckle ) , and there is a funny scene involving Norwegian priests ( do n't read too much into this ) . So , not horrible , but easy to skip . Your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does . Again , not good , but not a profound disaster .
0 This was a silly movie with a predictable storyline and dreadful acting ! ! Willy Nelson was as stiff as his braids . The movie just seemed like a very long advert for the bright red lipstick that Jessica Simpson wore - especially as there were so many close - ups on her face . The premise was not amusing and as I said - soooooooo predictable . Whatever money was spent on making this movie was a shameful waste . Any allusions to other old Marilyn Monroe movies did not enhance the viewing of Blonde Ambition at all . It was also so unbelievable - Jessica Simpson being able to step into an executive secretary position at the drop of a hat - that was laughable ! ! !
0 Watching this I mainly noticed the ad placements . DHL , Aquawhite Strips , Rockstar and more . It 's one product placement after another . It 's quite obvious how this movie got its funding . Jessica Simpson 's " acting " is laughable . Any Dick should n't ever get work because he plays the same lame character . The " story " is just a backdrop for this very long commercial . I ca n't believe this movie was even considered for theatrical release . The longer you watch this movie the more you 're embarrassed for everyone involved . The only minor saving grace is Larry Miller and Rachael Lee Cook , who gets almost no screen time as Jessica 's cousin . I 'm embarrassed I watched the whole thing . I would recommend avoiding this one .
0 This movie had all the elements to be a smart , sparkling comedy , but for some reason it took the dumbass route . Perhaps it did n't really know who its audience was : but it 's hardly a man 's movie given the cast and plot , yet is too slapstick and dumb - blonde to appeal fully to women.<br /><br />If you have seen Legally Blonde and its sequel , then this is like the bewilderingly awful sequel . Great actors such as Luke Wilson should expect better material . Jessica Simpson could also have managed so much more . Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusing.<br /><br />Many things in this movie were paint - by - numbers , the various uber - cliché montages , the last minute " misunderstanding " , even the kids ' party chaos . This just suggests lazy scriptwriting.<br /><br />It should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you do n't take it seriously , but it 's such a glaring could - do - better than you 'll likely feel frustrated and increasingly disappointed as the scenes roll past .
0 The story goes something like this : A small - town girl , Katie ( Jessica Simpson ) , decides to visit her boyfriend in the big city . When she arrives she discovers he is n't quite as faithful as he should be . Katie then ends up venturing into the adventure that is New York . Filling in as bike messenger comedic and charming mishaps ensues . She falls into a hole in the ground and thus meets charismatic good - guy Ben ( Luke Wilson ) . It 's not love at first sight , at least for her , but destiny and Ben , wo n't give up quite that easy . Being " just " a small - town girl AND blonde a couple of evil executives at a building firm decides she 's the perfect scapegoat for their cunning plan . Misunderstandings with hilarious and sad consequences follow . However , this is one blonde who wo n't take it lying down!<br /><br />People being judgmental of this film will soon enough be proved wrong . The jokes are confident and fitting , and the story well developed . The relationship between Katie and Ben feels so natural that it puts anything Godard has created to shame . The multi - talented Jessica Simpson once again surprises with a strong role only she could pull off . Simpson really is the Marilyn Monroe of our day ( there 's even one scene honoring her ! ) . She balances perfectly between vulnerable and whimsy . Katie really does show us that you ca n't judge a book by its cover ! Luke Wilson is as charming as ever . Even if he was covered in manure that man would be as appealing as anyone . His light touch , puppy dog eyes and laid back manner makes it difficult to resist . Andy Dick plays the role he was born to play , one of the two diabolical executives . He really can not be underestimated . The strength of the performance lies in his restraint . It 's remarkable , because most actors would just run away with it and play it for cheap laughs . Not this guy ! < br /><br />In conclusion , director Scott Marshall has crafted an intelligent and frequently hilarious comedy that is destined to become a classic alongside masterpieces of cinema like Epic Movie and Norbit . Kudos to everyone involved in this , especially Jessica Simpson . Her sincere smile and whole - hearted laughter would make even the toughest man break out in a big grin . You may be tough , but you 're not THAT tough ! Warmly recommended to everyone who wants to be swept off their feet and see a romantic comedy that for once , feels honest . Thank you for this film ! Oh , and the soundtrack rocks ! < br /><br />Now if you still have n't gotten it . I 'm being sarcastic . 1/10
0 This might be unbelievable , but this movie has grossed $ 878,138 in Russia ! It 's shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running ! Well , I have no idea why distributors put their eye on this particular uh " movie " , which had almost no screening around the world . That 's some kind of enigma ! Haha ! Maybe it was based on the fact that another movie , " Pledge This " with Paris Hilton , which was as well released only DVD almost everywhere , had major screenings in Russia and grossed more than 1mln$. Besides , both movies had a lot of promotion , like there were the banners all over the city , TV commercials and etc . Speaking about movie , I 'd say it 's dull and absolutely boring . It could be better , really . Even if it has Jessica Simpson .
0 I knew this movie was n't going to be amazing , but I thought I would give it a chance . I am a fan of Luke Wilson so I thought it had potential . Unfortunately , a lot of the movie 's dialog was very fake sounding and cheesy . I think that Aquafresh gave some money towards the production of the film because they were seriously dropping some hints throughout . There is a shot where the Aquafresh sign sticks out at you that you ca n't help but notice it . Maybe they should have focused on writing and acting more than how many times can we drop Aquafresh products in the movie without people getting annoyed . The movie had its moments , but I 'm glad I did n't spend $ 9.50 to see it in the theater .
0 ( First of all , excuse my bad English ) Of course only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include serious goofs like this .. I 'm a norwegian and I felt offended and shocked the makers of this movie did not take the time to do their research upon making this American/"Norwegian " movie . Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country.<br /><br />So I 'm posting my corrections out of my frustration : -The Country is named Norway , not Norwegia . -"Da " is Russian , not norwegian . -Norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far -It 's true we have a native traditional folk - outfit ( that we only use like twice a year ) but the outfit in this movie is more like a German outfit . -I could NOT understand the so called " norwegian " in this movie .. Jessica was not making any sense .. neighter did the " norwegian priests" < br /><br />The only thing I recognise is the norwegian flag ( and the viking hats , but that 's so stereotypic what people think about norway - vikings!:O gosh)<br /><br />Well .. I guess the people who made this film will never read this comment . but at least I cleared some things up and got rid of some of that frustration .. !<br /><br />I'm proud of my country and I 'd love if people in the US were less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country.<br /><br />That was all .. Lenge leve Norge ! ; p
0 Ahh this film had so much potential ! A good cast of quality B actors , the thighs of Jessica Simpson and ... that is about it!<br /><br />I believe some guy in some unnamed marketing department had an idea . Basically , lets do a kind of Legally Blond film , but do it in New York . That big bright city of chances , power and money and where everyone is a heartless , power / money hungry person . Let 's add to this Jessica Simpson , small town bimbo , that brother of Owen Wilson and for some no apparent reason Andy Dick ( only because of him you should ignore this film).<br /><br />Basic story line:<br /><br />Boy leaves girl for NY , girl follows , boy cheats , girl stays in NY with cousin , gets a job under false pretenses , mucks up , is courted by other boy ( Brother Wilson ) and together save the day and kiss.<br /><br />a few words come to mind when reflecting upon this film , i.e. dire , awful , unbearable , intolerable and xenophobic < br /><br />Just do n't watch this film , you will be happier . One reviewer referred to Guantanamo and i definitely agree with him . This film induces shock . And I know what you are thinking ... at least at some point will I see Simpson naked or close too . It 's not gon na happen , spare yourself the time and YouTube her . You will have better sexy time!<br /><br />The films editing is flimsy , the acting is unbearable , and why do they use blue screens?<br /><br />In conclusion ; this is cinematic treason which should be punished to the maximum < br /><br />Another question why does Willie Nelson always play a kind of father figure in almost every Jessica Simpson flick and why are there no black , Latin , Asian or European people in this movie ?
0 A lot of promise and nothing more . An all - star cast certainly by HK standards , but man oh man is this one a stinker . No story ? That 's okay , the action will make up for it like most HK action flicks . What ? The action is terrible , corny , and sparse ? Dragon Dynasty 's releases up to this point are by and large superb and generally regarded as classics in Asian cinema . This is a blight . They managed to wrangle a couple of actors from Infernal Affairs , but they ca n't bring life to a disjointed script . There are scenes of dialogue where two or three lines are spoken with a cut in between each and no continuity in what the characters are saying . You almost feel like they 're each giving a running monologue and just ignoring the other characters . Michael Biehn is made of wood , really ? Sammo Hung uses a stunt double ? No way . Yes way . Stay away .
0 At the end of " Dragon Heat , " all I could think of was why I bothered sitting through the whole thing.<br /><br />The film 's premise is interesting and that - as well as Maggie Q - is what attracted me to the film in the first place . But was I ever disappointed . Writer - director Daniel Lee ca n't hold a candle to the likes of John Woo , Ringo Lam and Corey Yuen.<br /><br />This has to be one of the most annoyingly - directed films I have ever seen . Lee is so wrapped up in his visual style - and I use that phrase incredibly loosely - that he fills the film with completely needless black - and - white stills , freeze frames , slow - motion , fast - motion and other visual nonsense . I suppose he did all that to make up for the lack of a good story or dialogue.<br /><br />The action scenes are nothing special and play out like some hopped - up music video more than anything else . There is little to care about any of the characters - including two supposedly professional snipers who could n't hit the broad side of a barn from the inside ! - who are then laden with some of the cheesiest dialogue I have seen in one of these Hong Kong actioners.<br /><br />The plot is devoid of any twists and turns - from the initial set - up , everything unfolds in predictable fashion - and Lee feels the need to keep reminding us of the characters ' back stories in case we did n't get it the first several times . This is awfully amateurish writing and film - making and wastes the talents of Sammo Hung , Michael Biehn and Maggie Q. Though , to be frank , I am hard - pressed to remember Biehn being in any good film that was not directed by James Cameron.<br /><br />If you really are in the mood for a great Hong Kong actioner , you are much better off sticking to some of the staples - John Woo 's " The Killer " ( 1989 ) and " Hard - Boiled " ( 1992 ) , Ringo Lam 's " City on Fire " ( 1987 ) - which Quentin Tarantino stole for " Reservoir Dogs " ( 1992 ) - or his " Point Blank " ( 1967 ) remake , " Full Contact " ( 1992 ) . Or , even check out Yuen 's " So Close " ( 2002 ) , a supremely entertaining , yet preposterous , popcorn flick . And there 's always the terrific French police actioner , " The Nest " ( 2002).<br /><br />True , most , if not all , are a bit over - the - top , but they were films that remain exciting , thrilling and even suspenseful . They have characters we care about and mind - blowing action sequences.<br /><br />"Dragon Heat , " on the other hand , is just terribly mediocre . The trouble is that Lee has not made a bad action film , he has made a dull one .
0 " Handsome Guys With Bad Haircuts ! ! " " Beautiful Girls Without Any Clues ! ! " " Stupid Gangsters Who Can not Shoot Straight ! ! " From Dragon Dynasty comes the Hong Kong gangster drama , " Dragon Heat . " For reasons which will probably forever be completely obscured , the production and casting call for this ' criminals - on - steroids ' movie somehow got both Maggie Q and Michael Biehn to sign on as villains . But they do n't get all that much to do in this horrid slug - fest.<br /><br />They are two of the best contemporary actors around , each with their own resume ' and list of accomplishments , and Biehn in particular has had the courage to take some rather challenging and non - heroic roles.<br /><br />Maggie Q was the super - bad " Mai " in " Live Free Or Die Hard , " so 'nuff said.<br /><br />Biehn is , of course , famous for being the soldier - from - the - future who made " The Terminator " of 1984 such a believable science - fiction / fantasy romp , by crashing up against Big Arnold , who is now the Governator of California ! ! < br /><br />Michael Biehn is almost wholly wasted in this terrible train - wreck of a police drama . There is absolutely no reason for that , as the incredibly convoluted plot -- given mostly in Chinese , as it is a Hong Kong story -- could have been better elaborated for non - Chinese audiences with a foreign narrator.<br /><br />In other words , if Biehn had been used as something like an Interpol observer or coordinator , or an agent under deep cover , who needs to get some ' splaining given to him every five or ten minutes , that would have been great . But no , he 's brought in as a part of an odd group of special forces - type bad guys who seem to be freelancing their own corrupt deal , in the middle of somebody else 's totally corrupt deal involving the local king of corrupt deals . < br /><br />Yes , there , I said it all . Confused ? Me too . " Welcome to the party , pal." < br /><br />In the truly superb Hong Kong crime drama , known by its English title as " Breaking News , " there are also a number of fascinating characters at work , but there is only one story line in the plot . < br /><br />Bad guys vs. good cops . In this wretched and excessively violent foray into the world of a Hong Kong Triad , or gang , it seems that the hot - shot police force is little more than a parade of ducks in a shooting gallery , the way the criminals mow them down.<br /><br />So , not surprisingly , there 's an almost otherwise incomprehensible scene ( several scenes , in fact ) , where kids are trying to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game , to win stuffed animal prizes . And so the hot shot good - guy police officers quite naturally intervene on their behalf , so that the arcade owner has to give up the Kewpie dolls.<br /><br />There 's also a half - hearted attempt at creating a " love interest " between one of the ' visiting cops ' and the sole female ' visiting cop'.<br /><br />The visiting cops are supposed to be material witnesses against the Triad gangster leader , who gets hijacked on the way to his court appearance , but not by his own team but by the mercenaries ( Biehn , Maggie Q , and some others ) . These killers all want something but we do n't get to learn about what it is , until the very end of the film ! ! That was a stupid mistake inside of the overall story.<br /><br />You can not build suspense in a crime drama without something to obtain , or get , or get away from , being introduced very early in the story.<br /><br />Add to that some " cut - away scenes " done for purely artsy effects , all showing the bad - bad guys ' and the regular bad guys ' recent pasts , and any film buff can readily understand why this barking dog gets a 1 rating from this fan of all things cinematic with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong .
0 Non existent plot , tons of poorly directed / super - cheesy scenes ( Snipers / world famous sharpshooters who ca n't even hit their targets a few feet away ? plus what 's up with the ending?--- > a bunch of law enforcers vandalizing a carnival 's shooting gallery ? WTH ? ) , technical mistakes ( how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a glock ? 100 + ? These people fire their guns without the need of reloading ) . The movie is so bad that even senior Hollywood actor like Michael Biehn ( Aliens , terminator ) ca n't save this junk.<br /><br />DO not watch this movie ( I realized that I wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this one ) . Hopefully the director would either stop making movies , or learn more for his next movie .
0 This esteemed production has it 's fans . But to paraphrase the classic bad review of ' Mary Reilly , ' Moby Dick is like a painting , only slower.<br /><br />This is because the philosophical grounds for a movie " production " are never to make a great film , rather it 's to substitute the lack of a strong guiding idea ( in this case for a books transference to film ) with a list of hopelessly atomized , undynamic but dazzling conceits in an effort to trick viewers into thinking they 've seen greatness . As viewers & critics are apt to fall for this , Oscars follow , feeding the whole dumb equation.<br /><br />I do n't share in the pleasure all these reviewers found . Moby Dick is stunningly uninvolving . Actors dutifully recite essays about Jonah , Moby Dick , the ocean , Moby Dick , Moby Dick ... all things that ca n't respond , and not one of which is absorbing in the slightest . It 's dramatically inert . It does n't build . In narrative terms Moby Dick ( as a movie ) is little more than a foregone conclusion in search of an actual story . After half an hour I was muttering " Oh terrific ... another oath ... another 4 minute soliloquy!" < br /><br />In the failed effort to involve you , it 's a pretty campy overacting showcase . A lot of grey hair here . Starbuck is supposed to be a golden god . ( ! ) < br /><br />One knows one is looking at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than trying to replicate the feel of someone else 's paintings & palette , or reverently embalming a classic as Huston does here . Paintings and books are nice but they 're a different mediums . A movie like this fails to grasp that an honestly enjoyable piece of crap ( Village of the Damned ) is better in most respects than an insufferable piece of culture . This is the Eat Your Vegetables school of film - making.<br /><br />One appreciates the work that must have been done to make the movie , but not the narrative . Only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting ; the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work & various sea efforts ; and the technology of whaling . And that does n't call for a two - plus hour movie .
0 This movie is horrible . Everything in it has been done before . There is nothing original . I can not stand when writers do n't come up with their own plots.<br /><br />A girl makes a wish on her 13th birthday and wakes up as an adult . Hmm , sounds a lot like a movie in the 80s called Big . What is even more annoying is Jennifer Garner 's acting . She does n't act like she is 13 she just acts like she is stupid.<br /><br />From then on , you can guess the whole plot . She gets a good job and it just so happens that a friend she had at 13 works with her . Wow , how awesome ! But , no .... her friend is bad and turns on her , trying to get her job . But , of course , she wins in the end when she comes up with a " great " idea.<br /><br />There 's also a dancing scene in the movie that I 've seen a thousand times before.<br /><br />I hate this movie .
0 I 'm beginning to see a pattern in the movies I give a 1 to . They are almost all movies that my wife made me watch . Maybe I should stop having faith in her taste in movies . Anyway , this is typical drivel aimed at pre - teen girls but done even more poorly than usual . Once again , the writer broke the cardinal rule of any movie . He / she made the main character unlikable . She starts off by being a complete b*tch to her friend at the beginning , and then finds out when she becomes 30 , that she 's basically a sh*tty person ( having affairs , etc . ) . Why the F would we feel for this person ? OK , let 's say we can get past that . Jennifer Garner is about as far from attractive as you can get without having some sort of deformity . I do n't know if it 's her or the writer 's fault , but her character goes well beyond my threshold for annoyance . Here 's a tip for future filmmakers : 13 year olds are NOT entertaining , they 're annoying . Far and away the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they danced to " Thriller " . Holy crap that was painful . It showed her practicing that dance at the beginning . That explains why she knows it , but an entire club full of people ? ! ? Argh ! ! ! The Macarena would be more believable ! All of a sudden she 's completely incompetent and has no clue how to do her job and no one notices ? At least Tom Hanks ' character on " Big " had a job that made sense to a child . These body - switching / child becoming adult overnight movies are really getting out of hand , and this is by far the worst one yet .
0 What the * bliep * is it with this movie ? Could n't they fiend a better script ? All in all a ' nice ' movie , but ... it has been done more than once ... Up till the end I thought it was okay , but ... the going back to the past part ... * barf * SO corny ... Was waiting for the fairy god mother to appear ... but wow , that did n't happen ... which is good.<br /><br />I loved Big with Tom Hanks , but to see such a movie in a new form with another kid who wished that he / she is older / bigger ; that just is so pasé < br /><br />Just watch till it comes out on TV . Do n't get me wrong , but it ai n't all that
0 She has been catapulted from 13 to 30 , with magic dust involved , courtesy the 13-year - old Matt , but nothing is made of that except as an unexplained device . New York City , especially Central Park , but also every other slice of the place incorporated into the movie , seems hope - filled and easily livable , and save for Lucy there 's no villain in Jenna 's adult life , and even Lucy is not cast as monstrous , only as a nasty 13-year - old grown 17 years more devious . Chris , the one - time boy object of Jenna 's yearning , is now a porky cab driver , and you have seen enough films to know that Matt will play a major role in Jenna 's future . You do n't know quite what might impede this before it is finally achieved , though I 'm here to whisper in your ear , so to speak , that the device is not unique . In fact , not only is this a variation on the theme of Tom Hanks ' " Big , " though nowhere near as fine , it is also a strictly by - the - book version of this subset of the Cinderella story .
0 This is a film where the actors are all fine , especially Brigitte Bako and Erik Palladino , in a film where every one of the three couples meet in a situation that feels verrrrry forced to be either cute or to set the story in motion . In other words , it feels like they are contrived movie scenes , not like real life . Even if women who work at peep parlors ever go out with one of their customers , it just does n't seem realistic at all the way it is written in this film . Also , when one of the characters meets the overweight woman in the film , it feels artificial , the way they look at each other seconds after arguing . Again , the actors are all good , and moments of this film are nice , but overall yet another indie that could have used some rewriting before production got rolling .
0 ' Mojo ' is a story of fifties London , a world of budding rock stars , violence and forced homosexuality . ' Mojo ' uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion ( owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period ) ; I have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies , but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language . It 's as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems , in consequence , a very distant country indeed ; and therefore stresses the particular , rather than the universal , in the story . ' Mojo ' features a strong performance from Ian Hart and annoying ones from Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner , the latter still struggling to build a post-'Trainspotting ' career ; but feels like a period piece , a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom . Rather dull , actually .
0 This is truly terrible : painfully irritating stylised performers screech and mug gratingly incoherent dialogues which take place in scenes which seem to have no purpose , no beginning , middle or end , cut together without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intention , all in the service of some entirely uninteresting and almost undetectable " story " . What makes it worse is the film 's pretentions to " style " : suddenly a remote - head crane shot spirals downwards , and , without any apparent reason there are sudden whip - pans or wobblyhand - held sections : all this " style " merely serves to magnify the almost unbelievably huge misconception of the project and the almost offensive vacuity of the material . Definitely a candidate for the worst film ever made .
0 I looked forward to watching this film and then realised that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was swamped by the unnecessary swearing . Now I am not a prude in any way , but to shout obscenities at each other does not a good film make . Ewan Bremner is arguably one of the worst actors in the world at this time ( witness his performance in the god awful Life of Stuff ) & his " Cockney " accent is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent . Avoid . How many more of these films " Kiss Kiss Bang Bang " , " Beautiful Creatures " do we have to suffer before the film makers realise that the f - word , the c- word etc does not replace proper dialogue .
0 First off , I would like to point out that while I am not an expert , the way the trial was handled will insult your intelligence . Firstly , the prosecution never proved that ' facilitated learning ' actually works . Irresponsible for both the prosecution(because they can get an appeal ) and the defense for not acting on this . As another commenter said , facilitated learning was proved untrue . Secondly , they used Terry as the translator who has personal interest , and even will testify , in the trial which is just stupid . If the court had allowed him to testify that way , they would have brought in someone neutral otherwise they would be just asking for an appeal . Thirdly , this child was never asked specific questions about the defendant by the prosecution(birthmarks , details of the event , etc . ) and even when asked by the defense specific questions like when it started , he could not answer . If that is n't reasonable doubt I do n't know what is and a competent lawyer would have gotten an acquittal.<br /><br />Bottom line , it starts off well with the pressures of being the parent of a child with autism , but the trial makes this movie wholly unbelievable .
0 I saw this movie way back when it premiered.<br /><br />It was based on the notion that autistic children could communicate with typed - out messages with someone else merely aiding them and guiding their hands.<br /><br />Then suddenly these children , many of whom were n't even observing the keyboard or the screen when the messages were being typed out ( they could be looking up at the ceiling in some instances ) , but their moderators were eyes glued on the keyboard , began typing messages of abuse from their parents and other persons , sending parents and child welfare agencies in a proberbial tizzy , left and right.<br /><br />This whole thing was proved a fallacy when a third person presented a folder , opened it to the child and said ' type the picture you see ' , then as the presenter turned the folder to the moderator , a fold would fall down , revealing another different picture.<br /><br />So while the child may have seen a dog , the moderator saw something like a boat.<br /><br />Every time , every bloomin ' time , the name of the picture typed was what the moderator had observed , never what the child was shown.<br /><br />So who was doing the typing ? Never the child.<br /><br />This movie further took a disastrous turn with , as the Australia poster stated , the person who molested the child in the movie was IN the situation trying to help the child.<br /><br />Had Melissa Gilbert never put her son IN that place , he would n't have been molested , is what the movie says . He was better off under her supervision.<br /><br />If I turn my kid over to your organization for aid and he gets molested instead , do you think I 'm going to be keen to listen to anything you have to say after that ? Not likely ! I think it is a safe bet that all of these accusatory messages that these kids were typing out , that this movie was based on , they never accused someone within their operation as took place here.<br /><br />Unfortunately , I do recall that the movie gave a very good performance from Gilbert as the mother of an autistic , but other than that , the movie really did n't do much.<br /><br />The worst by far was the child typing at the end to Patty Duke , and we hear the mechanical voice read back what he typed , . . . . . " we won ! " This child was molested . If you cut my leg off and I take you to court and you are found guilty of damaging me , assault , whatever , then that is legal justice , but it does n't bring my leg back.<br /><br />At best , in my condition , I will view it as a hollow victory.<br /><br />Whatever chance this child had at what is perceived as normalcy with the autism alone is further damaged by the molestation.<br /><br />A ' normal ' child has enough to contend with from such an experience.<br /><br />It 's utterly superficial to think that you must look upon any situation and go ' we won ' if that person is found guilty in court.<br /><br />Just a bad handling of a situation and circumstances all the way around here .
0 I had the good fortune of reading the book before seeing the movie . It was an epic of adolescence , a dream of summers gone , a great potential indie film or big budget drama . It somehow got into the hands of a hack , who clearly took notes watching Boogie Nights and Rushmore without actually learning anything at all . The script loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low brow gags . I feel sorry for the actors , since the characters in the book were rich and textured , but cut down to embarrassing charactures in the film . Mason Gamble is great when given the opportunity , as is Dylan Baker , but the skeleton that remains of the story plays out like a bad after school special . Poor people = GOOD , Rich people = BAD . < br /><br />Though it 's almost worth watching to see the Southern California beach where Gary Sinise parks his trailer which is meant to pass for a bay in Delaware . < br /><br />It 's a good book , but an embarrassing turn for first time director Mills Goodloe . < br /><br />K.
0 " A Gentleman 's Game " uses the game of golf in a country club setting to illustrate an adolescent 's discovery about honesty , prejudice , and other life lessons . Several times I thought I knew where this film was heading , only to be proved wrong . Unfortunately , I 'm not so sure that the filmmakers ever knew where it was heading , either . The defining moment in this movie is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise mocks " The Karate Kid " and debunks any notions that he 's going to become a mentor to the adolescent golfer . It 's refreshing , in a way , that this movie refuses to follow most of the simplistic and over - worked movie formulas . However , too much of it still comes off as contrived . At the drop of a hat people drop all pretenses of civility , or fail to stick up for the things in which they believe , or are exposed for something far less respectable than their place in society assumes . Unfortunately , there is often no resolution to these moments . And except for the fact that the club serves as backdrop for them , there is no real continuity or linking of them . It 's a shame that the writers and director could not salvage a better film , especially given some of the talented actors and potential in the setup .
0 the only word i can think of to describe this movie is : Ordinary.<br /><br />The plot line about Gary sinise 's character attempting suicide is a ridiculous premise and c'mon .. living as some sort Salingeristic hermit or recluse in a shack driving golf balls into the ocean because he could n't handle life in the lucrative pro / am golf community ? cry me a river . I wish these were my problems . I do enjoy Dylan Baker and Sinise but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a pay check for Sinise . The scene in which little Timmy Price gets verbally abused by the other club member in front of his father during the tournament is so over the top that i am embarrassed to watch it
0 At least it 's not full of sensless violence or fluff . It 's also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline . This story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green . The story is disjointed and goes off in strange < br /><br />directions , to no conclusion . I also do n't believe the director spent much time around a golf country club , either . Some of the depictions are absurd . Not very engaging .
0 I 've seen better production quality on YouTube ! I pity the actors , as the writing was terrible and the direction shocking , not sure how they could get the lines out - I really doubt any actor would have been able to salvage this movie no matter how good they were . The characters were not developed at all , and there was no real cohesion in the plot which just seemed to go nowhere much . It 's a shame really , as the premise for the movie was good and with better production quality , direction and script it could have been a decent movie . It certainly was not a comedy , unless you laugh out loud at the dubbing - which was amateurish , even the English actors sounded weird .
0 The movie had a cute opening , I truly believed I was in for one of the best romantic comedies i 've seen in a while ... there was something particular " foreign " about the way the movie was set up , realistic yet somewhat abstract and mystical . But then the story line started becoming more and more unrealistic . To say that the ending was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would almost be an understatement ... The most typical romantic ending where everything goes great for every ' likable ' character . A scene where the main character realises that he has made a mistake and chases the " woman of his dreams " only to confess his love for her in front of a sympathetic crowd of on- lookers . Come on . In the end , the ' good guys ' win , ' bad guys ' loose ... You get the picture . A WASTE of a potentially interesting movie .
0 Whattt was with the sound ? It sounded like it was all dubbed.<br /><br />Otherwise , bad . Plot = bad . Accents = bad ( even Dougray , and we live in Scotland ) , Acting = bad , Harp = bad , Sex scenes - bad / cringeworthy.<br /><br />Still , we watched it until the end in disbelief . How could such a good roll call of actors perform so badly ? Will they ever get a decent job again ? < br /><br />Bad , Bad , Bad . By the way , we gave it 3 because we at least were enticed to watch it to the end due to its bizarre plot , etc.<br /><br />And to the older reviewer - I totally agree , it was like a romantic farce from the 1940s . How did it get made in 2004?<br /><br />OK , OK , there were some OK bits . They had a nice house in Bristol . Dougray had a nice boat . Jennifer looked nice in a little outfit . But how come the sister got all the men ?
0 Watching TRUTH ABOUT LOVE ( is this a double entendre about the star ? ) is like plugging in white noise or manufactured water sounds to help you sleep - you put it in the DVD slot because there is nothing else left on the store shelves and you are in need of distraction after a hectic day . And it works for that for that purpose : being a British romantic comedy it is a bit more.<br /><br />The story is a rather simple one about a wife Alice ( Jennifer Love Hewitt ) married to an increasingly distant husband Sam ( Jimi Mistry ) who has put their love life on hold due to the burdens of his busy law practice . His partner Archie ( Dougray Scott ) is fond of both Sam and Alice , but has a longtime attraction to Alice that goes beyond friendship . Alice pals with her sister Felicity ( Kate Miles ) , a free love advocate , who encourages Alice to have affairs . On Valentine 's Day , after a drinking binge with her sister , Alice mails a card to Sam signed ' Anonymous ' as a test to see if Sam responds , testing his fidelity . At the same time Archie mails a radish seed packet to Alice on which he has inscribed a suggestive love not . Both have ex post facto regrets . Sam in fact is spending time with a lover Katya ( Branka Katic ) and is indeed cheating on Alice . Alice arranges assignations with Sam via email and phone calls and plans to meet Sam in disguise as ' Anonymous ' to test his fidelity . The entire cast of characters gets caught up in the silly charade and the ending proves that real love must be based on truth - and how that results in the various pairings is the surprise ( of sorts ) of the fluffy script.<br /><br />British comedies work because of the quality of writing and the tight quality of acting . Perhaps had director John Hay elected to cast a British actress as Alice instead of pasting a phony accent on Jennifer Love Hewitt the result may have been improved . But in the end this story by Peter Bloore bounces between mildly humorous and pathetic in its messages . One terrible distraction is a musical score that is consistently so loud that it covers all the dialogue and is intrusive . There are some nice scenes of London and a few moments of passable humor , but in the end this little film is truly best utilized as background music / white noise . Grady Harp
0 I ordered the movie from Korea because I was an extra in it and was interested to see how it turned out.<br /><br />Having watched it I can say that I am ashamed to have had any part of it . I feel embarrassed not only for myself but for everyone else who had any part in the making of this mockery of British " comedy".<br /><br />From beginning to end the film is predictable , tedious , dull , monotonous and cringe - worthy to the point that on several occasions I actually looked away from the screen in dis - belief . Until you actually see the movie it is difficult to conceive how un - romantic and un - comedic a romantic comedy can be.<br /><br />It 's not only a bad story , but a badly - made film . In one scene , you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing the S.A. 's when to wipe across . I will post details of this in the ' Goofs ' section.<br /><br />On the up - side , it did fill me with emotions ( disappointment , rage , embarrassment  )
0 Hiya folks,<br /><br />Well , this movie sucks really . Think " Love Actually " in reverse . Nothing fits quite right , nothing is coherent , and certainly nothing makes you laugh . Love is rare in this film.<br /><br />It IS a total flop . As indicated however , there are three redeeming points about this mangled potential of a film.<br /><br />A ) With a star billing of Jennifer Love Hewitt , there will be hordes of guys who will submit with grace to viewing this just to catch a glimpse of the petite Hewitt with form fitting clothing . To tell you now guys .... there are some promising scenes .... but it 's really weak eye candy . The " possibilities " here are watered down . Nevertheless , I watched the whole thing tempted by the next scene of you know what ..... titillating!<br /><br />B ) The ending is romantic and positive . That it 's contrary and " over the top " is relevant ..... yet for me was still a positive point.<br /><br />C ) Dougray Scott plays an amourous friendly guy ........ REFRESHING ! THANK YOU ! < br /><br />2/5 , not worthy of your 10 or so dollars.<br /><br />2/3 's of the way through , I was convinced Jennifer Love Hewitt was becoming the next softcore legend . Although I 'll take that back for now ..... it hinges greatly on her next film.<br /><br />Oh , and her sister is way stupid . Her husband is way stupid ... and what the heck , she 's way stupid.<br /><br />Next time . ca n't wait for the next Love Actually with JLH !
0 There have been more interesting polish documentaries on worm farming , in brail _ ! ! The competition ( worm farming ) had a better plot and more interesting characters . I was physically ill after watching this movie . The cheating husband ( i think dougray_scott _ ) was a joke in every meaning of the word . Poor Jennifer must really need the work , and what was with the accent!!. The locations and random meetings reminded me of a high school prank , and showed the humility of a 10 year old in cooking class . It was that bad that I think I will write the sequel named " this is not a laxitive " . Thank you for listening it was a great weight of my conscious .
0 Yet another British romantic comedy which audiences all over the world seem to have a ravenous appetite for . This feeble effort is an unintentional parody of the genre - all the classic clichéd scenes are here from ridiculously elaborate misunderstandings to running after departing trains to declare one 's love . The characters are one - dimensional caricatures save for Love - Hewitt who manages to bring some cohesion to the film . Things threaten to spiral out of control in the plausibility department as the film progresses ; our good - natured suspension of belief finally comes crashing down during the preposterous ending . If you 're looking for a Bridget Jones , Notting Hill kind of experience you wo n't find it here .
0 Daddy 's girls Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West receive some terrific news at the local post office , unaware they are being stalked by burglar Charles Inslee . Meanwhile , father David Miles receives a message ( from young Robert Harron ) which necessitates daddy leaving home ; so , when the young women return , they can be   home alone . As the vulnerable pair bed down for the evening , the local " Grand Ball of the Black and Tans " gets underway ; and , a dark - skinned drinker portends additional danger for D.W. Griffith 's dynamic duo   < br /><br />Mr . Inslee has one of his better Biograph roles , stealing the film from " The Girls and Daddy " . Ironically , Director Griffith appears as one of the black - faced extras at the " Black and Tans " ball . " Biograph Girls " Lawrence and West are suggestive of later " Griffith Girls " Lillian and Dorothy Gish , especially in " Orphans of the Storm " ( 1921 ) ; and , they are excessively affectionate in bed ! The racist tone is unfortunate , since the story of a burglar redeemed by saving his potential victims from a greater danger , is intriguing . < br /><br / > * * * The Girls and Daddy ( 2/1/09 ) D.W.

0 I ca n't believe anyone liked this movie . I 've seen a lot of low - budget indie films , but this one absolutely sucked . Low budget does n't mean the movie has to be demented . Horror does n't mean the movie has to be demented . There was nothing scary about this movie at all . It was just a gore - fest , and a particularly disturbing one at that . The acting was average , considering they were all unheard of actors , but the story was pathetic , the dialog was pathetic . The movie tries to come off as " artistic " , or something . This is not one of those really great indie films that cost only thousands of dollars to make , but are incredibly well done . This was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their perverse obsessions on film . Other reviews here also said that the soundtrack sucked ... that 's because most of it was written by the same person , and some of the songs were written by one of the writers of the movie . There were no redeeming qualities to this movie at all . A complete waste of my time and money .
0 I think this movie was supposed to be shocking . But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it 's been made ... and simply is . It 's one - and - a - half hour of torment . Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie ( the five girls).<br /><br />Sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way , which is basically fine , since it 's a horror - movie . And I ( usually ) like horror - movies . I 've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se . However all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever . It 's no spectacle other than that it 's simply grotesque . It 's so lame it even gets boring , and really quick too.<br /><br />The worst thing ( if the above was n't bad enough for ya ) about this movie is that they 've tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project , by filming with cheap hand - held - cameras . But ( again , this too ) serves no end whatsoever . In the " Blair Which " , sure enough , there 's an explanation , namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch . In this film , there 's no other explanation than : " Hey ya'll we wanted this to LOOK LIKE the Blair Whitch ! ! " The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about . The girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you ca n't make out what they 're saying . Also , no effort has been made to make anything any better , sound - wise or other wise.<br /><br />Than finally , there 's the soundtrack , which is just as bad as the rest , and varies from cheap euro - house to the worst grungy hard - rock ... <br /><br />My advise : Do n't watch this under ANY circumstances .
0 The word in the summary sums it up d'oh ;) Five girls get lost trying to find their way home , when they stop at a store to get directions they hit a parked car breaking one headlight on it , they flea the scene in fair of getting in trouble but suddenly they see one headlight coming up behind them ( ooooh).<br /><br />From there out everything is screaming , crying and violence when they try to get away from this crazy person who lost it because of a headlight ;) , well the screaming and crying pretty much stays through the entire movie ( very annoying ) The movie is shot , with a cheap camera trying to make it seem " real " or " shocking " I guess , it 's just embarrassing and useless though . In lack of anything better to compare it with , " Blair witch style".<br /><br />The screaming and crying for pretty much the entire movie with crappy sound was over the top annoying , you literally get a headache : ) < br /><br />I'm sorry but this was not scary , only an annoying painful piece of crap movie .
0 After just watching FIVE ACROSS THE EYES , I got ta be honest ... I just did n't like it . I had read so many good reviews on this movie , but I just did'nt get where these reviews have came from,<br /><br />I have got a lot of time for newcomers into film - making , and I 'm sure the directors will do well for themselves , but the budget they had was the main problem , there was two cameras used in the entire film ( which was OK ) but they seemed like really cheap cameras . Another problem was the sound , you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time , all talking on top of each other - it 's just impossible to hear what they 're saying.<br /><br />It had a good idea going for it , in a nutshell , they hit a parked car then drive off , a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit , driven by a mad woman , who wants to kill them , and has plenty of chances to do so! ... and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape , but do n't ! < br /><br />Very frustrating ... I only just scraped through this one !
0 This movie has many problem associated with it that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school . I have to give it credit on its campiness though . Many times throughout the movie I found myself laughing hysterically . It was so bad at times that it was comical , which made it a fun watch.<br /><br />If you 're looking for a low - grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness , then pop a bowl of popcorn , invite some friends over , and have some fun.<br /><br />I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad . Dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is kind of just there .
0 Do not waste your time watching this ! Unless you want to study it for all the wrong things you should n't do to make a good film . I am not one to usually review a movie , but this one is personal . I wasted precious time which they can not give back . I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time watching this crap . If this was a student project , i would have to say not bad , but only for the first 15 min ... after that it gets annoying . the screaming , the bad audio , the bad video ( a good camera man could have made it much better ) . and yes , what s with the Blair - Witch effect ? no budget ? I was hoping it was going to get better , but it does n't . Now how the hell did it deserves a 4 ? 2 is more fair but 1 for wasting my time ! I have said my peace .
0 This really is the most dreadful film I have ever seen . I simply have no idea how anyone has the audacity to put this on release.<br /><br />The production standards are atrocious . There is no pretence here at cinematography . The camera work , scripting , acting and sound are unbelievably crass . I think there is a plot , but it could have been done in 10 minutes sparing us the time to watch it . The hysterical neurotic girls at the centre of this piece have no credibility whatsoever.<br /><br />I would urge anyone to avoid spending any time or money on this Title . It is truly atrocious.<br /><br />JDD - 14 December 2008
0 This film was positively the worst film I have ever watched . I could n't sit through the whole thing . I also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping ... I mean what was that all about ! I ca nt believe this was even made and am disgusted at have # ingwasted a £ 4 rental fee . The quality both picture and sound are terrible , the acting ... well does n't exist . It was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee , crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup . Urghh ....... AVOID AT ALL COST ! The girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos they 'd be willing to take their tops off ... While these girls have nice bodies it certainly did n't make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears.<br /><br />This was like ( possibly worse ) than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car ? ! < br /><br />Definatey not one to buy folks . Sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but I could not find anything positive to say and I would like to think I may save someone else wasting their money like I have .
0 How , in the name of all that 's holy , did this film ever get distribution ? It looks as if it has been shot on someone 's mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths . They literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie . And that 's all they do . There is no plot , no tension , no characters , and not a lot of acting . Just screaming and more screaming.<br /><br />I gave up after fifteen minutes and fast - wound through it to see if anything happened . It does n't - except for screaming , of course . Odlly enough , the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem - there is no camera - work to speak of . Every shot looks like every other shot - middle distance , one angle , dull , dull , DULL.<br /><br />It 's not so bad it 's good . It 's just plain bad .
0 I ca n't believe this is on DVD . Even less it was available at my local video store.<br /><br />Some argue this is a good movie if you take in consideration it had only a 4000 $ budget . I find this funny . I would find it very bad whichever the budget.<br /><br />Still more funny , I read the following in another review : " Dramatics aside , if you love horror and you love something along the lines of Duel ( 1971 ) updated with a little more story and some pretty girls thrown in , you 'll love this movie." < br /><br />What ? ! ? This is a shame comparing those two movies.<br /><br />I give a " 1 " , since I ca n't give a " 0 " . I just do n't see any way this movie could be entertaining .
0 As horror fans we all know that blind rentals are a crap - shoot . Sometimes we find a real gem , but many times we find that the film we 've just spent our hard earned money on is nothing more than a putrid steamer made worse by the completely undeserved rave reviews and film fest awards listed on the box . Such is the case with Five Across the Eyes ( a title I 'm sure is a double entendre referring to both the films budget and the compulsion anyone watching it might have to using all five fingers to stab their eyes out ) .<br /><br />The story , or , at least what the * ahem * writers think passes for one , centers on a group of teen girls who unwisely decide to go on a backwoods joyride late at night after leaving a football game and run afoul of a crazy woman who plays cat and mouse with them as punishment for what she thinks the girls found in her car after a fender - bender in a gas station parking lot.<br /><br />In fairness , it 's an interesting idea . Some of the best horrors have very simple story lines . It 's in the execution of Five Across the Eyes that this idea falls flat . The film tries to be a cross between The Blair Witch Project with its shaky camera work and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its bare - bones approach to the material but succeeds at being neither . What we get instead are redundant scenes of chase , torture , release ; chase torture , release , in that order for 94 minutes with long interludes of bitching , moaning , and incoherent rambling acting as plenty of padding in - between chase sequences.<br /><br />The look of the film is incredibly grainy and dark , which , in a better made film might have enhanced the tension and the realism . Here it 's merely annoying . The characters are undeveloped and the viewer is hard - pressed to find anything to sympathize with them . One character stops to get a first - aid kit and tend to some scrapes on her face while gunshots heard in the background indicate her friends may be getting killed . Another girl mutters hilariously dumb lines like " Do n't go out there , she 'll get you , if she gets you she 'll kill you and if she kill 's you you 're dead".<br /><br />It was an accolade from Fangoria magazine and Dreadcentral.com listed on the box that compelled me to check this one out . Talk about a fake orgasm ! Perhaps my expectations would have been met had this been in the comedy section . I 'm all for low - budget Indie horror but this one takes the crap - cake . Give Five Across the Eyes ( or FATE ; get it ? ) a pass.<br /><br />RazorFriendly gives FATE 1 slash out of five /
0 The writers and producers of this little outing have plummeted new depths of depravity . Did writer 's block set in so badly , OR had ideas dried up so much , that they were forced to include a disgusting scene where a young woman defecates in the back seat of a van , and then promptly throws the excrement at the car behind ( mind you at least this summarises what this film is worth ) . We had already been treated to one of the other women urinating over one of her friends at gunpoint , as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting ; once would have sufficed ... we got the message ! This really is taking toilet humour to another level ! Had the script and acting been better then I could have easily forgotten that I was watching a film shot entirely on low budget video . This was a fairly original storyline , with a clever ( the only ) piece of direction in that we only ever got to take the viewpoint from inside of the van ; thus making it feel much more real . We never got to see inside any other locations , such as the store or the field where several of the women disappeared , and this could have added much needed tension.<br /><br />The script was dire . Lines like : ' I do n't feel too good ... I want to go home ' after one of the girls has been pursued by a psychopath ; subjected to rape by a screwdriver and shot at , seem a little undercooked.<br /><br />The acting was diabolical ( apart from the maniac ) . Did all the main 5 actresses in this learn acting by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike ! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the entire film with the subtitles on.<br /><br />The director seemed to have an easy job in this . It seems that the only direction he must have given was : ' Scream girls'.<br /><br />AND AS FOR THE SCREAMING ...... If you watch this please be sure to have some paracetamol at the ready !
0 This was probably the worst movie ever , seriously . I could actually do better myself , it was n't even set up properly . It 's like this movie had a $ 5 budget and left with change . Do n't watch it . I did n't even get all the way through this movie , had to turn it off . I 've give this a 1/10 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie , but actually turned into a really bad comedy . Basically , a bunch of girls crashed into a car , broke a headlight , and the owner of that car went after them . The bit that i saw was a women with a gun telling a load of girls to take all their clothes off , what the hell ? it must be some kind of cheesy porn movie as well .
0 Five across the eyes ai n't worth one off the wrist , I must admit at one point i was really worried , for about 30 seconds nobody made a noise and i thought my speakers had blown or that i had gone deaf with the constant screaming and high pitch yelling , me and the speakers are OK now thanks for asking , funnily enough that was the best bit of the film.<br /><br />I wo n't waste your time telling you the plot , read the other comments for that.<br /><br />If you have bought this DVD but not yet unwrapped it Do n't , take it back and demand your money back , i 've wasted mine do n't do the same.<br /><br />I was actually shouting at the telly " they 're over here in the car , look for the camera lights , and get the camera man first " , i have left the swear words out but you can guess where they go.<br /><br />If anybody would like to buy this film ( it 's really good ) it 's yours for a ten quid .
0 MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... BUT DOUBT IT CAN ACTUALLY BE SPOILT!!.<br /><br />Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word .... Amateurish . This film tries it 's best to be different from most films by the ' Blair Witch ' type of filming .... it does n't work .... it just ends up looking and feeling like somebody had a cheap video camera , a van and decided to make a movie . The story has no explanation , the protagonist is given no real motivation ( and looks like a lesbian wearing a power - suit compared to the five girls ) and there is no violence to speak of ... just the sounds of screaming and crunching . The whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is out of the question . The five girls really do their best with what they 've been given but on the whole come across as pretty terrible actresses ... although with the material given it 's hard to judge if they can actually aCt .... they spend THE WHOLE movie screaming , squealing and whimpering .... so much that half the time it 's hard to make out what was said and the cameras are so bad it 's actually hard to tell who said it . This video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact just five girls in a van screaming in terror ... that literally sums up the whole movie ..... we then get to the end after what seems like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive ... with one minus a finger . The only thumbs up(get it ... finger .... LOL ) is for the poor actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices(and their pride ) after making this terrible movie . Do not judge this by the poster .... you'll be very let down .
0 I 'm dumbfounded . Yes that 's right . I 'm really caught here . No way did I find it awful , but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky incoherency . The idea behind such a trim , minimal low - budget Indie production is n't bad , but it 's a confused muddle and in the end did n't do anything for me . It 's amateurish and simple ; it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that of - late fashionably rapid filming style . We have the documentary laced ( hand - held ) camera moving everywhere ( despite never leaving the van ) , and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out . Lately you kind of get use to it , but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating . Keeping it still will help . The context has little groundwork ( which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads . At a road - side store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied SUV headlight . Scared , they flee and not too long that one - light SUV appears behind them . Soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror ) spending most of the time playing out a drawn out , noisy and relentless cat and mouse game . < br /><br />As for being disturbing   I guess that depends . Some moments can make you squirm with its attention to pain , desperation and demented brutality ( with good use of piercing sound FX that seem to be more favoured over the imagery and not forgetting the alienating background sound effects ) , but also I found myself snickering too . In passages it can be repellent and intense with a real gradual rush , but hardly believable . The injuries of random characters never seem as serious like you were to believe , despite obviously they should be . Watch how blood runs freely , but it 's not entirely convincing and can get dull . The constant nocturnal car chase could only do so much before getting repetitive . We get screaming , spewing , bleeding , running , cursing , body fluids and so on . Quite unpleasant details followed too . With little really to do , it needed a much stronger script than the measly forced one that was penned up . Too many cringe - moments arose from it , and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in . It was about set - pieces , waiting for next torturous encounter and it drew it out long enough . Helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern . < br /><br />The performances ; Jennifer Barnett , Angela Brunda , Danielle Lilley , Sandra Paduch and Mia Yi are workman - like with their distraught characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the script 's weaknesses in its character - foundation . Veronica Garcia 's flipped - out , bug - eyed intensity as the loony driver of the SUV was something   yeah something . Her character 's real motivation for terrorising the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually non - existent . I guess being psychotic was good enough . Now probably the most unnerving thing I came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack . Terrible techno music , to cheesy hard - rock and an overwrought closing score . It never felt overdone or got in the way , but it did stick out like a sore thumb . Co - directors Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen try to get the most out of their slight resources , but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite ramshackle . Maybe it was enjoyable to make , but watching it just was n't the case .
0 - Contains miner spoilers - < br /><br />I have seen a number of decent Indie horror films such as The Hamiltons , The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever ; unfortunately I felt Five Across the Eyes does not fall into this category . From start to finish the film is plagued with amateurish acting resonating from a very poor script , god only knows why the writer(s ) thought dialogue such as " No do n't go out there ; do n't go out there she 'll get you : if she gets you she 'll kill you and if she kills you you 're dead " is of movie quality.<br /><br />This film displays very little character development and to be honest I could n't care less about what pain and torture was inflicted upon them as they are just a group of ditsy college girls who show almost no redeeming qualities ' . All they do is cry and whinge throughout the entire movie and if the girls are n't crying their arguing ; when they do converse the topics are completely random : about dating boys or how one of the girls father was recently cremated ( appropriate subjects when you 're being chased by a psychotic killer).<br /><br />The soundtrack is also abysmal exhibiting corny techno music during both the start and end credits ( although hearing the credit music knowing the end was nearing seemed like heaven).<br /><br />The camera - work is appalling and at times makes the film unwatchable . I 'm guessing due to having little or no budget the director was limited to just one digital camera which resides in the girls ' car almost the entire movie . I think this was an effort to stick the audience as close to the action as possible : to feel and experience what the girls are going through . But due to a very shaky camera , grainy picture and being too close to the action it can be hard to tell what is going on during action scenes and is simply chaotic . It 's one thing to make a film subjective but it 's another to have action on the screen that an audience ca n't decipher because of the poor cinematography.<br /><br />I understand that Five Across the Eyes is a low budget indie film but that does not excuse the extremely poor quality . There are no redeeming factors to this film : bad acting , poor scripting , shoddy camera - work and no story . In light off all this I decided to give the film 1 out of 10 as it left me very disappointed ; wanting a meteor to hit the earth bringing me sweet relief . Its 94 minutes off stupid college girls crying , arguing , aimlessly running and having random inappropriate conversations . However , how many times do you get to see girls defecating into their hands and throwing the crap onto the windscreen of a chasing car .
0 The problem with this movie is that it is shot on the worst possible camera and the film is blurry and grainy . Maybe it 's just the fact that whoever was holding the camera could n't hold still because they were having a seizure or something . There is also way too much poop and vomit in this movie . There is someone vomiting every twenty minutes and it makes me think that this was made by some bulimic or something . It was disgusting . Then there is the annoying high pitched screaming that goes on and on and on and does n't stop until the credits roll . I also did n't like when all her friends were being shot ( or not I do n't know)and she goes in the van and puts band aids on . That was just really really stupid to even have that in a movie . How much gas can a person siphon to get a van going ? It must be a whole lot because they do n't run out of gas for the rest of the movie . It was a terrible movie and I would highly suggest not ever seeing it in your whole entire life .
0 I 'll keep this fast and sweet . Five girls on their way home from a football game decide to take a ' short cut ' that leads them down a deserted forest - ridden road . Of course nothing but good things happen to them , and they safely arrive at their destination.<br /><br />Alright , they do n't . Soon they 're hunted down by a deranged chick who has some severe mental issues , and what ensues is 90 minutes of sheer boredom.<br /><br />I hope to never see any of these actors in any movie ever again . Their screaming , screeching voices gave me a headache , and the script was so poorly written that it included a lot of repeat phrases and nonsensical hysterical screaming . All in all , one of the worst cheap horror flicks I 've ever seen ... and I 've seen a lot .
0 Given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings , the girls in this film would be collecting Gold , Silver and Bronze at a Darwin Awards Olympic ceremony . A mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did , and would have screamed a lot less while doing so.<br /><br />If you like films with a grainy picture , deliberately amateur camera - work ( my 92 year - old grandmother wields a camcorder with better results ) , extremely poor sound and no discernible plot / narrative , then this is your ideal film . Also note that you should enjoy the following : women screaming for no reason , women whining for no reason . In fact reason and logic do n't appear much in this film . For example : " we have to find Stephanie " " yeah I ca n't believe I was speaking to her , like , last night " " she called you last night ? " " yeah , she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one " " WHAT ? How come she did n't tell me " ? As in , our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but I have a problem with the fact that she did n't tell me she was going on a date.<br /><br />Okay , so the budget is low . That does n't mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget . The ' score ' is interesting since all - with the exception of one - tracks have been written and performed by the writers / directors of the film itself . In fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by The Duskfall , a death metal band from Sweden.<br /><br />The most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel .
0 DO NOT WATCH THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR A FILM . I have wasted time and money on this and am pretty p**sed off about it.<br /><br />The acting is comparable with high school plays . The script is shocking . There is no plot . Twenty minutes from the end ( which I believe I should be rewarded for reaching ) I had a headache from all the screaming , crying and wailing the five girls make.<br /><br />The majority of the violence is ( rare for a film nowadays ) suggested rather than graphically depicted but I found the characters so damn irritating that I wanted to see them , and indeed every single person involved in the making of this piece of s**t , die in the most horrible ways possible.<br /><br />I spend ten more minutes of my life saving you from a very poor 100 minutes of yours . Do n't do it .
0 Watching this Movie ? l thought to myself , what a lot of garbage . These girls must have rocks for brains for even agreeing to be part of it . Waste of time watching it , faint heavens l only hired it . The acting was below standard and story was unbearable . Anyone contemplating watching this film , please save your money . The film has no credit at all . l am a real film buff and this is worse than " Attack of the Green Tomatoes".<br /><br />l only hope that this piece of trash did n't cost too much to make . Money would have been better spent on the homeless people of the world . l only hope there is n't a sequel in the pipeline .
0 Definitely , definitely the worst film I 've ever seen , no questions asked ! Contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others , since it 's an independent , low - budget film , but c'mon already  the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying.<br /><br />Agreeing with everything that has been said about this film , for example the mind numbingly weak acting ( when it 's this bad you take another go at shooting the scene , god damn it ) , the thing I found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script , assuming such a thing existed during the production . There was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers , the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any rationality or even brains - five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath  gang up on her , why do n't you?<br /><br />The only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it - which is , as the rest of the film , a good idea executed exponentially dreadfully.<br /><br / >  oh and by the way , this movie is NOTHING like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand - held camera  this is an effect and not a trait ! Used cleverly it can be breathtaking , but in this case it 's an excuse for inadequate cinematography .
0 Um ... Okay , I guess I get the whole shaky - cam , gorilla - style filming technique but unfortunately I think a gorilla could have made a better movie ... This thing was just a complete mess from the get go . Bad acting , bad directing , bad story and horrific cinematography . How this piece of garbage was released I will never know , but it has and unfortunately I watched it . Filmed on location in Tennessee by the directing team of Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen ( Harry and Lloyd ) , " Five Across The Eyes " I 'm assuming is supposed to resemble a " Blair Witch " type film but falls short ... Okay it nose dives off a cliff . I was actually embarrassed for these young women , whom I 'm sure were promised Hollywood stardom , but ended up in this dung heap . The dialog is ridiculous , and actually aggravates you as you listen to it . How this is supposed to be a horror flick is another mystery , as there is nothing even remotely scary about it , except for the fact that I watched it ... Try this one on for size : There is 5 of you and 1 of her , do the math and beat her ass ... " The End " . Saddly it went on ( and on ) for 95 more minutes of mind - numbing stupidity ... <br /><br />I saw it for free , and wanted my money back .
0 This " film " attempts to follow the genre of low budget , hand - held camera flicks that have proved to be very effective and successful.<br /><br />This one , fails , and HOW.<br /><br />It 's amazing how many so called " awards " this piece of garbage has got plastered on the cover ..... it makes you wonder what these critics were on when they actually submitted this .... <br /><br />Words fail to describe just how absolutely appalling this movie really is . Seriously , it 's THAT BAD.<br /><br />I watched it in 20 minutes flat , on almost continual fast forward.<br /><br />From rubbish lighting to dreadful directing , grainy visuals to muffled sound , and of course not forgetting the ABYSMAL acting , this was one completely and utterly pathetic piece of so - called film making.<br /><br />It seriously , has NO redeeming qualities - whatsoever . Save your cash and watch a decent low budget horror flick , there are plenty out there - Dead End , The Blair Witch , REC , to name but a few.<br /><br />AVOID this rubbish at all costs . DO NOT waste your money or time on this piece of trash pretending to be an actual film.<br /><br />Take heed of all the other comments ! You 've been warned !
0 Less than 10 minutes into this film I wanted it to end as it was painful . All this " horror " movie was about was a group of whiny bitches doing stupid things for 90 minutes , arguing , crying and screaming . Do not let the positive reviews fool you as this really is a terrible movie and you really should n't watch it.<br /><br />The movies plot had potential to be something great , but it just does n't happen . A group of five " teenage " girls are driving home one night when they find themselves being pursued by a crazed female driver who wants to kill them . Two minutes into the movie , and the characters are already arguing and this does n't stop . All we have for 90 minutes is a bunch of girls whining , crying , screaming , " acting " and arguing . None of the dialogue is even remotely interesting too , so you do n't get to really know these characters or enjoy them.<br /><br />The acting was terrible and I was shocked to find out that these characters were meant to be teenagers . None of these women looked a day under 20 , and one of them easily looked like she was nearly 30 years old . At least get people who look the age . None of them gave even remotely decent performances , and just seemed like they were picked off the street or were friends of the director with no acting abilities . The " actress " who played the killer overdone it , but she at least showed something that the other girls did n't - a little bit of talent.<br /><br />The characters do n't help things because these girls are a bunch of whiny , stupid bitches . That is all I can really say about them , and it did not help that they ALL survived . If I have to go into detail , in one scene the girls are being chased by the killer and having their car knocked a lot . One girl injures herself and is whining about it ... four of them are n't wearing seat - belts ... what do you expect ? One of your friends is being brutally attacked by the killer ... and you all just happen to be conveniently " too hurt " to help ? Whatever.<br /><br />The filming of the movie is absolutely terrible . I do n't care if this movie had a budget the size of a peanut , the filming was terrible and it was like watching a pirated version of a movie . The cameraman was clearly in the car with the girls , pushed up against a window somewhere and the amount of times the camera blurred out , shook and brushed up against an " actress " was horrendous . It was also grainy , and at times you could n't hear what characters were saying ( not that it was anything worth listening to).<br /><br />Supposedly the killers car in the movie ( that supposedly got hit , even though we only heard the accident ) is actually the directors car in real life . No wonder they did n't show the car getting hit ! This movie is so cheap , they ca n't even show a car getting a little scratched up . Oh , got ta mention the soundtrack also ... if that 's what it was . It was horrid ... sad one second , then hard rock the next . < br /><br />At the end of the day , Five Across The Eyes just feels like a terrible home - movie filmed in the middle of the road at night with a bunch of stupid girls screaming and arguing for 90 minutes . It does n't help when the script is terrible , the scares / tension / suspense and ( hardly even any gore to make up for it ) are absent , the acting is terrible and the picture quality and filming are horrendous.<br /><br />This was a horrible low - budget movie . Avoid it at all costs.<br /><br />1/10
0 I m the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when I 'm picking a film , so i picked five across the eyes , i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it , it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish ! i think i could of done better myself . i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch , i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul .
0 I never finished this movie for a reason , it was dreadful and that s just the acting . I was n't even sure what the film was about tbh it did n't make a lot of sense and the violence was awful . I mean ususally i like some nude in a film ( lol ) but it was just sick because of what was happening . ALL the characters annoyed me and it was just full of loud screams and the camera was shaking at parts and it looked like a sequel to the blair with project but without any good qualities . This is one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time and would like my time back please . i would n't recommend this film to anyone or even consider it . ( N )
0 Five Across the Eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew , they stop off at a store & accidentally hit another car & decide to just drive off & leave it . Soon after the other car forces them to stop & a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out & shouts at them , makes them take their clothes off & makes them pee on them & then randomly drives off . Shaken & shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost & are low on gas ... <br /><br />Produced & directed by Greg Swinson & Ryan Theissen with Swinson writing the thing & Theissen responsible for the cinematography & editing I have to say that Five Across the Eyes is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen if not the worst , I mean I 'm struggling to think of a film I have seen that 's worse . Now let me start off by saying that I am sure a lot of the film - making decision taken here were deliberate to try & provoke atmosphere , tension , realism & suspense but there is not one aspect of Five Across the Eyes that I did n't hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on YouTube & even then it 's still slightly embarrassing & a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that I could have been doing something more entertaining & fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers . The reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the IMDb ( the amount of 1 Star comments is revealing & they ca n't all be wrong , right ? ) & it 's message board which I think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks it 's absolutely trashed by just about everyone & the phrase ' the worst film I have ever seen ' is used a few times & to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things & I have to agree with them . The story is terrible , alright I suspect it 's meant to be minimalistic but this minimal ? There 's never any reason or explanation for the events that happen & it just feels totally random . It goes on for ages , the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature . The dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who do n't seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff & screaming a lot . Oh god the screaming , there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates & annoys & prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly . Then there 's the real killer , the entire film is set & shot within the confines of a mini van , seriously the camera never leaves this car & as you can imagine it gets really boring , add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen & Five Across the Eyes is a film that I hated with a passion.<br /><br />On a technical level again I can see that the film - making style here was a deliberate choice but I have to be honest again & say Five Across the Eyes is the worst looking film I have ever seen . As a fan of film I like my films to look like proper films as it 's a visual medium & I definitely do n't want them to look worse than the average YouTube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while I was drunk . It really does look that amateurish & that bad , it 's a complete eyesore & I hated every moment of every second of it . Just think The Blair Witch Project ( 1999 ) only ten times worse looking & sounding & you will be almost there . There are times during Five Across the Eyes when you literally ca n't tell what 's going on or happening because of the camera - work & the almost pitch black & grainy contrast levels . The violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood & a stabbing at the end.<br /><br />Low budget does n't even begin to describe Five Across the Eyes , with a supposed budget of about $ 4,000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release . The two vans in the film were owned by members of the production & that 's basically pretty much the entire budget right there , the locations . The acting is pretty bad by the main cast , I just hated all the fake put on crying & screaming that did n't convince at all but did irritate immensely.<br /><br />Five Across the Eyes will go down as one of the worst films I have ever seen & I have seen a few films , whenever anyone now ask 's me what 's the worst film I have ever seen Five Across the Eyes will definitely get a mention . I hated it , every single aspect & wretched moment of it .
0 And maybe , as Fred Sandford used to say , " one across the lips " . That to those who released this film on an unsuspecting public . And perhaps to the person in " Rue Morgue " who called this a " Fender Hellbender " and said it was good.<br /><br />Five young girls , apparently taking a short - cut home from a high school football game , become lost and stop to ask directions at some small store in the middle of nowhere . While there the driver accidentally hits a parked SUV & knocks out a headlight , but the girls all decide to just leave & not go find the driver . But the driver does come to find them , and it 's not just that the headlight on her vehicle got dinged , it 's for another reason that the girls do not yet understand . When the driver does first catch them she ( yes , it 's a she ) brandishes a shot gun & makes them strip down , and keeps screaming at them , " how much did you see ? " . Of course the girls are scared to death & do n't know what she 's talking about.<br /><br />As the night rolls on the girls end up in a cat and mouse game with the driver of the SUV , who manages to inflict all manner of injuries on the girls , who are remarkably resilient to shot gun blasts and screwdrivers where they did n't want them . Eventually they come to find that something happened back at that store after they left that is the reason for this woman 's psychotic rage . And eventually they have a chance at revenge and take it about as far as they can go.<br /><br />There are elements of this film that are rather disturbing and scary , but unfortunately , those moments are undermined by bad acting , bad dialog , and huge lapses of credibility . One girl is hit by a shot gun blast and appears to be mortally wounded , and she 's feeling cold , her life is passing before her eyes , but she got better ? And how far can a mini - van run on an almost empty gas tank at speeds of 80 miles per hour ? I need one of those things , it apparently gets GREAT mileage.<br /><br />There should have been an ending when the girls got their revenge , but the film goes on for a bit after that , which is an anti - climax , but they at least learn some of what set the woman off , and the driver is still worried about " messing up her mom 's van " , which is obviously the least of anyone 's worries.<br /><br />So this is n't the worst film I 've seen , but it 's too amateur to be good and yet a bit too scary and gruesome at times to be completely terrible . But it does take the cake for plenty of shrill hysterics and you 'll want to put two across your ears if you watch this . Which , by the way , I do n't necessarily recommend . 4 out of 10 .
0 I actually felt bad for the actors in this thing . No doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at the very least as well a job . The actors must have thought this would be their big chance working in a film , it certainly was not . Besides the terrible acting the stories were boring and for the most part predictable . The one about the remote control did n't even make any sense . To bad cause it had the best premise in the bunch.<br /><br />I'm all for supporting low budget films and giving new film makers a fair chance , but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer . I only watched it because of some good comments posted here . They must have been planted by people with ties to the film . You may fool people into watching this , but you ca n't fool them into liking what they saw.<br /><br />I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer story tried to be heart warming . Sure it failed miserably , but it tried . I reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip this dribble . I wish I had .
0 This does n't quite plumb the depths of Creepshow 3 , but it comes close . It also uses the same technique of using some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology , which is distracting to say the least.<br /><br />It also rather irritating rips off The Twilight Zone ( with the bookshop being comparable to Serling 's later Night Gallery ) . Unfortunately , the producers & writers forgot that Serling would build up sympathy for his characters before messing them over . None of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting until the last segment.<br /><br />Framing story : Adam West is ... well , himself . He does n't go the Bruce Wayne / Batman campy 60s route , but he rarely does . He simply plays the not - particularly - enigmatic " Jay " ( there 's an ominous spine - chilling name to compare to the likes of Dr. Terror , Eramus , and The Cryptkeeper ) , and makes some mildly awkward / creepy statements.<br /><br />Abernathy : Seen Rod Serling 's " A Stop in Willoughby " ? Then you 've seen this . The red herring of the nutso wife is introduced to no purpose , but even the main character 's friend identifies him as a wimp . As well directed as can be expected , but basically incoherent.<br /><br />Nex 's Diner : Reminiscent of various Serling time travel stories , mixed with Steve Allen 's " A Meeting of Minds . " Most of the actors are n't too bad ( except for Josh Astin as Cassius , who manages to walk , talk and even breathe awkwardly ) , and the idea is mildly interesting . But like Abernathy , it does n't go anywhere . The main character raises some relatively reasonable questions , bugs out a bit ( who would n't ? ) , and for some reason he ends up banished to a nuclear wasteland.<br /><br />Life Replay : Not a bad little piece , and manages to predate both Click and Creepshow 3 . I suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magical properties of remote controls . The main character is mildly sympathetic . Nothing substantially innovative here , but it 's okay.<br /><br />Fighting Spirit : You see the twist coming a mile away but like the main character , it has some heart and it 's a decent story of defeat and redemption.<br /><br />Finale : So ... why do people end up in cold storage in silver lame suits ? Do n't know . And does n't make sense . So ... all the protagonists wandered into the bookstore and became trapped ? Kinda undermines the happy ending with the boxer ( thanks , guys ! ) , and the guy in the first segment died . So how did he get trapped ? Did he visit the bookstore before he died , got trapped and ... did n't die ? What ? Huh ? I supposer this is n't expected to make sense because it 's supernatural . But still ... <br /><br />Overall : basically not dissimilar from the two newer Twilight Zone series , or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters . The last two stories and part of the second are probably worth your time . But there 's nothing really spectacular here .
0 I ca n't believe it , IMDb really does have every TV show known to man ! I have not seen this show in over 20 years . I only remember two episodes , and I barely remember those . I remember that Tony may not been on from the start , because one of the episodes I remember is the one in which everybody trying to get Tony to join , but he rejects them , but typically at the end of the show he becomes a member of Power House , with everybody cheering.<br /><br />The other one I remember is the one where Lolo for some reason pretends to be dead,(complete with funeral and mourners ) . I do n't remember why he plays dead , or how the show ends.<br /><br />This is one of those shows that I convinced myself that I must have dreamed up since no one else had ever heard of it .
0 I 've read all the comments on this film . I am a great admirer < br /><br />of the Dalai Lama . As such , I read the book upon which this < br /><br />film was based . The movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth . I do not criticize it for < br /><br />altering small details or events for dramatic purposes ; it is < br /><br />not a documentary . But the script CHANGES the impact , reaction,<br /><br />realities , and changes in EVERY main character . It vastly alters < br /><br />the real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama . < br /><br />From the ridiculous rivalry for a Tibetan woman ( which demeans < br /><br />the culture of Tibet ) to Harra 's music box gift , to Harrar's < br /><br />change of heart , everything about this movie is false - except < br /><br />for the amazing photography . I understand that the shots of the < br /><br />Potala ( the palace ) were smuggled out of Tibet . However,<br /><br />changing a real story about the relationship between two people,<br /><br />one of them very important to this world , in order to build up a < br /><br />movie star is sad
0 i read the book " 7 years in Tibet " from Heinrich Harrer and was fascinated of it . then i immediately grabbed the DVD and started to watch the movie . i remember the first time i saw it back in 98 , i kinda liked it . well , now i watched it again in full knowledge of the book it is based on . and soon i realized how WRONG it all was told:<br /><br />when they enter Lhasa the people start to stick their tongues out of their mouths and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that its the way to say hello in Tibet , so they greet back ... in the book Harrer explains , that sticking the tongue out is a sign of absolute humbleness and loyalty in Tibet and they may do it in front of the Dalai Lama but certainly not for these two europeans ! not only the mother but even the Dalai Lama himself was wearing glasses in the public . in the book Harrer mentions , that no one in Tibet wore glasses to that time(sorry forgot the reason , but its explained in the book too).the young Dalai Lama did , but only when he was alone and nobody could see him ! and what about that Mao tse tung lookalike , destroying the mandala in front of the young " living buddha " ? ? childish ... and the tailor made Harrer and Aufschnaiter tibetan clothes not European designer suits ! why are so many events that really happened eliminated from the story , just to fill the time with a fictional love interest ( the female tailor ... )that is completely unimportant ? just like the whole story about harrers son , rolf . not one word is mentioned about him or even any family member of harrer in the book . but that was OK for me because " 7 years in Tibet " is not a book about harrers person . its about tibet . I 'm very disappointed by this " adaption " of the famous book . and i bet heinrich harrer was , too ... 3 stars , just for the cinematography .
0 OK , here it is : " Nazi mountaineer befriends the Dalai Lama . " What we do is , first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a Germanic accent , and we let him flounder around between French , German , American , and British for over 2 hours . Then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely , so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly . But just to make sure the viewer doesn´t fall asleep , we throw in details which are shockingly absurd , such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22,000 feet . Naturally , we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles , so we have every character , even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closed - off city of Lhasa in 1943 , speak perfect English , also with dubious accents . Of course , the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story , so what we do is this : we have the Dalai Lama befriend the now - reformed Nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors , radios , antique cars , and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west . In return , our hero learns from his young protegé a kind of vague , undefined Buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion . We also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the Tibetan society accords the Dalai Lama , even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader . In other words , we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a Buddhist , sort of , in his own way , even though we ourselves don´t seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go . And last but not least , we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the Chinese have treated the Tibetans ( which is certainly true ) , thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a " political " movie , even though it is nothing of the sort . So , zat ist my idea . Vat do you zink ? Can ve make zis movie ?
0 The acting , other reviews notwithstanding , was remarkably well - done . Brad Pitt handles the role of an annoying , obnoxious Austrian climber quite well . Other acting is fine . The story could have been riveting , but somehow , it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown , and so the story , which could have been quite dramatic , fails to draw in this audience.<br /><br />Beautiful scenery and cinematography , a remarkably dramatic true story , important events that shaped the world that we live in - but I could not , try as I might , involve myself in this story . As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan ( I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation ) , I expected to * love * this flick - and yet , it left me cold.<br /><br />It could be a failing within myself , but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction , scriptwriting , production , editing - somehow , they lost me . It 's a shame , because it could have been wonderful.<br /><br />Good acting , dramatic story , beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent . It was n't . Probably worth watching , just to make your own mind up on it - but do n't expect too much , and perhaps you wo n't be as disappointed as I was . Mostly , it bored me .
0 " Hey everybody ! I 've got an idea , we found this egg - shaped thingie from outer space so why do n't we thaw it out and open it up ? " " Yes , I know that would be the dumbest thing a scientist could do , and it could be filled with contaminating bacteria or viruses unknown to earth and could potentially wipe out the human race , but hey , I want to know what 's in it " . " And nobody tell NASA , they might take it away from us " . " Wow this thingie gives off vibes ! " " Yes , really strong ones on contact so do n't touch it but it 's okay to cut it open " . " Hi there handsome , check out my nips " . ( Later that day ) ; " DO NOT OPEN " ! ! ! ! ! Uh oh , we have to run all the way to the lab and tell them not to open it because we do n't have phones or radios or intercoms even though we have a gazillion dollars worth of other equipment here . " I 've never seen such organic technology ! " " Yeah , lemme take this stick and stab it . " . " I 'm getting out of here , I do n't care if I do kill the other 6 billion people on Earth , nobody 's nukkin ' me ! " " Look ! it 's the friendly aliens from " The Abyss " ! They want us to come with them " . THE END
0 Recap : Something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of Antarctica . The mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on Antarctica . Julian Rome , a former SETI - worker , is brought in to decipher the message . Problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his , and the situation quickly turns awkward , especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him . And the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly . Soon the object is in the open . The mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity . It is decided to open the object , but just before that is done , Julian decodes the signal . " Do not open " . But too late , and the object explodes as it is finally breached , and two things unleashed on earth . The first is an alien , that had been dormant in the object , and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff . And Washington , that is suspiciously updated on this historic event , decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth . So a Russian nuclear submarine , carrying nuclear weapons is sent to Antarctica.<br /><br />Comments : The movie holds a few surprises . One is Carl Lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance , and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful , well worked through and a lot better than expected . Unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own , and this time not in a good way . Actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes . It is never really explained why Washington know so much , why Washington is able to command Russian submarines , why the object is in the Antarctic and has woken up now . It is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable English . Some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to Earth before and knew the language ( and obviously chose English , why ? ) . But then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the Earth from the virus , send their " Do not open " message encoded ! And finally the end is as open as an end can be.<br /><br />The movie is a little entertaining but too much energy ( from me ) must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot . Therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good.<br /><br />3/10
0 With one of my very favorite actors , James Spader , I expected this film to be at least tolerable . It was n't . After the first half hour I watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready . So trite , so standard , one knows what 's going to happen in each scene . One can even predict the dialogue word for word . This is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say , " How did this movie ever get made ? " In an effort to say something positive , I 'll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects . But , on the whole , if you 've seen 5 Sci / fi movies , or you are over 9 years old , do yourself a favor and skip this one .
0 Very bad acting , and a very shallow story . Not even a decent B - Movie < br /><br />Events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lame.<br /><br />This is one of the worst sci - fi I 've ever seen . I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre , but it sucked so bad.<br /><br />Now there 's really very few good movies on ALIEN subject , I think because most of them are low budget < br /><br />I give it 3/10
0 An unoriginal , overly predictable and only mildly entertaining low budget rehash of a sci - fi formula that we 've all seen a hundred times before - a group of scientists in isolation confronting some unknown alien something , and in of all places ( surprise , surprise ) Antarctica!<br /><br />The film features James Spader and an almost nameless supporting cast ( with the exception of Carl Lewis , who 's actually not that bad for a non - actor ) - who deliver ho - hum performances that do little to invigorate the script 's unimaginative dialogue . To make things worse the film 's pace is slow , there 's almost no subplot , and the few action sequences are stereotypical and not that exciting . Its little wonder that this thing went straight to DVD . What is a wonder is why Spader - an excellent actor at times , who won the Cannes Best Actor award for ` Sex , Lies and Videotape ' , and did a splendid job in the innovative sci - fi flick ` Stargate ' - chose to sign onto this lackluster project . Or maybe not , if you look at his career , for it seems he has invested his talents in more misses than hits.<br /><br />The most remarkable thing about ` Alien Hunter ' is how they managed to cram in so many elements from so many great sci - fi films , and still have the thing turn out so listless and contrived . There are huge borrowed bits from ` The Thing ' ( both Howard Hawks ' original and John Carpenter 's excellent 1982 remake ) , ` Contact ' and ` Outbreak ' ; a few hints of ` Alien ' , CE3 K ' , ` The Andromeda Strain ' , ` Kubrick 's ` 2001 ' ( i.e. the ` alien black box ' ) and ` Mission To Mars ' ( i.e. the mystery message ) ; and even a little dash of ` Sneakers ' and ` A Remarkable Mind ' ( although not sci - fi films , they share a ` cryptology ' connection ) . Hell , there 's even cornfields and Antarctica , just like the recent ` X Files Movie ' . And the luminous translucent spaceship at the end looks exactly like something that was plucked from an outtake from ` The Abyss'.<br /><br />Its all been done before and done a whole lot better , although I will admit there were a few mild surprises towards the end . I could say a little bit more about the plot , but there 's absolutely no need . You already know over half this movie without ever seeing it . ( 5 out of 10 )
0 Begins better than it ends . Funny that the russian submarine crew outperforms all other actors . It 's like those scenes where documentary shots ... <br /><br />--- SPOILER PART ---- The message dechifered was contrary to the whole story . It just does not mesh.<br /><br / >
0 Is it a remake og the Thing ( 1982/1951 ) , i think it is , there are so many factors from det previous movies do deny it.<br /><br />So the acting is bad , James Spader does a superlow stargate re - enactment of himself , with his coffy mug and his somwhat strange thinking / movements but that 's about it , the other actors i did't even notise . You do n't get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters . And the plot evolvement is slow , boring and , yah i know what is about to happend in 30mins . Score / music is ultraboring , imean there are alot of ubertallented people out there that would make scores for a coke and a credit , but this is major crap . Some of the special effects are nice , if it was made in early 90 's . If you like Slimy Aliens , chills and thrills , do n't whatch this movie . its a dull combination of the Thing , Alien 3 , Outbreak and some Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay production gone really really bad . Now this combination would be cool if somone knew what they where doing , and the only ones on this production that knew that was , no one.<br /><br />Though i have seen far worse , i would not recomend this movie to anyone , but if you are up one cold night , and just wanna glanse at something , it will pass the time , slowly .
0 Snuggle down in your favourite chair and switch on the play - station , as you toss this into the waste disposal unit . Spend a useful 90 min . living your favourite game . Disjointed - poorly filmed - non directed junk . It takes a bits from several other " science fiction " movies and badly attempts to join the parts into a pathetically weak story . There 's nothing new here , the filmmakers do not seem to realise that providing simple entertainment would achieve a monetary game , but a touch of skill ingenuity and flair is required to turn it into a good film . Any money spent watching this is a waste , and personally i would like my 90 min of life back .
0 This movie could n't decide what it wanted to be . There were a couple of sub - plots that for awhile made you think these items would all come together in the end ... but they did n't . If you want a " alien in the frozen waste " story , stick with the 1950 's version of THE THING ( not the abomination that was remade in gore - o - vision 20 + years later).<br /><br />I could n't get over the fact that the " alien " looked pretty much recycled from INDEPENDENCE DAY . < br /><br />The " bare minimum " sets would have been more effective if they had hired actors who could actually act and carry off the intended mood.<br /><br />Lots of scenery chewing with little payoff .
0 I am oh soooo glad I have not spent money to go to the cinema on it :-) . It is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like The Thing , Final Fantasy , The Abyss etc . framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario . I really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie - it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline which additionally is also senseless . Moreover there is nothing to watch - the FX'es look like there were taken from a second hand store , you generally saw all of them in other movies . But it is definitely a good lullaby .
0 Alien Hunter : 5 out of 10 : Is it me or does every movie that starts in Roswell , New Mexico suck . Take Alien mixed with The Thing , mixed with Contact , mixed with of all things On the Beach , The Andromeda Strain , the classroom scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark and a throw in a little Stargate to boot . < br /><br />Derivative does n't even begin to describe this movie . Of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right ? Nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease . ( James Spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable Leslie Stefanson asks to join him  . he turns her down . AGGH ! ) < br /><br />In fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it . I mean if your going to have impossibly good - looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an Antarctica research base why not go for broke.<br /><br />With about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie Alien Hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci - fi adventure . Needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the Alien itself is a horribly clichéd artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title . < br /><br />I also inquired during viewing what is with the Children of the Corn in space motif . ( Note that since Jason of Friday the 13th fame , Pinhead from Hellraiser and that Leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield ? ) The characters in the cornfield dress like Logan 's Run extras and I was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them.<br /><br />That however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant . The acting is mostly fine as Spader reprises his Stargate role while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in Antarctic beachwear . John Lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it.<br /><br />Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper Children of The Corn in Space movie .
0 I just saw this film tonight and I have to say that it 's a mess . I love Vince Vaughn but he ends up more annoying that funny here and the film is more than less a remake of the crappy 80 's classic " Santa Claus the movie " but with out the camp or the bad Sheena Easton song at the end . .The story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who comes back to face his family for the holidays kind of thing but with North Pole as its setting . Of course Fred ( Vince Vaughn ) is the family screw up who comes home after a series of set backs that include his girlfriend ( Rachel Weisz in a cameo role ) dumping him , so he comes home to face his parents and his more successful brother Santa Claus ( Paul Giamatti ) and wacky high jinks follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarky as well that threatens all of Christmas . Now if you think you know the ending of this film , I think you would be right because it 's predicable to the hill . As for the acting , Vince Vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays but this time he ends up more annoying than likable , Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus but the role is more than less one note , Elizabeth Banks plays Santa 's assistant but she 's not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and poor Kevin Spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the film " Glengarry Glen Ross " but a little more anal . The only two actors who come out of this film with their dignity intact is Paul Giamatti , who brings a real sincerity and warmed to his role as Santa Claus but he looks somewhat embarrass to be in the movie and you ca n't blame him and Rachel Weisz , who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors do with theirs , which is a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved a lot better than what this script gave them.<br /><br />To put it in a nutshell , a major disappointment .
0 Painfully bad Christmas film that has an equally painfully bad performance by Vince Vaughn , who is paying his usual frat boy self but this time for a children 's movie but with out the wit or charm that is in his R rated films . Vaughn seems like he 's on autopilot though most of the film and he keeps running into walls with his lackluster performance . After 30 minutes into the film , you would be in touch your inner scourge and say " Bahumbag " at how unfunny this film is and after another 30 minutes , you will want to walk out over how unbearable the film has gotten during that point . Out of all the actors involved in this mess , only Paul Giamatti and Rachel Weisz brings some life to there perspective paper thin roles and that 's manly because they are both way too good of actors to be in this film . Paul Giamatti brings some depth and warmth to the character of Saint Nick himself but he 's forced to Vaughn 's level of juvenile behavior when they are doing their sad sibling infighting . You can see in Giamatti face that he 's not having fun with his role and it painfully shows in certain parts of the film . Rachel Weisz brings a sense of fun and spirit to her role but she really does not have much of a character to work with and you can see in her face that she 's well aware of that , so much so that she seems irritated in certain parts of the film . Fortunately for her , she 's not in the film much at all and is able to save some face , unlike Giamatti , who looks like he 's about to fire his agent by the end of the movie . The direction also feels uninspiring , like there is no feeling or flow to be had and this is a supposed to be a holiday movie but it ends up feeling like you are just staring at a fancy widow display that is being torn down.<br /><br />I do n't know what went wrong here but with only two actors involved ( Giamatti and Weisz ) trying their best to at least bring something to the table with a unfunny script they had to work with , spotty direction with no feeling for the subject at hand ( and this is a Christmas movie of all things ) and a actor who just does not care about his performance ( Vaughn ) , you have a very unevenly bad film that is very painful to watch .
0 Every Christmas eve I make my kids endure yet another showing of It 's A Wonderful Life . I also thoroughly enjoyed Bad Santa . So sue me . I admit it . I like cheesy , schmaltzy movies . I like excellent , intelligent ones too , but as with so many things , variety is a good thing . What would the Christmas season be without the annual cinematic ka - ching ka - ching of Santa in all his guises , from Edmund Gwenn to Billy Bob Thornton ? Fred Claus will make no one forget Bedford Falls , but I do not believe a Christmas film should have to reach iconic stature to succeed . " Fred " is a perfectly OK holiday movie , with enough humor for the adults and sufficient charm for the kids . My wife and I laughed a lot , even if most of the humor was obvious and Vince was just being Vince . Paul Giamatti was a top - notch Santa , which helped a lot . Not a great flick , and unlikely to become must - viewing for anyone 's annual Christmas traditions . But my wife and daughter and I enjoyed it for what it was , holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice . There 's nothing wrong with that .
0 How hard is it to write a watchable film with Vince Vaughn , Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey ? Apparently VERY difficult for the writers here.<br /><br />I still have no idea how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince ( who plays the BIG brother ) . I must have missed that part of the story but in reality , it really did n't matter . Many scenes seemed out of place and contrived ; the kind of " funny notion " scenes that are drug out WAY too far to where any sense of comedy is lost.<br /><br />The director / producer tried to go " tear jerker " at the end , which would have been suitable if ANYTHING leading up that point had been worth following.<br /><br />Ugh , major disappointment . I can see how some people might enjoy this OK , since many people will take any garbage they 're fed , but I would strongly encourage waiting for DVD on this one . NOT worth the $ 23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days .
0 Okay , during this past thanksgiving break , whilst having the whole family together everybody decided to go see a movie , and since Fred clause was voted majority , that s what we went and say . < br /><br />To start off the movie had so many plot holes it was pathetic . Simple explanations of why a certain event was happening was void . example ; who the heck is trying to ' shut down ' Santa clause ? Is it some sort of corporation ? A little explanation would of been lovely . < br /><br />Second : The movie tossed you flimsy characters that evoked no sympathy from you about their feelings or actions . example : the little elf named Willie and the only tall girl in the elf village . they see each other twice and then they are a couple and i could of cared less because this movie did n't make me care . < br /><br />Third : I suppose this was suppose to be a family film ? Its rating was low at just PG . For a family film there were several articles of suggestive conversation . It did n't bother me , but if i were a parent i could see a problem . < br /><br />Through the whole movie Paul Giamatti looked extremely bored with his role , but honestly he was the only one worth watching in the movie . Vaughn had a few funny moments but played the same character he has for the last two movies . mouthy frat boy . ( nothing against Vaughn , he 's been good in other movies)<br /><br />so this movie gets a 3 out of 10 stars from me , just because somebody had to put in the effort to produce , film and release this flick . < br /><br />In my opinion i would definitely pass on this flick , or if you HAVE to see it save it for a rainy day rental .
0 Well , I have to say , this movie was so bad that I would have walked out if i did n't have to review it for work . ANd the worst part is , I wanted to see it so badly that I drove all over the city , paid $ 10 parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong . Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does -- the only time I 've seen him play someone else was in that movie with John Travolta . Anyways , the plot has potential -- it sounded great in the preview , but it is filled with totally ridiculous , predictable , weak plot turn points . And I was hoping that this would be one Christmas movie where Christmas DIDN"t have to be saved , and that Santa did n't need a replacdmetn , but nope . The only cool part was the sleigh rides , and the little bladck kid was the best character . I 'm sure this movie would be great for young kids , but for adults it 's so lame that it 's chore to sit through .
0 I do n't know what I missed here , but I ca n't believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film . I thought it was silly , and a bit over the top . I did like the performances of Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker , however the others were just ... boring.<br /><br />Now I like B movies , I really do , but this was a bit further down the alphabet for me . I saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to " Army Of Darkness " and " Shaun of the Dead " , as well as " On par with The Re - Animator " . You must be joking . I did n't find this film funny , it tried , it did make an effort , ( possibly too much of an effort ) , but it failed in my opinion . By the time I was hit with the 3rd or 4th one - liner I was rolling my eyes and checking my watch.<br /><br />There were definitely homages made to several other films , which is always cool , kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans . But here it may have just been a lack of original thought . Admittedly there were some nice special effects , good gore , but that ca n't carry an entire movie . The mutated Grant looked like a cross between Jabba the Hut , and in the early stages of mutation- Chet from " Weird Science " ( after he was turned into the monster ) and one of the alien creature / children from " The Explorers " . It just did n't work . I thought it looked like something some kid from Grade 5 art class could have designed . Then there was Brenda , the woman that Grant impregnated and chained up in the barn . When help finally arrived she looked like a giant tick waiting to be popped . The design once again was totally unimaginative . A round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle . * yawn * < br /><br />Now about the zombies- The more movies I see with zombies in them these days the more I wish George A. Romero had a patent on them and was the only writer / director allowed to make movies about them . He 's the only person so far to do it right , with the exception of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg ( but that was a comedy ) . Oh , and Danny Boyle , but they were a different style of Zombie . Maybe Mr. Romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to moan , groan and shamble about as if their joints are dried up and lacking even a drop of synovial fluid , and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by rigor mortis that had started to set in right before they were re - animated . The people of " Wheelsy " just did n't have the proper motivation ... they were horrible zombies.<br /><br />So in the end I give " Slither " a 3 , for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes .
0 Definitely the worst movie I have ever seen ... Can somebody tell me where should have I laughed ? There 's not a single hint or shadow of an idea . The three leading actors are pestilential , especially the one ( I think it 's Aldo ) from Sicily who _ ca n't _ make a Sicilian accent ! ! ! Not to say about the dream - like insertion about Dracula ... just another expedient , drawn from the worst cabaret tradition , to make this " film " last a little longer . Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can , but this so - called movie was really too , too hard to rescue . I would have given it " 0"/10 , but the lowest mark was 1/10 and so I had to overestimate it by one mark .
0 For me every piece of art is to be judged by these criteria : Form , Function and Meaning . Guernsey seems to be dedicated to forms : nice shots and sometimes interesting acting . The long close ups suggest a function that the viewer may fill in by himself . Because of lacking texts the story becomes a quiz . An introvert person suggests to have depth , but sometimes it turns out he has nothing to say . This film acts like an introvert person . If you have not read the synopsis you can not see that it was the suicide ( and the unanswered question Why ? ) that changes Anna 's view on life and makes her suspicious . ' Why do n't you speak to me ? ' asks Sebastiaan . Anna does n't answer , she only starts looking a long time at him without saying a word . What is the function of that shot ? What does it mean ? My question is like Sebastiaans : What has this film to say ? What is meant by this movie ? The answer for me : It shows us a handful of persons with the passion of a glass of water . The story of their lives is simple and boring . Motives behind their actions are not shown . The rest is : skins , residences , landscapes . Nice and artistic done , but meaningless without having disposal of ' instructions for use ' . In my opinion this film is made for fellow artists , not for the common viewer .
0 This film uses all art - house clichés ( slow pace , long static shots , minimal amount of dialog ) to try to hide the fact that there really is nothing worth watching here : There is no plot to speak of , the characters are dreary ( female lead ) or cliché ( Tersteeghe 's character ) , and they do not ever talk to each other about anything that concerns their rather uneventful lives . The film is centered around a woman who finds out about her husbands adultery . Instead of confronting him , she half - heartedly takes revenge by committing adultery herself . After a fight and a reconciliation with her sister - who knew about the adultery without telling her - she asks her husband to stop cheating on her . They seem to be re - united as a family . Two other story lines - the planned move of the woman 's elderly father with his young wife to Guernsey and the rivalry with the woman 's sister - do not offer any interesting developments . The suicide of a colleague of the woman that seems to set off events in the film is not a subject in itself . For 2005 - or any other year for that matter - this is not enough to make an interesting film.<br /><br />Moreover , what little possibilities for dramatic development there are in the script are not used or are consciously avoided , as when both the woman and her sister mark a particular piece of furniture from their fathers house which is going to be sold because of his planned move . Both sisters want this particular piece and given their rivalry in the past - over much more important things than furniture : men - this could in theory lead to a confrontation . Or the matter could be resolved by one sister giving way to the other . Either way , this would not be a very interesting or original development of the story but at least it would constitute some development . The film clearly sets this situation up ( with both sisters looking intently at each other during the marking and one sister having mentioned she does not want to draw straws ) but it cheats us out of any resolution : the scene simply ends and how this - in itself rather dreary and materialistic - issue is solved , is not shown . < br /><br />Although almost completely absent , the dialog that is in the film is excruciatingly flat and tepid . For example , when during a visit to Guernsey , the 2 sisters address their rivalry it is in a three line dialog that has a childish " yes it is - no it is n't " ring to it . The fight and reconciliation scene with the 2 sisters is completely without dialog - giving a highly artificial , overly stylised and unrealistic impression and considerably reducing its impact . The way the woman finally - finally ! - addresses her husbands adultery in a single line of dialog has to be seen to be believed - and is at the same time completely unbelievable . The husband does not seem to have any noticeable reaction or if he has any , it is not shown . The woman does not mention her own adultery to her husband . The scene showing the woman , husband and their young son asleep on an airliner , watched by the sister is possibly meant as a happy end , but the way the characters addressed the issues of their lives in what went before makes this unlikely.<br /><br />Because of its slow pace , uninteresting story , leaden direction and absurd lack of dialog , I found this film an example of everything that can be wrong with an art - house movie and a complete waste of time .
0 Anna lives with her family in a new housing estate just outside the city . She has been with her husband Sebastiaan for years and they do n't talk so much anymore . While on a working visit abroad , a female colleague commits suicide . Anna is deeply impressed by her death , even though she hardly knew her . Nobody seems to know why she took her own life . For the first time Anna realizes that one can be an unknown among your most dearest . Anna does n't mention the incident back home and starts observing her husband and child . Guernsey is the story of a woman who suddenly starts looking at her own life . And she wonders how she got so drifted apart from the people closest to her.<br /><br />(This is my translation of the DVD cover text synopsis . I hope you find it useful , as this movie does n't have an IMDb Plot Summary yet at this date . )
0 GUERNSEY ( Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Netherlands 2005).<br /><br />The mousy Maria Kraakman plays Anna , a woman in her thirties , who finds out her husband ( Fedja van Huet ) is cheating on her but she does n't dare to confront him . She painfully avoids any confrontation with human beings , her parents as well as her sister , so we have a main character in a feature film that does n't do much at all . We barely know anything about her background or her motivations . Just a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley , not just during this difficult episode of her life . She obviously suffers from something , but why do we in the audience have to suffer as well?<br /><br />I almost gave up on cinema after seeing this unwatchable mess . These were a very dull and painful 90 minutes . Normally I try to avoid wasting energy on bad film making . I 'll take the beating and roll with the punches , but in this case a fair warning is in place . How on earth did Nanouk Leopold get funding ( in large part from publicly financed funds ) for this turkey ? Obviously , there was no script to speak off . It could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with only a little more appeal . None whatsoever , just a vaguely defined concept , " I want to do something from a woman 's point of view " . The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life.<br /><br />To make things worse , there 's not an interesting shot to be found in the entire film . I can not think of a cast who could have spiced this one up , but Johanna ter Steege is a ( small ) light in the dark , if possible with this dire lack of material . I 'm trying to imagine how Leopold tried directing Maria Kraakman : " Maria , look at the horizon , we 'll film you for three minutes , just express sadness " . A perfect cure for insomnia . Get a copy and watch this late at night , guaranteed too put you to sleep.<br /><br />Camera Obscura --- 1/10
0 This movie was long and boring . Surprising that it was selected for Cannes , although they tend to like pretentiousness . Point is that contrary to other Dutch stars of the arty genre like Kerkhof and Kruishoop , Guernsey feels utterly empty . Even more so it has no cinematic quality whatsoever . A long opening shot does n't mean cinematic depth , it 's just a long boring shot . The story was n't interesting and the characters had problems I could n't identify with at all . The actors did n't shine under her direction and seemed lost at times . Leopold tried , but she is not the talent I hoped she would be . Where are Kerkhof and Kruishoop ? They really made some waves in Dutch cinema . Leopold just made another attempt .
0 For those fans of Laurel and Hardy , the 1940s and beyond were a very sad time for the team . Their contracts with Hal Roach Studios had expired and now they were " free agents "-- able to work for any studio who offered them a job . Unfortunately , Fox , RKO , MGM ( without Roach ) and even a French film company who hired the boys had absolutely no touch for their comedic talents . Plus , Stan and Ollie were a lot older and seeing these geriatric men taking pratfalls seemed sad , not particularly funny . Stan looked very ragged and Ollie 's weight had ballooned up to the point where he could barely walk -- and so it made me feel uncomfortable laughing at their very , very sedate antics.<br /><br />In addition to their age , this particular film suffers because Fox Studios oddly cast them in a supporting role and created a parallel plot involving a young couple -- something that reduced their time on screen AND turned them into insipid " hangers on " instead of just being themselves . A cute and cuddly Stan and Ollie is very foreign to the old Laurel and Hardy of the 20s and 30s -- and just seemed awfully strange and suited them poorly.<br /><br />Now even with their age , this COULD have been a decent movie if it had been given decent writing and if it appeared the studio cared -- and it 's quite obvious they were using the " B unit " here -- with , at best , second class support . In particular , there are very few laughs and the last 10 minutes of the film is simply dreadful -- relying exclusively on a sloppy rear - projected screen for the stupid chase scene -- which might just rank as one of the worst of its kind in film history.<br /><br />For mind - numbed zombie lovers of Laurel and Hardy , it 's probably a film they will love . But , for lovers of the team who are willing to honestly evaluate this film relative to their amazing earlier films , it simply comes up wanting indeed . In fact , of all their full - length films pre-1940 , I ca n't think of one I liked less than DANCING MASTERS . Unfortunately , of the post-1940 films , this might just be one of their better ones . Sadly , it got a lot worse -- with wretched films like THE BIG NOISE and NOTHING BUT TROUBLE . I just wish the boys had just retired after SAPS AT SEA.<br /><br />Finally , I wonder if all the generally positive reviews for this film on IMDb might reflect the reviewers ' love of the team more than it 's an indication that this is a good film ? For an audience who are NOT already in love with the team , I do n't know HOW this film will do anything but bore the audience -- it certainly WON'T convince anyone that Laurel and Hardy were comedic geniuses . But even comedic geniuses need material worthy of their talents .
0 I can understand after watching this again for the first time in many years how it is considered one of the worst Laurel & Hardy 's . For me , it is n't as close to as bad as " Air Raid Wardens " and " The Bullfighters " , but there are some definite huge flaws in it . The film is set up to show Laurel and Hardy as the owners and instructors of the dance studio . Hardy is funny as the prancing lead of a " London Bridge " dance , surrounded by 20th Century Fox starlets , while in the next room , Laurel teaches the beginners ballet while wearing a ballerina outfit . A clumsy carpenter spills glue on the floor , leading to a predicable gag where Hardy ends up the looser . Then , in come the racketeers , now selling insurance covering up their protection racket . One of them is a very young and handsome Robert Mitchum . But no sooner do they bully the boys into buying insurance , they are arrested.<br /><br />This is the end of the gangsters and the last time we see the dance studio . The rest of the film is devoted to Laurel and Hardy 's support of wealthy patron Trudy Marshall and her inventor boyfriend , Robert Bailey . They first try to help them hide their relationship from her disapproving parents ( Matt Briggs and Margaret Dumont ) and hopeful suitor Allan Lane , whom we can tell right off is a no - good swine . This leads to Briggs ' hidden bar being revealed to tea - totaling Dumont , and a gag where a rug is literally pulled out from the wealthy patriarch which crashes his bed into a pond below . When Bailey uses the boys to help display his ray gun , pandemonium ensues . The dead - pan butler announces to Case and Dumont that their house is on fire.<br /><br />Later , Hardy wants to use the insurance policy to gain money to pay their dance studio rent and hopes to get Laurel to break a leg to do so . There is no reference to the fact that the insurance salesmen were gangsters and that the policy would probably be invalid . ( Even if they were to have become legitimate insurance salesman , after being arrested , their licenses would have been revoked ) . Laurel ends up getting off a bus which had been abandoned by the driver over a supposedly rabid dog ( only a frosting covered , cake devouring Toto look - alike , or possibly the actual pooch ) , causing Oliver to end up on a huge beach roller - coaster that somehow the bus has ended up on , perfectly fitting its wheels onto the tracks . Roller - coaster gags can be exciting , as evidenced in " Abbott and Costello Go to Hollywood " , and this one is amusing but anticlimactic.<br /><br />As the story wraps up , all of these gags seem to have no point , giving the impression that this was simply a series of one - reelers put together to make a full - length feature , hopefully part of a double bill . L&H , as I 've mentioned in other reviews of their later films , had lost much of their luster after leaving Hal Roach 's employ , but surprisingly here , they do not come off as old and tired looking as they had in films made in the same year . Had the gags not been as amusing , as was the case with some of their other films , this surely would have ranked a " 2 " as opposed to a " 3 " .
0 I suppose bad Laurel and Hardy is better than no Laurel and Hardy at all , but just barely . It 's sad that the Fox films are the ones getting a big release on DVD , exposing people who may not be too familiar with L&H to their WORST stuff rather than their classic comedies.<br /><br />Once again the boys are saddled with a dumb romantic plot about a guy who 's invented an invisible ray . He 's in love with the bosses ' daughter , who hates him and prefers some slick guy . It 's incredible to think the geniuses at Fox thought THIS is what L&H needed in their films.<br /><br />Without their pancake makeup the boys look tired and old . The only scenes that work for them in this picture is when they try to sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene where Robert Mitchum , being a classic noir bad guy tries to sell Oliver Hardy " insurance " on Stan.<br /><br />Otherwise , this script is just a mess . Forget this and see if you can find a copy of " A Chump at Oxford " or " Bohemian Girl " or " Sons of the Desert " instead .
0 As a big fan of David Mamet 's films and plays , especially his first film House of Games that also starred Joe Mantegna , I was expecting great things from this film . Instead , I found myself annoyed by the film 's superficiality and lack of credibility . Racial slurs are thrown about without any feeling or meaning behind them , in the hopes of setting up a racial tension that for me never materialized . Identity is totally reevaluated and men become " heroes " for no apparent reason . Because of his oaths taken as a cop , the lead character adamantly refuses to perform one relatively small action that would harm no one and could possibly save lives , and yet performs another action which is very violent and VERY illegal , but then still refuses the minor action . In addition , a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced just for the sake of a plot point that was all but advertised with skywriting , and the cop 's reaction to that occurrence stretch credulity way beyond all reasonable limits . Needless to say , after expecting another exciting thriller from David Mamet , I was extremely disappointed to say the least . 3 out of 10 .
0 David Mamet is a very interesting and a very un - equal director . His first movie ' House of Games ' was the one I liked best , and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations , and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is ' Homicide ' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama . The principal characters are two cops , one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area . The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious . The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe , the group of Jewish militants is operatic , and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic . The end of the film itself is Mamet - like smart , but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances , but the flaws of the story are too evident to be easily compensated .
0 Very disappointing film . By the end I no longer cared for any of the characters . I did enjoy seeing Ving Rhames in a very small part , and William Macy was good as always , still not worth watching . It starts out strong and just keeps getting weaker and weaker . Insomniacs will like it as I am sure it will put them to sleep .
0 This movie displayed more racial hatred of Jews by David Mamet than I have < br /><br />have ever encountered in an American film . The sterotypes are so over the top that my ability to continue watching died . I was so disappointed at Joe < br /><br />Mantegna calling a bunch of men , sitting in a New York Jewish center cleaning weapons , heros that common sense prevailed and I stopped . I am deeply < br /><br />disturbed at the concept that Jews are not Americans and " different " . I suggest that Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hatred not a healer of same .
0 Pere is an idiot , but he is aware about it and acts in consequence . His life is totally boring and he does n't know how to change it . When his last friend , Nicco , dies . He feels totally empty and he decides to go out to become drunk . When he is returning home , he crashes with a girl that puts advertisements . Although she ignores him , he fells in love and starts to follow her , obsessively . Well the beginning of the film is a bit slow , and can result boring for most people . However , as action begins , it is a little better ( not much ! , maybe , the best part is the 5 minutes of sex ( almost 30 different scenes about it ) that you can see in the middle of the movie ; it is not good for the erothism , but for the funny and unexpected that is the scene . Probably it is the best of the film . Neither the actors nor the directing is good , and the results is a boring film that that can result funny for some people ( not for me ) . All the film is based on absurd situations ( idiot , as the film says ) , that have anything interesting . I like Ventura Pons , but I have to admit that this is not one of his best films ( maybe his worst ! ) , he knows to do it better .
0 Leave it to geniuses like Ventura Pons , the Spanish director , to convince the higher ups in his country to subsidize this misguided attempt of a film . The sad state of the film industry in that country is a product of trying to make a film out of such thin material . Most of the pictures that are made in Spain fall under two categories : those about the Spanish Civil War , that love to present past history as the writers deem fit . The other type of films show the viewer with a lot of gratuitous sex because the ' creators ' do n't have anything interest to say . < br /><br />As the film opens we get to watch Pere 's penis as he attempts to cut it off and place it in one of the platters at a party . Later on , Sandra will show all she has been given for the audience to admire . The story of Pere 's attraction to Sandra , a married woman that seems to be happily married , is false from the start.<br /><br />Our only interest in watching the film centered on an earlier , better made picture by Mr. Pons , " Amic / Amat " , but alas , it has nothing to do with the mess we are punished to watch in this venture . As far as the comments submitted in IMDb , all the negative votes come from Spanish viewers , which speaks volumes coming from them !
0 Although the actors do a convincing job playing the losers that parade across the screen , the fact that these characters are impossible to identify with had me looking at my watch a mere 20 minutes into the film ( and more than once after that ) . The plot development is disjointed and slow , the verbal diarrhoea of the main character 's only friend is practically insufferable , the base quality of most of the characters actions and the cavalier way in which they are treating is annoying.<br /><br />It is typical of Ventura Pons to put forth crass psychologically handicapped characters . However , this faux sociological analysis is a big step down from CARICIAS or Caresses , where the characters maltreat and despise each other for well founded reasons that play out during that film . In AMOR IDIOTA we are forced to follow the meanderings of a truly subnormal intelligence as he stalks a severely depressed and detached woman . Supposedly this is due to his own depression but the script does n't support that . I wo n't give away the rest of the story just in case there are any masochists out there   Is he cured through his obsession or is the woman shocked out of her own depression through his unwavering attention ? Even though I watched the whole thing I was n't made to care even for a moment about either of them.<br /><br />If you can sit through all this prejudice , ignorance , betrayal , BAD dialogue , flimsy philosophy , etc   the camera - work was pretty good and seems to be something inspired by the DOGMA group . The makeup also seemed to aim at showing these players in a raw and gritty light as it is the worst I 've seen Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in any of her movies ( while in person she is actually attractive).<br /><br />I suppose if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower strata of society so we can be grateful we are not part of it then Pons has achieved his objective . The barrage of nearly identical sex scenes was a proper waste of film ( if the actors had been filmed but once in blue green clothing the background behind them could have been changed in the special effects studio for a pittance ) . True that I heard much of the male audience squirm in their seats during this but an objective viewing proves that was not the real aim of those scenes.<br /><br />Save yourselves and watch something else .
0 OK , let me again admit that I have n't seen any other Merchant Ivory ( the distributor ) films . Nor have I seen more celebrated works by the director , so my capacity to discuss Before the Rains outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated . With that admittance , let me begin.<br /><br />Before the Rains is a different kind of movie that does n't know which genre it wants to be . At first , it pretends to be a romance . In most romances , the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character , is separated from the supporting character , and is ( sometimes ) united with his or her partner . This movie 's hero has already won the heart of his lover but can not be with her . His name is Henry Moores and her name is Sajani , and they reside in southern India during the waning days of the Raj ( British imperial rule ) . Henry has been away from London for a long time and has fallen in love with his married Indian maid , despite his legal marriage and child overseas . What could be better than that ? They often sneak away for intimate afternoons until some children notice them . Word spreads to Sajani 's husband who questions her involvement with Moores . She denies any contact with him , but Moores asks her to leave the area . Sajani refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide . Please take note that these events occur in the opening third of the film . The film changes tone and becomes a crime - drama in its final portions.<br /><br />Sajani 's body is discovered right as Moores ' family comes to visit . The alleged perpetrator is Moores 's English - educated assistant T.K. T.K. knows of his master 's affair but keeps silent until his life becomes threatened . Once he is declared innocent , he attempts to regain his honor by killing Moores . T.K. is too squeamish and leaves him in a dirt path as the rains fall.<br /><br />I want to warn you , this is n't a romance film . The DVD cover and theatrical posters show an Indian woman and Caucasian man embracing in an idealized tropic setting . This image is captured directly from the film 's opening , but quickly disappears . Then it 's over . It seems like an effort to capitalize on Western fixation on forbidden love . It is n't effective , at all . Not only is the movie not a romance , but its characters lack any personality . They are bundles of walking clichés . Moores is an arrogant white man who does n't recognize his Indian friend , T.K. 's intelligence . T.K. is torn between his own heritage and his educative background . Sajani is a woman incapable of having a choice in her romantic life . Oh , and , of course , Moores ' family is inquisitive into Sajani 's death but still slightly racist to Indians . If the tone was n't so serious , I would be willing to overlook these problems , but it is n't . The film is presented with a didactic overtone which highlights its poor character development.<br /><br />No , this film is n't terrible . Other than the laughable screenplay , it is n't poor . The actors are all experienced and perform well here . Nandita Das , who plays Sajani , was part of wonderful Indian drama Water . Even director Sivan has an impressive resume . He recently oversaw The Terrorist , which is part of Roger Ebert 's " Great Movies " collection . What happened here ? Why is this movie so bad ? Well , Sivan mentioned how he was inspired to direct this film because of a short he viewed in Israel called Red Roofs . Apparently , the story was " timeless , " and Sivan sought to create a similar experience set in 1930 's India . I do n't have any problem with that approach , but I think Sivan may have been too motivated this time . The actors , cinematography , and set design are acceptable but unless you share Sivan 's aura , you 'll probably not enjoy it . My recommendation is that you presume you are n't in accordance with him and watch something else . Final Consensus : * and ½ out of * * * * *
0 This movie fails to offer anything new to a genre that has traditionally shown the cross cultural love story underpinned by the politics mid 20th century / pre - WWII India , where the British and their modern ways are bad and the primitive but honest and true Indians are good . Surely such clichéd depictions of the British are rather passé now.<br /><br />Apart from the drama that fuels the second part of the movie the narrative is predictable , the acting is pedestrian and two - dimensional , and the directing obvious and unimaginative.<br /><br />The story really needed to be fleshed out and would certainly have benefited from another half an hour of screen time to give the characters and narrative more depth and give the viewer something to feel some investment in.<br /><br />All in all , rather uninspiring . Oh and Linus Roache just can not do tragedy - going cross - eyed with emotional pain just does n't work for me !
0 Despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating , this is an awful movie . Awful enough , that l feel obligated to warn you how bad it is . < br /><br />The movie is set in the final period of the Raj , during the time of India 's fight for independence . What follows in the ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief . What the characters do and how they behave just does not persuade me that the characters exist in that era . < br /><br />For instance , would the young married Hindu housemaid from the local village have an affair with her married Englishman Master , knowing full well that discovery of the affair would likely mean utter social ostracization and shame if not mortal punishment ? Unlikely , but still maybe . However , would the same young Hindu housemaid , in the conservative society of India of that era carry on like a half naked Britney Spears in heat , partake in hot outdoor sex during daylight in open view where they might be discovered at any moment ? That is not only bloody unlikely , that is a retarded plot line.<br /><br />Such idiocies combined with the poor acting , drove me to leave the cinema an hour into the movie , so i did not watch the second half of the movie . One could only hope the ending is of more intelligence than what i saw in the first half .
0 Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series . Despite the tragic nature of a middle - aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing , manipulative father , it was incredibly light - hearted and fun to watch in practice . In my opinion , it is without doubt one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time . The TV series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservation.<br /><br />This movie spin - off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word . Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is transferred successfully onto film . This movie has a very dreary , depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions . Seeing Harold being beaten up in a pub ( and not in a comical way ) is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the TV series will not like this movie . The movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbour.<br /><br />The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of tone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the TV series . In the TV series , Harold always went after respectable girls , not strippers.<br /><br />Albert 's reactions to the remarks made against him by Harold 's girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the TV series . In the movie , Albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises.<br /><br />Most movie spin - offs of British sitcoms tend to be quite dull , with the notable exception of the ON THE BUSES films ( which in some respects were actually better than the TV series itself ! ) . But , STEPTOE AND SON has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile , even below GEORGE AND MILDRED.<br /><br />My advice - skip this one and see the second spin - off , STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead . It has a much lighter tone , is more faithful to the TV series , and is actually very funny .
0 " Women ? They 're all scrubbers ... ! " < br /><br />No , not a good translation ; not at all ! This lags behind the previous year 's " Dad 's Army " , entirely missing the special , small - screen magic of the seminal television sitcom original , and failing to play interestingly at all with the big screen ... you could just about say that this film well represents a Britain entering decline , and more precisely even than that , a * British film industry * entering decline . And that is hardly a recommendation , is it ? To be an exemplar of saddening folly ... <br /><br />All that remains after the subtlety of the TV original has been surgically stripped away , by Cliff Owen , Galton and Simpson are : endless , dilapidated musical cues , yawn , from the Ron Grainer theme ... bolstered sentimentality ( that shoddy , thick - eared ending ... how much bolder does the second Steptoe film seem in comparison ) an increased seediness - with director and writers seemingly detaching themselves completely - fully applicable to something like the ' misbegotten monstrosity ' ( yours truly on this site ) from 1973 , " The Mutations " . There is a strangely botched , cut - adrift tone about the scene where Harold is beaten up in a rugby club , that I partly hate and recoil it ( so far , as a friend intimated , from the mood of the TV series ... ) , but this at least seems an original slant , and emblematic of tensions just rising to the boil in the Britain of 1972 ... There is , however , an implied prostitute , aye of a ' heart - of - gold ' who turns loose woman - traitor ' pon poor auld ' Arold - and beyond - caricature writing of the ' class ' element ; not to mention , surprisingly misjudged performances from the usually redoubtable leads . Brambell and Corbett collude with the script , and indeed fail to cure it of an essential ham . What would Anthony Aloysius Hancock have made of it all ... ? I will merely concede that a few moments just about work - chiefly those where G & S play things a little more carefully and B & C touch tenderer nerves - and it is not on the whole an unwatchable affair . < br /><br />But , and oh , how this pains me to say it : it is tiresome , boring , both wilfully detached from reality and what made the TV series great , and also fully in tune with the lazy , tawdry , misogynist ' fuck it , that 'll do ... ' actuality of much of what was allowed to pass for mainstream film - making in the Britain of the time .
0 Truly a disgusting , vile film , with only a small amount of real humour.<br /><br />The character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme ( intentionally so , obviously ) , and portrayed in the most pathetic , seedy manner.<br /><br />My wife and I found this film horribly upsetting , with absolutely no redeeming features at all . Frankly , I wish I had never seen it.<br /><br />I consider this British effort to be a sick and gross embarrassment.<br /><br />Those who enjoyed this film have an ability I totally lack : that of rejoicing in a display of deep depravity and squalor.<br /><br />The producers should be ashamed of themselves .
0 This film can be judged from three viewpoints : as history , as a profile of Amin , as a fictional thriller . < br /><br />It fails as history , it mentions in passing the coup that threw out Obote , the expulsion of the Asians , and has the Entebbe hi - jack as background , but not in any chronologically consistent time frame . < br /><br />As a profile of Amin it may have been interesting , because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good , and if this was a better film , he would get an Oscar . ( He got it - which proves the Oscar voters do n't watch the films they vote on . ) It ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel , which observed Amin and the history of Uganda from the point of view of the doctor . It tells instead the fictitious story of the Scots doctor and his impossible love life from the point of view of Amin . But the story told is the one incident that Amin was probably innocent of . < br /><br />As a fictional thriller , there is no plot to hold it together . The beginning is taut - it takes cinematic liberties with the novel , but sets up the story . The character of the doctor is well - defined , but becomes lost in the second half of the film which suffers as a result.<br /><br />Why the doctor decides to stay in Kampala is badly explained - seduced by power ? Why he befriends no - one is strange . The character of the friend in the novel has been lost because the Scotsman has the affair instead of the black doctor - a ludicrous entanglement which does not seem even faintly believable , but allows the writers of the film to show the ferocity of Amin close at hand . The Man called Horse bit at the end is risible . < br /><br />Finally in 1971 , Uganda drove on the left , not right , the number plates were three letters and two or three numbers - and where are the Equator tusks ? ! < br /><br />In short - if you 've never heard of Amin , you may want to spend two hours watching this film to appreciate Forest Whitaker 's acting , but the last hour will bore you to confusion . If you know Uganda or have read the book - do n't see the film - it will only depress you . And if you want to know why the doctor was so foolhardy - he was n't .
0 Forest Whitaker 's performance is all the more impressive for making it almost worthwhile to sit through this dreck . " Historical fiction " does not justify changing history . The absurdity begins from the ground up with the imaginary lead character played by James McAvoy . To create a fictional observer for the purpose of giving the reader a point of connection in the book is regrettable , regrettable that white people ca n't just read a book without a white protagonist to connect to , but at least he was placed in a somewhat passive role . Making up a fake historical actor and crediting this fiction with exposing Amin to the world is irresponsible , lazy and stupid . Not making the actions of this creation believable or even sane is just criminal , and has opened the door for movies like the one they 're planning to make with Leonardo DiCaprio as a heroic Enron whistleblower who NEVER EXISTED . The logic of the world does not apply in this film where some Scottish kid thinks its okay to sleep with the wife of a murderous dictator . It does n't apply where the wife of the dictator desires to sleep with some stupid scrawny irresponsible white boy . For that matter EVERYBODY is lined up to sleep with this scrawny , irresponsible , arrogant white boy , he even has Gillian Anderson licking her comely chops.<br /><br />Let me declare , I do not like James McAvoy . I 'm not sure what it is about him , but I thought his Mr. Tumnus in Narnia was creepy and pervy . I think that Kerry Washington would never look twice at him so I ca n't believe that the wife of a powerful dangerous man like Amin would risk and lose her life for him . I do n't believe him as a Doctor , and I just do n't see the appeal . His character seems to have far more arrogance than would make sense , and trying to make him look like a badass in shooting the cow was just ... there 's that word again ... absurd . Think about it , you are watching all of these characters bend themselves into knots in order to accommodate this unbelievable main character and there never was such a guy.<br /><br />Gillian Anderson looks incredible and sounds more British than most Brits . Whitaker gives a great expansive magnetic performance , and highlighted , with his incomprehensible pre - Oscar speeches , just how much he was acting . It 's a shame the film around him had no reason to exist .
0 Before I begin , I want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved , including Whittaker , who indeed deserves his nomination . It is highly entertaining , and . . . taken in the right context as a work of FICTION , it is a very good movie . For that , I give it the two stars.<br /><br />However , rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere , I want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth . I stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character , Dr. Nicholas Garrigan , is a complete invention of fiction . Rather , it presents this character into a real historical setting , and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real , and what they are seeing is the truth . I have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction - but to do so in such a dishonest matter is , in a word , reprehensible.<br /><br />There can be no doubt that Africa , along with most Third World Countries is rife with human misery and suffering . Hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film . But Hollywood also has its eye toward making money . The only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the West is to either experience it for yourself , or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary.<br /><br />But these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much . At the end of the day , they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself , and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming , " SEE , WE TOLD YOU IT WAS BAD ! " The seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the DVD after sitting through the movie . Arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of Kay Amin , Idi 's second wife , whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity . In the film , we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse ( arms for legs and vice - versa ) . This is the director making sure you understand that Amin is , as the Gungans say , Bom - bad ! But watching the documentary , we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth , which the sitting Minister of Health at the time himself tells us is not true.<br /><br />So . . . what . . . they just MAKE UP these things ? Why ? Because Hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence , that 's why ! They do n't trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves . Look , that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that Amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media - we do n't need this Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE inspired imagery to reinforce that ! And this is just the tip of the iceberg . What is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character Garrigan is himself fictional . There was no young Scottish doctor taken under Amin 's wing . As such , Garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb Westerners understand the African world . The producers seem to thing we wo n't be interested in a film about Africa unless there is a white face in it . ( Ironically , even the titular character is portrayed by an American black actor ! ) The problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of Amin and his regime , but instead an exploitative thriller about a white Westerner coming to Africa for all the wrong reasons , making several horrible mistakes , and then " redeeming " himself , even at the cost of three other innocent lives . Honestly , I have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of Mrs. Amin was the result of a tryst with a fictional Scottish doctor - it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment ! I really wish Hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money . I first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative A BEAUTIFUL MIND , Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman 's sugary - sweet adaptation of the life of John Nash , which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that America just ca n't get enough of . The sad truth is that Hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years , and viewers , who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves , buy these fake portraits hook , line , and sinker.<br /><br />Look , I 'm certainly not suggesting Amin is being turned into a villain he was n't . My point is , with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man , why must Hollywood then go to such fictional lengths ? Why must Hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films ? Why can they not trust us to think for ourselves ! ? Can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves ? I urge all who continue to watch Hollywood 's purportedly " true " movies to do yourself the favor of ALWAYS investigating for yourself , and to NEVER assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth !
0 Funny that I find myself forced to review this movie , but here I am.<br /><br />I am reviewing it , because just recently , I have had the chance to witness the revival of R.C. Sheriff 's play " Journey 's End " on stage in New York , at the Belasco Theatre , starring Hugh Darcy , Boyd Gaines , Jefferson Mays and others , as well as being masterfully directed by David Grindley.<br /><br />I left the theater shattered . I am not exaggerating , I was flabbergasted . After almost two and a half hours of a recreated and very claustrophobic depiction of soldier 's life in the trenches of the Somme ( I speculate ) , during World War One , brought to life vividly , by everyone involved , I came out of the theater with the shakes.<br /><br />Mind you , I am not easily shocked , nor am I too sensitive . I am a stage actor and a director myself , so I know the buttons being pressed to achieve certain effects , both emotionally , as well as psychologically.<br /><br />But what I had just witnessed , came so much to life , that I had chills in my spine as I left.<br /><br />None of these emotions came to life , while watching " Aces High " , the movie based on this play and even adapted for the screen , in cooperation with R.C. Sheriff himself , shortly before he died.<br /><br />The screen adaptation takes place in the skies over France . So , gone is the claustrophobic ambiance to start with.<br /><br />The only plus of the movie , are the aerial battle scenes , which look dated in their special effects , compared to today 's standards , but still very valid in the flying tactics adopted on screen.<br /><br />Granted there had been a couple of screen adaptations of " All Quiet on the Western Front " by Erich Maria Remarque , which takes place in trenches , and not in the sky , but that was the " German " vision on things , if one would like to be picky on such things.<br /><br />"Journey 's End " is just the other side of the medal , and would have made it into a great movie , if they had left it alone and intact.<br /><br />The transfer on DVD is poor , even though in Widescreen and adapted for 16:9 TV screens , the quality of the film itself is that of a movie theater . Nothing more , nothing less . It sports various defects , such as minor scratches and dots , although the copy , for the rest , is clean.<br /><br />If you want another WWI movie in your collection , especially for those who love and enjoy to see aerial battles among old - timers , then this is a picture for you . But I rather would suggest " Von Richthofen and Brown " as an alternative , although that too , is a movie filled with inaccuracies.<br /><br />For the rest of you , who love good acting and drama , I would leave this one out . Buy the play . Go watch the play , if you have the chance to get a decent revival of it near you , but keep off this would - be adaptation.<br /><br />It is an anti - war movie , granted , but the weakest I have ever seen in my lifetime ever.<br /><br />The presence of actors such as Trevor Howard , Ray Milland , Richard Johnson and John Gielgud , is just a bluff , since they are just seen in very weak and very brief cameo roles throughout the movie.<br /><br />McDowell , the very talented Christopher Plummer , Simon Ward and Peter Firth , all deliver very weak performances , not due to their lack of skills , but rather due to lack of true and solid direction.<br /><br />There are too many gaps in it , and as said before , it drags itself to the dubious end . Dubious because in the original play , none of the men we come to know and sympathize with , stay alive . They are all killed in a fatal and futile mission . In the movie they all die , except Malcolm McDowell , who manages somehow to stay alive another day , being the wing commander of the unlucky bunch , just to receive another three pilots to fly and die for another lost cause.<br /><br />The end of the play leaves a bare stage in total darkness . You just hear the cannons roar , the machine guns rattle , and grenade impacts throughout the theater . Then , suddenly , total peace and silence . The curtain comes up . Lights . And here they all are . Lined up , standing straight and rigid . Obedient corpses ... <br /><br />Far more interesting and far more shocking than " Aces High " finale , which is also dragged by the hair.<br /><br />It is up to you to judge.<br /><br />For me , if I had the money and the contacts to do so , I would take the play and develop it , the way it was meant . Adding here and there some action scene in the field , just to visualize the " outer " horror and slaughter going on in the " vasty fields of France " , around the men involved , but then , just strictly concentrating on what is going on , in that tiny " shack " at the edge of sanity and the world ... <br /><br />Want such a movie?<br /><br />Then ask for it.<br /><br />This is not it .
0 Despite the excellent cast , this is an unremarkable film , especially from the aviation perspective . It may be somewhat better than the egregious " von Richthofen and Brown " but not by much . " Blue Max " remains the best of a small market over the last 35 years while " Darling Lilli " is fun if not taken seriously . It 's interesting to speculate what ILM could do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new , high - quality WW I aero film .
0 I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a while ... what with all it 's raving reviews , nominations and media attention . And I must say , the first quarter of the movie was good ! It really portrayed the black music scene back then . However , as the movie wore on , me and my whole family were bored out of our wits . The singing just kept coming , one after the other . I mean seriously , just one more music number and it would have broke even with RENT.<br /><br />Furthermore , I noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters ; I just did n't care what happened to them ! Even when Eddie Murphy 's character died of a drug overdose , I knew I should have been sad , but I just could n't feel any emotion for that character . The characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot , but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in.<br /><br />Finally , the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care , which goes along with the lack of character development . This movie reminded me of a copy - cat movie based on Ray , Chicago , and Rent ( Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion ) . Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who does n't really care about an overall story , yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances .
0 Yes there are great performances here . Unfortunately , they happen in the context of a movie that does n't seem to have a clue what it 's doing . During the first 45 - 60 minutes of this all the music takes place as realistic performance . Suddenly , about an hour in , the characters who , until this point , had always spoken to each other , suddenly start singing to each other . To further confuse things , a little further in , out of nowhere , they actually do about 15 minutes of sung - through dialog , then seem to drop that idea and move on to other things , such as a number that begins in a jazz club with a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turning into a fully orchestrated piece with a massive unseen string section . On top of all this inconsistency in how the music is used , is the composers ' clear inability to actually write music in the style that is supposedly being portrayed . While the first couple of pieces do sort of mimic the 1950s Motown sound , the rest of the film is just ( bad ) Broadway show music . Then there 's the pure silliness of snippets of a group doing a bad Jackson family imitation and Eddie Murphy morphing from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie . When he started channeling Stevie Wonder I could n't help laughing out loud . This was clearly one of those films that make me appreciate how little time I have on earth and resent that I wasted two hours of it watching this film .
0 I anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the Broadway play . I waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances . I mean with the star power of Eddie Murphy , Jamie Foxx , Beyonce Knowles , Danny Glover ... the movie could n't be less than 4 out of 4 stars , right ? WRONG ! I was definitely disappointed by the finished product . The film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving graces were Eddie Murphy , Anika Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy 's James Brownesque performance rescues the movie just when it hits its multiple lulls and Jennifer Hudson 's performance compels you to pay attention each time she 's on screen . Her performance of " And I Am Telling You " was the only time that I felt the hype was deserved . You cringed as she begged her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life . As many reviewers have stated , she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades she 's receiving for this performance . Anika Noni Rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent . < br /><br />Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles , on the other hand , cruised through their performances . Foxx 's acting skills for this film seemed to predate his extraordinary " Ray " performance and Beyonce Knowles was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video taping , posing and shimmying her way through the movie . Her performance was n't strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film.<br /><br />The movie was too hyped , 30 minutes and 1 song ( Beyonce 's " heartfelt " solo to Jamie Foxx ) too long.<br /><br />DH -- Vancouver , WA
0 It makes sense to me that this film is getting raves from Hollywood because oftentimes in Hollywood it 's all just a popularity contest . It also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just be reacting to the countless songs being spit out at you rather than story content . Yet , this film is overrated and overblown . Eddie Murphy looks just ridiculous . No way do Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar rated performance so many have raved over BEFORE the film was even out . I ca n't even believe that Condon is being set up to be nominated for a Directing Oscar when all he did was put together an album . Glitz does not replace a nothing storyline . A bunch of songs does not a movie make .
0 This was longer than the Ten Commandments , All Lord of the Rings and the Matrix Trilogy combined . My oh My , what a nightmare . This is the single biggest over - hype of 2006 . THere is not a moment that is not scripted and clichéd . Movie Musicals can be done brilliantly and bring genuine excitement to the viewer . Dreamgirls takes the route of Chinese Water Torture , in the form of endless music montages , shoddy acting , and poor directing choices ( Seriously , Mr. Condon , did you HAVE to do the old Billboard countdown shots ? It 's at # 58 ! No wait , look its rising up the charts and here is the passing Billboard notice to show you again .... and again .... and again )
0 Yeah . Pretty sure I saw this movie years ago when it was about the Supremes.<br /><br />Another recycled storyline glitzed up Hollywood - style , borrowing scripts from better making - it - in - the - music - industry films.<br /><br />Nothing original here.<br /><br />More make - up , glammier costumes and choreography = more money for the questionably " talented " Beyonce draw.<br /><br />If you like the throwback style , you should appreciate actual groups who struggled ( without having digitized voices and a Hollywood empire).<br /><br />Beyonce 's involvement makes this hypocritical garbage .
0 Dreamgirls , despite its fistful of Tony wins in an incredibly weak year on Broadway , has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals . However , that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on - screen . Unfortunately , what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact . First , the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor . There are lots of songs ( perhaps too many ? ) , but few of them are especially memorable . The closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and One Night Only - the much acclaimed And I Am Telling You That I Am Not Going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of Effie ( Jennifer Hudson ) . The film is slick and technically well - produced , but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance . There is some interest in the opening moments , watching Jamie Foxx 's Svengali - like manager manipulate his acts to the top , but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film , when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain , despite his having been right from a business stand - point for a good majority of the film . Beyonce Knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well , but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz . Anika Noni Rose as the third member of the Dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film . Eddie Murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on James Brown , but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact . Foxx would seem ideal casting , but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored . The film 's biggest selling point is surely former American Idol contestant / Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson in the central role of Effie White , the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return . For me , Effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie . The film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather ham - handedly takes her side , but I have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion . From the start , Effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious , egotistical , self - centered diva , who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part . When she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude , the charges are more than well - founded , but the stage show / film seem to think Effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice . Even though the film tries to soften some of Effie 's harder edges to make her more likable , the charges still stand . Her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter - using the implication that ( much like the talent card ) motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable . Indeed the only big effort the film makes to show Effie 's mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office , insists that the girl has " no father " and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows . In the hands of a skillful actress , the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma . Unfortunately , Hudson is not that actress . She sings well , but the dialog - driven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments . Effie 's signature moment ( the aforementioned And I Am Telling You ... number ) is well - sung by Hudson , but emotionally flat in the acting department . Effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament , but Hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number . All in all , not quite the emotional highlight one expects . The latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver Foxx into Hudson 's earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone . Foxx 's criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers , but the film 's seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous , not to mention pretentious and condescending , particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle . The end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit , drained of emotion , energy or anything that can be described as dynamic .
0 I just saw DreamGirls yesterday , and I was REALLY underimpressed . Despite all the Oscar buzz , this is nothing special . Anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics . Except for Eddie Murphy 's great musical and dramatic performance , Dreamgirls is just a glorified TV movie with no style or flair . Just a bunch of amateurs singing AT each other!<br /><br />Now , the first half hour was good , but I was irritated at how Eddie Murphy 's terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages . Those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film . And the " rise to the top " portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum . The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless , rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting . It was also visually dull and included too many sound - alike tunes.<br /><br />Condon did n't try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as I 'd expected they would . Each number in the 2nd half was just one closeup after another of people " singing " AT each other . And the way they shot Hudson 's big " love me " number was criminal ! Condon just shot her stomping around the stage -- no drama at all ! God it sucked!<br /><br />AND note to all involved -- that " sing - talking dialog " stuff might work on stage , but it DOES NOT WORK IN MOVIES ( see embarrassing failures of Evita and Phantom ) . All that " I 'll teeeell youuuu something Efff - ieeee ! " crap should have been left on the editing room floor . Those are n't " songs." < br /><br />Again , the film -- except for Eddie Murphy 's amazing performance -- was nothing more than a glorified TV movie . There must have been megabucks behind the PR work for this film ! I wonder how much money was spent to give it that pre - release " one to beat " Oscar buzz ? As a whole this film was , except for Eddie , NOWHERE NEAR an Oscar caliber movie ! ( except for Eddie ) I 'd rank it right up there with Grease 2 . BIG disappointment , especially after all the ( very expen$I've ) hype !
0 We expected something great when we went to see this bomb . It is basically a Broadway play put on film . The music is plain terrible . There is n't one memorable song in the movie -- heard any hits from this movie ? You wo n't because there are n't any . Some of the musical numbers go on so long that I got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when I got back ! If they were good songs well -- but they suck . The pace is slow , terrible character development . The lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song -- it was almost impossible to stand . This movie has NOTHING to offer anyone but die - hard Broadway enthusiasts . This is without a doubt the most over rated movie I 've seen in my entire life . A complete waist of time and money . There is nothing memorable about this movie except Danny Glover -- who was n't on screen enough and whose character was n't developed enough . Rent the video and you 'll agree -- this movie was an expensive , over produced , polished dog do .
0 This movie is all flash and no soul . The actors put a lot of passion into the numbers , but these numbers often did n't connect with the film and felt like stand - alone music videos . And no effort was made to make the numbers sound as if they were happening right there in front of you , every single one sounds like its coming from a studio , essentially sucking all the life from the songs . Off the stage the performances were all dull and unrealized , especially Hudson , who essentially plays the same angry , " strong " ( she 's stubborn and selfish ) black woman we 've seen before . There was absolutely no depth to her character , nor any of the other female leads . Though I think the movie wants us to believe that Hudson 's character faces hardship because of her weight , it is really her own refusal to do what 's best for the team that lands her in trouble , making the end of the film totally meaningless . Hudson 's Academy Award is a joke , there was no justification . When she sang , she put forth emotion ( though it was often misplaced , but this was the writer / director 's fault ) , but when she was just acting , she did nothing to flesh out an already underwritten character . Eddie Murphy 's character is the only one with an arc , and he did a fine job , but still not Oscar worthy . The only actor who really brought something to the roll was Danny Glover , who took a small , relatively unimportant character and made something real out of it . There is nothing here to sink your teeth into , no drama or heart , or even laughs . The placement of the musical numbers was so bad that at times the movie almost seemed to be making fun of musicals instead of being one ; the number when Hudson is arguing with the other girls is so long - winded if it had been any longer it could pass for a Family Guy skit . The movie has no idea what it 's about , and I felt insulted by the last few minutes . It 's a big , boring waste of time , and really is the worst film I saw in ' 06 , and nothing last year was really stellar to begin with .
0 Eddie Murphy for best supporting actor ? ? ? What an insult to Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou . < br /><br />Jamie Foxx ( who can act ) walks through this film like a zombie . < br /><br />Beyonce ? ? ? That was acting ? ? ? < br /><br />This movie pales in comparison to CHICAGO or just about any other recent musical . < br /><br />If it were not for the great singing and performance of Jennifer Hudson I would have given this a ZERO.<br /><br />And no I never saw the stage play so I am not making the typical Broadway vs. Hollywood rap .
0 Wow , this is very unusual in one regard : usually the first movie in a long string of sequels is the best of the bunch . People are surprised when a sequel is actually better . With Tarzan , I thought this movie was the worst of the bunch , or at least the first six which comprise my Tarzan Collection DVD package . I will gladly watch the sequels multiple times but I am through sitting through this turkey , thanks to several characters.<br /><br />Well , let 's start with the good news first:<br /><br />THE GOOD - Plenty of action with a lot of wild animals on display , even if they are just stock footage . You see lion attacks , crocodiles , hippos , panthers , you name it , and you see several of the different tribes of all kinds , including pygmies ( called " dwarfs " in the movie . ) Since this movie was made almost 75 years ago , I ca n't knock any of the realism because they did n't have it in the movies that long ago . They do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds . However , Weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape . He and O'Sullivan make a well - built handsome couple , if there ever was one in those Golden Years of cinema.<br /><br />The film has historical value ( with so many sequels ) in that it shows how Tarzan acquired Jane and his beginnings of learning the English language.<br /><br />The BAD - From the moment " Jane Parker " is taken by Tarzan almost every scene with her is Maureen O'Sullivan in hysterics , shrieking and screaming scene after scene . It 's enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film . Thankfully , she calmed down in the sequels , but not in this movie . The movie also does no favors for " The Great White Hunter " image as C. Aubrey Smith , playing Jane 's father , and Neil Hamilton , as " Harry Holt , " the safari guide , shoot at every animal within sight , whether the beasts is threatening or not . These people are kill- happy , particularly Smith . On another note , it 's too bad there is n't anything in here explaining how Tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place . There is no history of him in here or footage of his growing up . He 's just there when Jane and the group get to a certain point in Africa .
0 From the stupid " quaint African natives " travelogue footage with our badly - superimposed principals acting as narrators , to the horrible fake ears which transform docile Indian elephants into African elephants , to the utter lack of any logic at all , to Maureen O'Sullivan 's incessant whining of " Tarzan ! Tarzan ! " , there is nothing about this movie which deserves classic status.<br /><br />4/10
0 A memorable line from a short lived show . After viewing the episode where that line was introduced my fraternity intramural flag football team started using the line to break our huddles on offense . Instead of Ready / Break , our quarter back said FOOTBALL and the rest of the squad responded YOU BET ! A fun way to break the huddle that had our opponents scratching their heads as very few of them had watched the show . Using this line added a unique element to our season that I 'll never forget . We had our best season during my time in college that year and in a small way it was due to the fun that we had using this line . The show was pretty much a stinker but it lives on in the memories of the 1977 Pi Kappa Phi intramural flag football squad at West Virginia Tech .
0 Before seeing this movie , I was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on ideas from the book ; instead , it 's the book , interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the different " illnesses . " That did n't bother me much , but it hindered my enjoyment of the film . One story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable , in my opinion . If you 're going to base a movie on a psychology text , you 've got to find a more interesting ( and preferably accurate ) text than this one . The film drags during parts where it 's little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology and would be utterly intolerable if it were n't sexual in nature ( because " sex = interesting " for most of us , even me ) . Luckily , there are several stories with actual character development that pull us in.<br /><br />But , disappointingly , Krafft - Ebing 's theories of sexuality went unchallenged , for the most part . I was hoping it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology which is still held by many to this day.<br /><br />So , in the end , what do you have ? A detailed catalog of a few fetishes and orientations , with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of a few " sexual deviants " before they are cured . For most of the film , the film moves with the crawling speed ( and mood ) of a wake . And , as an obviously low budget film , the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier . Although I * was * pleased with the music , costume and interior design.<br /><br />I felt this film 's subject was right up my alley , and I still feel it 's a below average film . It deserves a 3/10 ; a 4/10 if I were feeling extremely generous . I ca n't imagine anyone enjoying this if they did n't already have an interest in sexual fetishism .
0 I have three comments to make about this film , which I discovered hanging out forlornly in a lower shelf at Blockbuster . First off , it is interesting to see the approaches film makers take in trying to film essentially unfilmable works . Some have , as Kubrick did with " Lolita " , gotten the original author to write a screenplay that is something like the original work . Of course that ca n't happen here ; Kraft - Ebing is long dead . Some have used the premises of the original work as a launch point to go in a completely new , unrelated direction ( the recent adaptation of " Tristram Shandy " comes to mind here ) . You can dumb it down - the film of " Slaughterhouse Five " is to my mind an example of that . Or you can simply take the format of the original and try to render it in cinematic vignettes . That would be the approach of Woody Allen 's " Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex " , and , arguably , this film . Upon consideration , it is probably the only thing one can do with a scholarly work like " Psychopathia Sexualis " . The potential loss is that whatever cumulative point the original work had is obscured or destroyed . And so it is here.<br /><br />Point two is the cinematic style . Some would call it an " homage " to Murnau , Pabst , Carl Dreyer , etc . , but I think it more crude than that . Its far too heavy handed and self - conscious to be effective for long . It is eventually just annoying.<br /><br />Point three is perhaps a less intellectual observation . How did the people responsible for this manage to make a film about wild sexual deviations and perversion that is so incredibly boring ? I found the film impossible to pay attention to , and anyone who is not automatically drawn to depictions of sexual deviance will find it so as well . I do n't want to be completely uncharitable and say the film is pointless , but I have to say that whatever point the film makers had is rather obscured by the nature of the source material , the overt copying of filmic styles , and the stubborn refusal to engage the audience on an emotional level ( possibly for fear of being accused of titillation).<br /><br />The film is a dubious exercise from the start and does n't really work for me , I 'm sorry to say .
0 I gave this a four purely out of its historical context . It was considered lost for many years until it popped up out of the blue on Showtime in the early nineties.<br /><br />Moe is the straight man and Larry and Curly act as a duo . Spade Cooley has a couple of numbers . I guess it had something to do with working on a ranch . I 'm not quite sure because the plot was so minimal nothing really sticks in my memory . I vaguely remember it being a western musical comedy . Even the Stooge 's seem to be going through the motions . Overall there 's nothing much really to recommend here.<br /><br />If you 're not a Stooge fan then do n't bother . If you are a Stooge fan , then stick with the shorts .
0 The Three Stooges in a feature length western comedy - musical ? Perhaps " Rockin ' in the Rockies " was meant to combine the Stooges comedy short with the western musical , in a matinée ; if so , this was a pleasant way to break up a Saturday afternoon . Jay Kirby ( as Rusty ) is a handsome young hero ; and , Mary Beth Hughes ( as the blonde June ) and Gladys Blake ( as the brunette Betty ) are pretty women . The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group ; their songs are quite tuneful ; however , this is the 1940s , not the 1950s , so the film does n't exactly " rock " . There are a few laughs ; but the Stooges ' brand of humor is more subdued than usual . The talking horse is also underutilized . < br /><br / > * * * * Rockin ' in the Rockies ( 4/17/45 ) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard , Larry Fine , Curly Howard , Mary Beth Hughes
0 Having just seen this on TMC , it 's fresh in my mind . It 's obvious that while the stooges are featured stars , they do n't really run the show . First , they 're broken into 2 groups - Moe , as " Shorty " and Larry and Curly as a pair of vagrants , so there 's not a whole lot of full team work . The love story that fuels the plot is uninteresting , the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability , there 's another group of musical stooges that are unfunny , unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly buffoonish . The music is tiresome , they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses , the dorky western wear is silly , and there 's an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera . By the way , this is obviously after Curley 's first stroke , and his reduced energy level is clear . Vernon Dent appears early on in an uncredited role . I loved everything these guys ever did , including all the non - Curley stuff , but this little dogie is pretty lousy .
0 Not even the most ardent stooge fan could possibly like the movie , ( I one of them ) the stooges just are n't given any material to work with . It is really a shame too because this is the only feature length movie the stooges did with Curly , and this one effort by them is painfully unfunny , when it could have had great potential . Awful musical numbers do n't help any either . The short they did with the same title has more laughs .
0 I am a huge Stooges fan but the one and only redeeming quality this movie has is that Curley is in it . Done long before he started drinking heavily he is his classic self in this ( and Larry 's not bad either ) . Moe 's character is a straight part ( mostly ) and this movie would be better named " The Curley and Larry Movie " . Not that any of the Stooges movies were very good ( in my opinion ) , but as one commenter here said , how sad it is that this movie had real potential . The casting was good , it was well directed , filmed , and edited , but the story line tried to be about something serious with just some Stooges antics and musical numbers ( which I guess were good back then ) thrown in . The best thing you can do for yourself during this movie should you actually believe that it has to be better than mowing the lawn and taking out the trash ( which is subject to debate ) is to wait for Curley / Larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen to eat during the rest of it .
0 Schlocky ' 70s horror films ... ya got ta love 'em . In contrast to today 's boring slasher flicks , these K - tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula.<br /><br />This is a B movie about the making of a B movie ... that went horribly wrong . Faith Domergue ( This Island Earth ) stars as an over - the - hill , B movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home . Her boyfriend / director , who looks and acts like Gordon Jump with an attitude , is filming on location and on a tight schedule . The Ken doll co - star discovers a book of Tibetian chants that they work into the script to add " realism " . Unfortunately , " realism " is something they could have done without.<br /><br />John Carradine , having long since given up looking for the 17th gland ( The Unearthly ) , now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate . He goes about his daily work , but always seems to run afoul of the director.<br /><br />The horror builds slowly ; a dead cat here , John Carradine entering a grave there , finally culminating in seven , yes seven murders . ( At least there 's truth in advertising . ) It 's just sad that the ghoul did n't understand that there was a movie being made above him . How was poor Faith to know that those darn Tibetian chants would actually work ? Face it , you just ca n't go around tugging on Satan 's coat and expect him to take it lying down.<br /><br />Sterno says perform an autopsy on The House of Seven Corpses .
0 After reading the previous comments , I 'm just glad that I was n't the only person left confused , especially by the last 20 minutes . John Carradine is shown twice walking down into a grave and pulling the lid shut after him . I anxiously awaited some kind of explanation for this odd behavior ... naturally I assumed he had something to do with the evil goings - on at the house , but since he got killed off by the first rising corpse ( hereafter referred to as Zombie # 1 ) , these scenes made absolutely no sense . Please , if someone out there knows why Carradine kept climbing down into graves -- let the rest of us in on it ! ! < br /><br />All the action is confined to the last 20 minutes so I 'll attempt a synopsis . John Carradine comes out to the cemetery to investigate , and is throttled by Zombie # 1 . So far , so good . But then we get the confusing scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler , out for a little moonlight filming in the graveyard , discover Carradine 's dead body . Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into the open grave from whence Zombie # 1 had emerged , but Ireland succeeds in flipping him into the open grave instead , and PRESTO ! Strickler comes out as Zombie # 2 ! Yeah , I guess we can infer that Strickler was dead all - along ( a witch ? ) , but why he changed from normal appearance into rotting - flesh version by flying into Zombie # 1 's grave is never explained . ( Considering how excruciatingly slow - moving these zombies are , I 'd of thought he would have preferred to stay in his " normal " form until his business was concluded ) . This scene also brings a question to mind -- just who the heck IS Zombie # 1 ? ? ? We can only assume Zombie # 1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the movie 's opening credits , but who knows which one , nor why he has a particular grudge against the film crew.<br /><br />Anyway , after Ireland sees this transformation and runs away , we see the EXACT SAME SHOT of Zombie # 2 shambling through the trees as we saw for Zombie # 1 . ( This leads to momentary confusion over just how MANY zombies there really are ) . Then in best 1950 's horror - movie fashion Ireland manages to trip while fleeing . He conveniently knocks his head on the small headstone of Faith Domergue 's dead cat ( was n't that nice of John Carradine to chisel a tombstone for a cat that he barely knew?)<br /><br />Meanwhile , Zombie # 1 has been wrecking havoc up at the house . He easily dispatches three film - crew members , then starts up the stairs . Faith Domergue hears him , and thinking it 's lover John Ireland back from his night - shoot , goes out . Upon seeing it 's only Zombie # 1 , she lets out a scream and retreats into a bedroom where she retrieves Ireland 's revolver . While starlet Carole Wells is showering at this point and ca n't hear the scream , her co - star Charles Macauley ( who 's boozing and hamming it up at a mirror in his bedroom ) does . Taking his sweet time ( and only after some more swigs from his hip - flask ) he finally decides to investigate . ( One thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this movie is how SLOW TO REACT the stars are to screams and gunshots ) . Domergue comes back out into the hallway armed and ready , but mistakes Macauley for Zombie # 1 and shoots him six times ! He does a nice acrobatic flip over the railing , then a horrified Domergue backs up , right into the waiting arms of Zombie # 1.<br /><br />Carole Wells is by now out of her shower and drying off when she hears gunshots and Domergue 's screams ; she too feels no great urgency in running out to investigate . So during this time Zombie # 1 has time to string Domergue up from the neck with a rope . Wells sees Domergue 's hanging corpse and faints dead - away . The next time we see her is in a stream outside the house ( ? ? ? ) -- but more on that later . Meantime , Ireland has recovered his senses and stumbles into the house where he discovers Zombie # 1 's bloody carnage . Though Ireland has just stumbled upon 3 murdered people he 's more concerned that his film has been exposed and ruined ! Mercifully for him ( and the audience ) , Zombie # 1 throws some movie equipment down on his head from the 2nd floor . That 's the last we see of Zombie # 1 . At this point the audience is treated to a montage of all the deaths , showing that the new ones " mirror " the old ones . How profound.<br /><br />Zombie # 2 , meanwhile , has gotten near the house ( remember , these zombies move as slow as molasses in January ) where he happens to see Carole Wells floating by in a stream , and fishes her out . How did she get there ? Did Zombie # 1 carry her down , throw her in , then zoom back upstairs just in time to crush John Ireland ? Apparently one of the original victims was drowned in the tub , so Wells has to drown too ( but why outside in a stream , instead of in the tub , is never explained ) . Zombie # 2 never makes it into the house himself ( everyone 's dead by now , anyways , thanks to Zombie # 1 ) but instead he carries Carol Wells back to the graveyard . As the end credits flash on screen , we see Zombie # 2 with his dead love still in his arms , descending into the open grave.<br /><br />The viewer is left wondering : Yes , but was n't this Zombie # 1 's grave ? Why is Zombie # 2 taking up residence ? And what if Zombie # 1 comes along and wants to climb back in -- is Zombie # 2 gon na let him , or will there be a zombie fight ? Will the zombies share both the grave and the newly deceased Carole Wells ? And what about now - dead John Carradine -- where 's he gon na stay ? After all , from the earlier scenes we know he 's clearly at home in the grave ... If this plot synopsis of the finale has left you confused , do n't worry cause you 're not alone .
0 ... but I 've seen better too.<br /><br />The story here is predictable -- a film crew trying to film a horror movie in a place where murders occurred . Three guesses what happens . This is n't a total bomb -- the cast is fairly good with pros John Ireland , Faith Domergue and John Carradine giving the best performances . It 's reasonably well - made -- for a low budget film . Just do n't expect any nudity , swearing , blood OR gore ( the film has a very mild PG rating ) . I was never totally bored -- it 's OK viewing on a quiet night . I saw it on video -- it was a HORRIBLE print -- very dark and some scenes were impossible to see . Still I did n't hate it and it does have a cool ending which surprised me -- basically nothing happens up till then so it catches you off guard . Worth seeing but only if you 're a horror film completest .
0 - A film crew is shooting a horror movie in an old , supposedly cursed house where over the years , seven people have mysteriously died . One of the crew finds an old book of spells and it looks like it would be perfect to use in some of the ritual scenes in their movie . It is reasoned that the spells in the book are better written than the script they are using . But as the book is read , the graveyard outside suddenly comes to life . Now the cast and crew are faced with real danger .<br /><br />- IMDb lists a running time of 90 minutes . For the first 60 of those minutes , nothing happens . Far too much time is spent on the movie within a movie . Are we supposed to be frightened by the horror movie that they are shooting ? We already know that their movie is n't " real " . These scares just do n't work.<br /><br />- There are very few things to enjoy about The House of Seven Corpses . The acting is atrocious . Most of these " actors " would have trouble making a elementary school play . The score is terrible . It is very reminiscent of a 70s television series and provides no atmosphere . Speaking of atmosphere , other than a few moments at the end of the movie , there is none to speak of . Character logic is all but non - existent . Even in a movie , you expect characters to behave in a certain way . Here , I do n't think I remember one scene where a character did n't choose the most illogical avenue available to them . And finally , there 's those first 60 minutes of the movie that I 've already mentioned . Can you say BORING ? < br /><br />- I have n't rated The House of Seven Corpses any lower because of instances where the movie ( probably by accident ) actually works . My two favorite are the beginning and ending . The opening title sequence presents the deaths of the seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the movie . And , the ending scenes on the massive staircase as the zombie menaces the film crew are somewhat effective ( what a ringing endorsement ) . Overall though , these moments are n't enough to make this a good movie .
0 Ostensibly this is a Z - grade DTV horror film.<br /><br />But with lines like : < br /><br />"It 's easy to die , I have , many times" < br /><br />and < br /><br />"Why are you reading that book ? " " Because it makes the plot more interesting" < br /><br />and < br /><br />"You made your way in here , now you can make your way out again ! " ( after he leads a man into the basement)<br /><br />(and take a listen to what they chant)<br /><br />- it 's not that clear what this film , made in the era known for post - structuralism , is actually about , or whether its just bad film - making . The acting is atrocious , but some actors I know , so are they hamming it up ? < br /><br />An old house , cut obviously with a contemporary dwelling , is the site of murders . A ( bad ) film is made in the grounds and the story replays again .
0 John Carradine , John Ireland , and Faith Domergue who as players all saw better days in better films got together for this Grade G horror film about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion.<br /><br />For Carradine it was in those last two decades of his career that he appeared in anything on the theory it was better to keep working no matter what you did and get those paychecks coming in . With that magnificent sonorous voice of his , Carradine was always in great demand for horror pictures and the man did not discriminate in the least in what he appeared in.<br /><br />He plays the caretaker of an old Gothic mansion who movie director John Ireland has rented for his latest low budget slasher film . It 's even got a graveyard , but with a missing occupant . Faith Domergue is Ireland 's aging star and Carole Wells is the young ingenue.<br /><br />In the last twenty minutes or so most of the cast winds up dead that are n't dead already . The script is so incoherent I 'm still trying to figure out the point . I wo n't waste any more gray matter on it .
0 This is the type of movie where it actually hurts to acknowledge that it really , really sucks . I normally sanctify stuff like this ! Early 70 's grindhouse flicks with scrumptious sounding titles and a schlocky low - budget atmosphere usually ROCK . " House of Seven Corpses " appeared to dispose of even more trumps , since the cast is a gathering of great genre veterans ( including John Carradine , John Ireland and Faith Domergue ) and the filming locations ( the titular house , the graveyard ) are obviously very expedient for a gloomy tale of terror . The film opens with its absolute greatest and most hauntingly memorable sequences , though sadly enough they 're the only ones that qualify as such . The credits are a splendid montage , complete with freakish color - effects and eerie freeze - frames , illustrating how the titular house received its notorious reputation . The last seven owners were mysteriously murdered here and the credits montage gleefully exhibits their final moments . Someone falls down the balcony screaming , a lady drowns in her bathtub , and another female body hangs dangling from the ceiling and four more macabre tableaux . Needless to say the house is cursed and the awkward behavior of t caretaker Mr. Price ( Carradine ) only fortify this reputation . In other words , the house forms the ideal turf for the acclaimed director Eric Hartman ( John Ireland ) to shoot his satanic horror film project . The film - within - film structure is what mainly causes " House of Seven Corpses " to be so boring and uneventful . A lot of movie - material is wasted on crew members putting films spools in the camera and dragging around cables or  even worse  Faith Domergue and Charles Macaulay portraying horridly intolerable actor stereotypes . The plot finally gets a little interesting ( only a little , mind you ) when one of the characters reads some lines from an occult book and accidentally awakes a rotting corpse in the backyard . The asthmatic ( judging by the noises he produces ) zombie slowly heads for the house and kills the entire movie crew , reminiscent of how the previous seven turned into corpses . After a running time of approximately 60 minutes , the film suddenly turns from humdrum into just plain weird and confusing . I 'm still unsure whether the final twist has to do with the concept of reincarnation or just coincidence and all the remaining characters suddenly seem to go undergo vast mental transformations shortly before they die , for some reason . I honestly regret confirming " House of Seven Corpses " is a pretty dreadful movie . The locations and scenery are gloomy chilling , but not nearly used to full effect and there 's a serious lack of gruesome bloodshed . Numerous low - budgeted 70 's gems were stunningly gross , so the lack of financial means is no excuse and the film - within - film murders really do n't count . Even the always - reliable veteran stars deliver hammy performances and Harrison 's direction is completely uninspired . Not recommended , unless you think the zero cool four - and - a - half minute playing opening credits montage is worth the effort of purchasing a copy .
0 Well ... now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his " House of 1,000 Corpses " crapfest , I can now rest in peace . Nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in " The House of Seven Corpses , " but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot ( ha ! ) anyway , to kill the bloody amateurs making a low - rent horror flick in his former abode ! In Hell House ( sorry , I do n't remember the actual name of the residence ) , a bunch of mysterious , unexplained deaths took place long ago ; some , like arthritic Lurch stand - in John Carradine ( whose small role provides the film 's only worthwhile moments ) , attribute it to the supernatural ; bellowing film director John Ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum . The result comes across like " Satan 's School for Girls " ( catchy title ; made - for - TV production values ; intriguing plot ) crossed with " Children Should n't Play With Dead Things " ( low - rent movie about low - rent movie makers who wake the dead ) ; trouble is , it 's nowhere near as entertaining or fun . " The House of Seven Corpses " is dead at frame one , and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis , dragging us along for every aching second ...
0 A director and his crew head out to the isolated Beal mansion , to make a low - budget horror film about the seven mysterious deaths of the Beal family that have occurred there in the last century . Even with warnings by the caretaker , the director pays no attention to the supposedly cursed house . One of the crew find a book titled Tibetan Book of the Dead , and use some of the passages from it for their script . But in doing so , when red they raise a ghoul from its grave.<br /><br />Boring , confusing and tacky all rolled up into one , equals this penniless midnight horror production . What feels like an eternity , it just never seems to get going or demonstrate anything effective from somewhat decent ideas . Even though director Paul Harrison 's clunky , tensionless direction did construct a couple eerie , moody and atmospheric set - pieces . But laziness did set it early . The whole film within a film structure takes up most of the movie and in this time little to nothing happens of great interest . Nor is it fun . Think of Bob Clark 's " Children Should n't Play with Dead Things ( 1972 ) " , and now we 've got older actors in the part . However I found " Seven Corpses " to be inferior . The script early on has some cutting wit abound , before it ends up being drab , predictable and left with many unfulfilled possibilities . The cheap foundation involving limited sets did n't help matters either , but the mansion 's dreary , dark appearance had a creepy air to it . Performances from a recognizable b - cast is mainly rigid . John Carradine in small part mainly lurks about . John Ireland plays a hot - headed director , Faith Domergue 's washed - up actress demands attention and Charles Macaulay hams it up . The slow grinding premise is crossed between " Ten Little Indians " and your usual zombie set - up . However its not all that engaging , even with its occult and supernatural edge . Hell they even throw in some graveyard action , with no prevail . When the rotting ghoul makes its appearance   finally , but a bit late . It does get a little better , if very baffling . Just like the inspired opening , the ending is deliciously downbeat . To bad in between , it constantly drags . Continuity in many scenes comes across non - existent , and the death scenes are more exciting and bloodier ( but indeed poorly executed ) in the movie they 're making , then what actually happens to them when the zombie appears . The generic music score flounders on with its shuddery , but frank Gothic cues , and the camera - work is blandly staged with a lack of imagination . Shoot and frame . Shoot and frame . Job done . That 's a wrap .
0 So that´s what I called a bad , bad film ... Poor acting , poor directing , terrible writing ! ! ! ! I just can´t stop laughing at some scenes , because the story is meaningless ! ! ! Don´t waste your time watching this film ... Well , I must recognize it has one or two good ideas but it´s sooooo badly writen ...
0 Comes this heartwarming tale of hope . Hope that you 'll never have to endure anything this awful again . * cough * Razzie award * cough*<br /><br />I disliked this movie because it was unfunny , predictable and inane . While watching I felt like I was in a psychology experiment to determine how low movie standards could get before people complained . When I requested my money back at the end of the movie I was informed that because I watched the whole thing ' I was n't entitled to reimbursement ' . I was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten refunds already though.<br /><br />The movie summary is pretty basic . The midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to elude police . Underneath this clever outline however , lies a repertoire of original , fresh and hilarious skits . Or not.<br /><br />Ask yourself the following : Do you like to see people getting hit by pans ? Do you like fart jokes ? Do you like to see midgets posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus ? Do you like tired racial jokes ? Do you think babies say ' goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa ' ? Do you drool?<br /><br />If you answered ' yes ' to any of the above then this movie is definitely for you . Although it has been billed in some places as ' The Worst Movie of the Decade ' , there is probably a movie or 2 that are worse ... somewhere . I ca n't say for sure . I gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review would n't be taken seriously . < br /><br />This lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and I can not in good conscience recommend it to anyone . Save your money for something funny.<br /><br />Respect
0 This was the worst movie I 've ever seen in theaters . It was just a compilation of recycled material . People getting hit in the head is not funny . People getting kicked is not funny . After the third time a guy got kicked in the balls not even the youngest audience member was laughing anymore . It just got tired fast.<br /><br />I went with my younger sister . She actually laughs out loud at King of the Hill but this cinematic masterpiece bored her . I 'm not surprised . The story is pretty lame . A midget thief steals a big diamond in what was definitely the easiest heist in Hollywood history . Then he hides out with a family pretending to be a baby . I know it sounds exciting but that 's the whole story . Say those two lines over and over for 1.5 hours and you 'll get the picture There were predictable jokes galore . I really felt ripped off after seeing this . I was n't expecting much and I was still disappointed . I wish Keenan would just hire some decent writers to write jokes and/or his next script . This was even worse than White Chicks if that is possible . I 've seen high school plays that were better , and cheaper.<br /><br />There was n't anything positive about this movie . I do n't like my entertainment to be dumbed down .
0 Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel . It 's too easy . So I 'm going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of Little Man . First , I 'm impressed with the special effects . It really did look like Marlon Wayans ' head was attached to the body of a little person . I never doubted it for a minute.<br /><br />Secondly , I loved some of the unexpected cameos . David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer , and his renditions of " Havin' My Baby " and " Movin ' On Up " were priceless . John Witherspoon , who , coincidentally , played Grier 's father in 1992 's Boomerang ( if you remember , he " coordinated " the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket ) now plays Vanessa 's father in Little Man . So that was fun.<br /><br />Beyond that , this movie is about as believable as White Chicks . How dumb is it when even the doctor ca n't tell that it 's a 40-year - old man and not a baby ? He 's got a full set of teeth ! ! ! How is it possible that no one seems to notice that it 's not a baby ? Little Man is so bad that there 's a Rob Schneider cameo . And please , if you 're stupid enough to waste $ 8 on this movie , at least do me a favor and DO NOT bring your children . This movie is way too sexual for small children ( lots of jokes and innuendo about sex , going down , eating out , etc . ) , and I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their kids to the screening I was forced to endure . If you insist on seeing an idiotic film , as least spare your children the pain and suffering .
0 I 've now just realised that by watching this film I have lost valuable precious moments of my life I will never get back . Thsi film is n't just poor its dire . It reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made.<br /><br />I regret watching this film.<br /><br />Flixmedia reckons its a race issue , apparently " White " people do n't like it because it does n't have white actors . Mate , I think you 'll find the reason why no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and funnier then this pile of drivel.<br /><br />Please stop making crap films
0 When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies , I thought it was too harsh but little did I know that the low rating was absolutely correct.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers . I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks . Little Man , however , had very few laughs and the jokes were stale.<br /><br />Obviously , the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans , who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison . He and his partner , Tracy Morgan , steal a diamond meant for a gangster . Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington . In order to get the diamond back , the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep . Of course , he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.<br /><br />The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour . All these talents , however , can not help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny.<br /><br />The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was OK . I mean , it was not 100 % believable but it was OK ... nothing great . I just wish that the Wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.<br /><br />Wait for it on cable or television . It really is not worth any amount of money .
0 ... Ever . This is the bottom . I am not joking . The theater should 've had a warning of some kind . ' Abandon all hope ye who enter here ' would 've been fitting.<br /><br />I do n't have the words to describe accurately the hell that this movie is . Its debilitating stupidity even fails to amuse . This movie is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox . The story was blatantly stolen from a 10 minute Bugs Bunny cartoon and then stretched like Mr. Fantastic to 90 excruciatingly painful minutes.<br /><br />I remember when the Wayans 's were funny . I guess the pressures of Hollywood for them to produce produce produce are to blame for the poop that churns out at a consistent rate . I 'm sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick - in - the - balls jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoon.<br /><br />I disliked nearly everything about this movie . I wo n't spoil anything but the baby is actually a midget with Marlon Wayans 's face poorly superimposed over the midget 's body . What I DID like was the ending . Not the movie 's resolution , but the actual end where we all stood up and walked out.<br /><br />I gave this movie one star , but it clearly deserves less . I do n't feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star . This does deserve a Razzie and I pray to God it gets it.<br /><br />When are people going to learn ; if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop pooping it out . Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film . Avoid it at all costs . You have been warned .
0 There was a Bugs Bunny cartoon titled " Baby Buggy Bunny " that was EXACTLY this plot . Baby - faced Finster robbed a bank and the money in the carriage rolled away and fell into Bug 's rabbit hole . He dressed up as a baby to get into Bugg 's hole to retrieve the money . The scene in " Little Man " where he 's looking in the bathroom mirror shaving with a cigar in his mouth is straight from the cartoon . This was a hilarious 5-minute cartoon ; not so much an entire movie . If you are really interested in this , buy the Bugs Bunny DVD . It 's was much more original the first time ( 1954 ) . Plus you 'll get a lot more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons to boot !
0 There are some extremely talented black directors Spike Lee , Carl Franklin , Billy Dukes , Denzel and a host of others who bring well deserved credit to the film industry . Then there are the Wayans Brothers who at one time(15,years ago ) had an extremely funny television show'In Living Colour ' that launched the career of Jim Carrey amongst others . Now we have stupidity substituting for humour and gross out gags(toilet humour ) as the standard operating procedure . People are not as stupid as those portrayed in ' Little Man ' they could n't possibly be . A baby with a full set of teeth and a tattoo is accepted as being only months old ? Baby comes with a five o'clock shadow that he shaves off . It is intimated that the baby has sex with his foster mother behind her husbands , Darryl 's , back .Oh , yea that is just hilarious . As a master criminal ' Little Man ' is the stupidest on planet earth . He stashes a stolen rock that is just huge in a woman 's purse and then has to pursue her . Co - star Chazz Palminteri , why Chazz , offers the best line : " I 'm surrounded by morons . " Based , without credit , on a Chuck Jones cartoon , Baby Buggy Bunny . This is far too stupid to be even remotely funny . A clue as to how bad this film is Damon Wayans appeared on Jay Leno the other night , prior to the BAT awards and he did not , even mention this dreadful movie . When will Hollywood stop green lighting trash from the Wayans Brothers . When they get over their white mans guilt in all likelihood .
0 It 's here . finally a movie comes out that I can honestly say is worse than Larry the cable guy : health inspector . Yet I 'm willing to bet the the wayan 's brothers(hilarious ) will make more money than I ever make in my whole life on what is sure to be one of the top five worst films of all time , outside of my fifth grade outside the class re - enactment of romeo and Juliet . I mean really WHY would anyone ever ever see this movie unless they were paid to . The comedy is weak and all even remotely funny jokes from the flimsy plot were surely revealed in commercials . Final word is this movie was a terrible letdown for me . And the commercials looked so promising ...
0 Like some of the other reviewers have alluded to previously , I 'd like to know what moron actually read the script and went ' , " Yea ! ! ! This is it . This is the next film we are going to green light ! ! " And whoever that person is , should have his or her head examined for actual brain activity . Because whoever is responsible for actually dishing out money to have this made after reading the script , well , I 'd love to give you my email address and maybe you 'd like to just give away some more money . This film is atrocious in every way.<br /><br />The Wayans are funny , at least they can be . They have made some good films and had some incredibly funny performances along the way . But in here , not only does the premise defy all logic , not only is the acting terrible , not only is the entire movie offensive from start to finish , not only is the direction as amateurish as you can find , but they actually want you to pay to see this film . Maybe if it was free ... naaah , it would still be a waste of time.<br /><br />Usually I 'd be inclined to write some long winded , detailed review about why this film is so bad , but just suffice to say that let my brevity do the talking . This is the lowest common denominator film making and it is about as unfunny as a heart attack.<br /><br />0/10 .. makes my top ten list of worst films of all time !
0 This movie is most possibly the worst movie I have ever see in my entire life ! The plot is ridiculous and the whole " Little Man " crap is just so stupid . The entire movie is unrealistic and dumb . Let 's face it , It 's just a " Black Comedy " . This is just a pointless horrible piece that should have never made it to theaters . The jokes are not funny and the acting is horrendous . Please , I beg of to you save your money than see this worthless piece of crap . I had to endure sitting through Little Man for an hour and a half wishing my eyes would bleed . I am disgusted that something like this would even be thought of ! Who writes this crap ? The actors have NO talent what so ever , how do these people get into Hollywood ? They are making money off this junk !
0 This is exactly the reason why many people remain homeless . . . because stupid producers pay their money to make awful films like this instead of donating if they can bother!<br /><br />This film is even worse than white chicks ! Little Man has a lame excuse for posing a character midget as a baby . Story is awful considering it was written by six people . The idea still would n't be too bad though , if it was original and not a rip - off of a cartoon episode . it has funny moments but some of them are way over - done and some are just stupid . The acting was very , very bad . So was the directing . Anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves . it is racist and very offensive to midgets . I mean , instead of showing sympathy to them , the film - makers make fun of them ! It really disgusts me how they do it . They see midgets being just like babies . And for a character who is a midget , pretending to be an abandoned baby just to get a diamond from a certain family . That is its lame excuse for showing something like that . It just was not worth it . Do n't watch this film . It is a huge waste of time and money .
0 " Little Man " , now on DVD , is a Wayans Brothers flop . It 's the tale of a smaller than a midget criminal played by Marlon Wayans , who hides a diamond in a lady 's purse after a heist . He and his partner Tracy Morgan cook up the genius plan to disguise Marlon as a baby and plant him at the lady 's home . He then goes through all sorts of " Home Alone " or " Child 's Play " like mayhem to get the jewel back and be treated like a baby . I was surprised by how low the humor was in this film . The jokes have been done in other places so many times , that they are n't cute or funny . I almost think the movie might have been funnier if they did n't use CGI and used the small actor who Marlon 's face was pasted over . In watching the deleted scenes ( minus CGI ) this actor was funny in a Mini - me like way , but they chose a different route . A few cameos and Tracy Morgan make some funny scenes .. Spend your rental fee $ on Borat if you want some real laughs these days.<br /><br />http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
0 America . A land of freedom , of hope and of dreams . This is the nation that , since its independence , has striven to bring democracy , prosperity , and peace to the entire world , for the good of all mankind . There are times , however , when one can not help but wish that the American 's would just stay on their side of the Atlantic . < br /><br />This ' movie ' ( and I use that word with some reservations ) evokes these feelings with an intense purity . This vision of hell follows the adventures of Calvin , a freakish jewel thief who was created by attaching the severed head of Marlon Wayan onto the body of a two foot - high dwarf . After inadvertently dropping a large diamond into the handbag of Vanessa , a career - woman who is reluctant to have children , Calvin realises that in order to recover the diamond he must ingratiate himself with her . So , as any normal man would , Calvin dresses himself up as a 2 year - old and parks himself upon the poor woman 's doorstep , where he is discovered by Darryl , the broody husband of Vanessa . < br /><br />Darryl incongruously falls for Calvin 's disguise despite the fact that the ' baby ' has a full set of teeth , stubble , a tattoo , a knife - scar , and the sex - drive of a 16-year - old . Even more absurdly , Vanessa does n't see past Calvin 's baby - wear either and actually attempts to breastfeed the diminutive pervert . This wretched assault upon the soul of mankind attempts , and fails , to find humour in rape , scatology , sexual assault , and paedophilia , however , in a dishonest attempt to transform itself into a piece of ' family - entertainment ' the Wayan brothers stir in a sickening amount of sentiment and flawed morality . < br /><br />The brothers dim attempt a Freudian rehabilitation of their thieving rapist by revealing that he " had a bad father " . Repeatedly hitting Darryl in the crotch enables Calvin to develop the loving father - son relationship that both he and Darryl have always wished for . As if this was n't ridiculous enough , Calvin 's attempts to sexually assault Vanessa somehow convince her that it is selfish for a woman to indulge herself with a successful career , and that instead she should spend her life playing the role of the housebound little - woman , who spends her time alternatively squeezing out babies and cooking for her husband . < br /><br />In this movie the Wayan brothers have mixed their crass and twisted form of humour together with the clichéd sentimentality that has infected much of Hollywood 's recent body of work . Additionally , they are endemic of the current generation of black comedians who are responsible for transforming African - American humour into a poor and wretched shadow of itself that over - indulges in fart - jokes and crude sexual gags . By rights these two should be legally barred from picking up anything even remotely resembling a camera ever again . < br /><br />Unfortunately the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of American cinema means that by this time next month they will undoubtedly have filmed two sequels and be making millions of dollars from tacky merchandising deals .
0 What 's the point of reviewing a movie like this ? It 's painfully and embarrassingly bad , not even in a way that allows you to make fun of it.<br /><br />Movies like " Little Man " depress me . They represent film at its most disposable . This movie was made for a bunch of 18 - 24 year old dipsh*t frat boys who the studio was hoping would come out and see it on opening night before word leaked out about how bad it was , so that the film could quickly recoup its investment.<br /><br />A hundred other filmmakers with great ideas probably could n't get their films made because resources were going toward making this puddle of vomit.<br /><br />Grade : F
0 I was not impressed about this film especially for the fact that I went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film which was certificate rated 12A here in the UK . To my dismay , this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes . ( Which is not a problem to me as an adult , but not good for watching with children ) . This film at times was very crude at times with fart jokes , getting hit in the groin etc ... and for the most part of the film not very funny.<br /><br />The premise of the film is that Calvin Sims who is a 2inch midget , gets out of jail and steals a giant sized diamond but is then forced to put it in a womens handbag . So the rest of the movie sees him passing himself off as an abandoned baby , getting into this womens house so he can get this diamond back.<br /><br />Up until now , I have enjoyed most of the output from the Wayans Brothers - but this film is certainly taking the biscuit.<br /><br />A Bit of good advice - wait till it comes on TV or Cable
0 I can catogoricaly and unequivocally say that in all my 51 years on this planet that is the worse ( supposibly children 's ) film i have ever seen in my life.<br /><br />I took my three grand children to see it and even they were struggling to raise a smile during the all tortuous 90 mins . The sexual indendoes i will leave for another day but they were as tasteless as the film . They should pay YOU to watch it not you pay them . It 's truly truly awful , there is no other way to describe it . The people that made this film should be brought to task for taking money under false pretences.<br /><br />Aplogise for my spelling mistakes but i am so upset that it spoilt the time i had with my grandchildren Regards , Stephen
0 I think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made , When I saw the trailer on TV i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of * * * * and it would be best to avoid it , but I somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends , I walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film . The so - called " jokes " in this film bring a cringe to the face , they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls , the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies . The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull . The characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped . I never want to have to see this * * * * film again , I 'd rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again . If anyone I see says they liked it i will physically punch them in the face
0 So , has it really come to this ? Are we , as consenting adults , to blame for the next generation of cinema - goers lack of cinematic understanding and celluloid capability ? Concerning the Wayans and Co. latest addition to the moving pictures scenario ; Little Man . This United Kingdom P.G. ( Parental Guidance ) , anyone under the age of twelve must be accompanied by a responsible adult , certificated movie , is the epitome of what has now developed into the worse case of dumbing down since cigarettes were " wiped out " from pictures of movie icons of the 1950's.<br /><br />The predominantly under twelve 's audience here who , some without grown up supervision too , sat there , obediently , taking it all in , oblivious to their subject and the partly grown up features that Little Man portrays , in part at least too . Movies , in general , can do better than this poor attempt , while this nonsense is getting them in while they are still young and fresh , the biggest fear for the future of Cinema is that a child 's ignorance just might carry on through to a grown up bliss . Cinema deserves more than this , and so do its ever growing , and in the literal sense too , audiences , this blatant cash cow feeds on the ever - impressionable minds of the young.<br /><br />There is no Cinema experience here , no open eyed wonder , no awe - inspiring respect to the magic of movies ' . There is nothing but bewilderment and contempt , for the lack of substance , originality and its delivery of mind less tedium and parody of everything that is so now ultimately wrong with the Hollywood machine , for the sake of a quick buck , we must endure our future cinema audiences to the likes of this archetypal disaster movie.<br /><br />Will this have the likes of Hitchcock , Fassbinder , Leone , Kubrick and Schaffner reeling in their graves ? Money they all liked , no doubt , but talent and exuberance for perfection and quality , and to a vast degree , respect for their profession and audience , they were never short off . We are seeing , once again , with the works of the Wayans clan another cliché of bad taste , while the likes of White Chicks ( 2004 ) were in no doubt a stab at the bourgeoisie of American society . The irony here is that the two leading protagonists , played yet again , by the Wayans brothers , are so much undercover , that all recognition is non - existent , this makes for a better movie too , and it is the actor Terry Crews that gives White Chicks its substance and personality , not the Wayans.<br /><br />Yet again , with their pastiche of 1970 's Blaxploitation movies , as with the 1988 movie I 'm Gon na Git You Sucka , this to can be seen as a comical and amusing movie , with heavy weights as Isaac Hayes , Jim Brown , Bernie Casey and the gorgeous actress Ja'net Du Bois . The point being , that Little Man has absolutely no persona of any kind what so ever , he is shallow and narcissistic , with no appreciation or value toward his followers , he quickly dives in takes your money and before we know it , has hidden himself within the cogs of commercialism . There is no recognisable effort as to where our money has been spent , after Scary Movie ( 2000 ) , things could only have gone up , but alas they did not , no great pondering of artistic value and no doubt that the instalment from these intrepid movie moguls ' next movies shall be straight to video , one can only hope.<br /><br />The Wayans seem to have created a movie genre all by themselves , to a certain extent ; they have bludgeoned to death the movie parody , they have watered down each and every avenue and with their inevitable style . They have slowly destroyed the reputation of the last one hundred years that Cinema have given us , may the ghosts of movies past be ever so humble in their judgement , as their growing audiences , so far , seem to be , for when the bubble bursts , may they be as understanding too .
0 Since this picture is classified a " pure entertainment " work and since there are already many comments on it , I 'd like hereby to address something relevant to the abuse of humour . We can see that Marlon Wayans is playing the joker role in this film . Certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job , he has always been acting as a little man - an actor can change his customary dress but can hardly change his physical appearance - and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary . However far away from what I expected , I saw an image very disguising , pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty - year- old criminal . And with a ridiculous happy ending . So what is the point ? Many elements are mixed up , some principal ones are violence , sex and criminal activities , amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent , lack common sense : where is Vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and her husband 's life being pursued ? In addition the diamond is even bigger than the world 's No.1 Cullinan ! But the most sickening facet is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points . And they call it humour . A diamond is precious , hard and fragile ; it can not be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat . Hence it 's no more a diamond but pieces of debris .
0 When watching little man , you 'll spend its running time trying to figure out its many plot holes . And that s not a good sign because this film is supposed to be a comedy ! Your supposed to be laughing at it ! ! But will you ? Probably not . < br /><br />The main problem with little man is its concept- its far too ridiculous to accept ( even as a cartoonish comedy ) , so when the loud , laboured and over the top jokes kick in , they make the whole thing seem ten times stupider than it already is.<br /><br />"But its a comedy " some of you might be screaming . That s true but that s no excuse for such a dumb plot . I mean come on , think about it if you saw a baby with A GROWN MANS FACE , would n't you be the least bit suspicious ? And if calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly , why did n't he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random womans hand bag ? And how can a qualified doctor NOT recognise that calvin is a grown man ? i mean seriously ... what ? < br /><br />"Its not about the plot , its about the laughs " you might be screaming . Well heres the thing see , there are hardly any laughs in little man and that just make the dumb ass plot stand out all the more . < br /><br />If you really want to watch a wayans brothers comedy with a belief suspending plot , stick to white chicks because at least that had a few decent laughs . What ever you do steer clear of little man .
0 This piece of crap , since I ca n't call it a movie , can be summed up by the following.<br /><br />-Stereotypical black criminal with black midget partner get in trouble -Black Midget pretends to be a baby with a fully developed adult face , body hair and genitalia -Black midget is mistaken(somehow ) by man and woman who happen to want a baby -Black midget than goes on to commit acts of physical and sexual violence , demean white people wherever he sees them , and commit more crimes -Happy Ending < br /><br />Honestly , it could have been a good satire if it had n't been directed so shallowly and had such talentless bastards star in it .
0 ' SherryBaby ' is quite a painful and sordid melodrama set in Jersey , the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probe after a drugs - related conviction and fights to stay clean , to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother 's family . The only reason the film is to be watched is Maggie Gyllenhaal , an actress at the top of her career , who fits very well in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders . This is not enough however , as the story line is too simplistic and expected , and the emotional emphasis is put on the wrong place - I kept asking myself all over the picture whether I am supposed to be sorry about the ex and maybe future drug addicted mother as the director and script - writer wanted , or about the innocent kid who is in the middle . Even Maggie Gyllenhaal 's acting could not convince me that I should not care more about the kid .
0 This is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative . It lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection.<br /><br />The animation is well done but I feel like it is too presentational . I would have preferred more images from behind , more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to me.<br /><br />But for a Hollywood style film it works OK but it is very derivative of Aardman films and this is bothering to me . Perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice - over.<br /><br />I think the voice over is too glib .
0 I can see the guys doing the budget preparation for this flick . " Well lets see now , we spend 50 % getting Dirk Benidict , cause Battle Star Galactic and the A - Team were cool . The we spend 40 % making a Demon Costume , never mind that the Demon is supposed to be incorporeal in the script . And we spend the rest making the movie . " This was pretty bad and VERY cliche .... Have a loved one present when watching ( or bring a good book )
0 I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think " The Wild Women of Wongo " is worse . This is an exercise in patience . It 's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist . There 's no plot . There 's no logic . There is certainly no acting ( although the shark has some quality dialogue ) . We do n't wonder about anything . We do n't know how people got where they got . It 's always amazing to me how things like this even get released . I agree with the previous writer that it is n't even funny bad . I know . It 's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a DVD collection . It 's like a paperweight . Or a bad painting you bought at a starving artists ' sale . It covers the crack in the wall .
0 This is one really bad movie . I 've racked my brain and I can not come up with one positive comment to make . The acting is atrocious . I 've seen more believable performances on cable access . The plot is ridiculous . Stolen diamonds , secret recordings of the President , and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst . Night of the Sharks is n't even so bad it 's good . The dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before it 's filmed . And to top it off , Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I 've ever heard . I 'm surprised my ears did n't start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to record.<br /><br />From everything I 've read , the Italian film industry was dead by 1987 . Night of the Sharks is like a final nail in the coffin .
0 -SPOILES- Lame south of the border adventure movie that has something to do with the blackmail of a big cooperate executive Rosenlski the president of Unasco Inc. by on the lamb beachcomber David Ziegler who 's living the life of Reilly , or Ziegler , in his beach house in Cancun Mexico . Having this CD , that he gave to his brother James , that has three years of phone conversations between Rosenlski and the President of the United States involved in criminal deals . This CD has given David an edge over the international mobsters who are after him . < br /><br />The fact that James get 's a little greedy by trying to shake down Rosenlski for 2 million in diamonds not only cost him his life but put David in danger of losing his as well . Ropsenlski want 's to negotiate with David for the CD by getting his ex - wife Liz to talk to him about giving it up , Rosnelski made a deal to pay off her debts if she comes through . David is later killed by Rosenliski 's Mexican hit - man Tony , with the help of a great white shark , who just does n't go for all this peaceful dealings on his boss ' part . < br /><br />Tony had taken the CD that Liz left for his boss at a local hotel safe and now want 's to murder James , like he did David , and at the same time keep the CD to have something over Rosenlski.<br /><br />David who had secretly hidden the diamonds that James had on him at the time of his murder is now the target of Tony and his men to shut him up for good . David also wants to take the diamonds and at the same time give his boss Rosenlski the impression that the CD that David had is lost but use it later , without Rosenlski knowing who 's behind it , to blackmail him . < br /><br />The movie " Night of the Sharks " has a number of shark attacks in it with this huge one - eyed white shark who ends up taking out about a half dozen of the cast members including Tony . David who 's a firm believer in gun - control uses knives high explosives and Molotov cocktails , as well as his fists , to take out the entire Tony crew . Even the killer shark is finished off by Tony but with a hunting knife , not a gun . When it came to using firearms to save his friend and sidekick Paco a girlfriend Juanita and his priest Father Mattia lives from Tony and his gang guns were a no - no with David ; he was more of a knife and spear man then anything else . < br /><br />The ending of the movie was about as predictable as you can make it with David thought to be killed by the one - eyed shark later pops up out of the crowd , after Rosenlski was convinced that he 's dead and leaves the village . David continues his life as a free living and loving beachcomber with no one looking to kill him and about two million dollars richer . to David 's credit he had his friend Paco give Rosenski back his CD but under the conditions that if anything happened to him his cousin , who Rosenlski does n't know who and where he is , will shoot his big mouth off and let the whole world know about his dirty and criminal dealings .
0 What 's to like about this movie???<br /><br />It is in colour ! < br /><br />It has some impressive underwater photography ! < br /><br />It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times ! < br /><br />So 3 out of 10 ! < br /><br />Sometimes the music is speeded up ! Especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in ! < br /><br />Sometimes it is slowed ! As if to convey to the audience it 's about to be time for sympathy ! < br /><br />As another one bites the dust ! As if in a " spagetti Western " this has much similarity to ! < br /><br />It 's not that the Italians ca n't produce quality productions ! There was a series of TV movies with a heading like " Octopus " numbered about 1 to 7 , screened on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s about mafia - type conflicts ! And they were excellent ! But alas , you wo n't find it here!!!<br /><br />I assumed it was made about 1960s ! Sadly it was 20 years out of date , as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end ! < br /><br />Then there was the razor - sharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters ! < br /><br />Amidst it all , either in bar - room brawl or in observing the latest sea - side bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark , the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern , as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone 's character development ! < br /><br />At least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly , for his ex - wife ! < br /><br />But of course , even if the music fails to awaken our realisation , we have the sinister sound in the baddies ' voices , as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge ! < br /><br />And near the end , someone thought of a twist ! Just when we thought it was all totally predictable ! But stay tuned , folks , for you may find another twist ! If you are watching closely ! To , more or less , warm your heart ! < br /><br />Follow the advice of the hero , and have a few beers along the way ! It 'll make your viewing of " Night of the Sharks " more enjoyable ! < br /><br />Then you 'll be ready for something like a " 007 " movie to ease your way back into reality when this is over ! ! !
0 Despite some moments in heavy rain , an encounter with a drunk as well as an organ grinder with a gypsy and a monkey , and a stay in a sanitarium , this Roscoe " Fatty " Arbuckle silent comedy short with support from Buster Keaton and Al St. John is only fitfully amusing though there is a quite funny sequence of Arbuckle in drag flirting with Buster that 's the ultimate in " meet cute " scenes especially since it 's one of the few times we see The Great Stone Face smile and laugh in the movies ! Also , many scenes seem to have been jump cut edited possibly because of overuse of the film stock . Still , if you 're an Arbuckle or Keaton completist , Good Night , Nurse ! is certainly worth a look .
0 This is n't one of Arbuckle 's or Keaton 's better films , that 's for sure . Fatty 's wife is tired of all his heavy drinking , so she takes him to a sanitarium where a psychiatrist ( Keaton ) claims to have a guaranteed cure ! Well , once there , Arbuckle accidentally eats a thermometer and is taken to surgery . Then , he escapes and is chased about the place where he meets a cute girl who also wants to escape . Finally , despite staff chasing them about , they escape at which point it becomes apparent that the girl is crazy and Arbuckle is soon recaptured . However , he awakens and everything AFTER the surgery has all been a dream -- there was no sexy crazy girl and Dr. Keaton is n't as big an incompetent as he seemed in the dream.<br /><br />A lack of humor is the biggest problem with the film . Sure , making fun of mentally ill people is pretty low , but in its day it was guaranteed laughs . I 'd laugh , too , if there was just something funny to respond to ! A lot of energy and that 's all.<br /><br />FYI -- during one of the chase sequences , Fatty wonders into a race for men over 200 pounds ( wow , what are the odds of that ? ) . And , shortly after this , he backs into a post on which the number 5 was just freshly painted . As a result , the five is now on the back of Fatty 's shirt and he looks like a regular participant . HOWEVER , the number SHOULD have appeared backwards on Fatty 's shirt but came out front - ways -- a mistake , as they should have realized the mirror image would have been a backwards 5 .
0 Man oh man ! What a piece of crummy film - making ! But this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though I hate to admit it . They showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time . Where I grew up in San Jose , California ( right on the border of Cupertino ) we had this thing called The G Channel on our cable system . And they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again . Wanda Nevada was one of those movies . I fell in lust and love with the young Brooke Shields and loved her dopey adventures in the Grand Canyon in the 1940s . The script makes almost no sense , the direction is poor , the few highlights are that Henry Fonda makes an appearance , a lot of dialog that 's so bad it 's good and a nice Carole King song played over the end credits . Maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick . And hey , everybody knows there ai n't no gold in the Grand Canyon !
0 Peter Fonda is so intentionally enervated as an actor that his lachrymose line - readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue . He trades sassy barbs and non - witty repartee with Brooke Shields as if he were a wooden block with receding hair ; even his smaller touches ( like fingering a non - existent mustache on his grizzled face ) do n't reveal a character so much as an unsure actor being directed by himself , an unsure filmmaker . In the Southwest circa 1950 , a poor gambler ( not above a little cheating ) wins an orphaned , would - be teen Lolita in a botched poker game ; after getting hold of a treasure map promising gold in the Grand Canyon , the bickering twosome become prospectors . Some lovely vistas , and an odd but interesting cameo by Henry Fonda as a grizzled canyon man , are the sole compensations in fatigued comedy - drama , with the two leads being trailed by cartoonish killers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map . Shields is very pretty , but -- although the camera loves her pouty , glossy beauty -- she has no screen presence ( and her tinny voice has no range whatsoever ) ; every time she opens her mouth , one is inclined to either cringe or duck . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 Wanda Nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie using circa 1979 ideas of what constitutes illicit romance for 13 year old girls . Script , pacing , and direction are uniformly awful . Action sequences defy belief . Characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set , but also includes multiple sexual references involving Shields ' character as well as graphic deaths . < br /><br />The movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny , an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid , and a children 's movie but introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities . It also wants to be a buddy picture , a coming of age picture , a ghost movie , an Indian spiritual movie , a travelogue , and a western . The overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist . Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the Grand Canyon . That it manages to do just fine .
0 Any movie in which Brooke Shields out - acts a Fonda is going to be both an anomaly and a horror . Shields actually is only bad because she 's youthful , inexperienced , and clearly not well directed by her co - star . Peter Fonda is bad because , well , because he 's bad . I liked him in Ulee 's Gold , years later , but Lord above , he 's awful here . Not that anyone else is good . There 's not a single performance ( outside Henry Fonda 's delightful cameo ) that is even passable . I 've never seen a movie with this many bad performances . In the case of Luke Askew , the chief villain , it 's clear this is because of poor dialogue and direction , as he 's done good work in the past . But his partner , played by Ted Markland , is an embarrassing ham . The writing is just bloody awful , and the actors can not be faulted for the terrible things they have to say . But they say them so badly ! The editing and direction are worse than pedestrian . Shots are held way too long for no dramatic reason , or cut off before the impact of the scene can be realized . This picture was far worse than I 'd imagined and would have been utterly forgotten ( and probably never even made ) without the participation of a couple of famous names . One bright spot : the cinematography in the Grand Canyon is exquisite , capturing the beauty of that area in a way even big - screen Imax productions have not quite done so well . And finally : either this is a bad version of Paper Moon , with a lovable pair of father - daughter types , or it 's a bad version of Pretty Baby , with a considerably more icky romantic relationship between a forty - something and a 13-year - old . It suggests more of the latter than the former , and thus is pretty disturbing .
0 Beaudray Demerille(a weak Peter Fonda , who also directed ) , an aging gambler , wins young teen Wanda " Nevada"(pretty , but not talented Brooke Shields ) in a poker game . Together the unlikely pair(of course)embark on a search for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon.<br /><br />That 's the story and there really is no need to search for a deeper meaning in it . It just is n't there . The acting is very weak too , which was quite a surprise given the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead.<br /><br />If you 're looking for something interesting in this film , take a look at the nice scenery and some good looks of a young Brooke Shields . Her character however is so irritating(especially at the beginning)and dumb , that she never quite comes off as sexy or appealing . Too bad , but , given the story , I doubt anything more could be made of this . I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and starred in this film . He must have even talked his father(Henry Fonda)into a ( useless ) cameo in this ridiculous mess . Unfortunately , this was their only film together . Could n't Henry be in EASY RIDER for example ? 3/10
0 I rented this movie because it falls under the genres of " romance " and " western " with some Grand Canyon scenery thrown in . But if you 're expecting a typical wholesome romantic western , forget it . This movie is pure trash ! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE - AGED MAN ! The child is also lusted after by other leering men . It 's sickening.<br /><br />Peter Fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields , and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship . He tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy , loving couple . It 's revolting.<br /><br />I do n't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles .
0 Quite average even by Monogram standards , this mystery ( a remake of The Sphinx ) has an oddball plot which is not unraveled to much effect -- you 'll see through it after about ten minutes . The two leads have some nice breezy dialog at the outset , but John Hamilton is hopelessly dull as the villain ( perfectly cast Lionel Atwill originated the role ) and Warren Hymer 's nitwit shtick is pretty annoying . However , it 's worth sitting through for a five - minute appearance by the incomparable Mantan Moreland as Nicodemus the janitor , who gets the better of the defense attorney during a hilarious courtroom appearance . You 've got to hand it to Bill " One - Take " Beaudine ; he was n't much of a director , but he would always punch up a routine programmer with some goofy vaudeville .
0 I just came back from " El Otro " playing here in Buenos Aires and I have to say I was very disappointed . The film is very slow moving ( do n't get me wrong , I enjoy slow moving films ! ) , slow to the point of driving you crazy . All you hear is Julio Chavez breathing heavily throughout the whole film . This is a poorly made film , but more importantly , it is a film without a lick of inspiration , I felt nothing for the story or its characters.<br /><br />"El Otro " was made only for the sake of making a film ... making it forgetful . I would advise you to pass on this one , if you want to see good Argentinian films , look for films by Sorin .
0 Guy walking around without motive ... I will never get those two hours of my life back . The guy kept on assuming identities and cheating on his pregnant wife . What was I thinking ? How did this win a price anywhere ? I understood he loved his father but other than that the movie was completely senseless to me . What was the purpose of walking so much and going to the funeral of a stranger for no apparent reason . How did this enrich his life ? ? ? Why did we have to see the dying old lady on her underwear ? ? ? ? ! ! ! Why???!!!!<br /><br />I though it would be deep or about something more interesting . I do not recommend the movie even to leave on while sleeping ...
0 I just finished watching " El Otro " . I have always taken my hat off to Julio Chavez 's performances , as he is a great actor , but this movie is really depressing and slow . I guess that it would have been even worse if it was n't for Julio . Anyways , this is definitely a film that you will never understand if you are not from Argentina , and even if you are , I would advise you not to rent this movie in order to have a nice time with your girlfriend , boyfriend , family or friends ... it is really depressing and incredibly slow , and the plot does not make a lot of sense neither . Probably the director wanted to show the fragility of the human life , but what he does is bore and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little bit . It gives you something to think about , but not in a good way . Overall , I definitely did n't like this movie .
0 The title should have been " The walker " . That was only he did walk.<br /><br />There was nothing on the movie that was good . The description of the movie does n't really comply with the plot.<br /><br />The only thing that I can get from the movie is that he was a good son , but a low life terrible person.<br /><br />I'm sorry that I expend my money and time , on this movie . I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie . I stayed hoping that it will better .... what a mistake . I got worse.<br /><br />If there is a suggestion that I can make to he producer is to re - direct his life to another field , because making movies is definitely no his cup of tea
0 The title should have been the walker . The guy expend 90 % of the movie walking . He does n't know what he wants , or what he is . Go through life stealing peoples identity for nothing . He gets no benefit , no money , nothing pretending to be another person.<br /><br />No body was able to understand why he was pretending to be somebody else.<br /><br />The only thing that was clear in this movie is that he love his father and was a good son . But the rest was crap.<br /><br />May be director is a looser that would like to be somebody else . But what he really should do is to get a real job , because after his movie , I do n't think he has a chance to make as a movie producer .
0 This movie could have been so much better , especially considering the talent . Larenz Tate 's portrayal of Frankie Lymon was not good , especially in musical performances . He does n't lip sync well and his stage mannerisms are Larenz Tate , when he should have been Frankie Lymon . The portrayal of the women as a bunch of gold diggers has Hollywood written all over it . The powers that be obviously pushed it , but it only made the characters more unrealistic . The positives of the movie were Miguel Nunez 's portrayal of Little Richard , and the cameo of Little Richard himself . Lela Rochon is eye candy , as usual , even in a conservative role . It 's too bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox were wasted . The whole Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life . Too bad this film was a wasted opportunity .
0 After reading all of the rave reviews about this film and a few that give it a so - so . I finally decided to throw in my no cents worth . I agree with most on the point that if it had n't been for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry it would have been a disaster . Filmed in Mariette OH . just north of Dogpatch where all the real talent fled south down I-77 years ago , at least as far as a tank of gas would allow . I did get a chuckle from reviewers who subtly claim that they cerebrate a little better than most by claiming they followed the plot without an inkling of confusion . This wee tale by the Brothers Crook is like an old record with a skip in it . As an American I understand the difficulties Ind film artists have to face . A trip to Romania would have wiped out the budget for sure . Lets face it this whole film was a loop de loop of Claire in the gas station , Claire on the side of the road , Claire under the bleachers , Claire in the house , Claire in the cornfield , Claire at school . Claire here and Claire there . It almost became monotonous and would have if she had not been the best actor in the cast . Josh and Jeff have to make a living but do n't write a two page script and turn it into an hour , twenty flick . Before writing another screenplay about dreaming ghosts watch an episode or two of Ghost Whisperer or something and get a little background . All of the cast except the above mentioned and a couple of others were engaged in their first and last film . Also , there is an appearance by co - director Jeff as he is in all his films . Just like Alfred Hitchcock , eh ? One thing the film had going for it is that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation on Lauren Lewis ' derrière . Well , with all sarcasm now satisfied I still recommend the film for the horror buff just to see this young actress in the formative time of her career ( I hope)and that Chris Ferry has established himself as a villain worth watching .
0 Salvage is the worst so called horror film I 've ever seen . There is nothing remotely horrific about it . It does n't deserve to be in a genre so fine . First of all i do n't see how so many people can think this piece of crap such a great movie . If I wrote something as boring and utterly ridiculous as this i would be laughed at and too embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it . Second : the acting is terrible and the lead actress is excruciatingly ugly . Third : the story sucks , its been used before , and the excuse that its a cheap movie is no excuse . Read the summery on the back of the case , it reveals the whole story . I do not recommend that you watch this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste on something that will leave you regretting that you watched it . I feel really bad for those Crooks and the irony of their name . All hail Anthony Perkins ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0 Salvage : 4 out of 10 . Groundhog Day meets a Christian Coalition horror film . Okay maybe it 's not that bad . But it is close.<br /><br />Claire ( played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis ) is stalked and possibly killed by a serial killer ( Chris Ferry who is quite menacing and brutal ) . I say possibly because she wakes up and it was all a dream  .. Or was it ? ( Cue music)<br /><br />The basic problem with the film is that these fifteen minutes of plot ( Done quite well the first time ) is repeated over and over again . And since Claire wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or alternate reality I just stopped caring what happened to Claire and started wondering what lame twist at the end was going to pull this together.<br /><br />I was rooting for a séance ( which honestly would have made more sense ) but instead got one of those too obvious by half surprise endings ( Think the Village or Below ) Yup the film collapses faster than Donnie Darko 's directors cut . All the great twist endings in horror movies The Sixth Sense , the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers , Happy Birthday to Me worked because the audience was n't expecting a left field explanation . ( Heck even the canoe ending in the original Friday the 13th was worth a jolt)<br /><br />Salvage on the other hand screams twist ending with every scene change . Other nagging faults is the one note piano soundtrack ( Though the featured songs were decent ) the obvious time padding ( Claire doing the dishes , Claire 's mother 's subplots ) , the way Claire says " hello is anyone there " every time she thinks there is a serial killer around.<br /><br />Also some of the secondary acting roles ( In particular Claire 's mother played by Maureen Olander who resembles a Mary Kay zombie ) shows the first time actor low budget roots.<br /><br />Both too clever by half and not nearly clever enough Salvage keeps your interest if only to see how they are going to fix this mess . Problem is they really do n't .
0 I love horror movies . I can even appreciate most cheese ( face it , 9 out of 10 horror films these days ARE cheese ) , but this was just ridiculous . Terrible acting , terrible writing , completely hollow and unbelievable characters ( no Meisner actors here ! ) and a total lack of sufficient body count . I wish I could SALVAGE the 79 minutes of my life I just wasted . At least the Crook brothers are aptly named . The only good thing about the whole film was watching the Alicia Silverstone wanna - be get punched in the face . How this EVER made it to Sundance is completely baffling to me . Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic , even by slasher film standards . I mean , COME ON ! Who would rush out to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after a creepy stalker guy just left their doorstep ? Lame .
0 One of the worst films I have ever seen . Got so bored that I switched it off midway through to watch the news . When I switched it back on , I fell asleep . The film starts with a dream , continues with a dream , and ends with a dream . Then there are a few more dreams in between . Come on , what is supposed to keep me interested in that ? A film needs to have a reason to be interesting . The minute you felt the film was only a dream is when any sensible film - goer switches off . Ever had someone insist on telling you their dreams and what it means to them ? This is it!!!<br /><br />Absolutely awful .
0 This film just goes around in circles , and the viewer does not know where they are . At first I thought .. mmmmm , could be kinda cool movie this , but it just drags on and on , and eventually you do n't know what 's going on . The lead female is a good actress and played her role well , and the psycho fella , is creepy , but after a bit you do n't really care what happens , because this film just drags on . Shame really , this could have turned out a lot better.<br /><br />Would say though that the lead female and psycho fella , will have a good career ahead of them , but will they remember this film , for making them known , or for being the film they regret they ever made .
0 This movie is very important because suggested me this consideration : sometimes you can wish to be sick ... sometimes you can wish to have a syndrome ... sometimes , for example , you can wish have Goldfield Syndrome ... that way you 'd not remember this boring movie ... and above all you 'd not remember Adam " superfluos " Sandler ... sometimes , simply , you can wish ... have rented another movie ... <br /><br />My vote ? 3 out of 10 . My suggestion ? If you are neither a fan of boring romantic comedies or Adam Sandler ( ... it 's a joke do n't exist Adam Sandler 's fan ... I want to hope it ) , save yourself ... Someone to save ? Drew Barrymore . ... perhaps .
0 Millie is a sap . She marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a child . She then catches him cheating on her and divorces him ... but lets him keep the kid she claims to love . Back then in the early 1930s , she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easy ... with no support ... what a sap ! Later , when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good , he turns out to ALSO be a cheat ! Wow , does she have a hard time picking men.<br /><br />As a result of these bad relationships , Millie changes . Now she 's a wild party girl -- doing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck . Suddenly , many years pass . Millie 's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and oddly fashions have n't changed one bit . An old friend of Millie 's ( yes , it 's another evil man ! ) is now pretending to be the daughter 's friend , but he has lecherous designs on her . Millie promises him that if he touches the girl , she 'll kill him . Take a wild guess what happens next ! < br /><br />Overall , the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess -- a bit like " Madam X " but much , much less focused . So often Millie 's motivations and actions seem to make little sense . And , the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it -- so long as it substantiates the notion that all men are pigs . Unusual but not particularly good .
0 How the hell did they get this made ? ! Presenting itself as a caper comedy , the misbegotten " $ " is essentially two hours of people mumbling sentence fragments . The usually dependable Warren Beatty looks drunk , and the usually hilarious Goldie Hawn acts like she 's on depressants . As for Gert Frobe , his most famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here . Not even the guy with the champagne bottle of LSD can save this litany of worthlessness.<br /><br />Am I comparing this movie to " Plan 9 from Outer Space " ? I would n't do such a thing even if someone paid me . " P9FOS " was idiotically made but ended up hilarious ; this was idiotically made and causes you to feel like your brain just melted out of your ears . Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn made up for this when they co - starred in " Shampoo " , but then they co - starred in the dreadful " Town & Country " . Maybe they just should n't co - star in movies . All in all , I would rather have my skin torn off than have to watch this again . Awful.<br /><br />Maybe they should remake it with Jackie Chan . Then I would pay to see it .
0 The pakage implies that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn are pulling off a huge bank robbery , but that 's not what I got out of it ! I did n't get anything ! In the first half there 's a new character ( without introduction ) in every other scene . The first half - hour is completely incomprehensible , the rest is just one long , annoying , underlit chase scene . There 's always an irritating sound in the background whether it 's a loud watch ticking , a blaring siren , a train whistling , or even the horrible score by Quincy Jones . There are a lot of parts that are laughably bad , too . Like , the bad guys chasing Beatty on thin ice with a CAR ! Or , the police arriving at the scene roughly fifteen times . I really hated this movie !
0 This has the absolute worst performance from Robert Duval who sounds just like William Buckley throughout the entire film . His hammy melodramatic acting takes away from any dramatic interest . I 'm not sure if this was deliberate scene stealing or inadvertent but it 's the only thing I can recall from a truly forgettable film . This picture should be shown in every amateur acting class of an example of what not to do . Thank God , Duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to effect a cultured accent . He is a good character actor but that 's about it . Klaus is so much better . His performance is muted and noteworthy .
0 This is by far the worst film I have seen in my entire life . The acting is poor and the storyline is almost incomprehensible . Whether or not you like lightships or any ships for that matter is irrelevant . As for special effects the film has none . The whole film crew were probably on the boat out in rough seas rather than in a studio and when some of the men are " stabbed " ( if you can even call it that ) their reactions are totally unreal . The guns are more quiet than a mute . How this film could have one two awards puts serious questions to the state of the human mind . Well that s about it . This review is probably more fun to read than the film is to watch . If anyone is considering watching it or buying it I would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons . I have said that it includes a spoiler . If the fact that some people get stabbed and a gun gets fired is a plot giveaway . I suppose it is because they are the only good parts of the film .
0 Shiner , directed by Christian Calson , centers around three " couples " and their relationships with obsession and violence . Pretty good start as far as I 'm concerned . Interesting . The couples break down into a heterosexual couple , two heterosexual male friends and a straight guy being " harmlessly " stalked by a gay man.<br /><br />The " het " couple really do n't have much of a role in the film . There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex or playing around with each other , but seem to have no real purpose since the are so marginalized . My assumption is that they represent a more day to day illustration of how sex / violence are integrated in a couples life . The couple are n't very aggressive and it 's not even shot in any kind of erotic way . As characters , they do n't add much to the theme or plot.<br /><br />The two male friends make up the bulk of the plot . They engage in some gay bashing of sorts by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an alley . This escalates into violence . And the violence changes them . It becomes a means of sexual gratification . And their need for violence t release grows as the film progresses . The main problem I had is the violence is not convincing . Never once does it seem that any of the characters is in any real danger . It just does n't work . Given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters ' relationships with violence , this is a major problem . Unfortunately , the make - up does n't help either . Sometimes , it 's okay , other times it is very bad . In one scene , I really wondered why one of the characters had rouge smeared on his face . Confusing.<br /><br />The more interesting pair of the characters is the " stalker couple . " Here Calson seemed to have more to say and was able to develop a more coherent storyline . Perhaps it is because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the end . Shiner may well have been much better if it had stuck with these two.<br /><br />I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film . It is admirable . Most low budget flicks do n't aspire to much . I do n't think Calson achieved want he was aiming for . Myself , I found nothing particularly controversial or unsettling . Shiner was unconvincing . This does n't mean , however , that the director ca n't achieve something with his next film.<br /><br />He seems to have something to say .
0 What an unfortunate mess is " Shiner . " I wanted to like this over - the - top , anti - film aspirant , and in fact found a number of moments with powerful resonance . Sadly , those moments are few and far between . While I appreciate some of what Calson was attempting , any advantage aspired to by bare bones , no budget cinematography was destroyed with some truly atrocious editing that benefited the movie not at all.<br /><br />While bad acting abounds in low budget ( and big budget ) cinema , Shiner has some remarkably bad performances that are nearly painful to watch . In particular the " straight " couple Linda and Young Guy . These are the two most poorly written characters offering almost nothing to the story . The acting is so abysmal and neither actor seems capable of resisting smirking or cracking up as they drearily drop their lines with an appalling lack of skill . The choppy editing almost lends the feeling that these roles were entirely gratuitous and dropped in to avoid the films being stereotypically cast as an oddball gay film . It would have been better off as such.<br /><br />With all that is going wrong for it , there are several performances that seem to capture what Calson was hoping to get . In particular the story centering on Bob and Tim . These are the two most richly drawn characters and offer the most rewards with genuinely captivating performances by Nicholas T. King ( Bob ) and David Zelinas ( Tim ) . Tim is a boxer with some serious issues . Remarkably low self esteem is disguised by an almost cartoon like arrogance that he wears like armour plating . Obsessed with Tim , the seemingly harmless yet ultimately creepy Bob , stalks the boxer in classic cat - and - mouse fashion . When the tables are turned and hunter becomes the hunted , the resulting in the film 's only genuine emotional catharsis . In a film so artificially hard - edged ( that 's a compliment ) one character MUST have that revelatory break through ( or breakdown , as the case proves here ) and the final confrontation between Bob and Tim provide Zelinas and King opportunity to display some real acting chops.<br /><br />As played by Scott Stepp and Derris Nile , Tony and Danny seem to be the focus of the movie , and despite some bravado moments of their own ( including one truly disturbing scene revealing the sex / violence obsession ) , but they ca n't seem to escape a cartoon - like artifice and it 's difficult to look at - or beyond their seeming one note symphony and find anything other than the obvious.<br /><br />Ultimately this same raw material could ( and should ) be used to tell this story in better fashion . Alas , there really is n't much to recommend this yet , the performances by Messrs. King and Zelinas , really do offer something special and a glimpse of what might have been and are ultimately worth seeing .
0 I saw " Shiner " on DVD . While I was watching it , I thought , " This is a really bad porn flick without the porn . " I also thought , " Whoever wrote this has some real issues . " Then I watched the director / writer Carlson explain his process as a special feature . Yeah , it was real special.<br /><br />The emphasis of the film is placed on two alcoholic losers who hit each other to get off . They are marginally attractive . There is frontal and full nudity . These factors probably account for the film being seen at all.<br /><br />The most upsetting element of the film is the gay bashing and the subsequent further gay bashing of the same victim who tries ineptly to exact revenge from his assailants , the two drunken losers . Not only is the subject handled absurdly and badly from a technical point of view , but the acting is horrendously bad.<br /><br />Then there 's the boxer - stalker theme . This is really insane , not just absurd . This hunky boxer is somehow traumatized by the persistent attentions of a fleshy momma 's boy who works at his gym 's parking lot . This is in LA , mind you . The boxer is so traumatized that he turns up at the stalker 's house , strips in front of him and gets excited in the process.<br /><br />Well , all I can say is , why would a boxer who is at heart an exhibitionist be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker ? It simply makes no sense . And , I 'm afraid , some psycho - dynamics actually do make sense , if you take the time to read about them . However , bad scripts seldom make sense at all.<br /><br />The director / writer seems to have thought that this film represents a considerable minority within the gay community . Well , he may be correct , I suppose . We may never know , since that minority would be so dysfunctional they would hardly be able to get organized enough to ever get to an obscure gay film festival or DVD store , the only two places they could possibly find this turkey . Thank goodness for that .
0 I question its importance to Queer Cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violence.<br /><br />Three tales are tangled together in a rather sloppy manner . I found myself trying to untangle the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes , that alone did n't sit well with me . Weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 times.<br /><br />There was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film . More like a 45 minute Boy 's Brief short rather than a fleshed out full - length film . It had a certain erotic flair , male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its parts.<br /><br />The 1st part : Boxer / Stalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin . Bob has been following Tim for four years and only now is he confronting him ? I felt as though their cat - mouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion . We needed more information about them and less Parking Lot / Locker scenes with Tim relentlessly saying " What do you want ? " < br /><br />The 2nd part : Danny wants his buddy , Tony , to beat him up while he jacks - off . Tony does n't seem to mind , but he does n't even appear interested in exploring the implications of his homo erotic hobby -- not even after they do it in the nude . This tale lacks the all - important transition from " I 'm a straight boy smacking my guy friend around for fun " to " I think I might be gay and hitting him because I 'd like to spread his ass and do him S / M style . " A very important thing to leave out.<br /><br />Clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time . The 3rd part with the man and woman slapping each other around adds to that thought . Furthermore , it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film . Yes , the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy . The make - up ( bruises and cuts ) however was on par with a grammar school talent show.<br /><br />There was n't enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay politic . The film made no statement , squandered time , and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment . Its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach , that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously .
0 If you want to watch a film that is oddly shot , oddly lit , weird stories of these men ( and one woman ) who enjoy beating the crap out of each other , if you want to enjoy a story that goes nowhere of these two guys , one a boxer and the other a gay man , then you should watch this film.<br /><br />After watching this film , I almost felt as badly bruised up and cut up , like the director ( of the film ) himself beat the hell out of me.<br /><br />This is a movie where one is not meant to watch for plot or for great acting , this is a film to gawk at in horror and wonder . A lot like watching an airplane crash or a train wreck.<br /><br />If you want to watch a great movie , a good movie , a " B " movie , or even a mediocre movie , this movie is not it.<br /><br />A warning to all who watch this film , please do n't eat beforehand . You might want to puke by the end of the film .
0 OK . So it 's a low - budget " film " ( I used the quotes because it was shot in Hi-8 video ) . The acting is universally horrid , the makeup is laughable ( the blood looks like it came from Sherwin - Williams and I 've seen more convincing bruises made from halloween ghoul kits ) , and the lighting generally looks like they used someone 's borrowed Toyota pickup to shine headlights on the actors.<br /><br />I might be able to forgive these low - budget traits if there were some actual content , if a movie made an attempt to tell a story . But this collection of video footage can boast of no plot , no real characters , and no momentum . It 's a self - indulgent mess.<br /><br />And do n't worry -- no spoilers here , 'cause there 's absolutely nothing to spoil .
0 This is the most ludicrous and laughable thriller I 've ever seen . Oh .... where to start .... <br /><br />Plot ( what little there is ) : Clayton Beresford Jr. ( Hayden Christensen ) , a young billionaire , with a bad heart is desperately in need of a transplant . Clay has been secretly engaged to his mother 's PA , Samantha , played by Jessica Alba . On the night that these two secretly get married , it just so happens that a heart donor with the same rare blood type is found . Go and figure the odds of that one ! Once on the operating table , Clay finds out the anesthesia is n't working , and he can feel everything and hear everything.<br /><br />Fortunately Clay seems to be able to filter out the pain of a razor sharp scalpel cutting open his chest by simply concentrating on his memories of Samantha , which we are told he 's doing through an annoying voice - over which never seems to stop.<br /><br />If you did n't burst out in laughter yet , you will surely start to when you see the surgical scenes . < br /><br />How could a young billionaire agree to have a heart transplant performed by one surgeon , one nurse , an attending physician and an drunk anesthesiologist ? There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled . Not to mention the medical behavior , which is too preposterous to be taken seriously ... the operating room is n't even kept sterile ... people are practically able to just walk in and out of the room without even having washed up ... During the operation the viewer gets to hear Clay 's thoughts , none of which are too fascinating . Ah ... but here 's what it 's all about ... the doctors are trying to kill him in order to take his money . Believing him to be unconscious , the villains speak freely . Gosh ! What will happen ? < br /><br />Well ... at least there 's no interference from anyone else in the hospital , while an incompetent doctor who 's got four malpractice lawsuits running against him is performing major heart surgery . Not even Clay 's overprotective mother seems to be able to check on his status . The only one interested in keeping updated is Samantha ... but oh no ... could sweet Sam be in on it .... You'll quickly find out through some Scooby Doo dialog ... <br /><br />In the end , it would n't even matter whether or not Clay underwent anesthesia awareness , because the end would have turned out the same way in both cases.<br /><br />If you can ignore the feeling that the director / writer is trying to make fun of the patients who fell victim to anesthesia awareness , maybe there 's some dumb fun to be had ... <br /><br />Enjoy ...
0 I just saw this movie last night and , being someone who had very low expectations to begin with , was still disappointed . The most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point ( the guy being awake during the surgery ) , had NOTHING to do with the outcome . It would have ended the same way regardless . So , what was the point of this ? Who knows . Also , this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and he did n't think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table ? Give me a break . Jessica Alba is completely talentless and Christiansen is almost as bad . The whole thing was just laughable from start to finish . I 'm fairly certain that if you could feel someone cutting through your chest with a scalpel , you would be in more pain than that .
0 First of all , the big named actors must need the money ... The surgical scenes were laughable .... and surely they must know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this utterly absurd ...... Anesthesiologists do not leave the room during a heart transplant .... nor do they do the surgery in a tiny room devoid of instruments , heart lung equipment and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... could n't concentrate on the story line because of all the stupid surgery scenes ... no blood , no personnel and then the hero doc coming in and taking over ... it is not a film for thinking adults .... Also the budget must have been limited ... the street scenes were OK but who was the technical adviser .... Seems like it was directed by a total idiot .. Save your money and wait until it comes out on DVD and Do n't rent it ..
0 From the beginning this movie did have a few flaws . The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a the rich young mogul who has inherited his father 's considerable wealth and power , and he is struggling to both fill his father 's shoes and cut the apron strings mother ( and co - executive ) keeps too tight . He also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo that is the organ donor registry . There are also minor back stories which your first instinct is to mostly ignore that become important later , such as his friendship with his surgeon ( Terrence Howard ) and his romance with a middle class girl ( Jessica Alba ) . Uncreative story lines , but not bad enough to ruin the movie . The only real " oy vey ! " moment was the name of Lena Olin 's character . Overbearing woman named Lilith ... subtle!<br /><br />The surgical scenes are not at all censored . I appreciated that , people who find surgery scenes scary might not . The horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first . You watch in emotional agony as Christensen screams inwardly through the chest incision and the rib spreader . The moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia , he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him.<br /><br />The big twist , however , is very predictable and sends the film delving into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he , like us , initially missed . < br /><br />There are two more twists at the end involving his relationship with his mother . One is an impressive gesture by Olin , which comes of as unimpressive due to poor writing . The other is a secret about the family 's past which seemed very tacked on and pointless.<br /><br />The initially well done anesthesia awareness drama gets lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama . There is a one final attempt to bring it back which falls flat , taking the entire movie with it .
0 I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating , when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it . This really is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and i have seen many bad movies . It looks like a good movie in the beginning , but when he comes into surgery i could n't believe how bad it got . This voice - over destroys EVERYTHING ! Just imagine you are being cut open like that and then listen to what he says . I saw the movie in German so i do n't really know what he said in English , but ironic stuff like " Yeah right , it does n't hurt .. "? ... what is this ? Telling yourself " think about something else " and then forgetting your pain by just thinking about your girlfriend is just ... stupid . And his mother ... how the hell does she figure something like that out ? Someone comes to tell her , her son died in surgery ( what she kind of had to expect ) . Plus she found some letters in Jessica Albas bag . plus that " she knows the hospital " stuff ... and then it takes her " one second " to figure it out ? What the hell?^^ And the ending ... why does the police bust them ? The patient died in surgery , that s all that happened . That drunk doctor does n't know anything else either ... and then they bust them all , even the girlfriend ? ? ? Why ? ? ? Despite all that i think Christensen did a bad job , but that does n't really count for me ... those mistakes and stupid things i wrote about above are the problem . I watched this movie with some friends and we all were VERY disappointed ... As i said , one of the worst movies i have ever seen ... Just do n't watch it ;)
0 Hayden Christianson and Jessica Alba two of my least favourite actors of this century team up in what is quite possibly the flattest attempt at remake the already dire The Butterfly Effect . Awake is so dull and so utterly uninteresting that you 'd be better off asleep . Terrance Howard still recovering from the diabolical August Rush puts up a decent fight as the sadistic doctor who seems hell bent on killing Christianson and after viewing his performance I would gladly assists.<br /><br />Alba , still recovering after Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver surfer . Is naturally disastrous and equally unwatchable as she always was . Only once has she ever been rather brilliant at that was in the safe hands of master director Robert Rodriguez in Sin City . Could it possibly be that Jessica alba is n't as poor of an actress as most give her credit for and is is possibly that her acting abilities are being weight down by a poor script . If so then that would explain Awake . What with a script that would shame that of Plan 9 from Outer Space.<br /><br />Jessica Alba , Hayden Christenson , and Terrence Howard star in first - time director / screenwriter Joby Harold 's nerve - jangling psychological thriller about a man who experiences the frighteningly common surgical phenomenon known as " aesthetic awareness , " in which those laid out on the operating table remain acutely aware of what is going on around them despite remaining completely paralyzed and unable to cry out for help . When a successful young young man ( Christenson ) goes under the knife and realizes that the anaesthesia has n't quite done its job , the horror quickly sets in as his worried wife ( Alba ) waits anxiously and a terrifying drama unfolds in the operating room.<br /><br />Hoping to do for operating tables what Final Destination did for planes , this first effort from director Joby Harold pivots on a blood - frosting conceit . The pre - credits sequence tells us one in 700 people suffers from a phenomenon known as ' anaesthetic awareness ' , where the patient remains conscious but paralysed during surgery . One such unfortunate individual is Clayton Beresford Jr ( Hayden Christensen ) , who finds himself wide awake during a heart transplant ... and he can feel every single slice.<br /><br />Intermittently inventive as it probes away at his tortured psyche , Awake fails to inject true terror into its novel premise . Spiralling from chilling simplicity into absurd conspiracy , it 's hindered by stilted turns from Christensen and Jessica Alba . You 'll wish you 'd popped a sedative before watching   < br /><br />VERDICT : Awake is at very best extremely undemanding . A pull no punches film that undoubtedly looked better on paper . As a film though its awfully generic and extremely derived . Awake fails to inject terror into its novel premise . The end result is really quite lousy . Alba and Christian are the very least of your worries as the films main flaw lies in its inability to scare its audience . Awake is a film you 'll most likely sleep through .
0 After watching Awake , I led to a conclusion : director and screenwriter Joby Harold made Awake with the intention of laughing at the spectator , for the simple fact the movie is full of ridiculous elements . Awake has a lot of plot holes and it is full of absurd and ridiculous elements(for example , the hospital uniform the spirit of the main character uses ... did the ghost of a doctor leave it in the floor ? ) .The concept behind this movie is slightly ingenious but all the plot holes and the absurd things make of this a stupid and crappy film . With the exception of the great Lena Olin , all the actors bring bad performances . Hayden Christensen has zero expressions and the same applies for Jessica Alba . The extraordinary actor Terrence Howard is enormously wasted on his role . Awake makes a laugh of the spectator . It 's so ridiculous and full of absurd things that it 's impossible to take it seriously . My recommendation is : skip this crappy movie .
0 * * * * * * SPOILERS******<br /><br />The unfunny radio quiz show host Kyser and his mediocre band are the excuse for Lugosi , Karloff , and Lorre to pick up a paycheck in this bland , sporatically watchable haunted house spoof . Lugosi is a mystic whose seances are exposed as a fraudulent attempt to bilk an heiress ' fortune ; Karloff is the butler and Lorre is a professor who exposes fake mediums , but it turns out that they 're both in conspiracy with Lugosi . < br /><br />Of course , Kay Kyser and his band of 30-something year old " kids " uncover the truth with the minimum of possible humor along the way . Not recommended to any but the absolute horror completist .
0 There is something in most of us , especially guys , that admires some really working class small town " real men " populist fare . And Sean Penn serves it up for us with a cherry on top . Hey , A lot of people use Penn as a political whipping boy , but I do n't rate movies or actor / directors based on politics or personality . That is what right wing commentators like excretable faux movie reviewer Debbie Schlussel does . While acknowledging he is one of our best actors and a good director , I think this picture was a simplistic piece of aimless dreck that he has atoned for since . < br /><br />Okay , you have the gist of this there is this good cop , a small town trooper , Joe , played against type by David Morse , who in the opening scene chases some guy on a country farm road in big sixties cars . The bad guy stops , gets out , shoots at him so Joe has to blast him dead . There was no explanation what drove this man to do such a desperate violent thing and the dead man 's parents do some redneck freak out at the police station while Joe feels real sad and guilty that he had to kill someone . So we know that Joe , the farmer forced off his land into a cop job , is a good basic sort of guy . Then his brother Frank shows up , he is a sadistic , amoral bully , fresh out of the Army and Nam where the war got his blood lust up . Some people here and in other reviews called him just an irresponsible hell raising younger brother and Sean was trying to make some point about what our John Wayne tough guy culture and war does to otherwise good people but what I saw was an amoral , sadistic bully who enjoys hurting and ripping people off . Then there is mom and dad , Marsha Mason and Charles Bronson , who do the requisite turn as old fashioned country couple , then die off ; she by illness and he by shotgun suicide , to advance the story for us . Both times Frank the bad guy is away being a miserable SOB . But good Joe brings him back to Podunksville from jail so Frank can straighten his life out by welding bridges and living with his utterly stupid screaming trashy pregnant wife . But Joe has a nice wife , played by Italian actress Valeria Golina , who is Mexican and Sean uses this as an exercise in some affirmative action embellishment of goody Joe and his real soulfulness underneath his uniform and crew cut . For me , that was an utterly pointless affirmative action subplot that Sean uses to burnish his tough guy creds by sucking up to Mexicans because Mexicans are so tough and cool.<br /><br />But Frank is bad and we get the requisite events like stealing friend 's car , robbing gas station by beating the clerk over the head then torching the car and all those cool things that hell raisers do . Then there are the mandatory 8 mm film childhood flashbacks of young Joey dutifully moving the lawn and cowboy dressed Franky jumping on his back and wrestling him and yadda yadda so we all know what deep bond there is between the two of them.<br /><br />So the film meanders around with a lot of small town schlock to warm the heart of any red stater . Accompanying the film was a great soundtrack of good sixties songs like Jefferson Airplane and Janis Joplin which were totally inappropriate , except for the 60 's era effect , to win the hearts of old hippies . The worst offense is that , since the movie was inspired by a Springsteen song , " The Highway Patrolman " , that song was not included . < br /><br />So Joe 's brain dead wife goes into labor and Joe runs off to the bar to get loaded and spout some populists drunken victim 's spiel about how tough things are while good Joey comes to drag him back to his wife . The bartender is good Ole Ceasar , played by Dennis Hopper . So Viggo - Frank whigs out for no particular reason and beats his pal Ceasar to death after good Joe the Cop leaves.<br /><br />So Joe has chase his bad brother down and I was so hoping that he would do the right thing and blow that menace to society away . Instead we get a scene where his brother stops ahead of him in some old 50 's junker on some lonely road at night , and little Franky in his cowboy suit and cap guns gets out of the car to face good Joe , the kid from the 8 mm flashback home movie sequence . Oy , such dreck ! Then to top off this drecky sap fest , there is some Zen crap about the Indian runner , who is a messenger , becomes the message , ala Marshall MacLuhen ? See what I mean , Sean has done much better than this so do n't be afraid to miss this one .
0 I do n't like Sean Penn 's directing very much , and this early work , The Indian Runner , is no exception . The movie has no core , it 's colored with a kind of redneck , anti - authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of Penn 's work , his latest work even more so than the earlier . Frank Miller , Robert Rodriguez , Clint Eastwood , Sean Penn , the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product , ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty , but ending up being , for the most part , glorified pro wrestling matches , and moralistic , almost as if Hallmark cards had developed a line of Hell 's Angels greetings , and make me long for the days of Deliverance , which is a fine movie . Viggo Mortensen 's acting is much , much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg , and that 's about it . The movie is dead meaningless , and seems to be an exercise , a series of techniques , more than a story . Kudos for Charles Bronson , however , who proves he can act . And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis ' character . A lousy 3 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner crap .
0 Thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggles over family honor . David Morse is the responsible , straight - laced cop and ' good ' brother ; Viggo Mortensen , the ' bad ' boy , is a former soldier and ex - convict . As an actor ( particularly in his earliest years ) , Sean Penn seems to have modulated his performances under the Method . Turning first - time writer and director for this arty , obtuse drama , he works his script and characters out through the same methodical process , slowing the pacing down to a crawl ( ostensibly so we can catch every nuance and inflection ) . This approach might be fascinating if there were three - dimensional characters to care about , but photogenic Morse and Mortensen are n't really convincing as siblings . Worse , we expect more from prominently - billed veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis , who hardly get a chance to come through with anything interesting . The picture is balky with turgid sequences , a wobbly narrative and confusing editing ( always slanted to point up the artistic excesses ) . Penn 's tricks with the camera show off a talented eye , yet they are mostly an irritation . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 Penn takes the time to develop his characters , and we almost care about them . However there are some real problems with the story here , we see no real motivation for the evil brother 's behavior , and the time line is screwed up . Supposedly set in 1963 , the music is late 60s / early 70s . The references and dialogue is 70s/80s . The potential for a powerful climax presents itself , and Penn allows it to slip away . But even with all these difficulties it is worth the watch , but not great .
0 There is only one thing essential to thorough appreciation of The Indian Runner . Unzip your trousers . Peek inside . Is there evidence of a Y chromosome ? Okay , you 'll do.<br /><br />This film has all the male requisites : blood , guns , car chases , fond women , death , multiple tattoos , cigarettes , liquor , violence , pyrotechnics -- what have I left out ? -- oh , yeah , blowtorches.<br /><br />As a woman , I seriously hope Sean Penn regards this as a ` when I was a child ... ' kind of effort . Since he both wrote and directed the thing , he 's nearly solely responsible . An uneven cast ( Viggo Mortensen as usual demonstrating brilliantly how the job 's supposed to be done ) tries to save Penn . Too late . The lines and action are there . Even devoted , skilled acting ca n't change those.<br /><br />I found this movie puerile and silly , as well as predictable . The dialogue staggers along -- Sandy Dennis has my respect for trying to breathe life into a woodenly maternal monologue without motherly authenticity . Then she dies . After a bit , so does the protagonists ' father , played by Charles Bronson . Their absence is hardly noticeable.<br /><br />At intervals , the pyrotechnics , etc . , noted above appear to liven things up and scare the audience into thinking something significant is occurring.<br /><br />If you 're male and under 25 , you may adore this film . Plan to return to it at 35 . Think you 'll still like it?<br /><br />I do n't think so .
0 you can be fooled by your first impressions . as in , initial reactions to a movie , for example . as in , the first time i saw this movie i was bedazzled by the idea of it ( first of all , i love black comedies ) . could even - despite being male , myself - empathise with the feisty girls ' fervor to see their husbands deceased without delay . was tripped up by my own face - value ( and , i do mean " face - value " ) response to nicolette sheridan and a couple of the other delicious dames in the picture . it just goes to show you that you 've got ta step back from a situation sometimes and see that it 's bad ( and not " bad good , " either ) : the reason i 'm giving this movie a " 4 " rating is because of ms sheridan and her gams ( the rest of ' er is pretty good , too ) ; but this movie has all the hallmark TV movie characteristics - which means you 'll be disappointed if your a lover of movies made for the big screen . the story contains plot holes you could run a tunnel through - and i 'll generally overlook holes in a plot if the overall thing does it for me ; and i just experienced an incredible letdown the second time i saw it . i do n't think it 's a total waste of time , but ....
0 DEAD HUSBANDS is a somewhat silly comedy about a bunch of wives conspiring to bump off each others husbands ` . It`s by no means embarrassingly bad like some comedies I could mention but it never fufils its potential . Imagine how good this could have been if we had the Farrelly brothers directing Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson .<br /><br />Oh is Carter based on Jerry Springer ? Just curious because the catch phrase on Dr Elson`s show is " look after each other and keep talking "
0 When I rented this movie , I had very low expectations ...... but when I saw it , I realized that the movie was less ( a lot less ) than what I expected . The actors were bad ( the doctor 's wife was one of the worst ) , the story was so stupid ... it could work for a Disney movie ( except for the murders ) , but this one is not a comedy , it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity . The title is well chosen except for one thing : they could add stupid movie after Dead Husbands ! I give it 0 and a half out of 5 .
0 So , this movie has been hailed , glorified , and carried to incredible heights . But in the end what is it really ? Many of the ways in which it has been made to work for a hearing audience on the screen do not work . The fairly academic camera work keeps the signing obfuscated , and scenes that are in ASL are hard to follow as a result even for someone who is relatively fluent . The voice interpretation of Matlin 's dialogue , under the excuse that Hurt 's character " likes the sound of his voice " , turns her more and more into a weird distant object as the film goes on . Matlin does shine in the few scenes where her signing is not partially hidden from view . But nonetheless , most of the movie , when this is a love story , is only showed from a single point of view , that of the man . As Ebert said , " If a story is about the battle of two people over the common ground on which they will communicate , it 's not fair to make the whole movie on the terms of only one of them." < br /><br />The idea that an oralist teacher who uses methods that have been imposed in many deaf schools for decades would be presented as " revolutionary " is fairly insulting in itself . His character becomes weakened as a credible teacher as the movie goes on . Drawing comedy from a deaf accent is , quite honestly , rather low . And his attitude towards the male students of his class is pretty symptomatic of how he seems to act with women : as an entitled man . A party scene involving a number of deaf people including a few academics meeting together leaves him seemingly isolated , in a way that 's fairly inconsistent with his credentials : I have seen interpreters spontaneously switch to asl between each other even when they were n't aware of a deaf person being in the area , and yet somehow he feels like a fish out of the water in an environment his education should have made him perfectly used to . As a lover , he seems like a typical dogged nice guy , including his tendency to act possessively afterwards . And yet the movie is , indeed , only really seen through him , as everything his lover says is filtered through his voice . < br /><br />The scenes involving the other deaf kids are , in general , wallbangers . The broken symbolism fails , the dance scene , the pool scene , even the initial sleep scene which is supposed to carry some of it - all these scenes that try to hint at the isolation of the deaf main character are broken metaphors , at best : many hearing people I know do dance on the bass beats that deaf people feel ( instead of squirming like copulating chihuahuas ) , and going to take an evening dive for a hearing person is rarely an excuse to make a deep statement on the isolation of deafness ( no , seriously , when I go swim , I go swim) ... <br /><br />It also fails at carrying the end of the play , instead making it a story of a deaf woman who submits to a strong man . Even though the original play ended with a more equal ground , where both have to accept each other as they are , and where he has to finally recognize her real voice is the movement of her hands , not the vibrations in her throat.<br /><br />And for all the breakthrough that it may have seemed to be , Marlee Matlin remains Hollywood 's token deaf woman to this day .
0 Sorry . Someone has to say it . This really is / was a dull movie . Worthy perhaps , but dull nonetheless . I nearly cried with boredom when watching it . The acting is pretty dire , the story drawn out and predictable , the score and camera - work totally standard and unexciting . It 's one of those movies you are not allowed to hate ( becase it is about disabled people ) but hate it I suspect nearly everyone does . It is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie . I suppose they too are not allowed to be objective . This was made to win awards - which I remember it duly did . But it was neither interesting nor entertaining . I have n't seen the play so can not compare .
0 The movie itself is so pathetic . It portrayed deaf people as cynical toward hearing people . True , some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people , but they are not necessarily angry like of Marlee Matlin 's character was throughout the story . Deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way Matlin did . All in all , the movie itself is more boring than pathetic . It is so boring that I 'd like to believe that it is an insomnia - cured movie . If I have a problem sleeping , I can simply pop in Children of a Lesser God and watch . It will put me to sleep.<br /><br />Keep in mind , this is a deaf guy talking .
0 It is like what the title of this thread say . Only impression I got from that movie is that Marlee Matlin 's character was always angry , so cynical , and so pathetic . Her character 's first date with William Hurt 's character where they were dancing were dumb . All in all , I 've tried to finish watching the movie four times , and of all four times I fell asleep . I would keep watching that movie with one intention ... to beat my problem with insomnia , because all it do is to put me to sleep . Sweet dream .
0 CAMILLE 2000 < br /><br />Aspect ratio : 2.35:1 ( Panavision)<br /><br />Sound format : Mono < br /><br />Whilst visiting Rome , an amorous nobleman ( Nino Castelnuovo ) falls in love with a beautiful young libertine ( Daniele Gaubert ) , but their unlikely romance is opposed by Castelnuovo 's wealthy father ( Massimo Serato ) , and Fate deals a tragic blow ... <br /><br />A sexed - up love story for the swinging Sixties , adapted from a literary source ( Alexandre Dumas ' ' La Dame aux Camelias ' ) by screenwriter Michael DeForrest , and directed with freewheeling flair by Radley Metzger who , along with the likes of Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno , is credited with redefining the parameters of ' Adult ' cinema throughout the 1960 's and 70 's . Using the scope format for the last time in his career , Metzger 's exploration of ' la dolce vita ' is rich in visual excess ( note the emphasis on reflective surfaces , for example ) , though the film 's sexual candor seems alarmingly coy by modern standards . Production values are handsome throughout , and the performances are engaging and humane ( Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable ) , despite weak post - sync dubbing . Though set in an unspecified future , Enrico Sabbatini 's wacked - out set designs locate the movie firmly within its period , and Piero Piccioni 's ' wah - wah ' music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation devotees . Ultimately , CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste , but fans of this director 's elegant softcore erotica wo n't be disappointed . Next up for Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET ( 1970 ) , which many consider his best film .
0 The Cowboys could leave you a little sore in the saddle . Definitely not one of Johns best movies . Do n't get me wrong , with any John Wayne move there is always some good spots . And this one has it 's fair share . But over all the picture moves slow and just does n't live up to the aspirations it could have been . Bruce Dern again does an outstanding job as the villain . Roscoe Lee Brown is another bright spot in the movie . The kids in the movie were average but could have been cast better . This would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen year old movie goers.<br /><br />This would be a good family move to watch with your children . Just be aware , there is a couple of scenes that you may want to take a look at before you let the young ones see it . But most kids that I know who have seen the movie like it . Maybe it 's because they get to see kids their age do all the grown up work .
0 What a time we live in when someone like this Joe Swan - whatever the hell is considered a good filmmaker ... or even a filmmaker at all ! Where are the new crop of filmmakers with brains AND talent ? ? ? We need them bad , and to hell with mumblecore!<br /><br />This movie is about nothing , just as the characters in the film stand for nothing . It 's this horrible , so - called Gen Y , that is full of bored idiots , some of which declare themselves filmmakers with out bothering to learn anything about the craft before shooting . Well , Orson Welles was a filmmaker . John Huston was a filmmaker . Fellini was a filmmaker . Dreyer was a filmmaker , etc . Current films like these show just how stupid young , so - called " filmmakers " can be when they believe going out with no script , no direction , no thought , no legit " camerawork " ( everything shot horribly on DV ) , no craft of editing , no nothing , stands for " rebellious " or " advanced " film - making . Nope , it 's called ignorance and laziness or just pure masturbation of cinema ( and there actually is an in - your - face " jack - off shot , " so be ready ) . < br /><br />Look at the early films of any accomplished " indie " filmmaker : Linklatter , Morris , Allen , Lynch , Hartley , Jarmusch , Jost , Lee , or Herzog ... none made anything as tedious and aimless as this , yet Swan - whatever the hell , is still going to SXSW every year and hailed as some kind of gutsy , new talent . It 's crap ! I ca n't imagine anyone liking this , and everything else this so - called filmmaker has done ( all seen by me ) is just as bad ( the newer stuff clearly made to appeal to a more mainstream audience , one of the sitcom calling ) . Steer clear , unless you 're a friend or family member of those involved ... on second thought , if you 're a family member or friend you 'd probably be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such compromising situations ... <br /><br />Utter garbage . This is n't art . This is the ultimate opposite of it .
0 " It 's like hard to like describe just how like exciting it is like to make a relationship like drama like with all the like pornographic scenes thrown like in for like good measure like , and to stir up like contro- like -versy and make us more like money and like stuff . " - Ellen , the lost quote.<br /><br />"Kissing , Like , On the , Like , Mouth And Stuff " is like the best like artistic endeavor like ever made . Watching like Ellen 's hairy arms and like Chris masturbating was like the height of my years - long movie - viewing experience and stuff . But before I like begin like breaking new U.S.-20-something - airhead records with the my " likes " , let me like just briefly list like the high- like -lights of this visual like feast : < br /><br />1 . Chris doing the deed with his genitals . And not just that : the way the camera ( guided so elegantly by Ellen and Patrick ) rewards the viewer with a full - screen shot of Chris 's fat white - trash stomach after he finishes the un - Catholic deed - that was truly thrilling . I can in all honesty say that I 've never seen such grace . Chris , you should do more such scenes in your next movies , because that is exactly what we needed as a continuation of what that brilliant , brilliant man , Lars von Trier and his " Idiots 95 " , started . A quick w * * * and then a hairy , fat , white belly : what more can any movie - goer ask for ? ! Needless to say , I can sit all day and watch Chris ejaculate ( in spite of the fact that I 'm straight ) ... Such poetry in motion . Such elegance , such style . No less than total , divine inspiration went into filming that sequence - plus a solid amount of Zen philosophy . Even Barbra Streisand could not get any more spiritual than this.<br /><br />2 . Ellen 's hairy , thick arms . The wobbly - camera close - ups , so skillfully photographed by our two directors of photography ( I ca n't emphasize this enough ) , Ellen and Patrick , often caused confusion regarding the proper identification of the sex in question . There were several scenes when we would see a part of a body ( a leg , arm or foot ) , yet it was often a guessing game : does that body - part belong to a man or a woman ? Naturally , Chris and his fellow artists , Ellen , Patrick and whatsername , cast themselves on purpose , because their bodies were ideal for creating this gender - based confusion . It was at times hard to guess whether one is seeing a female or male leg . Patrick is so very thin and effeminate in his movements , so hairless and pristine , whereas Ellen and the other girl are so very butch , what with their thick legs and arms . Brilliant . < br /><br />3 . Brilliant - especially the way that neatly ties in with the theme of role reversal between the sexes : so utterly original and mind - blowing . Ellen behaves like a man , wants sex all the time , while her ex Patrick wants to talk - like a girl . Spiffing.<br /><br />4 . Ellen 's search for a Leftist mate . " He must love ' The Simpsons ' , which is quite Leftist . " I am glad that the makers of this movie decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent Leftists . Ellen is such a refreshing - and realistic - change . The number of " likes " that she and her liberal friends manage to utter in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal ( 3,849 , to be exact ) . They have managed to realistically transfer their real - life ineptness onto the big screen with a minimum of effort , and I applaud them for that.<br /><br />5 . The close - ups of toes . Plenty of stuff here for foot - fetishists , which I think is a very liberal , highly commendable way of reaching out to sexual minorities . After all , shoe- and foot- fetishists are offered so little in modern cinema , so it 's nice to see that someone out there CARES.<br /><br />KOTM , or rather , KLOTLMAS , offers more than meets the eye . It is not just a modest little film about shallow people engaging in hollow relationships while indulging in meaningless conversations . No , it 's much more than that . It 's about the light that guides all silly creatures ; the guiding light that dominates the futile lives of various pseudo - artistic wannabes who just dropped out of film school , and plan to assault our senses with dim - witted drivel that will hopefully play well at pretentious festivals like Sundance and Cannes , enabling them to gain the necessary exposure hence some real cash for a change , with which they will later hire the likes of Sean Penn and George Clooney in promoting the saving of this planet and the resolving of ALL political problems this world faces . What better way to do that than by making porn at the very start ? < br /><br />If Chris and Ellen did the camera here , as is clearly stated in the end - credits , then who held the camera while the two of them were in front of it ? They probably hired some passers - by and shoved the camera into their hands ... <br /><br />Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 , and check out my " TV & Cinema : 150 Worst Cases Of Nepotism " list .
0 This film was absolutely awful , I even feel uncomfortable calling it a film . Its the typical " mumblecore " movie , with zero plot and a bunch of aimless whiny twenty somethings stumbling around trying to " figure stuff out " . I have tried to give mumblecore a chance , but lets be honest its just horrible.<br /><br />I am not out of sync with cinema , I appreciate Dogme95 films , Idioterne is one of my all time favorite films . So I do not mind if a film is cheaply made so long as there is some ( ANY ) substance.<br /><br />Everything in this film is horrid , the acting , the writing ( or was it all improvised ? ) , the direction , but MOST of all , above everything else , the camera work was just plain and simple nonsense . The camera was never anywhere logical , there was no consistency . I got to admit being a guy I had heard there was nudity in this film so I thought to myself well even if its horrible at least there 's nudity ( yea I know , I 'm a jerk ) . Well thanks to the uber crappy camera - work you never really get to see anything , and the things you do see , TRUST ME - YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE . This film made me want to vomit on numerous levels.<br /><br />The dialogue made me want to vomit , the camera - work made me want to vomit , but mostly the idea that this film was praised by some legit critics , well now that more than anything makes me want to vomit .
0 I admire ' Kissing on the Mouth ' for its frankness  pubic hair cutting and masturbation , especially from the lead / director Joe Swanberg . They were n't afraid to show trueness to everyday " private " occurrences . Unfortunately , the film falls under the ' The Brown Bunny ' realm , though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy . Yes , it mirrors ' Bunny ' with a whole lot of nothing going on , or too many cinematography shots focused ( or sincerely unfocused ) on absolutely nothing  feet , hands or genitals . Again , unfortunately , I can see why this film was released , and why people are renting : true life sex scenes and full frontal ( equally , both male and female ) nudity . Other than that , it was a complete waste of time . We quickly learn of a post - college male / female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex - boyfriend . Other than that , we are subjected to the every - day events of their boring lives : she works for her parents ; he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer . For this all to work , the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real . Neither work and it 's as boring as watching someone drive for an hour , i.e. ' The Brown Bunny . ' The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich , and even she does some questionable acting . ( The DVD extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching / listening to . ) Again , I admire the filmmakers , especially Swanberg , for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower - habits , but overall the film falls flat . It has narrations that does n't fit the scenes , too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder , other than the soft - porn factor , why you rented this .
0 OK , I kinda like the idea of this movie . I 'm in the age demographic , and I kinda identify with some of the stories . Even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semi - realistic , and in a different movie would have been forgivable.<br /><br />I'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did , but it 's not that easy when the filmmakers were n't trying at all.<br /><br />The editing in this movie is terrible ! Possibly the worst editing I 've ever seen in a movie ! There are things that you do n't have to go to film school to learn , leaning good editing is not one of them , but identifying a bad one is.<br /><br />Also , the shot ... Oh my God the shots , just awful ! I ca n't even go into the details , but we sometimes just see random things popping up , and that , in conjunction with the editing will give you the most painful film viewing experience.<br /><br />This movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also . I 've seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity ! Joe , Greta , I do n't know what the heck you were thinking , but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your egos . You should be ashamed of yourselves ! In conclusion , this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene . If that 's not your kind of thing , avoid this at all cost !
0 This is a very old and cheaply made film -- a typical low - budget B - Western in so many ways . Gary Cooper was not yet a star and this film is highly reminiscent of the early films of John Wayne that were done for " poverty row " studios . With both actors , their familiar style and persona were still not completely formed . This incarnation of Gary Cooper does n't seem exactly like the Cooper of just a few years later ( he talks faster in this early film , among other things).<br /><br />However , unlike the average B - movie of the era , there are at least a few interesting elements that make the film unique ( if not good ) . If you ever want to see the woman that was married to Errol Flynn for seven years , this is your chance . Lili Damita stars as the female love interest and this is a very , very odd casting choice , as she has a heavy accent ( she was French ) and was n't even close to being " movie star pretty " . Incidentally , she was also married to director Michael Curtiz . < br /><br />But for me , the most memorable and weird aspect of the film is the seemingly gay subplot -- sort of like a BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN from the 1930s ( and we thought this was a NEW idea ) . Gary Cooper 's character was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can through much of the film to keep Cooper clear of females . This misogyny alone does n't necessarily mean much , but there are so many clues throughout the film that indicate the makers of the film really were trying to portray them as a gay couple . In particular , towards the end , when one of them is killed , the other is shot by an arrow and holds off dying long enough to crawl over to the body of his fallen friend and then falls -- with his arms cradled around him ! This was pretty edgy stuff for the time and I think this makes this dull film really fascinating today ! As far as Cooper and the plot go , the film is a bit of a disappointment and very skip - able . Unless you are curious about Damita or the homosexual undertones , do yourself a favor and find a better Western .
0 The motion picture was , in all likelihood , made in the year 1930 and released in 1931 . I would surmise that talking motion pictures had great difficulty in making the transition from the silent era . Nevertheless , this particular Zane Grey plot appears to be very weak . Also , Gary Cooper was probably just learning to act . The result is something that would not be acceptable by today 's standards . For 1931 , maybe . For 2004 , not acceptable . Some of the actors performed well . Sadly , the Indians always get the short end in these early westerns . They were living on the land long before the white man came , but according to twisted history , they had no right to defend themselves .
0 This is actually a pretty bad film . The ideology is not as perverse as in those films Collins made later . However , my main misgivings about the film are that it is implausible and quite frankly boring for a long time . The whole concept of an ex - SAS man joining terrorists for no particular reason is n't very convincing and you ca n't help wondering why a group of highly organized terrorists ( who later become pretty clueless ) fall for it . The film starts with a pretty powerful scene but then meanders for quite a long time building up towards the great finale . Overall , I think Who dares wins could have been an interesting 45 minutes episode of The Professionals but the story does n't carry a feature film . Although reasonably successful at the time this film initiated the demise of Collins ' career who in the eighties mainly made cheap and dubious soldier - of - fortune or army films . Pity , because he actually is quite a versatile actor but at the end of the day Martin Shaw chose his roles more carefully and has a career that 's still successful .
0 ... just look at the poor Robert Webber character ( great performance , once again ! ) who tries to wrestle a sub machine gun from one of the terrorists . Everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong . The biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a firm footing in the actuality of the early 1980ies ( the fundamental difference between this flick and the far more fantastic , ironic and therefore timeless Die Hard ) . The story comes through as a failed attempt to glorify the SAS commandos . Ideas like when a commando shouts heads down " all good guys do it and all bad guys do n't so that they can blast away ad lib ( with a good conscience ) , that the main character does not get mown down by the gas masked commandos although he wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from their arsenal just seem to be unlikely and make it hard to take the movie seriously . And it just happens that it tries to be more than just fun . Do n't talk about the toilet - mirror - signal episode ... < br /><br />I do n't mind the criticism of the Pacifist movement as a shield for evildoers and the arguments between the peace fanatics and the settled , even headed representatives of power in this movie . But the political comment is rather lame and uninspired . This is insofar regrettable as the movie features an early performance of Judy Davies . She plays the main fanatic and seems to have done extensive studies on the subject " . Anyway , her performance is a notch above that of the others and somehow I feel the movie let her down .
0 It 's 1982 , Two years after the Iranian Embassy Siege which involved the dramatic SAS Rescue from the Balconys , and with a War with Argentina over the Falkland Islands currently taking place , what better film to make than a Gung - Ho " SAS " Film that re - creates the Iranian Hostage siege , whilst using Britains Number one action hero of the day , Lewis Collins . throw in Edward Woodward and a few other Well known actors and you 've got a winner on your hands? ... Well maybe not ! The film itself does n't make the situation serious enough , whilst the acting is quite second rate . it 's like a Movie long episode of " The Professionals " , but without the formula . This film goes nowhere fast and is quite predictable . Maybe Cubby Brocoli watched this film and decided to ditch Lewis Collins as a Touted James Bond Replacement for Roger Moore . Watch it if your a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS stuff in General , if not , save your time .
0 In Europe , it 's known as Who Dares Wins ; in America , it 's known as The Final Option , but under any title this ludicrous SAS action flick asks the audience to put their disbelief to one side for around two hours . I find it incredibly hard to comprehend how Lewis Collins ( the hero here ) was almost chosen as Roger Moore 's successor in the Bond films .... this guy is so expressionless he 'd struggle to get a job in a waxwork museum ( as a waxwork ! ! ! ) Luckily , Judy Davis is on hand to partially redeem the affair with a meaty performance as a hard - line lady terrorist , and there 's a climactic ten minute action sequence that is quite competently orchestrated by director Ian Sharp . Let it be added that it 's a very , very , very long wait for these closing excitements to come around , and I ca n't honestly say that a near two hour wait for a bit of decent action was worth the effort.<br /><br />SAS hard man Peter Skellen ( Lewis Collins ) goes undercover among a group of peace protesters who would like to see the end of nuclear weapons stock - piling . He meets their leader Frankie ( Judy Davis ) , a strong - talking and opinionated woman who might just be capable of taking extraordinary measures to achieve her goals . Frankie 's dedicated bunch violently lay siege to the American Embassy in London , demanding that a nuclear missile be fired at a naval base in Scotland ( she believes that when the world witnesses a nuclear blast for real , everyone will be so appalled that they will join her campaign for disarmament ) . Unfortunately for Frankie , she makes the mistake of taking Skellen on her little embassy raid , and he plans to thwart their plan from inside with a little well - timed outside help from his SAS comrades.<br /><br />The film is inspired - quite obviously - by the awesome SAS assault on the Iranian Embassy in 1981 . Someone who saw that event on the news apparently thought it would be good to devise a film along similar lines . Unfortunately , the film is rather banal , with too much stupid dialogue and a heck of a lot of embarrassingly bad scenes ( the arch - bishop 's debate which descends into a riot , anyone ? ) Frankie 's idea to bring about peace by instigating a nuclear blast is ridiculous anyway , so she becomes a laughable figure just when the audience is on the verge of viewing her as an interesting villain . Who Dares Wins tries to be a celebration of the military legend that is the SAS , but at the same time it dips into clumsy action clichés and ill - thought - out plotting . The result is a well - intentioned but wholly ineffective slice of Boy 's Own absurdity .
0 Okay , what the hell kind of TRASH have I been watching now ? " The Witches ' Mountain " has got to be one of the most incoherent and insane Spanish exploitation flicks ever and yet , at the same time , it 's also strangely compelling . There 's absolutely nothing that makes sense here and I even doubt there ever was a script to work with , but somehow I could n't turn it off . The scratching your head with confusion starts right away , with an opening sequence about an angry little girl that killed her mother 's cat . So you think this film revolves on children possessed by evil forces ? Heck no , because after this intro , the girl and her wickedness simply are n't mentioned anymore . Then cut to a guy , with the most impressively trimmed mustache you 'll ever see , who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather unsubtle way . When she asks him to spend his vacation with her , he promptly phones his employer requesting him any type of assignment ! Great move . The movie finally starts now , as he travels to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks . Though not before he picks up a new girl ( Patty Shepard ) and photographs her topless ! Throughout their journey , all kind of strange events occur that  you guessed it  are never explained . The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest , loud petrifying music plays everywhere and someone even steals the jeep ! Really , car jacking witches ? Apparently a coven of silent witches owns the mountains and they practice voodoo on trespassers . That 's as close as I get describing the plot , but there 's a good chance I 'm way off   More important here is the atmosphere ! " The Witches ' Mountain " is occasionally very creepy , with its spooky music and interesting cinematography . The supportive characters all look uncanny and the ravishing Patty Shepard plays a good heroine . This is the type of European horror film that could have been legendary , if only someone had bothered to write a structured screenplay .
0 Saying this movie is extremely hard to follow and just as frustrating to sit through is putting it very mildly . Also saying that the current available print is dark , dreary , scratchy , abysmally edited , painfully dubbed , seemingly censored and in almost unwatchable shape is also correct . This film is in dire need of a good remastering from the full , uncut , original negative and seeing how it 's reasonably atmospheric ( and won the director an award at the Catalonia Film Festival ) , it might actually be worth the trouble . Then again , maybe not ... It 's just impossible to tell in its current condition what kind of movie it actually is . It starts fairly interesting , if you can discount the completely senseless pre - credits opening sequence , which involves a deranged cat - killing , snake - loving little girl named Gerda . The girls mom , Carla ( Mónica Randall , who should have laid off the eyeliner a little bit ) , splashes some gasoline around in the garage and torches the brat . Seemingly about as crazy as young Gerda , she goes to visit her estranged photographer ( ex ? ) boyfriend Mario ( " John" / Cihangir Caffari ) . He 's on vacation from work , but so desperate to get away from Carla that he begs his employers to set him up on an assignment ... any assignment . She scowls " You 'll be sorry ! " as he heads out the door . Well , Mario is assigned to photograph " Witches Mountain " ( somewhere in the Pyrenees , I believe ) . Before he gets to his destination , he gets sight of a hottie on the beach named Delia ( Patty Shepard ) and snaps a few pictures of her taking off her bikini top . Only slightly peeved , she claims to be a single writer , the two flirt and then decide it would be a swell idea if they went on the trip up the mountain together . When they stop by her place so she can pack her bags , Mario suddenly hears loud , sinister music . Delia claims he 's just hearing things.<br /><br />So the two begin their trip up the mountain , taking a stop at a local inn to spend the night . There they encounter a weird , partially - deaf , crazy - eyed innkeeper ( Victor Israel ) and Delia claims someone was spying on here through her window . The next day , under some trance , she wanders off up the mountain and is eventually located by Mario , who hops out of his jeep and runs after her . While he 's finding out what 's up , someone steals their wheels and they 're forced to walk a piece , eventually finding the jeep undamaged at the foot of a small , ancient , seeming abandoned village ... almost like someone was trying to intentionally lure them there . Well as we will see , that 's exactly what has happened . In the village they encounter a friendly old woman named Zanta ( Ana Farra ) who claims she 's the only person still living there and lets them stay in her home . Mario takes some pictures of the " abandoned " city and when he develops them they are eerily full of people . Slightly creeped out , he and Delia begin to leave and get stuck in " treacherous " fog and have to pull over and camp out for the night . The rest of the movie has to do with voodoo dolls , black cats transforming into sexy women , Satanic rituals performed by ladies in their bras and a deadly fall off a cliff . And yeah , coincidentally Carla the estranged wife turns out to be one of the witches , too . It all takes place in semi - darkness and to be quite honest , I did n't know what the hell was going on most of the time . The inconclusive " open " ending is just an additional slap in the face to anyone having to suffer through the rest of this senseless mess.<br /><br />Honestly , there are just a few things that stand out to me as being really good . The first is actress Shepard , who has that great Barbara Steele kind of dark , mysterious beauty . There 's also an excellent music score ( credited to Fernando Garcia Morcillo ) and chanting songs , which aided immensely in making this film as atmospheric as it is . The location work is fairly decent , but as I said , the print is ugly as can be and it does n't make a lick of sense , so proceed with caution on this one .
0 This was a fairly creepy movie ; I found the music to be effective for this . The photographs Mario took of the village were also unnerving . However , I had three problems with this film . One is that the lighting was very dark so some of the time it was hard to tell what was going on , but this may have just been my copy . The second is that the very beginning is not explained very well and I 'm still not sure what was going on there . The third problem is that I did n't understand the ending , but apparently some people do . Of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things , and the male lead is very 70s . All in all , watchable but not even close to being a favorite .
0 Highly implausible , unbelievable , and incoherent Spanish production about ... well , let me see just how close I can get to it . The film opens with a woman having one of her cat 's killed by a young girl . She then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation . He calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this . What relevance this plays out to is anybody 's guess at the film 's end , because the guy , a swarthy photographer , spies a beautiful Patty Shepard , queen of Spanish horror films it seems , taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture , ask her out to lunch , and then to his assignment to Witches Mountain - for reasons again we are never privy to . Before they go , Patty must stop by the house and loud , " eerie " chanting echoes in our hero 's ears . Again , this is never explained . The film goes on with these two stopping at an inn , going on to the mountain , and finally realizing why the mountain is called Witches Mountain . You know , there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film . It has some atmosphere , some of the character actors are really quite good(especially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman ) , the leads are at least adequate , and the climax - though it makes absolutely no sense at all - is well - choreographed(literally ) with the witches in white brassieres and long black hair . It just does n't make any sense though , and that is a huge detractor to me . I could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than I did after the first viewing . That is a major problem . The Witches Mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap , atmospheric European horror films that blanketed that decade . If you can get more out of it than me , better power to you .
0 I could n't make sense of this film much of the time , and neither could anyone else , based on other reviews . The opening scene of this film has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the story . In it , a photojournalist with a big mustache cancels his vacation to get away from his girlfriend . He is assigned to photograph a mountain range . It 's rumored to be haunted , but I could n't tell whether he heard that from his boss or later in the film . On his way , he meets a beautiful writer ( Patty Shepard ) and convinces her to join him on his working trip . Throughout the film , there is this terrible music score , mostly consisting of noisy singing that makes you want to scream " SHUT UP ALREADY ! ! ! " What really will gall a person is that the film always seems like it 's about to become good , though it never does . There is beautiful mountain scenery and some genuinely creepy atmosphere . The inn and the silent , abandoned old buildings scattered on the mountain are rather ominous . The foggy nights look real , not like someone put an artificial fog machine on the set . And the idea , while not original , had potential . But it never does improve , at least not enough to be worthwhile . Here 's how it goes , more or less . They stop at this inn run by a weird innkeeper ( you expect him to be named Igor ) with a hearing problem . There is a scene where the writer thinks a peeping tom is in her window , but the scene is so dark , I had no idea what was going on . Whether this was poor lighting or a poor film transfer is unknown to me . In any event , we never find out know what happened . There is a scene where she wanders off during the night . Whether she is sleepwalking or mesmerized by the witches of the title is never explained . Another scene which is never explained is when their car is stolen , then found again , with nothing stolen . They wind up in this apparently abandoned mountain village whose sole inhabitant is this seemingly kindly old woman . There are other things , including a chained wild man in a cave who is never explained , an attempt to sacrifice the writer in some way ( will they kill her or brainwash her into joining them ? ) , the witches themselves , a bunch of brunette women in white robes who do n't show up until the last 15 minutes of the film and whose practices and beliefs are never explained . Even the closing scene does n't make any sense . When all is said and done , most people will be saying , " Huh ? "
0 I was never quite sure where this thing was going . These people seem interested in what is going on on some mountain . They investigate , have narrow escapes , leave , come back , leave , put each other in danger , sleepwalk , get attacked by witches who have consistent wardrobes , etc . , etc . The guy seems to like the girl , but leaves her unprotected numerous times . She gets taken off , he gets her back , leaves her again . You get the point . The whole thing seems to get around to some sort of sacrifice , I think , but I 'm not sure , or turning people into witches , but I 'm not sure . It 's just dull and endless and not worth the time . There are some atmospheric scenes , but the print is so bad that there times when twenty seconds of blackness is not unusual . Is this caused by age or the overuse of night filters .
0 I admit , I had to fast forward through this poorly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes -- NOTHING was happening , and everyone has already described the " plot . " But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it 's impaled on the grass in the front yard ! I 'm guessing the bratty kid did it , put it 's never explained . Really trippy opening.<br /><br />I wish this had been a better written or thought out film , because what we 're left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no sense is n't a " clever " movie , it 's just a poorly executed film.<br /><br />I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage , I would like to see if it would help . Otherwise , this is an odd little film that is best if fast - forwarded through !
0 I am working my way through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and THE WITCHES ' MOUNTAIN ( El Monte de las brujas)is something like the 17th movie in the set.<br /><br />The movie had nothing to it to hold my attention at all . The plot was incoherent . The dialog seemed improvised . The acting was poor . The characters were unsympathetic.<br /><br />The best scene is the beginning , with an exasperated woman that is driven to burning her seemingly bratty daughter . However , the only connection this scene has to the rest of the movie , is the lead character , Mario , who has the most stupendous mustache ever . But , that 's it.<br /><br />The film was not effective on any level . The music was too intrusive . The lighting was very dark , so that some scenes are almost completely black . It really is barely watchable -- what more can I say ?
0 Welcome to movie 17 on the chilling classics 50 pack . Where we 'll see , That 's right . Another movie that makes absolutely no sense . Seriously , this movie had me so confused at the end , i thought i was rewatching " At Dawn they Sleep . " The plot seems simple enough .... well that is until 3 seconds into the movie where a girl supposedly killed a cat and then ... um .. explodes ? i have no idea what happened . and that was BEFORE THE TITLE SCREEN . That 's really sad when i ca n't even tell what happened in the first 3 minutes.<br /><br />Anyway it stars a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after dumping his other girlfriend on the way to take pictures of something somewhere . so we get there but not before somebody steals their jeep to drive it 200 feet out of the way towards a town . suspicious ? nah . so they decide to stay at this deserted village with one old lady . and then blah blah stuff happens and blah blah talking . The guy with the mustache goes out in the fog for some reason even though the old lady tells him not to . He gets lost and then finds his way back.<br /><br />Oh , i forgot to mention this is all after an incredibly pointless 20 minutes of them staying in the house of a guy who looks like that buggy eyed guy from casablanca . Then they leave . There 's really no point to this scene . It 's really just padding . if you cut it out no one would have noticed or cared.<br /><br />But sadly , that was actually the best part of the movie . wait . let me rephrase that . REALLY sadly that was the best part of the movie . because the rest is so confusing that i had to look on IMDb to find out what happened . But of course no one else knows so i 'm SOL . < br /><br />Seriously , the last 30 minutes of the movie were some of the most mindscrewing moments i 've ever seen on film . They dressed her up in a dress , he gets kidnapped , then released , he runs back to the house , then at the end the witches are in the house and it ends ? seriously . i have hardly ever been so confused in a movie . i mean , as bad as movies such as " War of the Robots " are , at least they MAKE SENSE . this movie does n't even make the ATTEMPT to be coherent . the ending was as confusing as the end of " At dawn they sleep " and the plot was much more boring . This movie gets a 1 just for its sheer " i have no idea what happened in this movie"ness . " Witches mountain " gets 1 confused movie watcher out of 10 .
0 As someone else mentioned , it begins with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat . Then the main story : a photographer ( Gaffari ) and a writer ( Shepard ) meet by chance and take a trip into the mountains . First they spend the night at an inn where the slightly deaf landlord gets hollered at , with increasing irritation to the audience , by Gaffari . Once in the mountains they seek shelter again and are invited in by a kindly old lady who seems overly hospitable to strangers ( Hansel and Gretel , anyone ? ) What happens next I will leave for the bold viewer to sort out because I most assuredly could n't . Now , I like Eurohorror , and this woulda been better if only Artigot ( writer AND director ) had made some attempt at logical story telling . The backdrop ( Pyrenees ? ) makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult occurrences . The verdant peaks could easily obscure supernatural forces and those who command them . The photography is nice . Just wish the whole thing made sense . You can view this film at archive.org .
0 This engaging ( which it should n't be ) low - grade Spanish exploitation ( quite tame I might add ) looks good , but huh ? Let me phrase that again ' huh ? ' . Actually the word ' huh ? ' would be going through your mind quite a lot . Nothing makes sense , nor does it try too . I just do n't know if its complicatedly cryptic or just a convoluted muddle , but there 's no denying how laconically uneventful , strange and wordy it feels.<br /><br />Unrelated sequences tied ( like that nasty opening involving a little girl , dead cat and fire ) in to a sparse story involving photographer Mario ( played by a chest - puffing John Caffari , who 's mustache is a dead ringer for Nintendo 's iconic Mario . What 's the odds ? ) that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady ( a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard ) who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment , where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches.<br /><br />Look past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease . Raul Artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages , but for most part seems sporadically non - existent and unfocused just like his writing . Ramon Sempere 's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away . However there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on . Fernando Garcia Morcillo 's hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created . The leads are capable , but there 's also a sturdy bunch ( the pick being Víctor Israel ) of secondary performances.<br /><br />Slow with little in the way of interest , but this dreamy set - up ( that seems to go on and on ) manages to keep you watching until its closing .
0 This movie got off to an interesting start . Down the road however , the story gets convoluted with a poor illustration of ancient black magic rituals . The male lead was very good , even though he gets the worst end of the stick in the climax . In comparison , this is " Boomerang " meets " Extremities".<br /><br / >

0 This is a typical Steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds . I would n't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a Steele novel knows how they ALL end . If you do n't want to know much about the plot , do n't keep reading.<br /><br />Gilbert 's character , Ophelia , is a woman of French decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident . Gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she , otherwise a good actress , can not realistically pull off any kind of accent . Brad Johnson , also an excellent actor , is Matt , who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce . He is gentle , convincing and compelling in this role.<br /><br />The two meet on the beach through her daughter , Pip , and initially , Ophelia accuses Matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid . All of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love.<br /><br />The chemistry between the two leads is not great , even though the talent of these two people is not , in my opinion , a question . They did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical . Two people meet , tragedy , bigger tragedy , a secret is revealed , another tragedy , and then they get together . I wish there was more to it than that , but there it is in a nutshell.<br /><br />I wanted mindless entertainment , and I got it with this . In regard to the genre of romantic films , this one fails to be memorable . " A Secret Affair " with Janine Turner is far superior ( not a Steele book ) , as are some of Steele 's earlier books turned into film .
0 As I said , the book was pretty good and this might have been a good movie if Melissa Gilbert had n't been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead roll . What kind of accent was that suppose to be anyway ? It sounded the same as her horrible Russian accent in another movie that I have seen her in . Every time she opened her mouth I cringed . It took 3 tries before I was able to watch the entire movie . Brad Johnson was good as the other lead . < br /><br />I really liked the beach location scenes . They added some much needed brightness to take your mind off of Melissa Gilberts depressing portrayal . I think they could have used San Francisco views more to their advantage though . It looked like the night scenes were actually SF , but I could be wrong . I do n't recall the character in the book being this depressing . < br /><br />Please keep Melissa Gilbert out of any future movies that require an accent !
0 Like all the Taviani Brothers films , this one looks great , but it is rotten to the core with false romanticism , and coincidences heap upon each other in some facsimile of a " story " . In actuality , this is really just a sentimentally cheap tear jerker posing as an intellectually distinguished art film .
0 Even by 1942 standards of movie - making the setup which HER CARDBOARD LOVER presents was dated to the extreme . The machinations of one half of a pair ( of husband / wife , ex - husband / ex - wife ) to get the other back at the threat of marriage to another , divorce , or an eventual separation by means of jealousy , humiliation , or other schemes had been done much better in classics such as HIS GIRL Friday and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY . Both of these movies features women with a strong , indomitable screen presence and who played independent , proto - feminist characters . In both movies , both women were estranged / divorced from their ( witty ) first husbands and set to marry colorless men who were their exact opposite , and both would be bamboozled into rejecting their soon - to - be husbands and re - igniting their passion for each other.<br /><br />The plot in HER CARDBOARD LOVER switches the gender : here , it 's Norma Shearer in the Cary Grant role out , this time , to ward off an ex - boyfriend ( George Sanders ) by means of hiring Robert Taylor to pose as her gigolo . The problem is , Shearer is much too old to be playing a role more suited to an actress in her mid - to - late twenties ; Sanders is about as involved as a piece of furniture for the most -- any man who would be in love with his fiancée , on seeing a strange man come out of her bathroom as happens here , would knock the lights out of him and cause a huge scene . Not here . And Robert Taylor plays his part as if he were trying to channel Cary Grant half the time , not in speech inflections but in overall essence.<br /><br />But the worst part of it is Shearer herself . For an actress used to parts which gave her a sense of intellectual sexiness and dramatic presence , playing Consuelo Craydon seems to put her into throes of complete over - acting , over - emoting , and over - gesturing which , while still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier , makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the joke out of a situation like water from a fairly dry sponge . It only fuels the fires that tell the theory which gives Irving Thalberg the maker of her career and chooser of ( most of her ) roles ; why she passed on roles such as Charlotte Vale and Mrs. Miniver on mega - hits NOW VOYAGER and MRS . MINIVER is a mystery , but then again , most accounts also state that by this time she had just burnt out from acting , that she 'd had lost interest in the whole thing altogether and it 's no secret that anyone who has experienced this sort of thing has essentially lost focus and ca n't wait until retirement or the end of a contract is near to leave as soon as possible . Such could be the case here . She seems lost , she seems tired , she seems ill at ease , going through autopilot instead of living the part . After this film she would make no more , but would be responsible of discovering Janet Leigh who would come into her own as a screen star during the late 40s and into the 60s .
0 Songwriter Robert Taylor ( as Terry ) is " dizzy , slap - happy " and ca n't see straight over otherworldly Norma Shearer ( as Consuelo ) . " She makes the sun shine , even when it 's raining , " Mr. Taylor explains . But , Mr. Taylor gets a lump in his throat whenever he gets near Ms. Shearer . Finally , at the Palm Beach casino Shearer frequents , Taylor proclaims " I love you ! " Shearer brushes him off , as she is engaged to George Sanders ( as Tony ) . However , to settle a gambling debt , Shearer hires Taylor to pose as " Her Cardboard Lover " , to make Mr. Sanders jealous.<br /><br />This film 's title invites the obvious and appropriate three - word review : " Her Cardboard Movie " . It is most notable as the last film appearance for Shearer , one of the biggest stars in the world from " He Who Gets Slapped " ( 1924 , playing another Consuelo ) to " The Women " ( 1939 ) . To be fair , this was likely the kind of Shearer film MGM believed audiences wanted to see . However , the part is unflattering.<br /><br />Plucked and powered , Taylor and Shearer were better off in " The Escape " ( 1940 ) . If Shearer had continued , she might have become a better actress than " leading lady " ; apparently , she was no longer interested , and certainly did n't need the money . Taylor has a great scene , reciting Christina Rossetti 's " When I am Dead , My Dearest " while threatening to jump from Shearer 's balcony , as directed by George Cukor.<br /><br / > * * * * Her Cardboard Lover ( 6/42 ) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer , Robert Taylor , George Sanders
0 In this forgettable trifle , the 40-ish Norma Shearer plays a fluttery , girlish socialite in Monte Carlo , caught in a tussle between George Sanders and Robert Taylor . It would be tempting to blame this movie 's failure on the dull , talky script , or director George Cukor , who never seems interested in livening up the film 's generally comatose state . Mostly , though , it 's the fault of Shearer herself , who desperately wanted to keep playing " young " parts as long as she could get away with it . Inadvertently , this makes " Her Cardboard Lover " a bizarre monument to an aging woman 's vanity .
0 " Her Cardboard Lover " is Norma Shearer 's last movie . She quit the movies and , I think , joined the Board of Directors at MGM . That was a good move on her part . " Her Cardboard Lover " was talky and boring in parts . It was obvious there were only a handful of actors with speaking parts so they had a lot of dialogue to speak to keep this turkey afloat . < br /><br />The story was a good idea about a wealthy woman ( Norma Shearer ) hiring a man ( Robert Taylor ) to make her playboy fiancee ( George Sanders)jealous . I am surprised that the director , George Cukor , did not cut many of the talky scenes between Ms. Shearer and Mr. Taylor . Mr. Cukor served Ms. Shearer well in " The Women " but not in this movie . < br /><br />The best performance in the movie was given by Robert Taylor . During Mr. Taylor 's career , he was given his best comedy roles in this movie and " When Ladies Meet " in 1941 . In 1942 , he gave his best comedy performance in " Her Cardboard Lover " and , up to then , his best dramatic performance in " Johnny Eager . " He had a busy year . I think of all the actors at MGM , Mr. Taylor worked with all the major and minor actresses on the lot . Also , MGM gave Mr. Taylor all types of movies to make - most of them were successful . That is why MGM kept him for 25 years . < br /><br />Mr . George Sanders was very good as a socialite heel . He played a similar role eight years later in " All About Eve " for which he won an Oscar for a supporting role . As for Ms. Shearer , this was one of her worst performances , she was not funny and too dramatic for this comedy . It is strange that she made a great comedy in 1939 , " The Women " , and gave her best performance . It was obvious that she was too old looking for her younger leading men in " Her Cardboard Lover . " Also , it did n't help that some of her clothes were awful.<br /><br />Too bad she and Mr. Taylor did not make another dramatic movie like their last movie together , the superb " Escape " . The same comments about this movie can be said of another movie , " Personal Property " that Mr. Taylor made in 1937 with Jean Harlow . It was too talky , boring , and the actress looked old . Ms. Harlow looked ill throughout the movie and nobody in Hollywood noticed to tell her to see a doctor , so in 1937 , she died at age 26 . What a waste ! She was becoming a good actress and getting better roles .
0 What boob at MGM thought it would be a good idea to place the studly Clark Gable in the role of a Salvation Army worker ? ? Ironically enough , another handsome future star , Cary Grant , also played a Salvation Army guy just two years later in the highly overrated SHE DONE HIM WRONG . I guess in hindsight it 's pretty easy to see the folly of these roles , but I still wonder WHO thought that Salvation Army guys are " HOT " and who could look at these dashing men and see them as realistic representations of the parts they played . A long time ago , I used to work for a sister organization of the Salvation Army ( the Volunteers of America ) and I NEVER saw any studly guys working there ( and that includes me , unfortunately ) . Maybe I should have gotten a job with the Salvation Army instead!<br /><br />So , for the extremely curious , this is a good film to look out for , but for everyone else , it 's poor writing , sloppy dialog and annoying moralizing make for a very slow film .
0 What 's written on the poster is : " At birth he was given 6 years to live ... At 34 he takes the journey of a lifetime . " Ami is an American - born Israeli who was diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy disease at the age of one . At age of 34 , after the love toward his 22 years old care - giver did n't go well , he decided to come to the US to face the doctor who said that he would have only 6 years to live . He wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive , and weights 39 pounds . Why ? Your guess is as good as mine , even I have seen this film.<br /><br />Obviously it 's courageous to live when all he can move is his left index finger , but why does he have so much anger toward the doctor who diagnosed his disease 34 years ago ? His doctor just told his mom that based on the medical history , people with his disease wo n't live long . What 's the point of him showing up at old doctor 's door for ? Why is tracking down this old doctor in the US is a journey of his lifetime ? There are so many things we might be interested in Ami 's life : how can he make those animations with the movement of only one finger ? How can he go through daily lives while totally depending on others ? How did he out lived his doctor 's prediction ? How does he deal emotionally when other people look at him like looking at a strange creature ? The movie told us none of that . Instead , the filmmaker got a van and set up a trip to let Ami to show up at his old doctor 's door in order to show him that he is still alive . I thought it was a joke .
0 There are three movies with this animation style that I fondly remember from my youth . This movie , " The Last Unicorn , " " Flight of Dragons " and " The Hobbit . " I own copies of both " Dragons " and " The Hobbit " ( both excellent ) and I had n't seen " The Last Unicorn " in more than a decade . That was until today and now I wish I had n't . What bothered me the most was the script . It was incredibly choppy and often inane . Things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation . We 're not just talking about little things here either ; we 're talking about key plot points ! The story itself is n't that great to begin with , but it could have worked had the script been decent . Not even close . On top of that the music was awful ! I know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces , but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a bowling ball . This was one of those films that I was going to show to my kids some day , but it just got cut . I do n't think I could ever sit through that crap fest again . Disappointed is putting it mildly .
0 I loved " The Curse of Frankenstein " so much that I rushed out to get " Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed " to see Cushing at it again ... even if it was without Chistopher Lee this time . To my great disappointment , this movie not only does without Lee , but it does without Frankenstein 's Monster altogether ! Was it a case of " If we ca n't get Lee , we wo n't have a monster at all " ? Why would they do that ? The monster is half the fun of the whole thing ! ! This film is dedicated solely to the study of Baron Frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum . I found the script extremely weak , with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much . I 'm willing to suspend a fair amount , but this movie got fairly ridiculous , which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it.<br /><br />Peter Cushing , though , is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film . For being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men , he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well . The supporting cast is competent , but has little to do , even the young doctor and his fiancée blackmailed into helping Frankenstein . A bumbling police chief is introduced , along with his put - upon sidekick , to generate some comic relief , then they are completely dropped from the movie ! Why ? We are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the Baron , then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor , and then it ends up being the victim of Frankenstein 's brain transplant experiment . There was no tension , we were n't invested in the " creature " , and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel.<br /><br />Also , there are virtually no " horror " elements . Yes , there is a beheading in the beginning ( off - camera ) , and we are treated to the sounds of Cushing cutting the tops of two men 's skulls off ( again , off camera ) , and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene ( 90 % of which is , again , off - camera ) . I understand that there is a love of " letting the audience imagine it all , for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show " , but come on , if you 're not going to give us a Monster , then at least let us SEE the few " horrific " elements you do choose to include . Showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary.<br /><br />On top of a weak script , I thought the directing was mostly flat . There were a couple of nice shots , but otherwise no excitement , atmosphere , or suspense was generated . The same director did " Curse " back in 1958 and I thought it was brilliantly directed ... guess he was as uninspired by this film as I was.<br /><br />The movie gets a 4 out of 10 from me strictly for Peter Cushing 's powerful , nuanced performance ... beyond that , I found little in this movie worth recommending . Instead , my suggestion is to watch " The Curse of Frankenstein " and see a truly great Hammer horror film .
0 Oh , man ! This thing scared the heck out of me when I first watched it ... and I was SIXTEEN!!!<br /><br />That creepy animated Barbie is scary as hell ! I want to stop talking about her now .
0 It is a Frank Zappa axiom that " music journalism is people who ca n't write interviewing people who ca n't talk for people who ca n't read . " If you ever needed proof that musicians ca n't talk , this is the film for you . Repeated attempts at profundity stumble over themselves to end up in monosyllabic comments delivered in awestruck voices : " Wow . " ( Thank you , Idris Muhammed . ) This film is pretentious but , while much of the pontificating from Youssou N'Dour and his gang of merry men ( and one token woman ) grates , the music saves the day.<br /><br />The main idea behind the film ( what I take to be the main idea , dredged out of the inarticulate commentary ) is interesting . To gather a group of musicians from America and Europe and take them on a journey through the different styles of music that grew up in and out of slavery , back to their roots in the music of West Africa , and a concert in the old slave fort of Gorée off the coast of Senegal . We are treated to gospel , blues , jazz and variations of these , including some fantastic drumming both in New Orleans and Senegal . There 's also a good deal of N'Dour 's own compositions.<br /><br />Sadly , that 's another weakness . It 's never entirely clear what N'Dour himself wants to achieve . To some degree , the film appears to be an exercise in self - promotion on N'Dour 's part . He wants to play his own music , jazzed up to some degree and performed in the company of a bunch of musicians he admires . He 's clearly a little embarrassed by this and early in the film obtains the blessings of the Curator of the Gorée museum.<br /><br />The clash between the different agendas shows through in several other places . For example , somebody obviously felt that it was not possible to tell the story of black music without involving a gospel choir , but N'Dour and most of his mates are Moslems ( a point made repeatedly throughout the film ) . The whole early sequence involving the black Christians is uncomfortable and then they disappear from the story until the close harmony group ( the only black Christians who can hold a tone ? ) turn up in Dakar at the end of the film . ( To be fair , they turn up triumphantly and perform the best piece in the film . ) If the story of black music needs to nod in the direction of gospel , why not also in the direction of Latin America ? Where are the black musical influences from the Caribbean and Brazil ? Samba ? Reggae ? Then there 's Europe . Here the black diaspora does n't seem to have produced any musicians of calibre , since N'Dour chooses to draft in Austrian guitarist and a trumpet player from Luxemburg . Are they in the team just because N'Dour has played with him before ? What I personally found most irritating , though , was the long sequence which tried to recreate a kind of 60s beatnik / black power / Nation of Islam cultural happening in the New York home of Amir Baraka ( a.k.a . Leroi Jones ) . Hearing people talk about the importance of " knowing your history " , and then in the next breath perpetuating ignorance . Why do so many African - Americans believe that taking an Arabic name is an assertion of their African roots ? And why do they think Arabic Islam is so much more admirable than European Christianity ? Who do they think established the trade in African slaves in the first place ? The film does n't have much to say about the situation in West Africa today beyond the platitude that " present conditions " are a consequence of all the brightest and best having been shipped away for 300 years . The Senegalese appear to be a poor but happy , musical gifted folk , friendly and welcoming , respectful of their elders ( and not above fleecing the visiting Americans in the fish market ) . Is this ethnic stereotyping or just my imagination ? There is no comment on the armed guard that N'Dour and the camera crew seem to need in the opening sequence as they walk through the streets of Dakar.<br /><br />There is also a strong implication in the film that the slaves who were taken from Dakar came from Dakar . The similarity between the folk drumming style of New Orleans and the folk drumming style of Senegal is cited in evidence . The last thing the slaves heard before they were shipped away was the drumming of their homeland , bidding them farewell . Except , of course , that by and large , the slaves shipped from Dakar did not come from Dakar . They were captured or traded from the interior by the coastal Senegalese and sold to merchants of whichever European power currently held the Gorée slave fort . The people of Dakar are not the descendents of Africans who escaped the slave trade , they are just as likely  more likely  to be descendents of the people who sold their black brethren into slavery and exile.<br /><br />The two agenda 's clash again in the final part of the film . There are two separate endings . On the one hand , the concert which N'Dour and Co have been rehearsing and preparing along the way and which they deliver in the courtyard of the Gorée slave fort . The other end comes when the Harmony Harmoneers sing the spiritual " Return to Glory " , in the seaward doorway of the slave fort . This is deeply moving , even if it is hard to believe the performance is quite as spontaneous as it appears.<br /><br />This is a film that is flawed . Unclear of the story it is trying to tell and tugged in different directions . Irritating , confusing , beautiful and emotional by turns . Watch it ( listen to it ) for the music and the feeling , but do n't expect enlightenment or intellectual rigour .
