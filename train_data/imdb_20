0 so altogether i found this documentary to be strange and really pointless . i know it got awards and things , but i personally did not enjoy it too much . there was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested , just a bunch of wierdos and their jobs . some of the people in are rather different which is n't a bad thing , it just did n't leave a good impression on me . i was thoroughly bored by this movie , no offense to my creative writing teacher . the circus theme throughout the whole movie was kinda cool but i did n't get it , and robotics and lion taming is definitely not my thing . the green animals thing was neat , i really liked the garden lots of colorful flowers , but how did these four jobs connect ? it just did n't make much sense to me why someone would make a movie about that . But if you are into stuff like this you might enjoy it . who am i to stand in your way . I am just forewarning you about possible suffering .
0 I found the documentary entitled Fast , Cheap , and Out of Control to be a fairly interesting documentary . The documentary contained four " mini " documentaries about four interesting men . Each one of these men was extremely involved with his job , showing sheer love and enjoyment for one 's job.<br /><br />The sad part , I must say , would have to be the subjects in which these individuals worked / studied . They were interesting for about five minutes , afterwards becoming boring and lasting entirely too long.<br /><br />The video was filmed in a very creative way though . I very much enjoyed the film of one thing with a voice dub over another . It played out excellent and also coincided nicely with the music .
0 Sorry , I just did n't find the subject matter as compelling as the filmmaker did . The robot guy and the mole rat guy were pretty interesting , although Morris did n't really tell us much about them . The other two subjects were a bore . And the supposed " connections " between them did n't hold up .
0 A broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent ( Tom Wood and Arye Gross ) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager ( Ron Perlman ) whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city , the " Costume Killer " ( so named because , after injecting his victims with Windex , he dresses them in silly costumes ) . They convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers ( John Considine , Joe Pantoliano , Kristy Swanson ) and discover that the art of movie making can be murder.<br /><br />There is more to this movie but it was unfortunately left on the editing room floor and it shows ( rumor is the studio wanted a " lighter " dark comedy ) . Our loss ( and the actors , who all do fine jobs and deserve better ) as this has the makings of an exceptional black comedy but only rises to mediocre cute.<br /><br />If you 're a Ron Perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance . His comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions ( he was n't kidding when he said on the Hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into Jerry Lewis mode ) . He 's just simply fun to watch in this one . < br /><br />David Dukes also shines in a two - scener ( but pivotal ) role .
0 The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote , poised to flick around to watch something else . The premise of two writers , down on their luck , living in a self - storage - space " bin " was mildly amusing , but , painfully bland.<br /><br />The introduction of the character , played by Joe Pantoliano - the big deal movie guy , that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory , offered hope and I decided to give it a few more minutes . And then a few more until Kristy Swansons introduction as a budding film director & borderline nymphomaniac , added a bit of spice . Her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye - candy inclusion.<br /><br />Ultimately , the obvious low - budget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes , stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments . Some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget , Whithnail & I being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream , but down on their luck.<br /><br />However , for my money , the actors save Tinseltown from the " Terrible movie " archives and just about nudges it into the " could have been a cult movie " archives . I laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving Joe Pantoliano 's character . In particular , the penultimate scenes in the terribly clich√©d , but still funny , rich - but - screwed - up characters house , where the story unravels towards it 's final moments.<br /><br />I can see how Tinseltown was a great stage play and while the film - makers did their best to translate this to celluloid , it simply did n't work and while I laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners , I think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree I would have laughed at anything.<br /><br />Unless you 're stuck for a novelty coffee coaster , do n't pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket .
0 " I just viewed this movie last night and I do n't think I will ever think the same about any of the actors involved , because this movie will stick in the back of my mind." < br /><br />The above statement can be thought of as a good or a bad thing . I mean every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in a movie , I think of " A Few Good Men " which is a good thing . Now , every time I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson , I will think of " Tinseltown " which is a VERY bad thing.<br /><br />I picked this up thinking that it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with Arye Gross and the aforementioned Swanson and Perlman , I thought that it at least would n't be bad . You could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of Wheeling , Indiana ( Where ? Exactly . ) , but maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie . WRONG.<br /><br />This movie is NOT funny or entertaining in any sense of either word . It is just there and lasts for 84 excruciating slow minutes.<br /><br />The characters are paper - thin . You almost care about NONE of the characters , and since the leads are two struggling Hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this need you to know about them . Okay , the two REAL writers know all about there onscreen versions of themselves , so they figure so does the audience . They do n't even think about character development , except for trying to tie there story back to " Gilligan 's Island".<br /><br />The plot is unoriginal . Two guys live in a storage center , where one of them stores a bed , and there are about twenty other people living there , too . The rest of the story is contrived and stupid . Have you seen " National Lampoon 's Favorite Deadly Sins " ? The second story with Joe Mantegna is about a television writer who ca n't find a good story to make a TV movie about , so he creates one . Now substitute the television writer for a screenwriter , morph Mantegna into to annoying actors half his age , and take away the comedy and you have this movie.<br /><br />The actors try . Kristy Swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie . She is still hot , but it would help if she would actually STAR in a movie instead of constantly making CAMEOS . As for everyone else , I do n't think it was the actors fault because they have BAD material < br /><br />Go watch the National Lampoon 's movie , but stay away from this movie .
0 I am amazed with some of the reviews of this film . The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com . This film is awful . The plot is extremely lazy . It is not scary either . People out there who think that because it stars Sarah Michelle Geller it is somehow like The Grudge should forget about it . This film is more like Dark Water , except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it . I was extremely disappointed with this film . It did n't scare me nor interest me either . Let 's face it , this type of plot has been flogged to death at this stage e.g. the dead trying to contact the living - Dragonfly , What Lies Beneath , Ghost Story , Dark Water , Darkness , The Changeling etc.etc . It seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films nowadays are the Japanese and the Koreans . The films that are coming out of Hollywood , like this , are cynical exercises in money making without a shred of respect for the viewer . They 're just being churned out
0 OK i will admit , it started out very pleasing and good , but then it just dropped downhill , i can not believe Sarah Michelle Gellar could have even finished reading the script after about 5 minutes into the movie , the only reason i actually sat through the whole movie , was i wanted to see the twist at the ned , and to my surprise , well , folks i can not even tell you if there ven was one , because the end just leaves you confused , and then the credit role , i was like what the hell ? this did not deserve a theater run , i am sorry , but it did n't i mean it was horrible , the only reaso i gave it a 4 is because it had a few jumpy parts ... thats it ! you can watch it , i m not telling you not to , hey you might even like it or even love it ! but if you hate it , do n't say i did n't warn you !
0 Think of the ending of the Grudge 2 with the following : < br /><br />- a man who repeatedly says the word Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar cutting herself - and a creepy mirror < br /><br />OH AND UNDERWATER SEA ANIMALS ... yay ... <br /><br />not a good movie ... I seriously did not enjoy it whatsoever . The poster for the movie is extremely misleading as well and I found that it was just to suck people into watching it ... I ca n't believe i went . < br /><br />Save your time and money ... go watch Saw III ... a film where the writing makes you feel like there was effort put into it ... <br /><br />Im Mike and I m out
0 Let me start off by saying I am not a fan of horror movies . I never watch them.<br /><br />Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /><br />The only reason I watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see it over Happy Feet.<br /><br /> ... I never saw Happy Feet , but I am sure it is better than this ... movie ? Anyway , we did n't actually expect it to be good ... we actually went in just to laugh at it . Cool with me ... I have a problem with ruining the movie for other people in the theater but since it was just other couples talking and making out , it did not matter.<br /><br />After 15 minutes the 2 other people left to go sneak into Borat , a movie I would have gladly seen again over this . The movie was not scary , and not stupid so it would be funny ... it was just boring . It was n't terrible like " Baby Genuises " terrible , it was terrible like ... not entertaining at all . Avoid.<br /><br />Now I am no expert , but it seems the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can have a PG-13 horror that is boring and not scary , or you can have an R gruesome horror movie that either is too bloody or too disgusting for people.<br /><br />You want a PG-13 horror that sucks but is funny ? See " The Grudge . " Avoid this movie like the plague ... because it may literally bore you to death.<br /><br />0/10
0 How do comments like the one that was the headline by high school girls even make it on this site , this was the stupidest movie I have ever seen , it was ridiculous , how can any moron sit there and say that just because a movie makes you jump it is a good movie , that might be the most idiotic thing I have ever heard , I could sneak up behind you and go " Boo " and it would make you jump , but that does not mean I am qualified to write or direct a movie , not to mention " they tied everything together at the end " is not a good reason for a movie to be well received . What kind of movie would it be if they did n't tie everything together , I guess that would make it half a movie , not a whole movie . So basically this idiot girl is complimenting them for finishing the movie , well I love how the youth of today hold the media and production companies to such a high standard . No wonder the political system of this country can get away with whatever they want , we have idiots like that coming up in our country , what would happen if this girl actually ends up leading something someday , that is a scary thought . Get a life and go watch a real movie sometime , try Shawshank Redemption or On the Waterfront , or something like that , and do n't comment that it was " boring " after you see it , just use what little brain God gave you to analyze it a little .
0 SOME NOT - SO - SPOILY SPOILERS AHEAD < br /><br />Why do people , when they are disoriented or sick or scared at a club , cut through the middle of the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom ? < br /><br />Who in their right mind would hide under a bed when someone breaks into their room ? < br /><br />How often do you knock on a stranger 's door and when they do n't IMMEDIATELY answer , you open the door , walk in , shout a few hello 's and then start going through their stuff ? < br /><br />If you were being pursued by someone you just discovered was a murderer , what would you do ? Quietly sneak off and hide under a wooden platform or among metal implements ? Run , quietly of course , to a ratty old barn or other decrepit structure ? < br /><br />I could be talking about almost any thriller that 's come out in the last few years , but since this is the " The Return " page , obviously I 'm talking about " The Return . " I saw it free because I work at a movie theater and make a point of screening all the " scary " movies . I thought this one was tolerable ... aside from the well - worn clich√©s . Sarah Michelle Gellar is really drab and looks kind of " Huh ? " through most of the film . The details of the plot are slowly given out as the movie progresses and it 's almost enough to make it interesting except there was n't enough explanation as it moved on and so I was almost lost until the last 2/3 of it.<br /><br />If you 're a die - hard thriller fan , it 's worth seeing at least once . If there 's nothing better at the theater and you really want to watch a movie , eh , I guess it 's worth a matin√©e ticket . If you thought the trailer made it look like an interesting movie and you ca n't wait ... wait .
0 This was far and away the worst movie i 've ever seen in my entire life . It was slow , boring , not scary , not funny , not dramatic , not entertaining.<br /><br />Sarah Michelle Gellar was up to her old playbook of empty expressions of fright and shock . She could n't sell her character nor could anyone else in the picture.<br /><br />For those who thought the Grudge was ' kind of alright ' then do n't go see this unless you get enjoyment out of wasting your time and your life.<br /><br />I saw this movie for free by the way so I do n't want this to come across as a rant from a guy that lost 8 bucks on a terrible movie . It was free , it still sucked , I hated it.<br /><br />Avoid .
0 This is by the far worst piece of cr4p I 've ever seen in my life . It barely made sense . It was n't scary at all ( unless you class scary as loud noises and screaming ? ) Sarah - Michelle Gellar needs to stop with these sh1tty horror films . I think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when i shouted " SHITE " when the credits rolled up . < br /><br />On my list of the worst movies ever made this is how it would go:<br /><br />1 . The Return 2 . Cabin Fever 3 . Silent Hill < br /><br />The reason i made Silent Hill 3rd is because it showed some frightening scenes , but the rest was absolute cr4p . Same with cabin fever , made no sense , but the return topped that list . Its worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever put together
0 My friends and I went into this movie not knowing what to expect , but hoping for the best . When we came out , we were only slightly more informed on what the plot of the movie actually was . Though not the worst movie I 've ever seen , I definitely do not recommend spending your money to see it in theaters . Maybe have a friend rent it for you ( it 's not even worth the rental cost , either ) if you really want to see it.<br /><br />When a movie is so convoluted that you have no idea what 's going on until the last five minutes , there 's really not much that can be said in its defense . The acting was decent , more than you 'd expect to get from this movie , and some of the shots were good , but it was all bogged down by a lame plot and poor script.<br /><br />This movie was actually so bad that as soon as it got out , I went and purchased a ticket to see a good movie just to cleanse my mind . I recommend that all of you just skip the first step and go see a good movie instead .
0 I just got back from the film and I 'm completely appalled . This movie is an absolute mockery to all of mankind . The theatre I was in maybe had 4 other people . This movie was recommended to me and I could n't believe that this person liked it . I ca n't believe that any sane human would like it . There was no plot NO PLOT AT ALL . It was a joke . How can you make a movie about nothing . This movie only goes to show why Hollywood is in such a shambles . I can only just look at the spiral of the " Horror Movie " industry and giggle . What a travesty to all filmaking , this is true of all the new " teen horror flicks " Grudge , Boogeyman , Ring , Saw series . It is all such trash . Do n't support this kind of hogwash !
0 The Return is one of those movies for that niche group of people who like movies that bore and confuse them at the same time . Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a lame buisnesswoman who does not kill vampires or get naked at all throughout the movie . I was willing to put up with this , however I was not willing to put up with the worst editing ever combined with pointless flashbacks . At the end it turns out she crashes her car into herself when she was young . Or maybe I 'm wrong and that was just a flashback . With this movie it 's impossible to tell . Can you believe the same dude who made Army of Darkness produced this crap ? A much better idea is to stay at home and watch Army of Darkness on Sci Fi channel . That movie had it all : sluts , zombies and a dude with a chainsaw for an arm . The Forgotten did n't even have one of these things .
0 I think a round of applause is in order for whoever pieced together the trailer for Rogue Pictures ' latest release , ' The Return ' . I myself , along with everyone else have been duped into believing it is in fact a horror film . On the contrary though , its actually a supernatural thriller . Too bad it is not the least bit thrilling.<br /><br />'The Return ' stars Sarah Michelle Gellar as Joanna Mills , a young woman who has had personal problems since the age of eleven . It was at that age that she began having haunting visions depicting the murder of a woman whom she has never met . While in Texas on a business trip , she is led by these visions to the murdered woman 's hometown , La Salle . There she comes face to face with another person who has frequently appeared in her visions . A man by the name of Terry Stahl , who is played by Peter O'Brien . Joanna is now on a desperate search for answers . A search that could in the end result in her very own murder.<br /><br />I really do n't know where to begin here folks . Which should I mention first ? The atrocious acting , hideous directing , or the terribly bland story ? No matter which one I choose my point behind each is the same : they simply suck . Adam Sussman 's screenplay is downright moronic . Its not interesting . Its not compelling . Its just plain unpleasant . I kept waiting for something to jumpstart the " film " ( I 've placed quotations around film because I do n't believe ' The Return ' deserves to be called an actual film due to it 's foulness . ) and at least give it some slight chance of hope , but nothing ever happened . I was left out in an unbearable cold to freeze . Not even stellar performances from the actors themselves could have saved this disaster . Of course they probably knew this having read the script then agreeing to do the " film " . I assume this is why the acting was so awful . At least that 's what I 'm choosing to believe . I really hope the cast does n't pride themselves on their performances . They need immediate medical attention if they do.<br /><br />Now the directing was unmistakably bad , but I ca n't quite crucify Asif Kapadia entirely . ( Well I could , but I wo n't since I 'm such a nice guy . ) I look at ' The Return ' as a test for Kapadia because for all of you that do n't know , this is his first full - length feature " film " . He 's just getting his foot in the door and still learning . Next time around , well if there is a next time , hopefully he will have improved vastly . The only thing he was able to accomplish here was almost completely duplicating the visual style of Marcus Nispel 's 2003 re - make of ' The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' . Now that 's nice the " film " was given that , but unfortunately he still wo n't be receiving any kudos from me for that . Copying someone else 's work is n't something I consider to be praise worthy . ( Even if it is from a film I very much enjoyed.)<br /><br />I think Jim Sonzero 's American re - make of ' Pulse ' will now have to fork over the title of Worst Film of the Year to ' The Return ' . It beyond question is deserving of the title in almost every imaginable way . Now I do n't doubt this will make a small , and I mean very small , profit . No matter what though , it wo n't surpass or even parallel the fluke success of Gellar 's previous acting effort , ' The Grudge ' . On that note , there 's one last thing I 'd like to add . I can honestly say I had never been embarrassed to have been seen leaving a theater auditorium until seeing ' The Return ' . That is something I never wish to experience again , along with the " film " itself .
0 I just saw this movie yesterday ... I can not believe the reviews on this site . The ones that give it over one - star must be Buffy fanatics . Well , I am a Buffy fan of the first order , but I know crap when I see it . On every level , this film is terrible . Technically , much of the time you do n't know where you are in this movie , even within one scene , it jumps POV like crazy for no reason . No logic whatsoever in cinematic terms . Emotionally is bleak for bleak 's sake and attempts to be a psychological thriller when it is just confusing . Throwing nasty - looking red - necks in your movie is a cheap way to convey " atmosphere " . I ran out of patience with it a long time before the last act , but I was having too much fun with my friends doing MST3 K riffs to turn it off . Since leaving Buffy , SMG has had 2 successful movies , if even listing " Scooby Doo " on your resume could count . Gellar is a fine actress , but she ( or her agent ) sure ca n't find a vehicle for her . And Mr. Shepard , if you are having trouble paying your mortgage , I 'll send you a few bucks if you promise to not appear in a movie like this again ! ( Also , the estate of Patsy Cline should sue for defamation ! )
0 The films of UPA are surprisingly well rated on IMDb despite the fact that the animation quality is light - years behind that of Looney Toons , Disney and MGM at their prime . Sadly , due to rising costs in making pretty cartoons with high frame - rates and lovely backgrounds , the UPA style ( which debuted about 1950 ) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s . After all , the films were dirt cheap to make and they 'd received several Oscars to " prove " that the cartoons were now mainstream . So as a result , lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend was n't reversed until the 1980s.<br /><br />This UPA film is one of the early ones . The characters are very simply drawn ( any simpler and they would have used stick figures ) and the backgrounds were ugly -- simple line drawings with colors added in a very slap - dash manner ( often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the items).<br /><br />As for the story , it 's a jive story with a strong jazz style attitude . Some will love this , others will just find it very , very loud . It 's the traditional " Frankie and Johnny " story and because of the shootings and all , it 's probably not a great film for the kids . Heck , because of the animation and jazz , it 's not a particularly good film for me , either ! Some will read my review and no doubt think I am a crank ( which I am , to a degree ) . However , I love animated films and a little of this minimalistic UPA style goes a very , very long way and you ca n't seriously consider them great works of art -- just very , very quickly made cartoons . Ignore the Oscars and try watching some classic cartoons or something -- anything else !
0 I watched this film for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets . That 's a mullet every 5 minutes . Seriously though , this film is living proof that formula works . If it ai n't broke , it do n't need fixin . A streetwise - yet - vulnerable heroine , a hardened ex - cop martial arts master with a heart of gold and a serial killer with ' issues ' . Pure magic .
0 An update of the skits and jokes you would have seen on a Burlesque stage in the first half of the 20th Century . It 's a string of several jokes acted out . Some of them you could tell your Grandmother , some of them not , but it 's a fairly safe bet she 's heard them all before . For what it tries to be , it 's not too bad . Before you rent it , remember that it 's an older style of entertainment and has more value as history than as comedy or titillation . Robin Williams has a couple of bits , but he 's interchangeable with the other players .
0 No real plot to this one , just a series of short skits acting out some VERY old jokes . I chuckled once or twice in the beginning , much to my chagrin . But even at only 73 minutes this film wears out it 's welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious ( with some nudity sprinkled in here and there to keep you awake ) . Still as bad as this movie is ( and that 's pretty putrid ) , it 's a comedic gem compared to pretty much ANYthing by Aaron Seltzer & Jason Friedberg ( Date movie , Epic movie , Meet the Spartans ) Also the song is sadly kind of catchy in a sad way.<br /><br />Eye Candy : 11 pair of tits , 3 bushes , 3 asses < br /><br />My Grade : D < br /><br />Code Red DVD Extras : Original trailer for this film ; and trailers for " Beyond the Door " , " Dead Pit " , " the Farmer " , " obsessed Ones " , " Power Play " , " Sole Survivor " , & " Wacky Taxi "
0 Spoilers ... if such a thing is possible ... . . . . . . . As a rabid Robin Williams fan , I felt it necessary to buy this film as first on - screen appearance . Wow ... I could not imagine a more mind - numbing movie . Essentially , the movie takes one bad joke after another that your uncle Artie would tell you after dinner and dramatizes them . Robin Williams plays a lawyer in a 30 sec skit.<br /><br />I'm all for bawdy humor , but this humor was n't pleasantly vulgar , or ribald ... it was just mind - numbing . There are no redeeming qualities to this film , other than Robin Williams fanatics , like me , who simply have to own every piece of film .
0 .... as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates . Barely even reaching feature length , " Can I Do It .... 'Till I Need Glasses " is a collection of ( mostly ) dirty jokes . Many of them are so short that you ca n't believe it when you realize that THAT was supposed to be the punchline ( example : the Santa Claus gag ) ; others are so long that you ca n't believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up THAT punchline ( example : the students ' awards gag ) . And nearly all are directed without any artistry . Do n't get me wrong : about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny ( the iron / phone one is probably my favorite ) . There is also some wonderful full - frontal nudity that proves , yet again , that the female body , especially in its natural form , is the best thing on this planet ( there is some comedic male nudity as well ) . And I agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy ! But none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than * out of 4 .
0 When I saw this movie , circa 1979 , it became the first movie that I ever walked out of in the middle . There is nothing worse than comedy that just misses being funny , and this misses every time ( although I ca n't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie ) . There was nothing original about any of the skits . While I enjoy racy humor where appropriate , these skits were needlessly vulgar . What was even more irritating was that this movie was advertised as " Robin William 's first movie " , capitalizing on his new found fame in the " Mork and Mindy " television series . Yet his role turned out to be so minor that you can not even notice him on - screen .
0 Can I Do it ' till I Need Glasses ? at the very least proves the point that anyone can make a movie . Talent is not a consideration . The folks who unleashed this wretched pile of spewing vomit upon the world , lack any semblance of talent , taste or intelligence . The target audience must consist of the recently labotimized , and infants who play with their own feces . Anyone else would be far too world wise to get even a snicker out of this film . It consists of a series of sophmoric skits in which the punchline does not even extend to the obvious . It ends at the ludicrous . The jokes told are the types of jokes that elementary school children tell ( usually potty or sexually related ) where they do n't know the meaning of all of the terms they use . You know , like the one about daddy 's car and mommy 's garage . To apply any sterner method of criticism would be pointless , since the usual standards of acting , writing , direction and such have never even been heard of by the creative " minds . " behind this mess . Not to be judgemental , but anyone who enjoyed this film should seriously reflect upon their purpose on this earth.<br /><br / >
0 The comedic might of Pryor and Gleason could n't save this dog from the tissue - thin plot , weak script , dismal acting , and laughable continuity in editing this mess together . It has a very few memorable moments , but the well dries up quickly . As a kid I remember this as a Luke - warm vehicle for the two actor - comedians , but there was always something strange about the flow and feeling of what was being conveyed in each scene and how this ties to the plot overall . Watching it again after many years , it screams schlock - a - mania . I 'm not so concerned with the racial controversy , as I would n't mind seeing a movie take that issue on with a little levity . The most obvious fault to me is that the scenes are laid out like a jumbled , non - related series of 2 minute situation comedy bits ( any not very good ones at that ) , that were stapled together by the editor after an all - nighter at the local watering hole . Characters change feelings and motivations on a dime , without rhyme nor reason , between scenes and within scenes , making this feel as though no one had any idea of what to get out of the screenplay . Not that it was any gem to start with . I feel bad for the two actors whose legacy is marred by this disaster that should never have been made . Maybe my sense of humor has become too refined ...
0 The only redeeming quality of this overlong miscast melodrama is the scenery of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing the theme song . Stephanie Powers is miscast and betrayed by a phony accent . As has been pointed out , she is too old to play an 18 year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age granddaughter ? Lee Remick is good although she also is ageless in her later years . The talented Joanna Lumley is under utilized and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son ( Robert Urich ) finally marries Grandma Stephanie Powers . Stacey Keach 's ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him . Do n't know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal ? The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson , who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs . It strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them . Can anybody believe that handsome Robert Urich would remain single for decades waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals ? The WW2 engagement between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is laughable . To begin with , the Germans did not occupy the Provence section of France until late in the war , it was controlled by the Vichy French puppet government . We see the French resistance staging a daylight raid on Mistral 's villa to steal sheets after which they all lounge under a bridge waiting for a lumbering truckload of Nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them ? If you want to see a well acted mini - series set in a foreign country , do n't watch Mistral 's Daughter . A far better alternative would be The Thorn Birds .
0 Usually , I do n't think Hollywood productions are fit to be called film , so I call them ' movies ' instead . But this piece of elephant manure , is not even fit to be called a movie , hence the quotes in the title.<br /><br />Where shall i start ? 1 . If this is n't the start of geriatric casting , it sure is the epitome of it . Stefanie Powers is supposed to play someone even LESS than half her age , she 's supposed to play an 18 year old , and she is FORTY effing TWO ! ! ! ! < br /><br />2 . A horrible and stupid mindless portrayal of Paris and France , where we see clich√© characters such as : the sympathetic grumpy shop owner , the bitchy queen of models , the fairy god mother ex - queen of models , etc . This film is surpassed only in this respect by the Da Vinci Code , ( which reviewers correctly determined was a comedy ) . < br /><br />3 . It 's highly and utterly ridiculous to have no nudity in a film about a time and a place where nudity was so common place , especially if the whole focus is about that < br /><br />4 . The horrible accents ! ! ! < br /><br />5 . The Nana Mouskouri elevator - music!!!<br /><br />I could go on , but i think this is enough . And I was able to make these observations after watching this crap for just half an hour , WHILE surfing the internet and talking to my friends about math equations ... I mean ... ! ! ! ! ! < br /><br />I invite everyone to add to my list . :) :P :D
0 I just saw this movie , and I have to say that it was a big waste of time . The girl who played Eva ( Ellen Fjaestad ) ca n't act at all . She read her lines very un - naturally , and she had a very un - natural facial expression through the entire movie . Rosanna Munter who played Petra on the other hand , is a natural . She played her part with great perfection.<br /><br />SPOILERS ! The story was simple - we 've seen it many , many times before . She breaks up , he finds another , she get jealous , he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end . There were no surprises at all , one knew that Eva would break up , and that Adam would " hook up " with Petra . The only thing that nobody saw coming was that Petra told Adam to go after Eva at the party . She became all serious , which is a side of Petra the viewers had n't seen earlier in the movie , and told him to win Eva 's heart back , which was really cute.<br /><br />Besides Rosanna Munter , there is n't a single actor who gives a memorable performance.<br /><br />This is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors , so I do n't recommend it !
0 This was a strange kind of film about a low - lifes in New York City and centering around a main character ( the title name , played by Brad Pitt ) who thinks he ' 's a Ricky Nelson - type musician , except he has no real talent . < br /><br />It 's kind of fun to watch until a profane tough New York City - type woman with horrible accent enters the picture and takes over . That ruined the film for me . It must have been Catherine Keener , who usually plays tough and garbage - mouthed women . < br /><br />The hairdo on Pitt - an exaggerated Pompadour - was fun to look at . I can picture Johnny Depp playing this role better . One last note : it odd to hear a film made in 1992 ( other than Woody Allen 's ) with just mono sound .
0 This is absolutely the worst movie I 've seen all year.<br /><br />First , I will say that the acting was very good , and by all of the cast.<br /><br />This was apparently meant to be very offbeat , and in that regard it succeeded . By the same token , the story revolves around a self - centered wannabe , who is a clueless , talentless chronic liar , whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers.<br /><br />This was worse than watching a car wreck .
0 I think this would have been a much better film if the Cajuns had been portrayed in a more believable light . My family is from the southeast region of Louisiana and I live in southeast Texas ( about 20 miles from Lake Charles ) . I have never heard the people I grew up around talk like these folks did . The Cajuns were portrayed as backwards rednecks . Most of the Cajuns I know are well educated , proud people and do n't sound uneducated at all when they talk the way these people did . All in all it was an OK movie , with great scenery and music . I understand that the writers were from Lake Charles , and have knowledge of the area , but for the love of all things Cajun , please have the actors study the language , live amongst the people you are portraying and get an all around understanding of how they are before you go trying to act like them . In my opinion , when the actors make you believe they are that person , it 's a much more enjoyable movie !
0 OK , anyone who could honestly say that this movie was Great or even Good is either delusional or knows the Director , Writer and Producers and is trying to boost the buzz on this film . I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was Horrible . I 'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie bored me to tears . The reason I 'm being so harsh is because this film was clearly a different take on " Of Mice and Men " and they should sue because it is such a horrible rip - off of the story . In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt ... for someone to take a classic book and film " Of Mice and Men " and destroy it with a new spin bugs me so much . The actors , the accents , the dialog and the direction were amateurish and the writing was dismal . I mean if your going to take a new spin on an existing story make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified . Did not like this movie at all .
0 This is one of the weakest soft porn film around . I ca n't believe somebody wrote this stupid story before making some changes . The guy Mike is a major wimp and moron I ca n't believe he did n't want to take a shower with his bride - to - be Toni and be in a threesome with the french photographer Jan. He does do a threesome with Toni and Kristi but that was short I hate that every time in Soft Core Porn Films threesomes between a woman , a man , and a woman is short but a girl - girl thing is about an hour . To the makers of these films have the threesomes alot longer this film should 've have two threesome scenes not one but two .
0 A drama at its very core , " Anna " displays that genuine truth that all actors age , and sometimes , fade away . Anna is a character that believes America is her safety net , her home , and it can do her no wrong ¬ñ but she refuses to belittle herself to do work she does n't believe in . She is hard - nosed , optimistic , stubborn , and arrogant when it comes to her life , yet not afraid to let others in , yet drop them at a moments notice . Anna flip - flops between personalities , which makes this film ideal of an aging star , but not idea of the viewing audience . " Anna " has been praised for its star Sally Kirkland , and her ability to get " grungy " for the role , but a month into 2008 , " Anna " does not remain a staple of film culture . It is dated , dull , and formulaically chaotic.<br /><br />Director Yurek Bogayevicz has a message hidden within " Anna " about the falsehoods of Czechoslovakia , both politically and socially , but Kirkland refuses to let them upstage her . Bogayevicz is not afraid to play with the camera , to use wooden frames to allow Kirkland to stand out , and he is not afraid to lessen the surrounding characters so that when you walk away from the film , it is Kirkland you remember . If it is n't obvious , this film did n't sit well with me . From the opening of the first act and deep within the second , " Anna " felt like a high school theater production . The characters were non - existent , there was no enlightening pre - story , and there was no definition of time or place . There was Sally Kirkland , stubbornly saying that she is better than the other actresses vying for the same lifestyle that she wants . Randomly she encounters a friend , a young girl that has also traveled a long distance to get to America for the glitz and glamour , and two of them ( within the span of 20 minutes ) build a friendship that could break all walls . It is emotionally boring and unbelievable . Again , randomly , we meet Anna 's boyfriend Daniel ( played by the weak Robert Fields ) , who brings nothing to the table in terms of definition or character ¬ñ only to boost the attention onto Kirkland 's Anna . Through the course of nearly two hours , we watch as more random acts coupled with unnamed characters intertwine together to feebly create a story that is held together by loose threads ¬ñ and SALLY KIRKLAND . Arg , it pains me to continue to say this but " Anna " could have been a fantastic film had Bogayevicz presented equal time between Anna , Daniel , and Krystina , but instead we are forced into a one - sided game where emotional scenes speak louder than plot.<br /><br />Is this where Charlize Theron found inspiration for her beauty - less role in " Monster " , or Halle Berry in " Monster 's Ball " ? Was Sally Kirkland one of the early actresses discover that by letting themselves go for a character Oscar will shine in their direction ? Throughout this film I was disgusted by Kirkland 's portrayal of Anna , and Bogayevicz 's lack of excitement for anything else fluent . Bogayevicz gives us an Anna that does n't work hard for her parts , does n't care for others , and is generally mean spirited ¬ñ yet we are to feel sympathy for her ? Near the beginning of the film , she forces what she wants to do onto others , and gets upset when she does n't get her way . Sure , aging actresses my have that appeal to them , but Kirkland creates a more childish character instead of a mature one . That is where " Anna " could have improved . If this was a mature Kirkland , I would have gobbled it up , but this stammering childish Anna was impossible to believe . While my favorite scene was near the end where Anna goes to watch one of her older films playing ( included is absurd make - out characters ) and the film burns , this scene is also one of my least favorite . Anna has made a phenomenal life for herself , creating films and building the dream , yet when anyone else wants to enter that spotlight , she gets jealous and outraged . This did n't make for a character I wanted to stand behind nor win Oscars . Coupled with the classic 80s background synthesizer , the outrageous over - the top wardrobe , and the displaced ending ( where did that come from and what happened ? ? ) ¬ñ " Anna " slipped far in the scope of amazing cinema . It was a show - piece , an opportunity for an aging star to yell at the world one more time . In this one it worked , but I do n't think I will be fooled again.<br /><br />Overall , I can not say that I was impressed with this film . " Anna " is not a film about an aging film star ; it is about Sally Kirkland , and ONLY Sally Kirkland . Bogayevicz tries to do more with the story , but fails either because Kirkland will not allow him or he just realizes that there is n't enough to support a full story . There are one or two decent scenes in this film , but nothing that promotes this film as innovative or influential . Bogayevicz did not create a character that audiences would believe , tear up for , or dedicate a Sunday afternoon with ¬ñ he created an annoyance . Kirkland was n't Anna , she was an actress playing her a bit overdone and crusty on the sides . Perhaps I missed the scope of this film , but what makes films like this work is the cooperation of everyone involved . That was n't the case here . In " Anna " , Kirkland orders Daniel to act like a dog ( apparently as a symbolic act ) and yet during the entire emotional scene , I could n't help but think that was what Kirkland was like to those on the set . She did n't make this into a film , she transformed it into her own production , and because of it " Anna " failed . I can not suggest this to anyone ¬ñ from one Czech to another ¬ñ skip it ! < br /><br />Grade : * ¬Ω out of * * * * * ( for that pesky theater scene that creeped me out )
0 It 's so sad that Romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows , as superficial and brutal as the " Garcea " series or the " Vacanta mare " child - plays ... The difference is that Mugur Mih√§escu , Doru Octavian Dumitru and other such sub - artisans never presume to claim their shows as " art " . Pintilie , who 40 years ago made a very good movie ( " Duminic√§ la ora sase " ) followed by another one , nice enough ( " Reconstituirea " ) , tries to declare his film - lenghts " art works " - but , unfortunately , he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression . As such , " Niki Ardelean " offers again a sample of " HOW NOT " - this being about its only merit .
0 This guy has no idea of cinema . Okay , it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth , and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship . This all is very good , but look carefully : HE DOES NOT KNOW HIS JOB ! The scenes are unbalanced , without proper start and and , with a disordered content and full of emptiness . He has nothing to say about the subject , so he over - licitates with violence , nakedness and gutter language . How is it possible to keep alive such a rotten corpse who never understood anything of cinematographic profession and art ? Why do n't they let him succumb in piece ?
0 Yes , he is ! ... No , not because of Pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies . Pintilie IS THE naked " emperor " - so to speak ... <br /><br />It 's big time for someone to state the truth . This impostor is a voyeur , a brat locked in an old man 's body . His abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever . It is 100 % visual perversion : he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies . And if he does this in front of the audience , he might eve get a hard - on ! Did you know that , on the set of " Niki Ardelean " , he used to embarrass poor Coca Bloss , by telling her : " Oh , Coca , how I wanna f * * * you ! " ? She is a great lady , very decent and sensitive , and she became unspeakably ashamed - to his petty satisfaction ! And , as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in Romanian audiences , so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities " works of art " ! Will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all ?
0 Terminus Paradis was exceptional , but " Niki ardelean " comes too late . We already have enough of this and we want something new.<br /><br />Big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time , not behind . Why people see Romania only as a postrevolutionary country?<br /><br />We are just born not reincarnated , and nobody gives a s**t anymore about old times . Most people do nt remember or do nt want to remember , and the new generation of movie consumers do nt understand a bit . This should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song - priveghi ! Maybe younger directors should make the move .
0 this movie begins with an ordinary funeral ... and it insists so hard on this ordinary funeral feel that i lost interest within 5 minutes of watching , and started skipping scenes . it seems to me whomever made this movie is afflicted to the extent of becoming trapped in a permanent morbid trance , unable to contemplate anything else but death and destruction . well , i ai n't one of the dark kids from Southpark , i want a movie that within 10 minutes gets me well into an interesting story , i wo n't sit and watch 10 minutes of nothing but preparations for a funeral .. my grandma on her last years was fascinated by funerals , perhaps she might have enjoyed this " movie " .
0 I saw this movie twice . I ca n't believe Pintilie made such a fantasy movie . I 'm also a movie / theatre director and I know what I speak . This is not Romania anymore , but I see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 September . No story , no plot , nothing . No conclusion , no message , nothing profound , nothing hidden . Just empty images.<br /><br />What most of Romanians do n't know , this movie is for the french viewers , not for us . They really believe that is the reality in Romania . Also for teenagers . Pintilie should stop making movies . I do n't really know if we can call this a movie , maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we 've got such an image in Europe . This WAS a reality , but is n't anymore . A good friend of mine from the Brithish embassy said : " You have no idea what a long way Romanian people walked from Ceausescu " .
0 I find it rather useless to comment on this " movie " for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment upon . It 's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it . But since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance ... < br /><br />Filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other Romanian " movie " directed by Lucian Pintilie who insists to depict the so called " Romanian reality " following the Communist era ( 1990 to present days).<br /><br />Under no circumstances recommended for people outside Romania as for the others ( who lately find amateurish camera , lack of plot , lack of directorial / actors 's quality etc , noise etc . as being trendy and even art - like ) : watch & enjoy this " movie " ( as I know you will ) but do the other well intentioned IMDb members a favor , do n't write an online review for it will misguide , irritate and in the end waste their time.<br /><br />On the other hand this movie ( among others ) has some value whatsoever , an educational one for it sets the example for : " How NOT to make a movie . "
0 It 's very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making movies . They get worse every time . Niki and Flo ( 2003 ) is a depressing stab at the camera . It 's unfortunate that from the many movies that are made yearly in Romania , the worst of them get to be sent abroad ( e.g. Chicago International Film Festival ) . This movie without a plot , acting or script is a waste of time and money . Score : 0.02 out of 10 .
0 A note to all of you budding film writers : Study this film . If your dialog reads like the dialog in this film , please shred your script and try again.<br /><br />I did n't have high expectations , but was intrigued by the description indicating there was a mystery at the Christmas Ornament Factory . The Mystery is resolved very early and the film becomes a straight romance . I almost stopped watching it at 5 minutes , 10 minutes , and at the first break . My spouse , who is the Hallmark & Lifetime fan , gave up at the first break . < br /><br />Forest River is a company town - the main business is Aikens Ornaments , who make all manner of holiday decorations . The patriarch of the company has recently passed away , so the companies future might be in question . We soon meet Noelle , who would rather be on Wall Street than Main Street , and the mysterious Justin , who gets a date with Noelle after a large snowman she is inflating crashes into Justins car . Once we meet Alison Aikens , doing due diligence for the Board , we have our story setup.<br /><br />If you ca n't nail all the story arcs by the first commercial break , you have n't seen enough of this kind of Holiday film . Maybe that 's a good thing .
0 They should have named this movie ... Blonde women that needed to get their roots colored . Also the main character , geeze , the too tight sweaters . The giggling . Thought the guy did a good job though . I keep hoping we 'll find a good 8 star Christmas movie to watch this week . The dart throwing . Had to laugh at that too . We 've still got 3 more on the DVR to watch , maybe we 'll get lucky . Oh yeah , I figured the guy out pretty quickly and nailed it when he picked up the flowers and then drove out with his cousin . I told my daughter they were on their way to the cemetery . And how stupid was it that the two gals followed them there spying on them ? Creepy .
0 Some of the worst , least natural acting performances I 've ever seen . Which is perhaps not surprising given the clunky , lame dialog given to the one note characters . Add to that the cheap production values and you 've got a movie that does n't look like it even belongs on television . One does n't expect much from a Lifetime movie , especially one this old , but this is nearly unwatchably bad.<br /><br />Plot - wise , it 's a dreadful , clich√©d romance of a type even Harlequin would consider beneath them . It 's possible to guess how the remainder of the movie will go by simply watching the opening couple of scenes . Surprise , the only female character who gets any focus and the mysterious stranger end up falling in love .
0 Four years after making his directorial debut with the art - house snoozer " Welcome To L.A. " , Alan Rudolph shows us what he really wanted from Hollywood was to be one of the guys . " Roadie " is a frat - boy fracas complete with barroom brawls , horny harpies , Art Carney in a souped - up wheelchair ... and Meat Loaf at the wheel . Meat Loaf ( playing Travis W. Redfish ! ) is actually a rather charming presence on the screen , and perhaps in a smaller role ( in a better movie ) he might indeed be ingratiating , but Zalman King 's script is full of stereotypical redneck humor and helpless Meat Loaf is kept wide - eyed and moronic . Alice Cooper , Roy Orbison , Hank Williams , Jr. , and Blondie all make appearances -- and all look embarrassed . They certainly should , " Roadie " is one bad trip . NO STARS from * * * *
0 The first look on the cover of this picture , it looks like a good rock n roll movie . But do n't let the cover fool you , or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie is in it . The storyline is just horrible , and so is the acting . Plain and simple : BAD < br /><br />It 's not a movie about a roadie , its just a thin love story , so awful that you see right through it . The only good thing about this movie , is the soundtrack . Some good songs , and that is why I give 2 out of 10 . If it was n't for the music , it would of been 0 out of 10 . Meat Loaf is a horrible actor(at least he was in 1980 ) , and the girl who plays the groupie is n't even good looking ! This movie was a huge disappointment for me , because it makes a lot of good promises .
0 Where to begin ? How best to describe just how awful this movie is???<br /><br />Let 's start with the campy hick humor . It is n't very funny . Add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors - Meat Loaf is horrible and Deborah Harry is even worse . Pity poor Art Carney , who should have known better than to do this movie.<br /><br />And then there is the plot . A roadie whose life goal is to work an Alice Cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for Alice Cooper . At least they get what they want ... <br /><br />And then , just when the movie should end , they ca n't come up with a more plausible last scene than a - well , I wo n't ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie.<br /><br />There are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a " B " movie or perhaps worse . Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role . That 's a sure sign that the movie probably wo n't be very good . If nothing else , the movie lives up to the low expectations - even exceeds them by being worse than poor.<br /><br />Let 's just say this . This is the movie against which all bad movies are compared . And none are worse than Roadie .
0 What on earth has become of our dear Ramu ? Is this the same man who made Sarkar , Satya , and Comapny ? I refuse to believe so . If AAG was Ramu 's most ambitious project , he has clearly jumped off the high cliff he has ascended by giving the industry some of the greatest works of all times . This movie is made to fall like a brick . I was cringing to leave the theater , but I was forced to sit because I would n't have been able to take my car out of the parking lot before others also left . Else , nothing would have made me sit beyond interval.<br /><br />This movie is nowhere close to Sholay . It does n't even come near it within a mile . I believe Ramu surely loves The Godfather more than Sholay , since Sarkar was a classic piece of work . I read Ramu 's interview a couple of days back , in which the interviewer said that Ramu does n't sleep for more than 4 hours a day , that too not at a stretch . I completely agree with this now , as his lack of sleep has probably taken its toll on the movie.<br /><br />There is no power in the performance . Amitabh Bachchan does n't even look scary . He looked more terrifying in the few posters and wallpapers I saw earlier . Ramu 's favorite Nisha Kothari did a fantastic job in Sarkar because she did n't have many dialogs ( in fact none if I remember clearly ) . She opened her mouth in this movie , and has found a place in history . The new guy playing Jai 's role seems to have that brash look , but did n't manage Jai 's role at all . I ca nt go on ... I m sorry ... my pain is too big for me to manage right now.<br /><br />I promised myself throughout the movie that I will watch the original Sholay once more just to see that it is still there.<br /><br />Bottom Line : Horrible movie . The media and critics are going to cook Ramu 's goose . And just to remind all readers once more , I am one of the biggest Ramu fans , and even I ca nt spare him for this act .
0 Ram Gopal Verma has proved himself as a very innovative and competent director . He had done a remake / reworking of Godfather with Sarkar , and succeeded tremendously . Ditto for Lolita which he made as Nishaabd.<br /><br />Sholay is been the movie he repeatedly says has inspired him the most . Unfortunately , he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake.<br /><br />The acting ranged from decent to very good , with Amitabh Bachchan being suitably menacing as the villain Babban.<br /><br />The songs were awful and forgettable . The Mehbooba Mehbooba song came off as a second rate music video.<br /><br />The worst part was the pacing , and the dialogues - which were forgettable.<br /><br />Watching the movie in a theatre , I found myself waiting for the intermission , and then for the ending . Some viewers were wise not to wait , and were seen leaving throughout the duration of the film . Ultimately , one of the worst movies made by Ram Gopal Verma .
0 This so called remake is terrible . I went to see this tonight .. on the first day as the anticipation and hype was too much for me to handle . But within the first half an hour , we knew that this is a disaster . It not only does not match the hype created but also insults the original blockbuster . The script had loopholes , the editing was untidy quite a few times . Mohanlal who is an excellent actor did an okay job . Amitabh was alright .. the director wanted to portray how evil his character is but he went a bit overboard which resulted in it being forceful . Ajay who is especially smooth in these kind of roles was also a disappointment . Lets not even get started about the new guy Prashant .. one would n't be proud to start off a career with something like this . Rajpal Yadav who was thrown in for a few laughs could n't even get a smile out of anyone because of his forceful humor and the shrill voice . Nisha Kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today . All in all , RGV who I thought was one of the most talented and gifted directors India has had .. failed miserably . He took up such a huge challenge and responsibility to remake what is known as the best Hindi movie ever and made a mess out of it .
0 If you have seen the Sholay of 1975 , Do n't watch this movie . If you have NOT seen the Sholay of 1975 , Go WATCH IT . But do not watch this movie . This movie has all the ingredients that could possibly have gone wrong with making a remake of Sholay . < br /><br />Amitabh ' Babban ' Bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain to the best ( Probably the only 40 mins of the reel that should n't be burnt ) . If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh play around with his character , it would still be worth a watch . But as Insp . Narsimha , Mohanlal does n't do justice to his talent . Ajay Devgan(Heero ) is extremely mundane and the only reason i think , they cast Prashant Raj in the role of Raj is because he has a striking resemblance to Amitabh of his young days . Sushmita Sen carries herself well , with grace and make - up . But the award for the " WORST performance and any role till date " must go to Nisha Kothari . She manages to degrade her acting to such levels that even high - school drama would would outshine her performance.<br /><br />If you have a mortal enemy , take him to this movie . :)
0 If the scale went negative I would be happier . Seeing Sushmita Sen was nice , and Nisha Kothari has a bright future but the producer and the director ruined any and all enjoyment in this story . The choice of angles , choice of lighting and well everything distracted from trying to remember what is the story . Oh , if the songs and dances have n't caused you to rip your ears off your head , first . The film could have been made twice at 1.25 hours , and been pretty good , kinda like " Seven Samurai " but the director and writer did n't go that direction , even if the " townsfolk " finally find their backbone and want to help . This movie fails on so many levels : editing , writing , photography angles , style , lighting , script - name any aspect of this film - it was BAD - probably the food from the caterer was bad too . I have never in 6 years of watching Indian ( Bollywood ) movies seen something this badly made .
0 What 's happening to RGV ? He seems to repeat himself in every movie . Has he run out of creative ideas ? If he has , time to take a back seat . Went to see the movie with great anticipation - of course not once did I imagine it would be anywhere near the original . I knew it would n't , the promos said it all . But even then I thought it would be a great RGV treat , after all is n't he the same guy who directed Sathya and Company ? Or is he ? I have my doubts after watching Aag . I am not going to talk about the plot or the story , as most of it is taken from the original , if you are really dying to go and see this one , you could play a fun game with friends : identify the scenes from the original one and give ratings of your own ! So Veeru becomes Heero ( how corny is that ? ) , guess Heeru would n't sound that great . Ajay Devgan is quite a disaster as Heero , the comedy is strained and the slurred talk that really was effective in Company sounds fake . The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo ( Nisha Kothari ) does n't exists at all . In fact the more charming Nisha tries to be the more irritating she becomes . This reaches a peak by the end . Raj is in fact not bad as compared to the others , he is a guy to watch in the future . I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban , he looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh . There is a scene where he is drinking something from a bowl all covered in a shawl , instead of inspiring fear he looks like a beggar with his bowl . The only performance that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Inspector Narasimha . I am afraid I do n't have the patience to write more .
0 i saw the film and i got screwed , because the film was foolish and boring . i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled " sholay " . the cast and crew was bad . the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle . amithab bachan 's acting is poor , i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year , sure . nobody did justice to their work , including Ajay devagan . this film do n't deserve any audiences . i bet that this film will flop . < br /><br />"FINALLY THIS MOVIE SUCKS "
0 this is the first time I 'm writing a comment on a movie on IMDb . but i had to write it for this one . its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture . from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gon na be bad . the acting is pathetic . I 'm a big fan of Ajay devgan ( loved him in bhagat singh ) but he is at his worst in this movie . amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one , but somehow the fear is missing . prashant raj is a non actor . and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari . i have no clue why the director took her in this movie . the background score is repetitive . somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar , the color theme , the background score , the camera angles , but it did n't work . PLEASE Do n't WATCH IT
0 This film was absolutely ... ugh i ca n't find the word oh wait ... crap ! I mean when it started i was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring . I nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that i caught a late showing because it was utter filth . Ram Gopal Varma has tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original Sholay i mean what was he thinking doing a remake . What was he trying to do ? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the awards next year like he did for Black ? Ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at . What was Amitabh doing ? He 's destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid films . First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now this i mean he s got to gather a bit of his money and move as far away from Bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and I 'm telling you he 's already past half his way . I mean all this is really good for the other actors like Shah Rukh Khan who 's getting a really good name now because of the recent downfall of Amitabh . I never really liked him because he thinks he 's God and i just knew Abhishek was going to be in that movie . < br /><br />If you want to save your ¬£ 17.75 and spend it on something good go watch Heyy Babyy because that 's just the funniest movie ever and it 's number one in the charts !
0 First of all sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie ( nothing less than this available ) . The film fails in every department be it screenplay , direction , characterization or acting . < br /><br />1 ) To start with , the name of the movie is really C class ( though the movie itself match up to the name ) . 2 ) Amitabh Bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character . 3 ) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has reward of 50,000 on him ( which was convincing ) . Here in Aag the figure was 100 crores for Babban ( Amitabh Bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero 's and had only few men bikes to commute ( with all automatic guns ) . Making a Sholay like movie in Mumbai type setup in modern time does n't look convincing . 4 ) As for Nisha Kothari , somebody needs to tell her that she does n't know acting . Why is Ram Gopal Verma casting her again and again ? 5 ) Mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do . 6 ) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie . 7 ) Legendry role played by Lila Misra ( Mausi of Basanti ) in Sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some Gangu Mummy . Ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie . Enough of stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag . 8) Should not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru .. pathetic to the greatest extent.<br /><br />To summarize , I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic . Please do n't waste money and time on this movie . I think watching Aap Ka Surror ( which I thought was the worst movie possible ) would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters , bad songs and miserable direction.<br /><br />Thanks , Saurabh
0 I , like many other Bachchan fans , having been eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay . This movie was not it . Thank god they did n't let them use the name " Sholay " in the movie title . Ram Gopal 's remake is not worthy of the title . The camera work , the locations , the costumes , the totally out - of - place dancing , the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie I have ever seen . You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast . The only non - paid actor , the ant , was the only resemblance to the first movie . Abishek 's role was totally ridiculous , did he need money to pay for the wedding to Ash ? Save your money , your mind and your time , do n't bother with this movie or the DVD when that comes out .
0 Something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot . The movie , that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema , fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making . The best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning , that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistake.<br /><br />The editing is poor . Direction is crap . Acting is out of this world(omg ) ! The characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes.<br /><br />I would n't watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it .
0 I ca n't come up with appropriate enough words to describe the horror I felt sitting in that cinema watching Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag , the director 's half - hearted attempt to pay tribute to that classic Bollywood western , Sholay . The biggest problem with Varma 's remake is that he does n't even try to make a credible film . It 's evident in every single frame of this movie that Varma 's heart is just not in it . What you see on screen is a bad joke at best , a gimmick on the part of the filmmaker , and it pains you to see what little regard he actually shows for a film he claims he 's been a fan of all his life . I've seen several bad films over the years , but I ca n't remember one that 's been as much of a torture to sit through as this one . Consider yourself very brave if you 're able to survive the entire film , because it tests your patience like few films have before . Varma may borrow his plot and characters from the original film , but his version is trite and hollow and does n't have any of the spirit and energy of Sholay . Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag is actually a mockery of that timeless gem because it turns out to be everything that the original film was not - way - over - the - top , too - long - too - boring , and entirely mindless . Much - loved moments from Sholay are parodied by Varma and for that you want to wring his neck . One of the most memorable scenes in Sholay in which Dharmendra as Veeru climbs up the watertank and threatens to jump down to his death is turned around in this film with Ajay Devgan playing Hero , pulling a pistol to his head threatening to shoot himself . How you wish he 'd pulled the trigger and spared us all the agony . Not only does Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag fail as a remake of Sholay , it 's a pretty bad effort even as a stand - alone film . The eardrum - damaging background score sounds more like someone clanging vessels in the kitchen , and the camera - work alternates between dramatic and head - spinning . Partners in this terrible crime of bringing this ridiculous film to screen are the film 's mostly dead - as - wood actors . Sushmita Sen as Devi the widow takes both her role and the film too seriously , punctuating her lines with pauses , staring into camera for effect , and generally performing like her life depends upon it . Mohanlal as Narsimha , struggles with his Hindi dialogue and looks embarrassed to be delivering some of the stupidest lines in his illustrious career . Newcomer Prashant Raj playing Jai - equivalent Raj has no acting chops to speak of and ca n't strum up any of the brooding intensity Amitabh Bachchan brought to the part in the original film . As Hero , the new - age Veeru , Ajay Devgan is entirely hopeless , failing miserably in his attempts at comedy . But the film 's weakest link , easily the most shocking casting decision is Nisha Kothari as Ghunghroo , who steps into the shoes of Hema Malini as Basanti , the endearing airhead from Sholay . Nisha Kothari is not only the worst actress in this country , but possibly the worst actress in this whole wide world , she gives the word annoying a whole new meaning , and she makes you want to slit your wrists every time she 's on screen . And then , there is Amitabh Bachchan playing Babban Singh , Ramgopal Varma 's version of Hindi cinema 's most popular villain Gabbar Singh . The only actor in this ensemble who recognises the film 's over - the - top tone and plays along accordingly , Bachchan constructs a menacing character who is a treat to watch . He 's meant to be a comic book villain who snarls and sneers and hisses and hams , and he does all of that to good effect . But because he 's trapped in such a doomed enterprise , his performance does n't really help elevate the film in any way . No surprises here , I 'm going with zero out of ten and two thumbs down for Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag , it one 's of those painful movie - watching experiences you would n't subject even an enemy to . It 's not like Varma has n't handled a remake before . With Sarkar he gave us a smart , gripping take on The Godfather , and it 's a pity he 's made this Sholay bhature out of such a much - loved classic . Ramgopal Varma Ki Aag is his worst career decision ever , it 's also a dark spot on his resume he 'll be embarrassed of forever . I suspect this film will go down in movie history as Ramgopal Varma Ka Daag .
0 This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in the cinema ! ! Could not wait for it to end . To make matters worse it is given a 12A certificate so you do not see anyone getting shot , just bodies slumping to the ground , even Babban getting killed was cut out ! ! ! Too many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers as I think the makers knew it would flop disastrously ! ! Amitabhs acting was great but that ' Basanti ' wannabe and the other idiot who plays Devgans mate ca n't even act . Devgan was wasted!!<br /><br />I would not watch this for free again and I advise all others who read this to do just the same YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED ! !
0 OVERALL PERFORMANCE : - At last the long waiting AAG hits the screens . Unfortunately , it could n't set progressive fire in the audience . The first best thing to talk about the movie is The idea of remaking the mighty SHOLAY . And Varma made a nice choice of changing the total backdrop of the movie . If he repeated the same Ramghad backdrop , people will again say there is nothing new in this . Different background is appreciative but the way he presented it is not worthy . Right from the start of his career with SIVA in Telugu , he had been using the same lighting and kind of background . I seriously dunno this guy Varma considers about lighting or not or may be he has no other lighting technique other than like gordon willis GODFATHER . It 's all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH . Why would some body use so many Dutch angles and extreme closeup shots ! ! ! ! ! ! ! The shot division is lame . Characters could n't carry an emotion , performances are not to their mark , Storytelling is worse , Background is really really terrible.<br /><br />Babban:- Amitabhz been over prioritized to his job . VARMA produced great villains like Bikumatre , Bhavtakur Das , Mallik Bhai but this time he failed in carving the all time best characters of Hindi Cinema . There 's no comparison of Gabbar with Babban . Babban is a more psycho rather than a villain , still he has a soft corner for his brother ( It 's a gift in this movie ) . Amitabhz performance is not to his mark . His appearance itself is pathetic . The scar on his nose , symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema . What ever they worked on Babban is not successful . Babban is no comparison with Gabbar.<br /><br />Narsimha:- The first best thing about this character is not to put audience in suspense about his hands . If varma did that , it would be like teaching ABCD to a Bachelor degree holder . Itz good he opened the secret early . But the flashback is pathetic . Varma could n't use a great actor like mohanlal to his mark.<br /><br />Durga:- The only character with betterment . This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to the story.<br /><br />Heroo , Raj , Ghunguroo:- No body bothers or at least considers these character . The utter failure of movie starts when director could not work on the close friendship between our heroz . These characters carry nothing to this movie.<br /><br />RAMGOPALVARMA:- His quality is degrading , diminishing . AAG totally can be treated as a C grade movie . Sholay is a fire of revenge , problem of a town , meaning for true friendship and highly appreciated nuisance and fun by Dharmendra . AAG never carried an emotion with its characters . Storytelling is too weak that it could not make audience feel sympathy for the characters . Do n't compare AAG with sholay , still u will not like it.<br /><br />If you dare watch this movie . You will be burnt alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
0 Truly shows that hype is not everything . Shows by and by what a crappy actor abhishek is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife . Amitabh as always is solid . Ajay Devgan as always is shitty and useless and the new guy is a joke . The leading lady is such a waste of an actor . Such pathetic movie from such a revered director and from such a big industry . With movies as such I have decreased the amount of bollywood movies I watch.<br /><br />RGV has been making very crappy movies for a while now . Time to get different actors . Hrithek anyone ? Bollywood needs Madhuri and Kajol back . Every other leading lady is a half - naked wanna be . Pffffft .
0 I must tell you right up front , I am certainly NOT an authority on Bollywood films and have only seen a handful . However , if you 've never seen one , DON'T start with this one ! I have greatly enjoyed the ones I 've seen up until this one , but I just could n't stand this one . I also must tell you up front that I could not finish this film -- it was that annoying . So why was it so annoying ? < br /><br />1 . There is a character named ' Rambha ' in the film . He is even more annoying than Jar - Jar Binks -- which I never would have believed would have been possible . He is so # @^ ! # annoying ! ! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think was meant to be comic relief . Instead , he just grated on my nerves and wanted him to die ... slowly ! His voice , his mannerisms and his obnoxiousness -- he just did n't seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in -- and he needed to die ! < br /><br />2 . The heroes had the amazing ability to dodge AK-47 bullets with ease . I kid you not -- there was a scene where several unarmed guys took on a small army of guys with these assault rifles ! ! And , again and again , they avoided taking a single bullet AND beat up the ruffians ! ! ! This made Stallone 's actions in " Rambo II " look mundane ! ! < br /><br />3 . The film was so gosh - darn loud , in your face and intense -- it practically made my brain bleed ! ! It was as if the film were made by people under the influence of meth ! ! Crazy camera angles , INTENSE music and action , action , action ... this movie is clearly designed for someone who ca n't take a movie with plot and wants nearly 100 % action.<br /><br />4 . The two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sense ... none whatsoever ! < br /><br />Perhaps if you are the most ardent action and Bollywood fan you can stand this film , but as for me I can see why it 's on IMDb 's infamous Bottom 100 list . Wow ... this film is bad AND intensely bad ! !
0 Once in a while in Indian cinema there comes along a movie like Sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie . And den just once in a while(hopefully ) we have a RGV ki Aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own . A standard so low , it can never be broken . Ram Gopal varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish so stale u can smell it from a distance . To take a classic like Sholay and assassinate it is totally unforgivable and I ca n't believe he almost called the movie RGV ki Sholay . Although Sholay had a lot of folklore elements in it , the movie managed to build on its plot by merely defining the characters so distinctively that they lived on forever . What Aag does is take these characters and mess them up so badly u'll need a contest to pick the worst . The realism element is totally missing and what the movie ends up providing is a bunch of " actors " parading along in a plot less and seemingly unrelated set of events . One star for this film is a ridiculous waste of a vote . its time for RGV to wake up to the reality of his failure and conjure up another " different " plot that can be categorized under cinema .
0 Sholay : Considered to be one of the greatest films . I always wondered if they would ever remake being the classic it is . That was the time RGV announced this movie and I was somewhat excited to see it . I always thought that maybe this will be a good movie , but every week we would here RGV change something . And the movie is a very B - Grade movie , something that I had not hoped.<br /><br />I really tried looking for positives , but I promised to keep Sholay out of my mind . The cinematography is awesome . The movie tries to be its own . But that is the up side . The action sequences are weak . The screenplay had potential . The biggest flaw is editing . None of the scenes excite you . For example , the comedy sequences felt very out of place and forced . Ironic because comedy was just as entertaining in the original . And none of the characters are developed . And no scenes will linger until the end . And the ending was very disappointing.<br /><br />The biggest question is acting . Amitabh Bachchan was good as Gabbar Singh , nothing great . It seemed as if they concentrated too much on his look , that the character only looks menacing , but you do n't get creeped out . Mohanlal is barely in the movie , but he impresses in his few scenes . Ajay Devgan was decent . It was n't so much the performance , he gave it his all , it was the weak script . Prashant Raj is very confident , and has potential to make it far with better movies.<br /><br />I had most expectations for Sushmita Sen , who was probably the best of the lot . She was expressive , but this still was not enough . Nisha Kothari surprised me . She seemed disinterested for the most part , but her emotional scene after her friend 's death was quite good . Seems as if she needs to find a director who will help her talent , not her cute looks . But what disappointed me most was chemistry . Ajay Devgan and Prashant Raj did n't look like friends . Ajay - Nisha were not a strong couple . No passion was to be found between Sushmita and Prashant . And Amitabh and Mohanlal did not the hateful passion they needed.<br /><br />As for songs , they pretty much suck . Urmila 's Mehbooba was too overblown and I pretty much slept through it . It was however nicely danced . The Holi number was enjoyable , but not memorable . Same went for the other songs . For someone who looked forward to this movie , I was heavily disappointed . I had high hopes for RGV because of his Jungle , but seems as if he lost his talent during the shooting of this movie . But hopefully he regains his talent for Sarkar Raj . But this movie is best forgotten . All the positives still do not make up for the boring movie it is .
0 Iam a Big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma but i could not believe that he made this movie . i was really disappointed.<br /><br />Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag does n't come anywhere close to the real Sholay . It does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer . Ram Gopal Varma fails to create chemistry between the characters . There is no camaraderie between Heero(Ajay Devgan ) and Raj(Prashant raj ) . There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together . The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is remarkable . Amitabh Bachchan should not have done this movie . Ajay and Sushmita sen was trying their best but no use . Rajpal Yadav 's voice modulation - ineffective and rather pointless . Mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language . Rest of the cast was below expectation . The comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movie.<br /><br />Ram Gopal Varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this Aag . But there is no fire .
0 I downloaded this movie yesterday through an internet site the Quality was kinda good ! I was watching the movie with high expectations ( though i knew it was a flop ) , especially as the film has superstar Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of a villain . I though at least actors like him would have done some worth to their roles . But unfortunately Mr Bachchan failed to impress as villain this proved that nobody can compete AMJAD KHAN 's magic Rgv 's trial to re - kindle the past backfired royally ! Sholay , the old one is a milestone in Indian cinema with an all - star cast , cult dialogue , stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack which is still a hit with present generations too . A good actor like Ajay Devgan 's TALENTS ARE wasted and his performance was average . Prashant Raj , a newcomer does n't know what acting is . Nisha Kothari proved she is one of the worst actresses we have I do n't know how she is still in RGV 's crew Urmila & Abhishek seen in a song with no excitement and passion Mohanlal tried his best and Susmitha Sen 's work was good i somehow liked her work in this movie It was a Total carnage of the original Sholay
0 In a variant of Sholay , Ram Gopal Verma ventures into what can be called an unknown territory where the blockbuster takes a new shape . The Thakur goes south . Mohanlal as Narsimha the police inspector whose family has been killed seeks vengeance Madrasi style . The accent is totally South Indian in contrast to Thakur from the north . The severing of the hands of Thakur by Gabbar is also cut down to the fingers in Aag . So make up costs are cut down because there is no effort to hide the hands instead only a long shouldered Kurta covers up for the cut fingers . Moreso in the climax where the Thakur uses his legs and says"Tere Liye to mere paer hi kaafi hai " here Narsimha uses his finger stubs to fire a gun and kill the villain . Babban , the new avtar of gabbar is also different . He is not from Bihar or UP . He is Bambaiya . Gabbar 's infamous laugh is also in two instalments this time and is more subdued . Babban asks for Diwali instead of Holi and romances Urmila the replacement of Helen in Mehbooba . he also dances and enjoys dancing with Abhisheh who plays Jalal Agha in Mehbooba . Babban is more intelligent this time . He tosses the apple and asks the question that made Isaac Newton discover laws of gravitation . Basanti is more verbose than the Auto driver Ghungroo . Nisha Kothari can not play the auto driver and looks too artificial using words like ' entertain ' and ' too much ' with gay abandon . Viru was fun whereas Ajay Devgun is a misfit for the role . The God Speaks to Basanti incident and the shooting lessons and the Koi Haseena song and the water tank sequences are painful . The water tank turns into a well and the drunk Devgun is so bad in the sequence that the audience would have wanted him to commit suicide . Jai was composed and serious . Prashant Raj is better than the others because we do not expect anything from him . But he also bungles on the Mausi sequence . He is not as romantic as Jai with the mouth organ . Jaya 's role played by Sushmita changes careers . A pure housewife turns into a doctor this time plunging into full time social service after her husband is killed . She too lacks the pain that Jaya displayed . Her flirtations with Jai are more open this time . Samba gets a bigger role this time as Tambe . He does not have to point guns and answer questions of Gabbar this time . He follows Babban wherever he goes and is a bodyguard with more visibility outside the den . Horses give way to Jeeps and auto . The Gabbar 's hideout here keeps changing and Ramgarh becomes Kaliganj . All in all it is more of a spoof than anything else . RGV comes up with his own interpretation of the classic . But we remember the original so well even after three decades that our minds refuse to accept stylized versions and changed dialogues . So we call it a spoof . So Mr . RGV(Sholay ) and Farhan Akhtar ( Don ) and JPDutta(Umrao jaan ) stop making remixes and start making originals .
0 This movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop . Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie " Sholay " , but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and ... i guess leave all the good parts of the movie ( acting , script , songs , music , comedy , action etc ) out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew . Waste of money , waste of time . After making movies like Rangeela , Satya , and Company he pulled a Coppola ( Godfather ) on us ; What were you thinking RGV ? Anyways , the story is , though hard to follow , is almost like the Old sholay . Ajay Devgan playing Heero ( Beeru , sholay ) and Ajay , new kid on the block playing Ajay ( Jay , sholay ) . Both " bad yet funny " friends help a cop capture a bad guy first . Later in the movie , now Retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan . In case you have n't been watching Bollywood movies , the Good guys win in the end . There I just saved you 3 precious hours of your life !
0 I can not say that Aag is the worst Bollywood film ever made , because I have n't seen every Bollywood film , but my imagination tells me that it could well be.<br /><br />This film seems like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director , and I for one be believe he has been successful in his mission . No A - list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humiliation this film is bound to carry with it.<br /><br />But lets not just blame the director here , there is the cinematographer , who looks like he 's rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year award . There is the over dramatic score , that hopes to carry you to the next scene . The lighting man , who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light bulb on pole in the other , and hoping that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene . And , of course the actors ! Some of them are by no means newcomers , else all could be forgiven here . The ensemble of actors in Aag were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re - make of India 's most loved movie of all time , ' Sholay ' . One must not forget that these actors were not forced in to this film , they are A - list and willing participants to something that , let 's face it would surely have had high and eager public expectation ? ? ? So it begs the question , Amitabh aside ( for now ) , did the other actors really believe their performances even attempted to better the original ? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of a film ? Do n't be stupid , of course he did n't , this was a demonstration to the public of how much money talks hence can make actors walk.<br /><br />I truly hope everyone involved is satisfied with what is truly a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film , which only succeeds in polluting everyone 's mind when they watch the original .
0 its a gem movie if anyone who has n't seen movie sholey he ca nt understand what is going on there . a thakur call men for catching a big terrorist who is like god and even police do n't know abut him but these ppl do.<br /><br />biggest advantage of film is its speed u never know what is going on and the part is completed . actors are at there best of worst acting and actress is here for time - pass of songs . and what u ca nt forget is the cool dialouge which seems to come in very long time but u ca nt understand them so easily try hard for that and last word i have n't seen movie complete due to a brain roast so plz tell me ditz end if it have
0 Not as bad as some are making it out to be , though obviously pathetic compared to the original . In my opinion Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh - try not to compare to Gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect . Other than some mediocre action scenes however , the rest of the film is flawed . Character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless , with many loopholes , and missing pieces of information which i would n't have known if i had n't read the back of the DVD case . The worst part of the movie was the support roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude called Prashant Raj . Nisha is just plain annoying from the time her lips first open . As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy ? where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than to serve drinks ? . His acting ability is zero and he has the same tone , dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene , whether it be action , comedy , or even a scene when someone has just died . Ajay Devgan was average , at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion . overall , RGV 's Aag is worth watching for Amitabh 's solid performance , and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance .
0 Please Do n't hate me but i have to be honest , watching this movie , i had a lot of fun,,<br /><br />It 's a Movie with a Stupid Cast and Stupid Songs!!!<br /><br />Unnecessary songs ! ! !

0 Designed only to annoy ( or amuse ) any self - respecting intelligent person . If the director 's intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character , then it would have been okay , but I know that there is no such thing as a Hollywood director who 'd make a critique of America 's pro - Marxist 60s movement , especially not a filmmaker from the 70s . There is so much idiotic dialog going on here , that sometimes I wondered if I was n't actually watching a comedy . You would n't be at fault for thinking that this is a satire ¬ñ that 's how na√Øve the movie appears . Spacek has been in her share of Leftist movies which brings me to the obvious , inescapable conclusion that the redhead hick is one of those Hollywood liberal morons . But , I mean , are n't they all ? Nice boobs , but s**t for brains .
0 The first one was the best . The second one sucked because the dialog was terrible . Although , the storyline was n't so bad ( in fact , all story lines are good and bad ) . Throughout the movie , I dosed off a few times . I know that Jackie Chan is a great martial arts expertise , but not a good actor in Rush Hour 2 . Chris Tucker , too , was n't good . And Zhang Ziyi , what can I say , a few lines , terrible acting ( But that 's based on her script ) . All the characters there were not that good . But , some of the things I like in Rush Hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes . I know that Jackie Chan does n't do those things which is good for him .

0 For the life of me I ca n't figure out why anyone would make a movie like this . The plot is tired , the acting is strained , the language is consistently foul and at times the over use of the " F " word seemed like a lack of dialog was prevalent so ' let 's throw in another couple of " F 's " for good measure , that 's what the American public wants to hear ' . Gossett was particularly foul and seemed to enjoy his part . Forget this c__p , rent ' Shrek " and have a good laugh .
0 I can see why Laurel and Hardy purists might be offended by this rather gentle ' re - enactment ' , but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classic L & H. Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain acquit themselves reasonably as the comedy duo and there 's a reasonably good supporting cast . I enjoyed it .
0 Yowza ! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it , you 're a better person than me ! This movie , while a great attempt at ' imitating ' Laurel and Hardy through appearance , sound and routine , falls very short of honoring them , or even being a movie of any substance . I blame Larry Harmon . Dialogue is torn from old L+H movies and planted in unrealistically , the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co - stars , Pinchot 's accent was bizarre for Stan , and while Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie 's accent , he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy . Where was a ( good ) musical number ? Editing is choppy , acting is stiff , lines are horrid , physics are -implausable- ( although perhaps they were TRYING to give it that feel of cheap sets ? ) , and overall it 's a terrible thing to witness . It 's even more painful to watch than ATOLL K , where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950 's era writing and photography . Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can , and learn how things WERE . You know what a MAGNATE is , do n't you ? Stan Laurel did not perpetually reply with semi - moronic quips at every sentence.<br /><br />I pity anyone who thinks that THIS was a decent update / honor of the boys . Where was THE CLASSIC THEME SONG ? ! ? Why ruin ' Here 's another fine mess ' ? Why skip ' any the wiser ' ? Why was there a pointless gaggle of co - stars ? ! WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ ? ? ? ? WHY MUST LARRY HARMON BE IN IT ? WHY BOZO ! ? And did THE LEARNING CHANNEL help fund the thing?<br /><br />I mean , really . Fart jokes , for God 's sake.<br /><br />FART JOKES .
0 Who was George C. Scott ? George C. Scott was a renowned actor . Practically any movie that he 's been in is the better off for it . Now ol' George had absolutely NOTHING to do with this movie ... , but he once said something that describes said movie to a T.<br /><br />I do n't recall his exact words , but he basically said that Great Writing can Save Bad Acting , But Great Acting CanNOT save Bad Writing . Never has this little observation been truer than in " The All New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy : For Love or Mummy".<br /><br />The casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect . Bronson Pinchot ( Laurel ) and Gailard Sartain ( Hardy ) not only look the parts , but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal ( mannerisms and all ) . This movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents . That said , this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to ( you guessed it ) WRITING.<br /><br />Aside from the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain ( which was very " in character " ) and a brief gag involving a taxi , this movie is an absolute chore to sit through.<br /><br />PROBLEM # 1 : Too much time and effort went into the plot.<br /><br />I do n't want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty British lady . What I WANT is to see Stan and Ollie ( or at least , their stand - ins ) . Way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not - very - funny secondary characters that said plot revolved around.<br /><br />However , even if this movie had been all jokes , that would still leave us with ... <br /><br /> ... PROBLEM # 2 : Most of the jokes are what I would call " watered - down " slapstick . < br /><br />What do I mean by " watered down"?<br /><br />In slapstick , a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect ( ala Looney Tunes , 3 Stooges ... ,or how about Laurel & Hardy?).<br /><br />In " watered - down " slapstick ( as I define it ) , a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced , and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect.<br /><br />Maybe an illustration would help:<br /><br />In Looney Tunes , Daffy Duck gets shot by Elmer Fudd . His bill falls off and he puts it back on . That is classic slapstick.<br /><br />In this " gem " , Ollie accidentally bumps into some people . They turn around , tell him to be careful , and continue on their merry way . That 's not slapstick . That 's not even funny . That 's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes . It 's as though they 're this movie 's bread and butter . The writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they 're supposed to be funny . Granted , the example I just gave is the most extreme case , but I can only cut it so much slack.<br /><br />Long story short : The film just does n't work because the script fails to capitalize on Pinchot 's and Sartain 's abilities to impersonate Stan and Ollie . Instead , the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes . Watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with.<br /><br />Not a good movie , but an incredible sleeping aid.<br /><br />I say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal ( just so long as you steer clear of " Atoll K " and " Be Big " ) .
0 This " film " is a travesty . No , wait -- an abomination . NO , WAIT -- this is without a doubt the absolute WORST film ever made featuring beloved characters created and established by other actors.<br /><br />I thought " Inspector Clouseau " with Alan Arkin ( ! ) instead of Peter Sellers was ludicrous and sacrilegious , but even daring to " remake " Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy is asinine and money grubbing.<br /><br />Mr . Laurel and Mr. Hardy have been dead , respectively , since 1957 and 1965 . Why anyone would even begin to imagine that suitable updates for L & H would be in the persona of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain is beyond me . I tuned in fully expecting to be horrified and embarrassed and I certainly was n't disappointed . Everyone involved in this pathetic , moronic , disgrace should be blackballed from anything and everything associated with Hollywood and film - making . AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS -- YOU HAVE BEEN DULY WARNED .
0 This is far worse than those awful Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 60s . They were terrible , but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then Stan and Ollie resurgence . New audiences had rediscovered the pair 's comedic genius and the cartoons were mind - numbing garbage geared to cash in on children 's interest . It was to be expected . But , how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of ... I ca n't even think of a word . I 'm sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival , but you ca n't inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing . The impressionists ( I hesitate to call them actors ) do a Vegas act and that 's where it belongs . The plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days , trying to stretch out two - reel ideas for a feature . If this film was someone 's first exposure to the REAL Laurel and Hardy , I 'm sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo 's reputation as senility gone amok . The only movie I hate worse than this is I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE . And , you know , these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to Stan and Ollie .
0 This is the kind of film one watches in gape - jawed , horrified silence , and yet continues to watch , mesmerized , as if watching a train wreck in slow motion . And yet , in the back of your mind , thoughts are churning : " Who on EARTH green - lighted this garbage?" < br /><br />Some of the preceding user comments say things like , " A good way to introduce children to Laurel and Hardy " -- an insult to children everywhere . That children would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows a profound misunderstanding of the nature of children the world over . Others have commented on the faithfulness of the two stars ' characterizations of Laurel and Hardy to which I would respond : so WHAT ? One would think that the rash of movie BOMBS based on beloved series ( Rocky and Bullwinkle , Avengers , Flipper , Mod Squad , ad nauseam ) would have taught Hollywood that there are some things that simply ca n't be recreated . The films of Laurel and Hardy are readily available on video : why bother with this?<br /><br />As for F. Murray Abraham , a fine actor of stage and screen ... well , all I can say is , he must have been in trouble with the IRS.<br /><br />Run , do n't walk , away from the television if this trash comes on !
0 I put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home , because I had packed away all their toys . ( Toddlers do n't like to watch " Regis and KAthie Lee " or " The View . " ) My four year old found one scene funny , but told me the rest of it was " too silly . " This is a FOUR YEAR OLD , folks . Anyone over the age of , say , nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out.<br /><br />To say this movie is bad is like saying the Holocaust was a little mistake . There are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this " film " truly is . The acting is bad , the plot is stupid , and the script is pathetically unfunny . Since this is supposed to be a comedy , the fact that you can not even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse . Bronson " Balki " Pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent ( Irish - Pakistani - Bronx - Cockney - Cajun as far as I could tell ) , but all the characters are awful . I have n't watched a real Laurel and Hardy film in ages , but I KNOW that they HAD to be way better than this . What is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with ... this?<br /><br />Bottom line : derivative garbage . Avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky Bronson Pinchot fetish . 2/10
0 I have seen most , if not all of the Laurel & Hardy classic films . I have always enjoyed there comical stupidly , even after watching it over and over again . This new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both Laurel & Hardy , however fails miserably for various reasons . One of which is how out of place their cloths are ( still early 20th century ) however are both portrayed in the 90 's setting . Some of the former dialogue was brought back , however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series . This film could very well be the worst film I have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever . The real Laurel & Hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation .
0 Even if it were remotely funny , this mouldy waxwork of a film would still be soberingly disrespectful . Stopping just short of digging up the boys ' corpses and re - enacting ' Weekend At Bernie 's ' ¬ñ but only just ¬ñ producer Larry Harmon and the director of the frickin ' ' Ernest ' films use holding the copyright as an excuse to crap all over Stan and Ollie 's legacy . Gailard Sartain does a fair Ollie impersonation but Bronson Pinchot would n't reach tenth place in a Stan lookalike contest ; even if they were both spot on the film would be no less detestable . The less said about the surrounding catastrophe the better . Makes ' Utopia ' look like a dignified swan song .
0 Brief summary : This movie demeans everyone it touches . That means you.<br /><br />First off , let me say I 'm not a purist , and this might have been funny for a few minutes . The impersonations are not bad . But overall it 's just dull and excruciatingly not funny . A few simple jokes are repeated over and over again.<br /><br />It 's clear that this movies only exists to squeeze the last few dollars out of the now - trademarked Laurel and Hardy . The producers can not have any real regard for their place in film history , or their talents . This is what offended me the most.<br /><br />Of course , my daughter liked it , so I 'm also a failure as a parent ;)
0 That 's the sound of Stan and Ollie spinning in their graves.<br /><br />I wo n't bother listing the fundamental flaws of this movie as they 're so obvious they go without saying . Small things , like this being " The All New Adventures of Laurel and Hardy " despite the stars being dead for over thirty years when it was made . Little things like that . < br /><br />A bad idea would be to have actors playing buffoons whom just happen to be called Laurel and Hardy . As bad as that is , it might have worked . For a really bad idea , try casting two actors to impersonate the duo . Okay , they might claim to be nephews , but the end result is the same.<br /><br />Bronson Pinchot can be funny . Okay , forget his wacky foreigner " Cousin Larry " schtick in Perfect Strangers , and look at him in True Romance . Here though , he stinks . It 's probably not all his fault , and , like the director and the support cast - all of who are better than the material - he was probably just desperate for money . There are those who claim Americans find it difficult to master an effective English accent . This cause is not helped here by Pinchot . What is Stan ? Welsh ? Iranian ? Pakistani ? Only in Stan 's trademark yelp does he come close , though as the yelp is overdone to the point of tedium that 's nothing to write home about . Gailard Sartain does slightly better as Ollie , though it 's like saying what 's worse - stepping in dog dirt or a kick in the knackers ? < br /><br />Remember the originals with their split - second timing , intuitive teamwork and innate loveability ? Well that 's absent altogether , replaced with two stupid old men and jokes so mistimed you could park a bus through the gaps . Whereas the originals had plots that could be summed up in a couple of panels , this one has some long - winded Mummy hokum ( and what a lousy title ! ) that 's mixed in with the boys ' fraternity scenario . I ca n't claim to have seen every single one of Laurel and Hardy 's 108 movies , but I think it 's a safe bet that even their nadir was leagues ahead of this.<br /><br />Maybe the major problem is that the originals were sort - of playing themselves , or at least using their own accents . It at least felt natural and unforced , as opposed to the contrived caricatures Pinchot and Sartain are given . And since when did Stan do malapropisms , and so many at that ? " I was gon na give you a standing cremation " ; " I would like to marinate my friend . " Stop it ! < br /><br />Only notable moment is a reference to Bozo the Clown , the cartoon character who shared Larry Harmon 's L & H comic . Harmon of course bought the name copyright ( how disconcerting to see a ¬Æ after Laurel and Hardy ) and was co - director and producer of this travesty . < br /><br />Questions abound . Would Stan and Ollie do fart gags if they were alive today ? Would they glass mummies with broken bottles ? Have Stan being smacked in the genitals with a spear and end on a big CGI - finale ? Let 's hope not.<br /><br />I did laugh once , but I think that was just in disbelief at how terrible it all is . Why was this film made in the first place ? Who did the makers think would like it ? Possibly the worst movie I 've ever seen , an absolute abhorrence I grew sick of watching after just the first five minutes . About as much fun as having your head trapped in a vice while a red - hot poker and stinging nettles are forcibly inserted up your back passage .
0 The reviews I read for this movie were pretty decent so I decided to check it out . BAD IDEA ! This is another movie about a ghost out for revenge against a group friends . The story is stupid , mix two parts Ringu with one part Prom Night , a sprinkle of I Know what you did Last Summer , and add a tiny dash of Single White Female - now blend until completely nonsensical . There is nothing new to this plot , and revisiting the clich√©s I 've grown so fond of was n't even entertaining this time . This movie jumps to and from the past too much , and once I made sense of it all I realized it still did n't make much sense . Characters go from sane to psycho killer in the blink of an eye . Speaking of characters , they are all your stereotypical favorites - the greedy selfish lawyer , the egocentric actress , the has - been baseball star , the video voyeur , the bitter girl , the spooky quiet chick , the ' nicer - than - nice ' nice girl , a freakin ' black cat ... and I did n't care about any of them . Perhaps a better writer could have made the movie work , there were some decent scenes in it , but overall this movie was a mess . I should also mention a certain ' video tape ' that would have been IMPOSSIBLE to shoot . < br /><br />This movie is n't the worst Asian horror has to offer by far , but it is still pretty bad . If you just want to see some creepy images in the dark , or just want to laugh out loud at some over the top acting , or just want to yell " you 're stupid ! " at a movie screen , or just want to have another Asian horror flick up your sleeve when someone asks you how many you 've seen - this movie is for you . < br /><br />Those seeking a decent plot look elsewhere .
0 I 'm afraid that I did n't like this movie very much . Apart from a few saving graces , it 's nothing to write home about . < br /><br />J - horror has boomed for the last five - six years but the films themselves have on more than one account been repetitive and carbon copies of a previous success . This is one of them.<br /><br />Basically this is a supernatural slasher movie . The beginning is promising with chilling scenes from a morgue where a dead girl has her eyes graphically sewn together , but soon after opens them . However , after that , it 's quickly downhill for this flick.<br /><br />To be kind I will start with the things I like about " Gawi " . On the plus side , the visuals are gaudy and the movie looks great for it 's type . For those who like their horror movies gory there are a few nicely executed ( no pun intended ) murder scenes . We also get a few good suspense sequences / set - pieces.<br /><br />However , there are quite a few drawbacks also ... <br /><br />First of all , and my major complaint about this movie , is that the plot skips and jumps forwards and backwards in time with an alarming intensity . Usually that 's not a problem for me , but here , where the students look exactly the same no matter what age they are , I was confused on more than one occasion.<br /><br />The performances are okay I guess ( a little hard to tell when you do n't know the language ) , but seem a little stiff . And for a horror movie , I do n't think it was scary enough . For a while I was quite bored actually.<br /><br />Being a fan of giallo movies , I was expecting quite a lot from " Nightmare " , but unfortunately I was quite disappointed .
0 The following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie : 1 ) Clich√©s abound . Seriously , awful " twists " are everywhere.<br /><br />2 ) The narrative jumps around in time , which would be fine if done well , but it 's not.<br /><br />3 ) Lame characters that do n't develop so much as either remain utterly static , or drastically change for no good reason.<br /><br />4 ) Big one : HORRIBLE ACTING . Over the top from nearly every person.<br /><br />The following are some of the best points from the movie : 1 ) The lead is damn good looking.<br /><br />As I see it , there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie : a ) People who can sit through 90 minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive.<br /><br />b ) People who often think to themselves , " I like Hollywood dreck rife with clich√©s and overacting , but if only I could watch it in Korean ... " There 's a lot of good Korean cinema out there , so why waste your time with garbage ?
0 We see a body of dead girl in a morgue with the coroner trying to close the eyes of the girl , but whatever he tries they wo n't stay open . After this we move into the future and we follow a group of former school friends who hide a terrible secret , but suddenly they start getting picked off one by one in many grisly ways . Through flashbacks we learn of this awful suicide of a shy girl who was trying to be one of the group , but she was shut out by them because they dug up her past and found out some weird occurrences . So , is she back from the grave seeking revenge ? < br /><br />Oh what a great and always spooky story ! Well , that 's what I hoping I could say . And ' hoping ' was as good as it got . This is an forgettable , so - so supernatural horror flick that I actually watched before , but I went in thinking it was my first viewing . So to my surprise it hit me when I started picking up on certain things , but like I said it 's quite a forgettable mix that it felt like a first viewing again . " Nightmare ' is just another type of it 's field that adds a ' few ' changes to the gruel . Oh , please give me something that 's a bit more fresh . It does n't have to be entirely original , but this is one formulaic and at times quite tired J - horror flick . Even though it strings along the usual ghost story involving you guessed right ¬Ö  an evil looking , vengeful chick spirit.<br /><br />But in spite of my negativity of it being the same old , same old story and jolts . This one kind of entertains when its being grisly and popping in some creepy visuals . The deaths are vividly displayed with bite and some originality . While , the gloomy atmosphere alienates the audience with it 's murky lighting . The first scene involving the spirit terrorising one of the girls is one blood - curdling experience , but really when it 's not trying to shock you . I found it rather coma inducing and I thought about getting some shut - eye . That might be harsh , but it just did n't go anywhere of any interest between those shock moments . You could say that because the supposed mystery is really not much of one , the unsure story is just simply flat and the characters are a self - centred bunch that you do n't really care what happens to them . The disjointed story should have focused more on the spirit than that of these bland characters who have one unconvincing group relationship . It just overplayed its cards by becoming overly muddled and taking too long to get going that when it comes to the climax it 's just plain ludicrous . The film 's haunting ending is a high point , though.<br /><br />The film looks fine , although it could have done without the snazzy , quick fire editing and the music score was a bit overbearing in playing up the mood . The performances tread a fine line , but Gyu - ri Kim is strong in the lead role.<br /><br />It 's nothing new and it shamelessly steals ideas , but if you can look past that it delivers some nasty thrills . Although , I found the handling of it rather lethargic , despite the odd effective chills . A standard effort all round I guess , but still it 's equally missable .
0 If you appreciate the renaissance in Asian horror , do n't bother with Gawi . The film scarcely deserves mention alongside A - list work such as Ringu , A Tale of Two Sisters , Cure , and Ju - On ( or even such good material as The Eye or Inner Senses ) . Those films brim with subtleties , unexpected imagery , rich characters , and a decidedly non - Western take on what 's frightening . Gawi is strung together with the leftover limbs and organs of everything that has made American horror lousy for the past twenty - five years.<br /><br />The film tries to blend Asian ghost story and Hollywood slasher flick , but it 's a bad fit . One aesthetic is bound to smother the other ; guess which ? Having no story of their own to tell the filmmakers loot Ringu for an evil - child subplot , but the situation is hopeless . Clich√©s , crap characters , witless plotting , a dull ghost , ho hum .
0 In reviewing this film I can only go by my experiences as a weekend warrior doing my basic training in July , August , and September of 1971 in that garden spot of the earth , Fort Polk , Louisiana . Take the High Ground was not anything like I remember basic training.<br /><br />But one has to remember at the time this was post Korea which ended in a stalemate , but it was a conventional war as we knew them . It was not Vietnam , a jungle guerrilla war where we kept pouring draftees into an endless pit . The draft at that time was an unwelcome , but accepted as still necessary for the country 's defense.<br /><br />Richard Widmark is a veteran of Korea now assigned state side to train the troops to go overseas . The film is about one of his training cycles and the men of the platoon he has to train . They 're the usual kind you would find in just about any war film from the previous decade . < br /><br />One thing I will praise Take The High Ground for is the fact that MGM recognized our army was now an integrated one with the presence of William Hazard as a black recruit in the platoon . It was in keeping with the spirit of the times which were a changing.<br /><br />But I will say that a recruit like Russ Tamblyn would have been cured of his smart mouth from day one . Richard Widmark would have not risked death or becoming a eunuch in order to give Jerome Courtland confidence with a weapon . And no way would have he worried so much about Robert Arthur deserting . He 's have just let the MPs deal with him.<br /><br />Of course being shot in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso , Texas did give Take the High Ground good authenticity . But view it as an army recruiting film and you can certainly understand why the government so eagerly gave cooperation back in the day.<br /><br />I do remember the drill sergeants having their little conflicts which you could pick up on when you were n't worried about them getting on your case for something which was 95 % of the time . But there ai n't no way that Karl Malden would have slugged Widmark out in the open during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits . Both would have realized that would have undermined authority , something the military just does n't let happen.<br /><br />I wish I could have said something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like its talented cast , it 's talented director Richard Brooks , even the silly theme by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington , fresh from their Oscar a year before for High Noon . The film actually got an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and story by Millard Kaufman . It must have been for Kaufman 's vivid imagination .
0 Being the only movie I was able to see at this year 's " Nordische Filmtage " at L√ºbeck , this year 's festival will be remembered as a all - time low for me.<br /><br />This movie , which was announced as an erotic thriller , is nothing more than a sick piece of crap ! Excuse the language , but there are n't any decent words to describe it.<br /><br />First of all , the actors are not the best . But even better actors would not have rescued the movie . E.g. the plot : after the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that John was sick , the neighbour girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend . The so called " sex - scene " was nothing else but disgusting ( hitting each other until blood flows for me has n't anything to do with sexuality ) , but unfortunately that were not the only disgusting images to be shown . Everything else was copied by other directors like e.g. Lynch , but of course without their geniality.<br /><br />So , to summarize the whole film and to save other viewers time and money : guy loses girlfriend , girlfriend turns back home , guy kills girlfriend and becomes mad afterwards , guy imagines hot , but crazy neighbour girls , guy has very disgusting sex with one of them ( or so he thinks ) , in the end he realizes , he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lay in his apartment all the time ... bad story , bad actors , pictures , that make you want to vomit ... <br /><br />1 out of 10 ( 1 point for the fact , that you realize how good you can understand Norwegian if you learned Swedish - at least one benefit of the evening - and you ca n't choose 0 points here ) .
0 Interesting idea and storyline which did n't quite work.<br /><br />When you see the film , maybe you will feel as dissatisfied with the ending as I did . I did n't really know who to root for in the movie , Taye Diggs looked bored as the detective , the rest of the characters seem so one - dimensional and unpleasant.<br /><br />If the victim Alicia(Mia Kirschner ) had been more of a nice girl , we might actually have enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and the perpetrator brought to justice . The problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls , turning from sweet girl to conniving opportunistic cokehead . I ca n't understand the moral message of this film , and as a detective story and thriller it does n't work .
0 Geez , another Lifetime movie , but once again is n't exactly the worst movie in the world , but far from the best . I think the main problem is that it 's pretty obvious who is responsible for what , and it 's generally fairly predictable . Worse yet , some of the flashbacks ended up being confusing , and the viewer is left wondering " Okay , how much am I supposed to care ? " One thing I did like is that the movie goes to show you that it 's never THAT simple as " the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad " , and sometimes it IS evil vs evil rather than good vs evil . Hadley did n't do what she did out of a sense of justice , she did it because she considered herself entitled to a job for being family , AND to eliminate the competition . As for Alicia , it simply proves that a victim is n't always a good person . Some of them really do " have it coming " , even if " it " was a painful , horrible death . " The Burning Bed " is a great example of this , but the difference is that the vile man in " The Burning Bed " got exactly what he deserved . But , did Alicia " have it coming " ? Some will say that she did , but others do n't agree , and the law generally does n't either.<br /><br />As for acting , it 's a mixed bag . Some do a good job , like Mia , but others just came across as indifferent to their roles . They were mostly wooden or simply not convincing . The music was pretty cool though and some of the scenes are nice and steamy , especially if you like girl / girl action . The movie is n't badly shot at all , but given its glaring weaknesses , the strengths are in background , unfortunately.<br /><br />I've heard rumors of a sequel , but given the years , I doubt it 'll happen . But , I would n't be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared . If Alicia is as EVIL , conniving and horrible as people say , then I do n't think she 'll be thinking , " YAY ! I woke up from a coma ! Oh , Hadley was responsible ? Oh ! That 's okay ! I totally forgive her and want the charges dropped ! " No way Hadley would be in jail for long anyway , if she even does any time since no murder actually happened . < br /><br />Anyway , worth checking out at least once !
0 I rented " New Best Friend " hoping for a movie similar to enjoyable teen thrillers such as " Gossip " and " The Curve " . Instead , " New Best Friend " is much more like " The In Crowd " , in which there are no thrills and the acting is incredibly phony . " New Best Friend " is boring , and the events during the movie are the same . Skip this movie ... it 's a waste of time .
0 Not very interesting teen whodunit saved from being a turkey from some decent performances . The main cast consisting of Taye Diggs , Mia Kirshner , Dominique Swain and surprisingly Meredith Monroe are all good but the story is not very original .
0 " New Best Friend " is another entry in the " steal another woman 's life " sub - genre ; the best of which are " Single White Female " and " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ; the worse of which you can catch almost any afternoon on the Lifetime Channel . For some reason this type of identity theft happens exclusively to women.<br /><br />There are just two basic ways to play this type of story . You can make the woman evil at the beginning and let the audience watch knowingly as she hatches and implements her evil scheme . Or you use misdirection to make her appear a good person , as a seemingly unplanned series of events break in her favor until she is revealed to be evil in the climatic scene . Unfortunately the makers of " New Best Friend " could not decide how they wanted to play it and things crash and burn early . We first meet Alicia ( Mia Kirshner ) scamming the college 's financial aid office for scholarship money . We now know that she is a bad person and will view all her subsequent activity with suspicion . But the director and editor apparently forgot that this revelation had been made and spend the next 50 minutes laying misdirection to make us think that Alicia is a good person . This introduces the only element of suspense , not about whether she is evil but about when the director and editor will wise up and stop wasting our time with transparent misdirection.<br /><br />"New Best Friend " suffers more than most from the teen movie curse of a cast too old to be portraying undergraduate students . There are really only two big parts , Hadley ( Meredith Monroe ) and Alicia ( Kirshner ) . They were 31 and 26 respectively at the time of the production . It almost works for the 26 year - old Kirshner when she plays the mousy version of Alicia but it becomes glaring when she is transformed into the glamed - up version of Alicia . Monroe 's casting is simply a joke , about like having Nicholette Sheridan try to pass as a classmate on " Lizzie McGwire " . She looks much closer to a mid - life crisis than to a term paper.<br /><br />The producers must have owed a lot of favors because this age issue extends to most of the supporting characters . Taye Diggs who plays the town sheriff is younger than most of the students.<br /><br />The basic setup is that Hadley and two other rich party girls ( played by Dominque Swain - age 21 and Rachel True - age 35 ) are undergrad roommates at college . They share ( as their student residence ) a mansion that is nicer and better furnished than the mansion on Real World - New Orleans ( a premise more believable than soccer moms playing students ) . Alicia moves into the mansion and begins to take over Hadley 's life . At least that way Swain finally gets a roommate from her own generation so the two can have a lesbian scene . Swain 's supporting performance is the only good thing about " New Best Friend " and her love scene with Kirshner is fantastic , so cool and artsy that it does n't fit with any of the other segments , maybe it was subcontracted out to a good director and cinematographer.<br /><br />The unintentionally hilarious story is presented in a series of dreary flashbacks of rampant sex and nonstop parties , each proceeded by a shot of a comatose Alicia in a hospital bed . About half of Kirshner 's screen time is spent lying motionless with a tube in her mouth . Not a good career move Mia.<br /><br />Then again , what do I know ? I 'm only a child .
0 Unentertaining , uninvolving hybrid of " Cruel Intentions " and " Wild Things " , but it is n't nearly as good as either of those trash min - classics . It 's about the acting sheriff , Artie ( Taye Diggs ) being called in to investigate a near - fatal drug overdose at a posh upper - class Univesity , but to keep it on the down low . As he digs deeper he thinks it 's much more than it at first glance seems to be . We follow Alicia , the girl who overdosed in flashbacks as well . At about 90 minutes , if this film was welcomed to begin with , it would have worn it out . This film brings absolutely nothing new to the table . But it IS the only movie thus far that has Miss Swain topless so the grade is higher just for that.<br /><br />My Grade : D < br /><br />Eye Candy : Dominique Swain gets topless ( fixing a mistake of " Happy Campers " ) ; another girl is topless < br /><br />Anti - Eye candy : more men ass than girl tit
0 Small college town coed OD 's ? ( Why do we care ? ) Acting sheriff investigates the incident . ( Why do we care ? ) The interviews show us the comatose subject ( Kirshner ) as different as the opinions of the subjects being interviewed . ( Why do we care ? ) Result ? A mess of flashbacks in this mess of a movie featuring a handful of one - hit wonders and B - flick divas which begs the question ... Why do we care ?
0 I totally disagreed with those comments which said this is a good movie . This is a totally SUCKED movie . I mean SUCKED - S.U.C.K.E.D. The story development is strange . Mia Kirshner changed from an innocent girl to a party - fun seeking chick for no convincing reasons at all . In addition , all the actresses looked way too old for being college students - College students looked like about 30 years old - you figure out the rest . I watched only about first ten minutes and started fast forwarding to look for sex scenes . all the sex scenes are lame , hasty and , most importantly , no frontal at all . All the sex scenes are laughable , considering how many clothes they had on . Do yourself a favor - put it down and save yourself a few bucks . Conclusion : Story - 0 , Sex - 0 , Acting - 0 , Score - 0 out 10 .
0 Interesting film about an actual event that took place during the Civil War in Vermont . It kept my attention to the end and I do n't regret viewing it . I have n't ever read any on this raid incident so I was curious to see if the rebels pulled it off . I enjoy historical films from that era.<br /><br />My major complaint is with the Confederate uniforms . They look too good ! ! ! The acting was a little stiff at times . I like the old man eating the mashed potatoes because he did n't have any teeth . The wounded soldier playing fetch with a hound was a little strange . Overall , it was a descent film .
0 ( Avast , slight spoilers ahead ) I got this tape from my local library , which keeps a copy for obvious reasons.<br /><br />I once went to the town of Matewan , West Virginia , and in a little museum there I saw the schedule for the town theatre citra May 1954 . Movies would change at the theatre each day . As there would be no TV for another decade or so in those parts , this was much of the available entertainment in the town . " The Raid " seems to have been made for towns like Matewan in the 1950 's . Although it was n't listed for that month , I am sure showed there some Monday or Tuesday night for an audience which probably was n't too demanding . The historical raid - daring and remarkably successful - did n't seem to have been very well researched , so the movie is full of Hollywood embellishments , including a loose cannon played by Lee Marvin . Marvin uses the opportunity to practice being Liberty Valance . And St. Albans seems to have had more Yankee soldiers coming and going through the town than Washington D.C. had.<br /><br />What really made me snicker was when the raiders change into their Confederate uniforms . Only in tacky Civil War paintings do Rebel uniforms look so pristine . When Anne Bancroft 's son catches Van Heflin in his uniform just before the raid , I expected the boy to think it was Halloween.<br /><br />And then there 's Anne Bancroft herself . While watching the movie I actually looked on the IMDb to see if there was a second Anne Bancroft . The then - studio contract actress looks nothing like in her later films , and has none of the presence she would later have in " The Miracle Worker , " " Agnes of God , " and of course " The Graduate." < br /><br />Worth seeing if only 1 ) . you live in St. Albans and 2 ) . you have a couple hours to kill on a Hollywood fictionalization of your home town 's biggest news story .
0 I read the reviews for this and while not expecting a saving private Ryan I was expecting a film of some substance.<br /><br />The film starts off very lob - sided with the usual intro of history and how the unit came into being . But immediately it 's 1944 and you are not sure where everyone is . The accents etc are very poor as this unit is supposed to be Hawaiian / Asian American but everyone speaks in a very poor take on Harvard English imitation of a Japanese person.<br /><br />I gave this film 3 out of 10 as after 10 minutes I could n't watch any more of it . The characters were 1 dimensional and even though they were most likely based on real people I had no feeling for them and this left me not caring about them . Very poor direction of a very average TV movie which will be shown at midnight on some cable channel . I 'd avoid and look out for better efforts.<br /><br />This is a good story but it was deserving of a better telling . You got a sense the director had seen band of brothers and thought that that was enough to sell his movie . My advice , avoid and watch band of brothers , Tuskegee airmen , Glory or any other movie like when trumpets fade ...
0 In my opinion , this movie 's title should be changed from " Only the Brave " to " All About Lane " . I went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome . Although , I appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd - a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry - the acting in some parts of film was quite stale . The performances of Marc Dacascos , Tamlyn Tomita , and Jason Scott Lee were all great . However , the director should have NEVER put himself as the main character in the movie . Sorry Lane , you are just not a film actor . Stick to what you 're good at - theater acting . Gina Hiraizumi 's performance in this film was also horrible . She should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a Miss Nisei queen . There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful ... Why were n't they cast for that role ? Another major problem with this film were its action sequences . The Japanese - American soldiers do n't look like they were fighting German soldiers ... let alone anyone . Granted this was a low budget feature , but since this was a war - based film , is n't it important to show some actually fighting ? This film was a worthy attempt , but definitely not worth a major distribution .
0 While I totally disagree with one reviewer who described Charley Chase as unfunny , in this film he certainly is . It 's a shame , as I suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few Charley Chase duds and assumed the guy was n't funny . Films like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and WHAT PRICE GOOFY ? are very good Chase films , so he COULD be really funny given good material . Unfortunately , in this film he 's given absolutely nothing . Even the inclusion of the usually good Oliver Hardy as a foil is n't any help because the basic premise ( boy wants to marry girl but girl 's father thinks the boy is a wuss ) and the gags are so poor . It 's a shame , as I really wanted to love this film but couldn't.<br /><br />By the way , for those used to the look for Charley from the mid-1920s on , you 'll be pretty surprised as Chase sports no glasses or mustache -- and looks very little like you 'd expect .
0 I 've never found Charley Chase very funny , even though his on - screen character sometimes reminds me of John Cleese , whom I find VERY funny . ( Charley Chase also reminds me of gowky Hen Broon from Scotland 's ' Sunday Post ' comics page . ) In Chase 's best films , I tend to admire his professionalism rather than laughing at him . I 'll give Chase credit that his very best films -- such as ' Mighty Like a Moose ' and ' His Wooden Wedding ' -- have inspired a fandom who are fiercely loyal to him ... but I 'm positive that even the most die - hard Chase fan will agree that the very early and very crude ' Married to Order ' just is n't funny at all.<br /><br />Chase -- eager , awkward , gormless , naff -- is a young swain hoping to court the fair Rose . Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this film as her blowhard father , who disdains Chase as a ' mollycoddle ' . Leo White , who did more notable work as a foil for Chaplin at Essanay , is on hand here as a rival.<br /><br />There 's some action involving an Ingersoll watch . I was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the dialogue titles : is this an early example of product - placement ? < br /><br />Sadly , a major flaw in ' Married to Order ' is the casting of Rosemary Theby as Rose : she 's meant to be a standard - issue ingenue , but Theby -- flat - chested , hawk - faced -- is physically wrong for the role . Theby ( the wife of Harry Myers ) had a successful career as a screen actress , but was never a believable ingenue . Film historian William K Everson dealt with her very dismissively in one of his film books.<br /><br />I'll rate ' Married to Order ' just 3 out of 10 , and I 'm being charitable ... because I keep suspecting that Charley Chase has got something that everyone else gets but I keep missing .
0 Max had the V-8 , Trace ( Wheels of Fires last and only hero ) has a jet engine on the back of his car allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces as he rockets around the halfway desolate wasteland . Be amazed as Mad Max 2 ( aka The Road Warrior ) is dissected and spliced back together as a new movie albeit filmed in a lackluster manner with bad actors and lousy stunt work.<br /><br />Why is WoF set in a post - apocalyptic wasteland ? Simple , The Road Warrior was ! Actually any questions can be answered by : it was that way in the Road Warrior ! Except for the out of work mutant actors from the original 60 's The Time Machine film that make a cameo appearance for sake of giving the audience some non - vehicular action to chew on for a few minutes.<br /><br />In typical 80 's fashion , all cars driven by bad guys that are bumped or slightly jostled explode in a huge billowing explosion . Inevitably all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will unavoidably fall off of them . Along with this 80 's cinematic wild ride is the general rampant misogyny in this style of cheapie film . Generally I waited for Trace 's rocket powered car to accelerate and shoot flames so there would be another shot of him scrunching up his face like he is supposed to be tough , which comes off more as him looking constipated . Badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting makes this film a true sinker . The unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin.<br /><br />Rats : Nights of Terror by Bruno Mattei is superior . And that in and of itself is saying a lot ! By this count 2020 Texas Gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire . A poor Road Warrior knock off that does n't have near enough cheese factor to make the film watchable.<br /><br / >
0 It 's curious that the two stars of Meet The People were a pair of movie stars who went into the new medium of television and became even bigger successes and who both went into the production end of things and enjoyed tycoon status on the small screen . Lucille Ball however was not a major star , that would come with television . As for Dick Powell he desperately wanted to get out of doing films like Meet The People and his career salvation would be coming in his next film.<br /><br />I think the only reason that Dick Powell did the film was because a young player from MGM was cast in a specialty number and he was seeing her at the time . His private time with June Allyson was far better than what we see on the screen . Powell looks crashingly bored and ca n't summon up any kind of emotion at all.<br /><br />He was probably tired of doing these musicals with silly plots , the kind he ran from Warner Brothers from . The original show Meet The People was not a book show , it was a revue and it ran in the 1940 - 41 season on Broadway for 160 performances . When MGM bought it , they scrapped everything but the title and the title song . The rest of the score was patched together from various and sundry songwriters , none of the songs is memorable . Odd when you consider some of the source material is from Burton Lane , E.Y. Harburg , Harold Arlen , and Rodgers&Hart . These guys just must have emptied the trunk for material.<br /><br />The plot is sillier than even most of the musical propaganda pieces of the time . Powell is the writer of a revue called Meet The People and he 's a shipyard worker who wins a lottery date with movie star Lucille Ball . She 's interested , he 's interested , they 're both interested in the revue , but creative differences keep them apart of course until the finale . That 's the film in a nutshell.<br /><br />MGM did give Powell and Ball some good musical acts which are the main reason for watching Meet The People . The big bands of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are here and the highlight of the film for me is Bert Lahr dressed in a commodore 's suit like Lou Costello had in the dream sequence in In The Navy . The song Heave Ho is written by Arlen and Harburg who wrote for Lahr , the Courage number from The Wizard Of Oz . And as just about everyone in the world has seen that film , you have an idea of Heave Ho is like.<br /><br />Dick Powell 's next film was Murder My Sweet in which he finally bid a not so fond adieu to musicals . And Lucy would have to wait for television before the world got to see what she really could do .
0 I went into this movie hoping for the best . I like wartime musicals in general . Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did good jobs with their roles ; however , the writers gave them boring dialog . The love - interest between the two of them was not given any real growth ; just suddenly it was there . I did not think much of the music ; the best number was the snippet we heard of Spike Jones with " Der Fuhrer 's Face . " The one complete number that Spike Jones did had little of his great musical comedy ; pretty tame stuff , even with the monkey . Bert Lahr 's comedy skits were interminable.<br /><br />There were parts to enjoy : Lucille Ball was quite a looker , and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen .
0 I watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare . And I have to say , it did not deserve it.<br /><br />Parinda was so hyped , that I was really looking forward to watch it.<br /><br />Parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good Indian film - makers , despite having a great story . It was even more pathetic to know , that the story itself was not original , it was loosely based on the classic " On the Waterfront".<br /><br />Anil Kapoor was irritating , especially when he comes from America . The direction lacked quality many a times , except a few in - between scenes.<br /><br />Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma , Deepa Mehta , Mahesh Bhatt , Sudhir Mishra , and I 'm 100 % sure , they 'll make a mind - blowing movie out of it.<br /><br />I'm not saying Parinda was bad . It was just not good enough .
0 This movie is chilling reminder of Bollywood being just a parasite of Hollywood . Bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its industry.<br /><br />Vidhu Vinod Chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of " Deewar " and " On the Waterfront " will bring home an Oscar . It turned out to be rookie mistake.<br /><br />Even the idea of the title is inspired from the Elia Kazan classic . In the original , Brando is shown as raising doves as symbolism of peace.<br /><br />Bollywood must move out of Hollywood 's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously .
0 This is one of the worst movies i have seen to date , the best part was Christian J. Meoli " Leonard " attempting to act jumping up and down outside the bar , kind - of like i wanted to do on the DVD , to spare the rest of humanity the agony of watching this shitty film . It has a great cast so you keep watching waiting for it to get good , i mean with Sean Astin " Andrew " ( played his part perfectly , did a great job , too bad it was in this film ) , Kyra Sedgwick " Bevan " , Ron Livingston " Chad " , Ren√©e Zellweger " Poet " ( they put her name on the cover she has a total of 1 line and less then 4 seconds in the whole movie ... <br /><br />If the cast had any dignity , they would go out and buy all the copies of this film and burn them along with Writer / Director George Hickenlooper and Writer John Enbom
0 Bugs Bunny accidentally ends up at the South Pole while trying to vacation in Florida . Where he meets a little penquin , which he tries to save from an Eskimo . This short tries and the penquin is adorable , but in the end it 's a bit too light in the laughs department . The Eskimo is n't really that great of a foil for Bugs and I just seen a lot better Bugs Bunny cartoons frankly , even other shorts when he 's paired with other unknown antagonists . So I ca n't in good conscience recommend this one . However it is nice to see it in it 's uncut form . This cartoon is on Disk 3 of the " Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 " < br /><br />My Grade : C
0 You can tell a Lew Grade production a mile off ¬ñ distinctly British in style ; epic in conception ; peopled by international all - star casts ; usually set in exotic climes . It 's a formula that Grade and his company ITC employed throughout the 70s into the early 80s , resulting in titles like The Eagle Has Landed , Firepower , and Raise The Titanic ! In 1977 Grade produced March Or Die , a remarkably old - fashioned Foreign Legion adventure that models all the characteristics mentioned above . Directed by the usually dependable Dick Richards ¬ñ who helmed the acclaimed Farewell My Lovely just a couple years earlier - March Or Die is an unfortunate disappointment.<br /><br />A company of Foreign Legionnaires led by the harsh disciplinarian General Foster ( Gene Hackman ) is sent to Morocco shortly after World War 1 . Their mission is to protect an archaeological party fronted by the dedicated Francois Marneau ( Max Von Sydow ) . The archaeologists are carrying out an excavation at the ancient city of Erfoud , but fear an attack from Arab tribesmen following the decimation of an earlier archaeological group . Foster is not happy with the assignment ¬ñ he does not consider historical artifacts worthy of his men risking their lives . This creates ongoing tension between himself and Marneau , who believes that the legionnaires should sacrifice their lives to make the excavation possible . The problems heighten when a beautiful woman named Simone Picard ( Catherine Deneuve ) tags along with the legionnaires . She is hoping to find out what happened to her father , a historian abducted by the Arabs when they wiped out the first archaeological team . Her presence arouses desires amongst the legionnaires , none more so than gypsy thief Marco Segrain ( Terence Hill ) , a charming and courageous rogue who initially shows indifference towards his legionnaire colleagues but gradually grows in stature . Things climax with a huge battle at Erfoud , with swarms of united Arab tribes charging against the handful of legionnaires as they desperately try to defend their lives.<br /><br />On paper the star duo of Gene Hackman and Terence Hill seem a mismatch ¬ñ Hackman is the heavyweight Oscar - winning character actor , Hill the handsome but limited Italian heart - throb from numerous low budget spaghetti westerns . One expects Hackman to act his counterpart off the screen . Yet , bizarrely , it is Hackman who gives the weak and uninvolving performance , while Hill raises his game to surprisingly high levels . The film is attractively shot on desert locations , but the pacing is awfully slow and few of the characters are worth caring for . Maurice Jarre 's music is uncommonly flat too ¬ñ very disappointing from the guy who gave us the Lawrence Of Arabia score . It is remarkable that anyone had the nerve to try an old - fashioned adventure of this type in the 70s ( it was a genre that peaked in the 30s , and had been all but forgotten during the intervening decades ) . Sadly , the gamble does n't really pay off ¬ñ this homage to the legionnaire flicks of old becomes more of a plod than a march .
0 The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918 . The troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the French Army , including the Legion , marched off to war in 1914 ! This a sure sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey . ( The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working . Metropolitan French troops were put into " horizon blue " and Colonial troops were put into khaki . ) The Claude Van - Damme ( sp ? ) remake at least got the uniforms more or less right . Really is too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes when they then go to all the effort to get other things right .
0 " Shadrach " was not my favorite type of movie . I found it overly sentimental and the acting was below par . Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good but some of the other actors were n't at all believable . I also did not believe that Paul 's parents would go away and leave him with the Dabney family , especially when they had a housekeeper living in the home . Their social classes were too far apart to consider this believable . It seemed the Dabney 's lifestyle was too exaggerated . There was a scene in the beginning of the movie that showed Andie MacDowell getting out of a car after having sex with someone . Who was it ? Her son ? What was the scene supposed to show us ? Why was the scene even included ? It had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was in fact never alluded to again . It seemed gratuitous and not fitting into the story at all . There were too many inconsistencies in the movie for me . The story concerning Shadrach was nice but I was n't convinced that the Dabneys would have been as kind and generous as they were portrayed .
0 My girlfriend picked this one ; as a southern born and raised African American I found this movie 's plot and premise totally without credibility . To believe that class and racial biases would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the ante - bellum south . Totally absurd ! ! ! I wonder how they got a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell ( who being southern knows better ) to participate in this crap
0 We rented five movies for New Year 's Eve weekend and watched this one first . All I can say is that there was no place to go but up after watching this one . It was pointless and vulgar . Harvey Keitel 's script must have been easy to write -- just make two out every three words a curse word . Andie McDowell is surprisingly good in a character roll , but the movie has nothing else to recommend it .
0 Really , They spelled it BRAIN in the credits , not BRIAN.<br /><br />OK , they did n't have the budget for a spell checker . All the production money went for great old cars . There are at least two Packards visible here . One is a Darin Convertible . A nice yellow Packard convertible.<br /><br />The scenes of the movie studio show that there was some money spent for costumes and set decorations . Old Cameras , an exterior of Ciro 's , street signs and whatever was needed to make a visually pleasing picture was there . Poorly written and directed.<br /><br />My DVD says it runs for 104 minutes , approximately . It was more like 85 minutes . It came to an end without reaching a conclusion . There was a collision but no conclusion . The movie just smashed up against the credits . 99 cents for this . I paid 99 cents for this . I could have bought 3 cans of cat food and watched my cat 's face as he emoted more excitement.<br /><br />For a few seconds in the Ciro 's scene after Darren McGavin gets a phone call , it looked like , maybe ... this movie would have a surprise twist that would make for an interesting film . Then it just sat there.<br /><br />The young Latin actor played by Steven Bauer ( Tony Montoya ) could have had a much bigger part in all that was going on here . This cast could have made a good film.<br /><br />I think if they cut Brian 's part and use Steven Bauer in his place and change the script and keep the Packards and lose the band and add a Johnny Otis sound alike band , then they got something.<br /><br />Here Kitty , Kitty ... <br /><br />Tom Willett
0 I bought this on DVD for my brother who is a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan . I decided to watch it myself earlier this week.<br /><br />It is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines . The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two . She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships . She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin ( A regular married guy with Kids)after driving her car into the back of his . After being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive . Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out . What happens at the end I was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine TV direction takes any drama out of the plot.<br /><br />The other section involves an old Studio boss played by Darren McGavin . This section actually has the better cast with Kenneth McMillan , Lois Chiles , Steven Bauer & Stella Stevens . They all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign , they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere . < br /><br />It passes the time but is not all that interesting and I am glad this was not bought for me . I am not a Michelle Pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress . Overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine .
0 So the other night I decided to watch Tales from the Hollywood Hills : Natica Jackson . Or Power , Passion , Murder as it is called in Holland . When I bought the film I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was starring in it and I thought that had to say something about the quality . Unfortunately , it didn't.<br /><br />1 ) The plot of the film is really confusing . There are two story lines running simultaneously during the film . Only they have nothing in common . Throughout the entire movie I was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me . But it still hasn't.<br /><br />2 ) The title of the film says the film will be about Natica Jackson . Well it is , sometimes . Like said the film covers two different stories and the part about Natica Jackson is the shortest . So another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice.<br /><br />To conclude my story , I really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs , on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it . By doing this you wo n't waste 90 minutes of your life , as I did .
0 I would n't give this movie a rating , it 's not worthy . I watched it only because I 'm a Pfieffer fan . I love her and would watch anything she made . Even in this dud , she did n't disappoint . Every scene with her in it , kept the viewer watching ... waiting ... for something to happen but nothing ever did . It had some good story lines but they ended abruptly as soon as it started . Some of the other characters had potential but nothing became of it.<br /><br />Pfieffer was 29 when she made this film and at her most lovely . The wardrobe and set was surprisingly good . < br /><br />I can watch mostly anything and rarely come across a movie I ca n't find something to like about it , but this was a dud . I do n't understand . < br /><br />The worst thing about it all , it had a big cliff hanger at the end . It had an ending scene that woke you up and say wow , this film is finally going some place , then the credits roll . Good grief . < br /><br />I agree with the review that said .99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting . Well said . Actually , that comment was more entertaining than the film because it sums it up so well . I too wasted .99 cents on this dud.dud.dud .
0 Years after the fall of the last of the great corporations , the world has fallen into a new dark age where cyborgs are harvested for their parts . Cash , a female cyborg , travels to a wasteland doctor to receive news that she is pregnant . On the run from Recyclers ( bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs ) , Cash tries to find her way to Cytown , the mythical refuge for cyborgs.<br /><br />"Cyborg 3 : The Recycler " is the third ( & last so far ) entry in the CYBORG trilogy . The first film was originally planned to be a sequel to MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE , but was quickly rewritten into a standard post - apocalyptic martial - arts fest that became something of a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes . CYBORG 2 : GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that actually improved upon its predecessor but was not widely seen ( & was dismissed by those few who saw it as cheap fodder).<br /><br />This film , for one thing , tries to be a meld of the first two films ( the first was a cheesy action film while the second was a smart Cyberpunk story ) but unfortunately falls short on both counts . The budget was obviously lower than CYBORG 2 , with the film being set in the desert wastelands ( like so many post - apocalyptic action films of the 90s were ) , shot around old industrial buildings to conserve costs.<br /><br />The film 's story centres on a plot device , that of a pregnant cyborg , that is as interesting as it is absurd ( this film is not the first to try that idea ; the anime OVA series ARMITAGE III uses it to a greater extent ) . But the film falls into the same trap that so many low - budget sci - fi action films fall victim to , in the fact that the snags ( synthetic organisms ) featured are nothing more than androids . The visual effects amount to nothing more than prosthetic arms & makeup effects.<br /><br />The acting is pretty standard for this kind of film , with the lead actress ( Khrystyne Haje ) being the single worst performer on display . Instead of being joyed at the news she is pregnant , she acts all whiny & sullen . Her co - stars are much better , Malcolm McDowell being the usual gangster type who enlivens the scenes he appears in & Richard Lynch has a lot of fun as the chief villain . Of particular note is Andrew Byniarski , playing Lynch 's right hand man , who would later appear in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake & its prequel .
0 Cash ( Now played by Khrystyne Haje in for Angelina Jolie ) has wandered to a post apocalypse wasteland ( after her protector has died from old age , said protector was played by Elias Koteas , an actual decent actor ) and now she finds that people wander through the rubble looking for cyborgs to trade for scrap metal and cash . She leads a group of burned out cyborgs ( That includes William Katt , Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan ) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch . Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch 's employer . Cyborg 3 does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature . The problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well , the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as McDowell , Katt and Galligan are given little to do . Haje is indeed a whiny heroine and Lynch is too over the top(as usual ) and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as fun - bad as it 's hilarious predecessor . ( The one with Van Damme , the second one is just dull . ) Also disappointing is the science fiction angle which almost aggressively resists any good idea it has . As an action flick this is routine and by the numbers B - movie stuff and it is competently made , that 's the only thing positive I can say about it.<br /><br />*1/2 out of 4-(Poor )
0 A study in bad . Bad acting , bad music , bad screenplay , bad editing , bad direction and a bad idea . Pieces of schlock do n't come any cheesier or unintentionally funnier than this ... thing . By the end of the " movie " , you are left wondering why did they bother in the first place . Poor Malcolm McDowell , was he short of cash or something ? Still thinking of seeing this ? * SPOILERS AHOY * : If you have n't died of laughter in the first thirty minutes , by the time you 'll see the cyborg - populated town named " Cytown " , you will . Avoid this , my movie - loving friends . Avoid .
0 I almost made a fool of myself when I was going to start this review by saying " This movie reminded me of BILLY ELLIOT " but then I looked up the resume of screenwriter Lee Hall only to find out that he was the guy who wrote BILLY ELLIOT so it 's Mr Hall who 's making a fool of himself not me < br /><br />Am I being a bit cruel on him ? No because Lee has something most other aspiring screenwriters from Britain do n't have - He has his foot in the door , he has previously written a successful British movie that won awards and made money at the box office and what does he do next ? He gives the audience more of the same < br /><br />Young Jimmy Spud lives on some kitchen sink estate . He is bullied at school and no one loves him . The only thing keeping him going is that he has aspirations to be a ballet dancer . No actually he has aspirations to be an angel but considering his household he may as well be a ballet dancer . He has a macho waster of a father who thinks " Ballet dancers are a bunch of poofs while his granddad says " Ballet dancers are as tough as any man you could meet . I remember seeing the Bolshoi ballet ... " Yup Ballet is a main talking point on a run down British council estate those days - NOT . Come to think of it neither is left wing politics which seems to be the sole preserve of middle class do gooders who live in nice big houses , so right away everything about this set up feels ridiculously false < br /><br />Another major criticism is that this is a film that has no clue who it 's trying to appeal to . I have often criticised Channel 4 for broadcasting movies at totally inappropriate times ( THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT at 6 am for example ) but they showed this at 2 am and for once they 've got it spot on . Considering the story involves politics , ballet dancing ( Gawd I hate it ) lung cancer and poverty there 's no way this can be deemed suitable for a family audience but since the main protagonist is an 11 year old child and features angels and ballet dancers ( Do n't blame me if I seem obsessed with the subject - there was no need to refer to them ) there 's not much here for an intelligent adult audience either . < br /><br />Of course if Lee Hall had been told at the script development stage by the producers that he should write a story featuring a schoolboy and an angel and had flatly refused saying that he wanted to write about other themes and stories then I will apologise but throughout the movie you do get the feeling that once the film was completed it was going to be marketed to the exact same audience who enjoyed BILLY ELLIOT
0 Not that I want to be mean but this movie really surprised me a lot . During the whole film , I was like ... erm ... what is this movie all about ? I do n't get the animations at all . Probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belongs to the 1980s . During the film , there is a group of people walked out . After the movie , many people said , " That 's it ? " Frankly speaking , I can not believe that this movie was awarded the best children film award . If you are thinking of watching this film , I strongly recommend you not to . You will regret it . I 'm not joking . You will find that you are just wasting both your time and money of you go and watch it .
0 If you 're watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about , then you 're in for quite the surprise . Even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline , but the actual film is anything but.<br /><br />As the synopsis went , it tells of an obsessed mountain climber , which you 'll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl , which tells you of the presence of Chronopolis , an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind ( note to self ¬ñ this spells trouble with flashing lights ) , where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence . They can see our world , and notice of all persons this mountain climber , and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy , creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man.<br /><br />What that translated to , is a repetitive piece of animation that a 5 year old kid could produce . Have shapes created , though credit goes to the stop motion style , and put it through a mind - numbing loop . And repeat until your eyes start to close , then move on to the next scene . If anything , the Chonopolisians ( if this term exists ) really love their sticks and balls , constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere , and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the " other " world . It gets no better as well , when the man interacts with the sphere in yet another hypnotically boring and sleep inducing sequence.<br /><br />Thank goodness of course that the run time is shorter than what 's advertised , which is 57 minutes ( or less ) against the 70 stated . While firmly dated , its dull colours , non - existent story , scratchy soundtrack and repetitive pictures will win over no fans . Do n't waste time .
0 Well , you might not actually SEE any women in love in this movie , but you 'll certainly hear women TALKING about love , and men talking about love , and women talking about men , and men talking about women , and men talking about men , and everyone talking about death , and talking , and talking , until you yourself will want to scream and do something that requires no talking at all , like paint your bedroom or water your plants.<br /><br />Welcome to the world of D.H. Lawrence , where psycho - babble reigns supreme , and where no one can get down to living a productive life because everyone is too busy talking about how unproductive their lives are . Spending time with the characters in a D.H. Lawrence novel is like being locked in a closet with a group of your most self - absorbed acquaintances who you would run away from if you met them at a party . When I read " Women in Love , " I so desperately wanted to strangle every single character in it , but since I could n't , I was hoping they would at least strangle each other . Alas , only one of them dies , not by strangulation , and I wo n't spoil it for you by telling which one , in case you actually give a damn about this story or any of these people.<br /><br />To give director Ken Russell his due , he makes this filmed version about as entertaining as it 's possible to make this essentially unfilmable novel . He throws out much of the psychological mumbo - jumbo that Lawrence adored , and focuses instead on all of the naughty parts , so we get lots of histrionic lovemaking in beds and fields , two buck naked men wrestling by firelight , and one embarrassing scene featuring Alan Bates ( yup , buck naked again ) roaming around in a meadow making love to bushes and grass ( I 'm not kidding ) . Glenda Jackson won an Oscar for her performance as Gudrun , the more dominant of the two sisters at the story 's focus , and she certainly tries her hardest to do something with this material ; anyone would deserve an Oscar simply for having to bear Russell 's decision to give her a scene where she has to dance wildly in front of a herd of mystified - looking cattle . Oliver Reed has one expression , an intense glower . The whole thing is over - written and over - directed , and it 's deliriously campy . Indeed , this vies with " Mommie Dearest " as perhaps the most unintentionally hysterical movie I 've ever seen.<br /><br />Grade : D
0 The old axiom that bored people are boring people is well demonstrated in " Women in Love . " The script , taken from D. H. Lawrence 's novel , contains an endless flow of concepts that are , at best , sophomoric.<br /><br />What a pity so much effort went into so vacuous an exercise ; what an empty array of characters given such attention . In spite of high production values , this film comes across as tedious as its personnel.<br /><br />A revisit in 2001 merely confirms a 1969 impression of juvenille minds in adult bodies , dawdling nowhere , and fumbling every step of the way .
0 Practically the only other actor who would be less likely to play Evel Knieval than Hamilton is Anthony Perkins , yet somehow Hamilton manages to turn in a reasonably effective portrayal ( and as producer of the film , he was n't likely to be fired or told he was n't right for the part ! ) The early life of the daredevil motorcyclist is recounted here in multiple flashbacks . The film opens with a rather silly prologue with Hamilton in his white - leather , star - spangled gear spouting the world according to Knieval as if to say , " Do n't worry . This film is about my youth , but I 'll be back in my familiar costume by the end of the picture . " Hamilton is preparing for a huge jump , yet is still licking his wounds from the previous one as devoted wife Lyon both supports and derides him . He recalls various vignettes of his childhood and delinquent teenage years along with his early days as a stunt rider and blossoming celebrity . This flip - flop approach is pretty abrupt and sometimes disjointed , but it does prevent the movie from sticking to one of its inexpensive sets for too long a time or from getting into a rut with the fairly pedestrian characters . Hamilton , usually a suave and debonair persona , does a very fine job of enacting the tiny details of his subject 's mannerisms and demeanor including his walk . His hair is a shade lighter and longer and he works hard to give the right inflections in his speaking . ( He even pays minor tribute to Knieval 's many injuries by appearing in a skimpy towel while his shoulders are covered in " scars " from the multitudinous accidents . ) Facially , he looks nothing like the real cyclist , but he does suggest him in his physical performance . Lyon is excellent at playing the young girl he loves and then the more worldly wife , though her 3-pack a day voice does threaten to give her away at any given moment . She and Hamilton strike up an easy chemistry which goes a long way in putting the film over . Other nice supporting turns are given by Freed as his jaded doctor , Cameron as an early influence and Taylor as a flea - bitten sideshow barker . The film was made on a low budget , but the story is a rather low rent one anyway , so that does n't affect it too badly . The makers wisely used actual Butte , Montana locations to give the film a proper small town ambiance . Several of Hamilton 's antics are amusing , though the character is certainly reckless and inconsiderate of other people 's property ! Some of the real Knieval 's completed and failed stunts are included in some blurry footage , one of which features a mind - boggling " splatter " in which the man is rolled up and snapped around like a rag doll . Hamilton 's then - wife ( Stewart ) appears briefly as a nurse .
0 I paid one dollar for this DVD and at first I was feeling ripped off , but then I started thinking about it and I should be grateful . I have found a holy grail , a real touchstone of bad cinema . If you think the opening dramatic shots of an empty stadium successfully fizzle with Evel 's awkward camera address monologue , then wait until the opening credits roll on the chauffeur 's butt . The script seems to be pasted together from press clippings , and ESL textbooks . But ..... I just ca n't believe how bad George Hamilton is . He seems to have absolutely no connection to anything he says , the only internal monologue I can detect is " gosh I bet they think I am cute . really cute ! " . This is an epiphany ! I now know how bad it can get .
0 The 1990 's begun to have day time talk shows sprout up left and right . Every network had one , and they all lacked one thing Originality . Ricky Lake was just another show to entertain the obese trailer park mother with a Marlboro cigarette hanging out of her mouth while breast feeding one of her dozens of toothless , illiterate children . The English language and other cornerstones of mankind where ruined by this shows existence . Titltes ranging from Girl you a Pigeon Head and so on . How could anyone want to watch this pure and utter garbage ? Has our society really became nothing more than a bunch of hill billy 's and dead beat fathers ? The people who appear on this show were Trash . The people who watched this show were Trash . Anyone that wishes to see this show re aired or put onto DVD is TRASH . People wonder why Americans are becoming huge piles of lard and too fat to even get jobs , its having shows like this tell them Its OK to be 500lbs overweight , and have 12 year old girls act like prostitutes . Having such trash on TV has ruined morals .
0 The person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer / director / star -- or is , in fact , the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle . How about this ? You want to make a movie -- tell a story ; entertain ; draw me in with vivid characters . Sure , you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal . However , do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads . If I 'm to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to buy .
0 60 minutes in the beautiful Christina Galbo tries to escape the isolated boarding school she 's brought to at the beginning of the movie . Is she running from some kind of fate too horrible to contemplate , a monster , black - gloved killer , or supernatural evil ? No , she 's running from a bunch of bullies . For the OTHER 40 minutes that follow , various figures walk around the school in the dark holding candelabras and looking alarmed or distraught , which does n't say much in itself perhaps because great movies have been made about just that but if you 're going to have characters walking around corridors and staircases you better be Alain Resnais or you better know how to light that staircase in bright apple reds and purples like Mario Bava . We know a killer stalks the perimeters of the school but his body count is pitiful and sparse and in the absence of the visceral horrors one expects to find in the giallo , we get no sense of sinister mysteries / unspeakable secrets festering behind a facade of order and piety and rightness which is the kind of movie La Residencia wants to be but does n't quite know how to do it . We know something is off because girls are reported missing but we never get the foreboding mysterious atmosphere that says " something is seriously f - cking wrong here , man " . When Serrador tries to comment on the sexual repression of the female students , he does so with quick - cutting hysterics and detail closeups of eyes and parted lips while high pitched " this - is - shocking " music blares in the background . None of the aetherial beauty and longing of PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK to be found here . It 's all a bit clumsy and aimless , with no real sense of urgency or direction . A number of people are presented as suspects but there 's little reason to care for the identity of a killer that goes unnoticed by the characters inside the movie . I like the first kill , the image of a knife hitting target superimposed over the anguished face of the victim as a lullaby chimes in the background , but the rest is too inconsequential for my taste . I have to say Serrador did much better with the killing children and paranoia du soleil of WHO CAN KILL A CHILD ?
0 I ca n't believe that so many are comparing this movie to Argento 's . His work is far more imaginative and vicious -- and a lot more fun.<br /><br />The director simply lacks the ability to build real tension . The murder scenes -- and let 's face it , that 's what this genre is all about -- aren't interesting . It was not hard to guess who the murderer was , and I really did n't care when it was revealed . The cinematography is n't memorable , and the much - praised 19th century Gothic atmosphere just did n't draw me in . Several of the actors are quite good ( especially the headmistress and the sadistic girl who lords it over the younger students ) , but they 're given very little to do.<br /><br />Yes , there are undertones of incest , sadomasochism , and lesbianism , but amazingly , they add very little spice or suspense . < br /><br />If you 're looking for a good horror movie , look elsewhere .
0 If this could be rated a 0 , it would be . From the atrocious wooden acting to the dull , plodding pace , the puerile exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation added purely for the sake of the sad viewers , this is a disaster of a film.<br /><br />The plot is predictable , as from the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all of the characters and how the plot will commence . From a boring , unexceptional beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending , every single presence in this film is wasted , and every meagre scrap of talent dug up for this turkey is squandered.<br /><br />If you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with plenty of the same childish titillation , watch one of the Ilsa films . At least they 're unapologetic and up - front about what they 're trying to do . How something this horrendously bad ever managed to be rated above a 5 is a miracle of how people with no taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purposes.<br /><br />It 's not scary , it 's not interesting , and above all it 's not arousing in any sense of the word . It is , in my opinion , a crime ; it is a crime that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash was ever conceived of and given the resources to come into existence , and even more a tragedy that it is still defended by some woefully misguided viewers.<br /><br />Not even Elvira 's cheerful personality and joking ways could soften the blow that this horrifying travesty of film is . Avoid it at all costs .
0 Reading my review of THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED , many may assume that I 'm some 14 year old who thinks SCREAM is considered " classic " horror . This is not the case , as I 'm 30 years old and have been watching horror films for most of my life . But admittedly , I 'm a child of the 80 's that grew up on slasher / zombie / ghost / cannibal , etc ... types of horror films - so I do typically prefer horror films that are more graphic and faster - paced . Just like someone who can appreciate different music , painting , or in this case , film - but not necessarily like them - I can appreciate why some people may enjoy this sort of film ... I just don't ... <br /><br />THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is an exceedingly dull and tedious film about a school for wayward girls . The heavy - handed mistress of the school rules with an iron hand ( or whip in some cases ... ) to keep the girls in line . She has a young son who creeps around and peeps on the girls while they shower ( in their nightgowns no less ( ? ! ? ) ... ) , and meanwhile , girls are disappearing from the school as they are the victim of a murderer who 's lurking about the campus ... <br /><br />I can see why THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED is often compared to SUSPIRIA ( which is a masterpiece of a film in my opinion ... ) , in terms of the atmosphere of the school itself and the interaction between the girls and their guardians - but this film is so dull and uneventful that I could barely stay awake . I 'm all for " tension " and " suspense " in horror films - but this film held neither for me . Luckily , I was n't expecting a whole lot going into this one , so I ca n't say I was really disappointed - THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED just reinforced the fact that I personally do n't typically enjoy most horror films much older than from the 70 's . This is n't a hard and fast rule , but those that I HAVE enjoyed definitely seem to be more of the exception . Probably a " must - see " for horror fans who enjoy more understated and suggestive horror films - but as I do n't really know too many fans of that sort of material , I ca n't really recommend this one ... 4/10
0 First be warned that I saw this movie on TV and with dubbed English - which may have entirely spoiled the atmosphere . However , I 'll rate what I saw and hope that will steer people away from that version . I found this movie excruciatingly dull . All the movie 's atmosphere is lost with dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie . I 'm sorry , but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy . I did n't see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie . Maybe I missed something , but I have to tell it like I see it . I rated it a " 1 " . What can I say , U.S. oriented tastes , maybe .
0 This DVD appears to be targetted at someone who will just put it on and play it in an endless loop in the background . It 's organized as a series of music videos of the Grand Canyon set to various pieces of Tangerine Dream music.<br /><br />Unfortunately , the TD music is dull , and the transfer to DVD looks rather blurry and dim . Too expensive a DVD for what it is .
0 A spaceship returns from Mars ; about a couple of months earlier , a 4-person expedition had been sent to the red planet . Most of the picture is a flashback to what transpired over there . The picture is saddled by inane , melodramatic dialog , typical of many sci - fi efforts of the fifties & sixties . Note , for example , how the ship 's commander ( Mohr ) tells another crew member to ' stay there ' for no reason ; as if moving to another spot inside the ship will cause a problem . Later , the commander orders two of the crew to remain in the ship while he and another go outside . The two he ordered to stay say ' no way ' and follow out ; I did n't have high hopes for the expedition 's success by this point . There 's much talk of ' ears twitching ' and hugging a freeze - ray gun named ' Cleo ' ( short for Cleopatra , of course ) . It would at least be pretty funny , unintentionally , if the story did n't drag.<br /><br />There 's a very slow pace to the whole thing ; the astronauts spend as much time looking out the ship 's window portals ( which change color from red to blue ) , commenting on what they see , as they do outside actually exploring . The martian landscape , advertised as filmed in ' Cinemagic , ' usually resembles animation cut - outs , or drawings , shot through an orange - red filter to give the illusion of interacting with the actors , who do take on an odd surrealistic appearance due to the process . But I do n't think it fools anyone over 10 years old . The one clever mention I did notice was that the memories of the surviving astronaut would be tinged with unreality , so that would explain the unreal nature of the martian vista . Oh , okay ... <br /><br />I was amused by some of the astronauts ' actions as they begin to explore ; right off the bat , they test their freeze gun on a plant , killing it , just for the hell of it . Then the female member hacks with a machete at what she thinks is a tree but turns out to be the leg of the spider - rat monster . Nice going , lady . Look up next time . No wonder the ' intelligence ' on Mars gets upset and does n't mind that one of the lower lifeforms , a giant amoeba , attacks the explorers . The acting is n't too impressive . Mohr especially , had a very annoying technique , saying a line and then abruptly erupting into a huge grin which always creeped me out - reminded me of It ! the Terror From Beyond Space . The ending is fairly anti - climactic ; do n't expect any huge revelations beyond the ' no more expeditions ' with freeze guns named Cleo .
0 This sci - fi adventure is not the best and by no means the worst . I agree with the statement that bad sci - fi is comical . Bizarre pink tinting and unusual special effects make this a favorite for the late , late , late show viewers . Space explorers on the planet Mars fight off strange giant amoeba - like monsters and other strange creatures . Pretty cool.<br /><br />The cast includes Les Tremayne , Naura Hayden , Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen . Get comfy and enjoy . Do n't feel bad if you nod off for a moment . I agree with adding this to the list of cult classics to not miss .
0 It 's telling that as of the entry of this comment , NO females have submitted a vote of any kind for this movie . Not surprisingly , cheesy science fiction does n't appeal to them quite as much ... If you like a good " B " movie , and especially if you like to satirize them as you watch , you will like this . If you do n't have fun watching bad movies , this one 's not for you .
0 The film begins with people on Earth discovering that their rocket to Mars had not been lost but was just drifting out in Space near out planet . When it 's retrieved , one of the crew members is ill , one is alive and the other two are missing . What happened to them is told through a flashback by the surviving member.<br /><br />While on Mars , the crew was apparently attacked by a whole host of very silly bug - eyed monsters . Oddly , while the sets were pretty good , the monsters were among the silliest I have seen on film . Plus , in an odd attempt at realism , the production used a process called " Cinemagic " . Unfortunately , this wonderful innovation just made the film look pretty cheap when they were on the surface of Mars AND the intensity of the redness practically made my eyes bleed -- it was THAT bad ! ! Despite all the cheese , the film did have a somewhat interesting plot as well as a good message about space travel . For lovers of the genre , it 's well worth seeing . For others , you may just find the whole thing rather silly -- see for yourself and decide.<br /><br />While by today 's standards this is n't an especially good sci - fi film , compared with the films being made at the time , it stacks up pretty well.<br /><br />PS -- When you watch the film , pay careful attention to Dr. Tremayne . He looks like the spitting image of Dr. Quest from the " Jonny Quest " cartoon ! Plus , he sounds and acts a lot like him , too .
0 First off , I 'd like to say that the user comments alone left me with tears in my eyes from laughing . One comment that bad SF movies become good comedies is right on the mark . MST3000 made it 's living off that.<br /><br />If you look at THE ANGRY RED PLANET as the fever dream of a 10 year old comic book reader from 1959 , you 'll have the handle on this sucker . All the elements are there : the pseudoscience , occasionally logical , more often hilariously infantile . The adolescent boy attitude toward sex , with the " gigolo " captain ( good call on that one , guys ! ) making eyes at the buxom " scientist " with hair so red it 's a wonder it does n't set off the fire alarms . The ridiculous conception of Mars as a planet so alien that everything glows red , yet one alien monster has a mouse face , and the blob alien has an eye that rotates like a kid 's toy . The comic relief , an overweight astronaut ( ! ) who sounds like he never finished the 8th grade in Brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his ray gun . And of course , the mere fact that alien = dangerously evil . If these people had met E.T. , they would have roasted him in two seconds flat ! " OW " indeed!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong . I rated this movie low . Still , it 's never boring ( except when the scientist tries to explain everything - only to make it all sound more and more ridiculous ) , and you have to admit , in your little kid core , it makes you jump a few times . < br /><br />Okay , then do n't admit it . I guess you were never 10 .
0 * * Possible Spoilers Ahead**<br /><br />Gerald Mohr , a busy B - movie actor during the Forties and Fifties , leads an expedition to Mars . Before we get to the Red Planet we 're entertained by romantic patter between Mohr and scientist Nora Hayden ; resident doofus Jack Kruschen ; and the sight of Les Tremayne as another scientist sporting a billy - goat beard . The Martian exteriors feature fake backdrops and tints ranging from red to pink¬ñ-the " Cinemagic " process touted in the ads . Real cool monsters include a giant amoeba , a three - eyed insect creature , an oversized Venus Fly - Trap , and the unforgettable rat / bat / spider . The whole bizarre adventure is recalled by survivor Hayden under the influence of hypnotic drugs . THE ANGRY RED PLANET reportedly has quite a cult following , and it probably picked up most of its adherents during the psychedelic Sixties .
0 This movie is funny and painful at the same time . The " Cinemagic " almost gave me a seizure . Despite what they imply , " Cinemagic " is not some innovative technical procedure . It was " developed " as the result of an accident , and they used it because it disguised the fact that their " monsters " were so stupid - looking . I also do n't think it 's a coincidence that the writer is Sid " Pink".<br /><br />This movie is good for a laugh , if you are really looking for a movie made in 9 days on 200,000 dollars . It is entertaining ; at least I can say that about it . The bat / rat / spider is the highlight .
0 Very bad but watchable science fiction film that suffers from abominable special effects , poor acting , and a ridiculous story . The film opens with a spaceship returning from exploration on Mars with a woman and a man with green slime on his arm . She , through some hokey plot contrivances , begins to tell what happened on this fateful trip as almost all the tapes seemed to be magnetically wiped off . Four astronauts take on this journey : a military type played by Gerald Mohr , a poor man 's Humphrey Bogart who enjoys saying the word " Irish " and has the acting savvy of a codfish , then there is Naura Hayden , a beautiful redhead and only female crew member on flight with three men wearing the most formfitting suits possible to accentuate all her curves , next , Les Tremaine , a wonderful character actor from cheap sci - fi films like this as the egghead , and last , Jack Kruschen as Sammy - the guy from Brooklyn with jokes and does n't seem too bright although chosen for his expertise in electronics . None of these performers are really any good , and all of them say their dialog with little conviction . Watch Tremaine as he utters that scientific nonsense ! Really , the best out of the four is Kruschen - and that really says a lot about this film . But bad acting aside , the movie just falls apart when they land on Mars via flashback . The Angry Red Planet had a real cheap budget because Mars is really the American Southwest with a heavy red tint over it . When the story calls for something that might look Martian , there are drawings placed with a heavy red tint over them . You can tell they are drawings The monsters are perhaps even worse as we get a Bat - rat - spider with a size upwards of 40 feet that looks like some kids got together piecing dead animals together . The other significant creature is a giant amoeba with an oscillating eye . Whew ! These are bad . There is a nice drawing of a Martian city , but there just was not enough of this in the film . Despite all these big problems , The Angry Red Planet is a fun bad film . It is really fascinating to see how far we have come as a civilization . Most of the stuff they used in the movie is so outdated . One guy is using an electric razor with a cord and I thought they can get to Mars but they are still using cords . Director Ib Melchior gives an interesting look to much of the film even with the budgetary constraints , but the story by him and Sid Pink does n't fly . And how bout that ending with the music and the psychedelic colors ? Groovy man !
0 There seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8 - 10 star reviews here from people who have never written an IMDb review before or since . Given the very low average rating given to the film by other people , I think you may draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />This is a very bad film . I 'll admit it , I thought the concept was kind of cute , and I was pleased to see the actresses who played Eve and Harmony on Angel getting work , but it did n't take long for the sheer awfulness of this film to make itself known.<br /><br />Acting : The leads seemed competent enough , but everyone else ? Terrible.<br /><br />Plot : Chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck through.<br /><br />Direction : Non - existent.<br /><br />Humour : Did they really think people were going to laugh ? Oh boy.<br /><br />Eye Candy : OK . there were some really beautiful women in this film . Not just the three main female characters , but right across the board . It was as if the producers hoped the scenery would keep male viewers so distracted they would n't notice how terrible everything else was . If so , they failed miserably.<br /><br />In the right hands this could have been cute but darkly funny camp classic . It was n't even close .
0 Not one of Keaton 's best efforts , this was perhaps a veiled attempt to revenge himself on the family he married into - the Talmadges . A Polish / English language barrier and a series of coincidences leads Buster into a marriage with a large Irish woman , who ( along with her father and brothers ) treat him shabbily until they think he may be an heir to a fortune . Mistaken identities abound here - gags are set up and but for the main fail to pay off.<br /><br />This Metro short does have at least two real laughs - Buster 's cleverly turning around his lack of dinner by using the calendar on the wall and the basic ignorance of his adopted family to literally bring the meat to his plate . The other is a family photo , with the entire group slowly collapsing to the floor as the tripod of the camera loses its stability.<br /><br />The yeast beer overflow could have been the catalyst for a massive series of gags built upon gags , but stops short ( for all the buildup ) of development.<br /><br />Kino 's print is crisp and clear and the score is one for player piano , drums and sound effects . Not one of Buster 's best efforts , but worth a few laughs .
0 A good cast ( with one major exception ) pushes its way through Epstein 's smart light satire . Mansfield was never better , or funnier , than she is here paired with Walston , who 's a veteran who 's determined to become a congressman to get out of the war . He and his buddies -- including suave con - artist Grant -- head to San Francisco on leave and start the city 's swinginest party while conniving to escape the service altogether through industrial speaking tours . The only thing about this movie that 's not delightful is Suzy Parker 's one - note performance as Grant 's love interest , which takes up too much of the film 's time and slows down the pace in the second half . Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry ; the gimmick is that she 's set on making love to every serviceman ( to do her duty for the war effort , of course ) but he 's a married man who , nonetheless , loves his wife . They steal the movie with little trouble from Grant ( who 's amusing here in the first part of the film , when not paired with his non - actor co - star .
0 This film was a critical and box - office fiasco back in 1957 . It was based on a novel which was later turned into a play -- which flopped on Broadway . The story is about some navy officers on leave in San Francisco during WWII . They have 4 day 's leave which they spend at the Mark Hopkins hotel . The film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real . Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama -- but here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he does n't really pull it off . Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better choices . Audrey Hepburn was initially set to play opposite Grant , but had other commitments -- so Suzy parker stepped in . She had never acted before , but was America 's top photographic model at the time . I think that she did a good job , considering all the pressure that she was under . Grant 's pairing with Jayne Mansfield in a few brief scenes -- did not really work . The Studio was trying to give her some class by acting with Grant -- but the character had no substance at all .
0 There is a level of high expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy with a cast headed by Cary Grant , Jayne Mansfield , Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer . Those expectations are buoyed further when the film is directed by Stanley Donen , whose comic touch was so evident in , among others , DAMN YANKEES ! , BEDAZZLED and CHARADE . For the first five minutes , or so , it seems that those expectations might be met and then ¬Ö . Nothing . What is supposed to be a light comedy , plunges into leaden , heavy handed melodrama , with nary a chuckle to be had.<br /><br />Relative newcomer Suzy Parker has often been criticized for her performance , or lack of one , in this film , but in a movie in which even the great Cary Grant frequently appears flat and wooden , attacking Parker seems unfair . Not even as bright a light as an Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could have changed the fortunes of this meandering , dreary and wholly pointless script , which drags itself lamely along and drags the viewer 's interest and patience down with it.<br /><br />The rest of the cast , especially Ray Walston , keep trying to breath some life into the proceedings , but the horrible script is beyond resuscitation . The desperate , inane effort to drag a half hearted laugh from the numbed audience in the film 's final moments only serves to add insult to injury.<br /><br />This film is nothing but a major disappointment on all levels .
0 Oh dear , oh dear ... <br /><br />For JM fans , this was the nail in the coffin as far as her A - list Hollywood career was concerned . After solid turns in Girl Ca n't Help It , Wayward Bus , The Burglar and Rock Hunter it seemed Jayne was well on the way to becoming one of Tinsel Town 's hottest stars . However , an obsession with racy publicity and an appearance in this clunker relegated Mansfield to the sidelines , namely cheap Euro loan - outs until Fox could drop her contract at the earliest opportunity.<br /><br />This movie really is a diabolical waste of everyone 's time with the exception of Suzy Parker who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material . Many people blame poor Jayne and her grating performance for this film 's poor returns at the box office and while she is a pain in this film , she can only do her best with the material . After all , Cary hardly sets the screen on fire does he ? After a handful of very good dramatic and comedy turns Jayne takes 10 steps back in her pursuit as a serious actress by agreeing ( simply for the sake of appearing with Grant ) to portray this squealing , idiotic menace . Her character of Alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit , her every appearance in the film jangles your nerves . We all know Jayne could do so much better than this dross and yet here she is parading around like a prize pudding . A real shame.<br /><br />Steer clear of this so - called comedy . It 's more depressing than funny .
0 While I recently gave OPERATION PETTICOAT a positive review , I really did n't like this film even though it had so many similarities . Both were made just a few years apart , both starred Cary Grant and both were WWII comedies . However , the overall tone and style of the films were quite different . KISS HER FOR ME , overall , just seemed like a cheaper film -- with poor writing , little energy and some VERY broad performances -- even when compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT . I think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting Jayne Mansfield . The combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this A - budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio . Plus , there was n't much chemistry or energy in pairing her with Cary Grant -- an actor generally loved for his grace and class . It 's sort of like pairing Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main .
0 I wanted to love this movie . How could I not love it ? Cary Grant , Jayne Mansfield , Stanley Donen ; all icons in their own way . However , the train wreck that was Suzy Parker ruined the entire experience for me . Her acting was so appalling that I sat there with my jaw hanging open , not believing my eyes or ears . I could barely make it through one viewing , THAT 'S how hideous she is in this.<br /><br />Cary ? Gorgeous and in fine dramatic form . Jayne ? Adorable , endearing , and obviously having a ball . The supporting cast does alright , and the city of San Francisco is captured in all its stunning , retro elegance.<br /><br />Then you see Suzy Parker attempting to speak her lines with a woodenness , a deadness , a cluelessness that simply defies belief . Who told this creature she could ACT ? ? Oy VEY , people .
0 I was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services , director Stanley Donen , so far what 's not to like ? It 's the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved ( including some well - known names ) realize they had a turkey on their hands , and what 's the worst thing about it among a number of contending aspects ? Still pondering the first , but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering storyline , ahead of the wordy sometimes pretentious script , the uncertain tone , the lack of consistent and well - developed characterization , and the lack of rapport between the characters . You have to add very uneven acting to the criticism but it 's understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem under - rehearsed . Quite often they can hardly get their lines out quick enough . Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and urbane persona but at times seems uneasy and staccato in his delivery . I have to say however that I was relieved when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the unspeakably vulgar Jayne Mansfield go away with the appearance of Suzy Parker . What 's to like about the film ? - for me chiefly the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and a Grace Kelly - like dignity . Generally speaking the film is nice to look at . The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite . Even Grant ca n't look elegant in his . Back to the credit side , Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre - Hogan 's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without an assumed German accent !
0 As an avid fan of Cary Grant , I expected to watch this movie and howl with laughter , as AMC billed it as a comedy . I have never been more disappointed with a film ! Cary 's usual charm and effortless comedy are AWOL from this entire movie ; he comes across as strained , bored , and just not himself . Mississip 's character ranks among one of the worst stereotypes I have ever witnessed - his accent is terribly exaggerated ( and incorrect , according to which part of Mississippi he claims to hail from ) , and whenever he does deliver a line , it 's several decibels higher than any other cast member . Mississip tried to make himself stand out in the film as a lovable , country - bumpkin goofball , but in the end , he manages only to detract from the already weak plot . Mansfield looks more like an obscene blow - up doll than a Hollywood sex kitten , and while she was never known in Hollywood for her acting ability , this film screams that she never had that ability to begin with . Ray Walston 's character was sugary and ultimately contrived . For four men on shore leave , it was the tamest leave I 've ever seen . I watched this nightmare until its very end , and while I wo n't spoil that for anyone , I will tell you that it 's the most absurd you 'll ever see . The film tries to spark patriotism and a sense of debt to the fighting men , but the film misses that point totally because of its weak plot line and weak cast . Sorry , Cary !
0 One of the most common entries in the ' goofs ' category is anachronism . Though I 'm beginning to believe that anachronism and other goofs are more acceptable , even ignored , in very good films , but are found front and center in rotten films . KISS THEM FOR ME is a rotten film and reeks of anachronism , yet when watching it closely , I found almost nothing specifically anachronistic.<br /><br />The shots of aircraft which bookend the film are certainly out of place . The big 4 engine transport seen after the title " Honolulu 1944 " appears to be the post war C-97 Stratofreighter ( in MATS colors ) . The combat planes seen taking off from the carrier at the end are Douglas Skyraiders which entered service after WW2 and were made famous by their service in Vietnam.<br /><br />But excepting these two pieces of film and , of course , the hairstyles , everything else is very possibly period authentic . It just ' feels ' so wrong . I 'm an admirer of Stanley Donen , we share the same birthday . In his co directed ON THE TOWN ( 1949 ) there is a car chase at the end with the police driving 1949/50 Ford 's yet there is n't the slightest feeling that this is out of place in a WW2 period film . In fact , as I reflected later , there is n't anything which says that this is supposed to be a WW2 period film . It just feels that way . Based on a wartime Broadway musical which was based on a ballet ( Fancy Free ) which may have been based on the work of artist Paul Cadmus ( The Fleet 's In ! 1934 ) its a great film about sailors on a 24 hour pass in New York and , so heavy with wartime associations , its merely assumed it takes place during the war and yet these contemporary cars do nothing to break the spell.<br /><br />The first problem is old Cary Grant . Though far too old to represent a Navy SBD dive bomber pilot , it is a Hollywood tradition for stars like Grant , Gary Cooper ( Lou Gehrig ) , Jimmy Stewart ( Charles Lindbergh ) to play younger . It was the role which he is miscast in , not his age . He plays an operator , as they used to call them . A guy who gets things done and breaks all the rules while doing it yet remains admired and loved for it . A hustler . A wheeler dealer . A de rigueur character in a service comedy . Grant is the comic center of what is after all supposed to be a service comedy which is contra to his comedy style.<br /><br />Thinking back on the great Grant comic performances like BRINGING UP BABY ( 1938 ) or ARSENIC AND OLD LACE ( 1944 ) and he is the great reactor whose comedy is to be reduced by his context from dignity to a befuddled puddle of inert jelly . IN KISS THEM he is expected to be the comic spark plug which just is n't him . People had already been exposed to the type , most recently to comic Phil Silvers as Sgt . Bilko on television . The role would be perfected later by James Garner but here Grant just is n't funny and appears to be a bully getting his way by aggressively pushing his Cary Grantness rather than cajoling and finessing.<br /><br />But the thing which really stinks the place up with anachronism is the lead women . There can be no more echt 50s women than Suzy Parker and Jayne Mansfield . They are unique to the decade . Marilyn Monroe can be placed in a continuum with Carole Lombard and Marie Wilson and any number of dumb blonds , and Grace Kelly was another high class dame ( think of Mary Astor ) , but there never could have been an anatomically exaggerated woman in films like Mansfield . Sure there were the ' sweater girls ' ( e.g. Lana Turner ) of WW2 , but Mansfield was stretching the point . Suzy Parker was THE model who revolutionized the model business , who changed the mannequin like poses to become the first natural girl who moved and whose personality was captured by the camera ( see FUNNY FACE ( 1957 ) also by Stanley Donen).<br /><br />Of course in high 50s style , there seems to be a lot of gender mixing at ' wild ' parties but never even a hint of sex ( think of the 50s TV shows Bachelor Father or The Bob Cummings Show where dinner jacketed men returned from ' dates ' alone ) . The original book , which I have n't read , was published during the war and appeared as a play on Broadway at the end of the war and the nuances of the situation must have been inescapable for contemporary readers and audiences , but broken down , bowdlerized and reconstituted a dozen years later and fatally miscast , it remains a once forgotten stain on otherwise exemplary careers until the invention of the VCR and cable television resurrected this petrified turkey.<br /><br />So the lesson here is whatever the ' goof ' it will be ignored in a great film like CITIZEN KANE ( who actually hears Charles Foster Kane say ' Rosebud ' ? ) , and tolerated in fun dreck like WESTWORLD ( why were the robots given live ammunition in the first place ? ) but absolutely despised in a rotten film , even if the goofs are really non existent .
0 So , back when Herbie made his first appearance , I was perfectly happy watching Dean Jones mug away . I only wanted to be entertained for a few hours and eat overly buttered popcorn . Now , unfortunately , I have expectations of a riveting / delightful story whenever I watch a movie , if I 'm not on some sort of medication . And this is another good movie for the medicated . There are no major laughs , no complex plot lines , no difficult twists . Herbie Fully Loaded is great for the fully loaded.<br /><br />This was the first time I had seen La Lohan on the screen since she swapped places with Jamie Lee Curtis ( I thought she was excellent in that ) , and I ca n't say I was terribly impressed this time around . Aside from her constantly changing and distractingly unnatural hair color , she just did n't ring true as the kid next door who had spent a lifetime hanging around road racers . Her ' need for speed ' was n't portrayed consistently in the film - perhaps it was elsewhere - she looked older than her part , and seemed to always be looking for something ( a party ? designer togs ? new place to spend money ? ) off set . I could n't see any chemistry with Justin Long ; that romance seemed obligatory at best . The only time Lindsay appeared engaged was when she was interacting with Matt Dillon , who I thought was appropriately over the top as Evil Bad Guy Trip Murphy.<br /><br />It was great to see Herbie again , and I loved the movie intro with material from the old movies . If Disney had popped out with some Car 53 jewelry , I might have worn some just to be loyal . His new feature ( ? ) was a little inconsistent ( does he channel the thoughts of his driver ? Does he now skateboard ? ) but whatever . We all knew how it was going to end , but I do wish he had ended up with someone a little less dopey than Maggie . And my head still hurts from that lesson Maggie and we viewers had hammered home . < br /><br />What would have made the movie worthwhile ? Have the old Herbie in a real story with a real plot - at the very least , Herbie 's as good as Lassie - but clearly that 's asking too much . Why is it that Disney always goes back to the same well as " Herbie Goes Bananas " and " the Computer That Wore Tennis Shoes " when it comes to innovation ? < br /><br />I'm sure this was a great movie for kids and those with no expectations . For the rest of us .... it 's for when you have the ' flu and just ca n't take the suspense of Rear Window .
0 There are few uplifting things to say about this , but I can mention Matt Dillon doing his best to make something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worthwhile . As most race movies suffer from the premise that car lovers are not that intelligent , we end up with movies like this.<br /><br />Lindsay Lohan who surprised so much in Mean Girls has to make better decisions which roles to take . Here she can only fail.<br /><br />Children will only be mildly entertained because it tries to appeal more to adults than children ( although still pretty dumb ) . The ones in the theater I saw it with showed no real interest after a couple of minutes . And as a family sports movie this is horrible . The better moments are in the beginning at the scrapyard creating some sentiment and later in the car - bash fest creating some tension . If you develop a car as a central character you have to develop it better than here . After a few obligatory race scenes you are in for the best part : being able to leave the multiplex in your own car .
0 I went to see this movie with my 17 y.o . daughter . I insisted we go the matin√©e showing , not because I 'm a tightwad , but just feeling I had . In the NASCAR spirit , this is a sponser 's dream . SO much blatant advertising , it almost qualifies as an info - mercial , if it were n't for the so - called acting . Keeping with tradition , the Herbie franchise continues with its cheesy story lines , the car is only a ' vehicle ' ( no pun intended)for this cornball of a motion picture . Earlier Herbie installments ( although cheesy as well ) were produced during more serious times , making them a little easier to digest . Ms. Lohan , Disney 's reigning drama queen , has little acting ability . I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would get involved in such a project . Only the snack bar , was a bigger ripoff !
0 A failure . The movie was just not good . It has humor that 5 year olds that will not even giggle at . I mean , sure , some parts were amusing , but most of it is not . Lindsey Lohan is a great actress ( and a bad singer , ) and she should be working on better movies . The movie should have been aired as a Disney Channel original movie , that is FREE.<br /><br />The only thing that was well done about this movie was the music . Nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to brighten up your day . These songs are so good . Especially Alyson and Amanda 's Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter 's , Beach Boy song , Fun Fun Fun.<br /><br />4 out of 10 . If I gave it a ten , 9 of that would be the music and 1 will be the movie . Not worth your money , but the soundtrack is .
0 Herbie , the Volkswagen that thinks like a man , is back , now being driven by Maggie Peyton ( Lindsay Lohan ) , a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion . The only thing standing in her way is the current champion , Trip Murphy ( Matt Dillon ) , who will do anything to stop them.<br /><br />The original love bug was n't that good . Even as a kid , I remember not liking it very much . I had some hope for the sequel though . I mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie . Unfortunately , Herbie is no better now than he was before . The film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12 . It will probably entertain the kids but that 's all.<br /><br />I realize it 's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting . There were very few laughs and it got boring near the end . Most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too . Lindsay Lohan was alright as Maggie Peyton . She usually gives better performances like in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls . Matt Dillon gave the best performance out of everyone . He was very good as the bad guy even though he did n't have a lot to work with . Justin Long , Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really just there and they do n't do anything special.<br /><br />Angela Robinson directs and she does an okay job . She tries to keep the film interesting but she 's working with a weak script . Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier ? These two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable . It 's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder . In the end , Herbie is a safe , predictable family film that 's worth watching if you 're a kid . Everyone else is better off skipping it . Rating 4/10
0 I can sit through this movie once , but I doubt I could make it through a second time . Mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan . The fun of Matt Dillon(think Something About Mary ) , and the re - emergence of a more serious acting Micheal Keaton . This is not the fun romp The Love Bug was but it is watchable . One of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that Herbie had evolved into R2D2 antics for the most part . I was bored with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me . Go see this with your little ones , i.e. the " single digit bracket " kids and do n't expect a lot from this film.<br /><br />_X
0 You probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie ¬ñ " Herbie : Fully Loaded with crap " and yes it is true . This movie is really dreadful and totally lame.<br /><br />This got to be the second worst movie Lindsey is ever in since Confession of the Teenage Drama Queen . The only good thing about this movie seem to be the over talent cast which by far is better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie . I do n't see how such a respected actor like Matt Dillon could be a part of this movie , is n't he read that horrible screenplay before he sign on to be in it ? < br /><br />What I did n't like about this movie is also base on how Herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a racer car after all it just a Beatle . I know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining . Little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictable.<br /><br />Final Words : Unless the kids are actually 5 -12 years I highly doubt that any one could enjoy this senseless movie . What wastage of my money . I feel like cheated.<br /><br />Rating : 3/10 ( Grade : F )
0 * Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence . But this contention ignores the actual content of the film . Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious , inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination . Instead he lends them justification . The movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt . Engaging in vicious stereotyping , Stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures - dumb rednecks , broken - English speaking immigrants , lazy fat people . The one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype . Of course they befriend the old , hallucinogen - using American - Indian - because they 're trendy , dude ? Let 's make him an admirable character . Fat , Chinese clerks and " hicks " are uncool , so let 's make it seem like the deserve to die . Instead of twisted , hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds , their rampage makes them happier and more in love . Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people . Justice is mocked . The police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal , ugly and scowling compared to the GQ murderers . Again , this is not in the media reports within the film but in the " reality " in the film . There is no nuance or subtlety in the film - just overblown performances and visuals . The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence . The proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it . Some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed . The film 's " message " is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real - life results . The clever message is nowhere to be seen .
0 NATURAL BORN KILLERS ( 1994)<br /><br />Cinema Cut : R < br /><br />Director 's Cut : NC-17<br /><br />It 's an unusual Oliver Stone picture , but when I read he was on drugs during the filming , I needed no further explanation . ' Natural Born Killers ' is a risky , mad , all out film - making that we do not get very often ; strange , psychotic , artistic pictures.<br /><br />'Natural Born Killers ' is basically the story of how two mass killers were popularised and glorified by the media ; there is a great scene where an interviewer questions some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory , and the teenager says ' Murder is wrong .... but If I was a mass murderer I 'd be Mickey and Mallory ' . Mickey describes this with a situation of ' Frankenstein ( the monster ) and Dr. Frankenstein ' - Dr. Frankenstein is the media who has turned them into these monstrous killers < br /><br />Most Oliver Stone films examine the flaws of the America , the country that the director loves and admires . I guess ' Natural Born Killers ' is about the effect of mass media , technology and how obsessive as a nation , Americans are ( and most of the world ) over things such as mass killers and bizarre situations.<br /><br />The killers played by Woody Harrelson ( Mickey ) and Juliette Lewis ( Mallory ) are executed astonishingly by two excellent actors who step into the lives of two interestingly brutal killers . Mickey and Mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing , perhaps in the cruel theory of Social Darwinism ( survival of the fittest ) - Mickey says in his interview in prison , that other species commit murder , we as humans ravage other species and exploit the environment ; the script is interesting , but it is questionable how much this film amounts to , in the sense of making us think about society and human behaviour , rather than the intensity of a 2 hour bloodbath that we have seen.<br /><br />The last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison ; we see the harsh realities of prison life ; the attitudes of the warden etc;overfilling of prisons - maybe Stone is questioning the future , the path that society is leading to.<br /><br />Two other interesting characters ; First , a reporter who runs a show about ' America 's Maniacs ' and is obsessed with boosting ratings , that he goes to any length to capture the story of Mickey and Mallory . The other is police officer Scagnetti , an insane , perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with Mallory - he also has some weird obsession with mass killers , since his mother was killed during the massacre at Waco , Texas by Charles Whitman.<br /><br />The cinematography is superb ; different colours , shadows , styles create a feeling of disorientation ; the green colour most evident of all is green , to resemble the sickness of the killers ( in the drugstore when they are looking for rattlesnake antidote).<br /><br />The camera work is insane ; shaky , buzzy , it takes some determination to get use to it and accept it . Highly unorthodox , psychedelic and unusual.<br /><br />'Natural Born Killers ' does not glamourise the existence of insane murderers , it questions it and how we as the public may fuel this attribute ... <br /><br />Although the above review sound quite positive , I did dislike the film . Quentin Tarantino , who originally wrote the script for the film , was not pleased with the altered screenplay and he asked for his name to be removed . I can see why . While mildly interesting at times , Natural Born Killers is a mess of a picture.<br /><br />4/10
0 God , what an awful thing ! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something ( see the terrible use of music and pictures here ) but what for really ? The whole thing behind " Natural born killers " seems to be a " clever " look at how medias can turn into complete trash but unfortunately the movie turns into trash itself . Please Mr. Stone , next time you want to criticize the fascism of tv shows using violence to get high rates , avoid doing the same with your movie ! Michael Haneke said quite cleverly about this film that it was denouncing media fascism with fascist cinematographic ways . How true ... Only he forgot to tell us about the massive headache you get after sitting through this overlong load of crap !
0 This is the kind of film that everyone involved with should be embarrassed over . Poor directing , over the top acting and a plot that rambles on with no point other than to show violence . I thought when I first saw it that it would be perhaps a satire of the media and how it shows violence but it 's not . I 'm not sure what makes the film worse . Oliver stone does his worst directing ever . From scenes where Woody Harrelson 's face morphs for no reason or Robert Downey Jr 's dreadful performance as Wayne Gale who is a reporter who seems totally bonkers , this movie is simply a mess .
0 Let 's be honest . As a film school project , made without budget and " real " actors , this is a passably interesting film . As something to be released on DVD for an innocent viewer , it 's a very poorly produced product . If I would be idly changing channels and happened to catch this film accidentally , it would probably arrest my eye and attention for a while . As a person who bought this DVD under the impression that I would be getting a proper cinematic product , i.e. a film , I feel deeply disappointed . It 's a videotaped TV play , something along the line of old sixties serials , but without that certain charm . Aside from the leading man Mr Redfield ( who also is the director ) , the other actors seem to be either chaps from the campus ( a bit too old for that actually ) , or members of the director 's household , who appear before the camera without any help from not only the acting couches , but also the make - up artist or hairdresser ( a bonnet over outgrown permanent bangs or a top hat over mullet is a very long way from creating 1840s ) . It 's all shot using a motionless mounted camera in a small , bare studio , sometimes using blue screen for outdoors backgrounds . Synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame " period " inspired romantic karaoke insults the viewers ears on more than one occasion . The film attempts to be " dreamlike " , whereas in fact it 's merely conceptionless collage of those shots that made it to the editing ( and believe me , the standards were n't too high to start with ) . There are interesting dialogs every now and then , but overall it 's pretty lame and two - dimensional production in more than one way with no flashes of genius from either the director or any members of the crew . That 's how " artsy " films attempted to look in the 80s . Mr Redfield does a much better job as an actor than the director .
0 Renown writer Mark Redfield ( as Edgar Allen Poe ) tries to conquer old addictions and start a new life for himself , as a Baltimore , Maryland magazine publisher . However , blackouts , delirium , and rejection threaten to thwart his efforts . He would also like to rekindle romance with an old sweetheart , a significantly flawed prospect , as things turns out . Mr. Redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allen Poe . Redfield employs a lot of black and white , color , and trick photography to create mood . Kevin G. Shinnick ( as Dr. John Moran ) performs well , relatively speaking . It 's not enough .
0 Another case of a decent DVD case betraying the shot - on - video quality of the film . < br /><br />It was n't that bad . Rochon does a serviceable job and Damn ! the cast is good looking . I 've never seen that many musclebound guys hang out together on a regular basis . This movie really wanted to make you think Rochon was the killer , but it was not to be . My biggest problem with the film was that by the end , I did n't much care who was the killer , and the real killer made little sense , since it was out of the blue and the filmmakers were thinking ' ha , betcha did n't see that one coming , sucker ! ' . Yeah , there were continuity errors about ( mainly with ms . Rochon 's ever - changing wardrobe ) , but for an indie slasher it 's not that bad . I was pretty sure at the beginning it was just a thinly veiled excuse for girls to go topless , but that was just a gimmick . The dialog was overly think and painful at times.<br /><br />Just do n't have high expectations going into this , and it wo n't be that bad . And Lloyd Kaufman 's cameo is wonderfully understated .
0 Quite possibly the nicest woman in show business , and the sexiest , Debbie gives another fine performance here . Although her work in American Nightmare was far superior , she is still worth watching in this film.<br /><br />The cast is filled with your typical Melrose Place types , chiseled features and seductive curves , that I had never seen before . Other than Debbie , Laura Nativo was the only actress I had seen before , in the similar Delta Delta Die.<br /><br />The plot centers around a group of California arrogants who initiate poor naive Debbie Rochon into their clique . They tell her that they have a murder club , and that she must kill someone to be accepted . Debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool people , so she quickly kills a person , and now the group must decide what to do with her , after she fell for their joke.<br /><br />VIOLENCE : $ $ $ $ $ ( Plentiful ! Debbie Rochon occasionally has blood splattered all over her and all of the murder scenes are done in your face . Gore hounds will surely enjoy!)<br /><br />NUDITY : $ $ $ $ $ ( Plentiful as well ! Debbie Rochon has several nude scenes as do many of the no - name actresses and actors . The pool party seems as just an excuse to get everyone naked ; man and woman alike . Julie Strain also has a topless cameo but her character is gone after the first five minutes).<br /><br />STORY : $ $ ( Could have received a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot serves as filler between nude scenes . I understand that B - Rate films use nudity often , but this is borderline excessive).<br /><br />ACTING : $ ( The acting is sub standard to say the least . Rochon is always a treat , easily the best B - Rate actress in the business today , but her character in American Nightmare was superior . Danny Wolske does a fine job as Debbie 's object of lust but the other actors were nothing to write about ) .
0 Odd slasher movie from Producer Charles Band . In the days of Full Moon 's greatest success Band said that he would never make " real killer films " because he felt that little puppets and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the films better - people killing each other is thus real and less fun . A nice philosophy and a true shame that Band , having destroyed the Full Moon studio through possible shoddy business dealings became so desperate for home cinema profits that he started making exactly what the likes of Blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality . The team behind this one also worked on ' Delta Delta Die ! ' and ' Birth Rite ' - both equally bland by Full Moon standards . Debbie Rochon is on usual top form here as a newbie to a gang of dudes and dudettes who decide to make up a story about a ' murder club ' . She - as one would obviously - does all she can to join and then panic sets in because it was not a true story and silly Ms Rochon believed it and now everybody will have to run around getting covered in blood and maybe killing each other or maybe not . The choice is there 's and with regard to this movie its yours ... not recommended but not entirely bad either .
0 Devin Hamilton is probably better known as the new name in legendary Full Moon entertainment . Sadly , his arrival to this independent studio happened in a time when budget and production values are at its lowest in years . However , in his short career Hamilton has established himself as a creative director that manages to make inventive and original stories . Now , this does n't mean that his movies are good , but at least they are different to the usual in the horror genre.<br /><br />In his debut , " Bleed " , Hamilton presents us a creative twist on the slasher sub genre . Maddy ( Debbie Rochon ) is a young woman that finally gets the job of her dreams . Not only that , but it seems that she has also found a boyfriend in Shaun ( Danny Wolske ) , it seems that life finally smiles for Maddy after many sad events . Until on a party with Shaun 's friends , they tell her that they created a " club " where members have to kill somebody to enter.<br /><br />Obviously they are joking , but Maddy wants desperately to fit in , that she actually murders someone . After that event , someone starts to kill the rest of the members of the " club " one by one . it is up to Maddy to figure out what is going on as anybody could be the killer , including her.<br /><br />Maddy is a very interesting character wonderfully played by the beautiful Debbie Rochon . It is a very interesting twist on the genre to have the lead actress as part of the suspects . The concept is so original and Rochon 's performance is so good that it is a real shame that Hamilton did n't develop the whole story a little bit better . The movie feels quite slow at times and overall the feeling is the one of a good idea wasted on a bad movie.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is weird in the sense that all the female cast is very good , while the male cast is painfully bad . Danny Wolske is terribly wooden and his performance as a yuppie is quite stereotypical . Julie Strain , Brinke Stevens & Lloyd Kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles . Also , there is lots of nudity ( both male & female ) and the cast is very good looking , so it is really a plus.<br /><br />The low - budget hurts the film in the effects department , as there are very few gory scenes and are not really graphic ( probably because they would look bad ) ; nevertheless , considering the budget , the film at least looks good.<br /><br />Hamilton 's more recent effort , the sexploitational venture " Delta Delta Die ! " , is a better crafted and overall funnier film . While this one is not as bad as other better known films , it still has a lot of flaws and may be interesting only for fans of Debbie Rochon or fans of independent no - budget films . 4/10
0 Maddy ( Debbie Rochon ) is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she bargained for when she goes to a pool party with a handsome coworker . When her date and his friends jokingly say they belong to a ` Murder Club , ' Maddy takes it seriously and moves straight up to ` Level 3 ' by bashing in the brains of a woman in a parking garage ( for denting her car ! ) . But is Maddy also the one donning a plastic mask and killing off other members of the group or has someone else lost it?<br /><br />The plot of this film ( originally titled MAKE ' EM BLEED ) is very poorly conceived , full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ludicrous , out - of - left - field twist ending . Some of the dialogue is downright laughable . I did n't have a problem with Rochon 's performance , but the supporting cast was atrocious . However , I managed to sit through this Full Moon release thoroughly entertained . There 's plenty of skin and blood and it 's the perfect type of flick to sit around with a group of your buddies and pick apart . Horror fans may also enjoy the cameos from Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman ( as Debbie 's parents ) and Julie Strain ( an early victim).<br /><br />Score : 4 out of 10
0 The only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money.<br /><br />I bought it ex - rental for ¬£ 3.00 , it looked interesting , so i took a chance.<br /><br />Within minutes of turning it on i realised i 'd made a mistake . The entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire , where they could meet more of their kind.<br /><br />As for the Devin Hamilton ( Writer and Director ) , he should just be shot , sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish.<br /><br />Avoid this film , If you see it in the shops run away.<br /><br />1/10
0 A killer , wearing a plastic white mask and black overcoat , is killing the friends of Hollywood producer Shawn Banning(Danny Wolske)who inherited his position when someone sliced open his former employer from crotch to chest . Perhaps the psychopath is newly hired Maddy(Dabbie Rochon ) , an attractive , raven haired beauty with a troubled family past , plagued with nightmares . Shawn and his friends play a practical joke on Maddy , concerning a supposed Murder Club they started where each member randomly selected a victim to kill . When Maddy accidentally murders a woman in a parking garage because of a dent put into her car by this person , she finds that Shawn 's pals were jerking her chain . But , Shawn and his comrades are concerned about Maddy 's admittance towards committing the murder and contemplate turning her into the proper authorities . Deciding to wait on a definite decision , each member fall prey to the white - masked psycho with Maddy a suspect considering the fact that she already has killed before . Or , is someone else behind these murders ? Low budget slasher , executive produced by Charles Band , with gore murders that fail to convince . Plenty of tits on display and Allen Nabors goofy character Chris might entertain those with low expectations . The murders include a stomach being opened with intestines showing , a neck sliced , an electrical cord thrown into a pool frying a female victim who had all day to escape , an ax buried into the back of a male victim , and , to top it all , a couple are strangled by a rope during their sexual climax( .. for added effect , the killer uses the breaker bar of a socket wrench as extra leverage to twist the rope as tight as possible snapping their necks ) . There are enough plot holes to drive a truck through , such as why Maddy has nightmares of murders she did n't commit , how she could murder someone so violently( .. with blood all over her)winding up waking in her bed without leaving something at the scene of the crime that would easily implicate her , and how Shawn could go so long , allowing her to continue working at the company despite what she told regarding the murder she committed , and a continual desire to join the supposed club that does n't exist.<br /><br />What bothered me the most was the film 's desire for having us somehow sympathizing with this female protagonist who wanted to join a club after killing someone , later proclaiming it to be an accident . The film builds Maddy as the potential psycho throughout because of her past . Her family disowned her for an abortion . She has black - outs and always appropriately winds up at the scenes of crimes after the fact . In a lot of slashers , the one who seems the most likely killer is often the red herring , but this film goes out of it 's way to point the finger at Maddy . When the twist occurs , we 're left rooting for Maddy , yet we know she 's not right in the head . It 's a tough sell caring for this chick . She does look great in a man 's Army shirt , though . And , Rochon is n't afraid to let her puppies breathe , either . Low budget horror fans will get a kick out of seeing cult favorite Brinke Stevens as a religious fanatical mother who preaches against what Maddy did , calling her a murderer as beloved Troma producer Lloyd Kaufman is the aloof father who can not get in a word edge - wise to protect the daughter he truly cares about . Cult siren Julie Strain has a minor cameo , showing her tits(of course)as the opening murdered male 's girlfriend getting her head crushed by a hammer . Oh , and check out the office for which Shawn works , you 'll see a lot of Full Moon posters and art - work spread throughout the walls .
0 Sadly , more downs than ups . The plot was pretty decent . I mean , nothing out of the ordinary , but it had a story , unlike the other modern horror flicks . The other good thing was the cast . I 'm not saying that the acting was good , because it was n't , but every actor / actress was hot and attractive.<br /><br />One of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so . The rest was quite boring . Another down ( or you could consider it an up if you want ) is the excessive nudity . All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes , and all the guys showed their butts for a long time . It 's not that I 'm against nudity , but this was a horror movie , not ' The Dreamers'.<br /><br />Unless you 're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes , or watch a girl get naked for no reason , or you 're a die - hard fan of Debbie Rochon , than this is the movie for you . But if you 're looking for a good horror movie , stay away .
0 My boyfriend and I rented this because we thought it might be a good ' Halloween ' take - off . A killer terrorizing young people , a white mask ... you get my drift . We were dead wrong ! No pun intended . We not only discovered one of the worst movies out there , but also that it is a cult classic ! It is filled w / plot holes and makes no sense . The actress who plays Maddy is pretty , but that 's about it . I do give credit for it being shot on a VERY low budget -- I always support movies like that . Just not this particular one.<br /><br />This movie may be good to see if you 're drunk or high ; otherwise do n't bother . Unless you want to lose your movie privileges like I did !
0 When you put this DVD into your player and hit " play , " you will experience a brief moment of silence and see a black screen as the laser is guided to the correct starting point in the center of the disc . CHERISH THIS MOMENT . Make sure you have some Tylenol or something ( preferably PM 's so you can fall asleep ) , because you 're going to have a massive headache once this movie starts.<br /><br />Starring a bunch of big - breasted girls and with an opening that actually made me chuckle a bit , I thought I 'd be in for a good time . Sure , the opening sequence was a WEE bit awkward and most of the jokes fell flat and it seemed like this was going to be a Scream ripoff ( by the way , my sole chuckle was from Julie Strain 's final comment in this scene ) . But then I knew there was trouble ... the opening sequence had a terrible rock song . During this terrible rock song , I looked over the DVD Chapter titles and saw things that said " TOPLESS IN THE BACKYARD ! " and " BETTER THAN SEX ! " . I knew what the selling point of this movie was going to be.<br /><br />And that 's the sad truth : The ONLY good thing about this movie is the attractive cast . Other than that , it 's a sadly routine slasher film that throws in an " innovative " concept about murder clubs , which ends up being fake anyway . So , the whole movie then points in another direction to try to be confusing and this huge mystery , but it all just adds up to not being interesting at all and leaves you feeling like you do n't care for any of the characters . I mean , when the main character of the movie is revealed to have murdered an innocent woman , can you really feel ANY sympathy towards her when she 's in fear for her life ? The Scream influence is prevalent throughout , with a ghost face killer and some really terrible jokes . We 're also treated to scenes of the main character talking to her mom and dad ( Lloyd Kaufman ! The only other cool part of the movie ! ) about an abortion or something . Uh . Yeah ... This is n't a " so - bad - it's - good " movie , it 's just BAD.<br /><br />Someone compared this to a Troma film , but ... you know , most any film that comes from Full Moon ( or its offshoot , as this film proves ) is horrible . NOT horrible in a Troma sense -- I 've seen many Troma films , and I can honestly say they all offer something , ANYTHING that you can walk away with and tell your friends about later . However , this film has pretty much nothing at all enjoyable about it . Beware .
0 This mess is so bad it does n't even qualify as horror . < br /><br />Debbie Rochon 's talent is completely wasted in this film . She is not even the villain . The rest of the actors look like porno wannabes and the plot is so lame I wo n't even mention it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip to the end credits to hear upcoming band TwoMarlowe perform " Better Than Sex " it 's total 80 's Disco candy song . Nice up tempo song about Gambleing & Sex . Way more entertaining than " Bleed " . Put it this way , When one has the equipment to copy videos , but decides only to record the song at the end of movie , you have a really " BAD " movie .
0 Let me being by saying the I followed watching this video by watching Saw and after Bleed , Saw looked like the all time greatest horror flick ever even though I thought it was only fairly good . Bleed is pretty bad . The best part is seeing the female cast nude . The gore is very fake looking and over - done . It has its funny parts but its extremely predictable and I did n't want to stay to see the horrible ending . If I could , I would ban these actors and actresses , the only reason being is that Debbie Rochon ( Maddy ) has been in over a hundred other videos and I 've also seen two other members of the cast in equally or worse motion pictures . They should not allowed to continue this madness .
0 Wow ... speechless as to the making of this film , I ca n't say much . The coverbox at the local videostore should 've said it all ... nothing but 6 actors / actresses who get lost on the set of Scream and decide to shoot a movie!<br /><br />The acting was apparently not in the budget , but they were able to afford nudity and good - looking actors ! Style over substance almost makes its mark here , except most of these acting - class failures keep forgetting that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere when they were reading this script . After only 4 or 5 kills by the so - called masked murderer and a confusing tie - in plot about a Murder Club which the dumb lead actress thinks is a real club that she can join ( only if she can get over a girl bumping into her car ) , you want to stab your hands with the nearest sharp object to remind yourself never to get overly excited by a possibly good movie such as this.<br /><br />I feel bad for the people who bought this film and ca n't find anyone to take it off their hands . Another example of what 's wrong with the growing number of straight to video horror releases with no thought put into the essentials . Throw it away if you did buy this .
0 * SPOILERS INCLUDED*<br /><br />With a title like " Bleed " , you know the creative juices were n't running on high when this puppy was conceived . The movie is your basic run - of - the - mill low - budget slasher movie . Oh sure , it tries to be creative with the premise of the " murder club " , but we learn that was just a joke anyways . Okay , for those who really care about these things , the basic plot is that new girl in town starts dating her co - worker . He invites her into his circle of friends , and at a party , they tell her how they have a " murder club " and they murder people , blah blah blah . Well , we learn that it was all a joke , but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage . Now , the " members " of the Murder Club are being killed one by one . Oh , and the bad guys wins and the movie ends on a downer . By that time , you wo n't really care though.<br /><br />In retrospect , the first 10 or so minutes of this movie make no sense . The motivation for the killings in the beginning of the movie is never explained . I would say that it was a way for the director to pad out the film , but on the DVD there are deleted scenes ! I 'm not sure why anyone would want to see more than the feature length version of " Bleed " , but apparently the people behind the DVD thought the viewers would be clamoring for more . On the box , it says there are Easter Eggs , but why the hell I would want to waste my time looking for extras on this movie is beyond me . < br /><br />I was expecting a bad movie , and " Bleed " delivered on that front . It was n't a fun bad movie though . Everyone looks good in the movie , and there 's plenty of nudity , but the acting is just awful . My least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer ... I think he 's supposed to be funny and amusing , but he just ends up coming off as a tool . I think the funniest moment of the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage , in a hilariously unconvincing death . Heroine shoves the women into the parking garage cement pole , and the woman looks like she barely hits the thing , and she spits out a mouthful of blood , and " dies " . < br /><br />For those who think that movie making is an intricate , creative process done by professionals , check out " Bleed " . It will change your mind , and you 'll realize any hack get can a movie made . < br /><br />Otherwise , do n't waste your time or money on this .
0 This is a low - budget " Scream " style movie . " Maddy " is a new worker at a conspicuously - unnamed office , where she meets and starts a relationship with her co - worker " Chris " . During a hot tub - party , Chris and his friends convince Maddy they belong to a " Murder Club " where everyone has killed someone for kicks . When Maddy loses it and kills someone for real , hijinks ensue.<br /><br />The film looks good , and there are the requisites for this genre and budget level ( nudity , gore , maybe a few cameos from slightly bigger stars than the cast ) , but , after the credits roll , you 'll ask yourself why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it .
0 As you all may know , JIGSAW did not make its way to Blackbuster because of a member of Full Moon 's own staff , Devin Hamilton . Devin is the one who sells to all of the video chains . He recently released a movie , BLEED , which he was selling to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW . He convinced the Blackbuster buyer not to take any JIGSAW , and double the number of BLEED . The result is that JIGSAW looks like a flop , and BLEED looks like a hit . The major problem with that is that BLEED is one of the worst movies ever , and as we all know , JIGSAW is , well , gold . I urge all of you to go on to the BLEED page on the internet and vote for the movie that wronged JIGSAW , and all of your talents . Likewise , you should go to the JIGSAW page and cast high votes for it ( if you already have n't ) . We need to get JIGSAW up to at least an 8 or 8.5 , and BLEED down to around a 2 ( thus putting it on the internet 's 100 worst movie listing ) . Also , try to convince friends and family to do the same.<br /><br />Hope you all are doing well , - Matt
0 How many times do we have to see bad horror movies with a killer in a Scream - ripoff mask ? The plot of Bleed is kinda original but the movie itself is a complete failure . For one thing the dialogue is poorly developed , it 's boring and wastes too much time on trivial details , the acting is bad , et cetera . I want my money back , this rental stinks worse than a skunk .
0 For romantic comedies , I often judge the quality of the film based upon the mistiness of my eyes by the end of the experience . Unfortunately for " The Wedding Date , " I can only rate the film with 4 out of 10 possible tears.<br /><br />My apologies to fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney , but I did not see much chemistry between their two characters . The premise of the film is a reverse " Pretty Woman , " with Dermot playing the role of Nick , a high - priced male escort hired by Debra 's character Kat to accompany her to England for her sister 's wedding . A romantic relationship presumably develops between patron and client . But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial . And there were n't enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship of Nick and Kat.<br /><br />In a supporting role , Amy Adams was a standout as Kat 's sister . Whenever Amy came on screen , she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film 's energy . Perhaps if Amy Adams had been cast in the role of Kat , the film might have had more dynamism . But as it turned out , instead of reaching for Kleenex , I was looking for the Visine in attempt to at least pretend that this film had some genuine sentiment and romance .
0 Seriously , I 'm all for gooey romantic comedies and will get sucked into Miss Congeniality as easily as Goodfellas ... but this movie ? It does n't make any sense ! ! ! ! And I 'm not even talking about the willing suspension of disbelief kind of not making sense . Why does her family live in England ? Or , at the very least , why does n't she have a British accent ? She 's sure cozy with her dad and he 's surprisingly forgiving of her not being around for the last two years . ( On that subject , no one ever makes much of a deal about her being away for so long ) . And what was with the goofy outfits at the bachelorette party ? I 'm not even going to get into the fact that the escort she paid for falls in love with her -- that could 've been overcome by better movie - making . I 'm just saying that the characters , the setting , and the plot are n't fleshed out enough to make an even somewhat cohesive story . Oh , and the worst part , in my opinion , is the filmmaker 's consistent use of the most unflattering angles on Deborah Messing 's nose -- I'd have sued the filmmakers if I were her ! I mean , honestly , I 'm all for women being who they are , but why , in seven loyal years of Will and Grace viewing , have I not ever noticed how incredibly odd her nose is ? Oh ! Because those producers are kind to her ! This movie , like my other least favorite movie ever , Armageddon , is the fault of the filmmakers , not the actors . I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better writer , director , and producer.<br /><br />This easily gets my vote as one of the worst movies I 've ever wasted time on . I 'm just glad a friend loaned me her DVD , so all I wasted was time . If there were a way to make this review ZERO stars , I 'd do it .
0 Too Much of Something Borrowed Grade B-<br /><br />Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days at movie theaters every year . Because of this , movie studios tend to avoid releasing bigger budgeted films that weekend . Every few years a studio releases a counter - programming female skewing movie ( 2001 's " The Wedding Planner " ) to compete with the big game . This Super Bowl weekend similarly titled " The Wedding Date " will try to find success and attract viewers not watching the game . < br /><br />Sick of people feeling sorry for her , single - woman , Kat Ellis ( Debra Messing , TV 's " Will and Grace " ) hires male escort Nick ( Dermot Mulrony , " About Schmidt " ) to pose as her boyfriend for her sister 's wedding in London . Her family has been giving her a hard time about her not being married , and her ex- fianc√© of seven years , who dumped her without a reason , is the best man . To make him jealous Kat parades Nick around her ex to make him see what he is missing . But ultimately Nick helps Kat realize that she can open up , and let someone love her.<br /><br />The film borrows too much from similar wedding movies . It is almost a carbon copy of 1999 's " Picture Perfect " and mixes in scenes similar to " The Wedding Planner " and " My Best Friends Wedding " . The movie also has a reverse " Pretty Women " theme going for it , and knowing her audience , the director makes clever references to that and other films.<br /><br />"The Wedding Date " has all the clich√©d elements of a typical wedding movie , there is the stereotypical overbearing mother ( Holland Taylor , " Legally Blonde " ) , and practically plagiarized wedding speeches by the family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner . The twist at the ending has been done before , but it was something that was n't completely expected . The real reason why Kat was dumped comes as a surprise and changes the direction of the film for the last half hour.<br /><br />Even though " The Wedding Date " is predictable , it is able to stand on its own . Debra Messing , in her first lead role , proves she can be charming and funny . Dermot Mulrony has great chemistry with Debra Messing , but most of his dialogue was too corny and unrealistic . He is able to make best of what he is given , and be able to salvage the character . < br /><br />By the use of many clever puns ( often sexual ) , the film is actually funny . Although primarily a chick - flick the film has components everyone can enjoy . The feel good story , and humor make it the best date movie released in a long time .
0 One wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen , like it 's the case with this movie . " The Wedding Date " is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake , under the guise of a new story , something that should have been let alone . If a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos ' approval , then go all out with big stars and glossy production values , that way , people will come for the stars.<br /><br />Alas , that 's not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy . The problem seems to be the way the screen writers have transplanted the story to London , when basically , this seems to be a typical American situation that not even the setting will be able to fix . Then there is the problem with the stars . Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney ? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar!<br /><br />Since the Kat and Nick have no conflict from the start , the viewer is not pulled into the film the way the creators thought they would be . It 's clear that Kat will fall for Nick , and vice - versa in this predictable story . Amy Adams , who was the best asset in " Junebug " , comes across as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie going on and not come clean to the man that loves her and is going to marry her.<br /><br />For anyone interested , the credits at the end of the film run for almost seven minutes !
0 There have been so many many films based on the same theme . single cute girl needs handsome boy to impress ex , pays him and then ( guess what ? ) she falls in love with him , there 's a bit of fumbling followed by a row before everyone makes up before the happy ending ...... this has been done many times.<br /><br />The thing is I knew this before starting to watch . But , despite this , I was still looking forward to it . In the right hands , with a good cast and a bright script it can still be a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours.<br /><br />this was none of these.<br /><br />this was dire.<br /><br />A female lead lacking in charm or wit who totally failed to light even the slightest spark in me . I truly did not care if she " got her man " or remained single and unhappy.<br /><br />A male lead who , after a few of his endless words of wisdom , i wanted to kill . Just to remove that smug look . i had no idea that leading a life of a male whore was the path to all - seeing all - knowing enlightenment.<br /><br />A totally unrealistic film filled with unrealistic characters . none of them seemed to have jobs , all of them had more money than sense , a bridegroom who still goes ahead with his wedding after learning that his bride slept with his best friend .... plus " i would miss you even if we had never met " ! ! ! ! ! i could go on but i have just realised that i am wasting even more time on this dross ..... I could rant about introducing a character just to have a very cheap laugh at the name " woody " but in truth that was the only remotely humorous thing that happened in the film .
0 If Deborah Messing were not already cast as " Grace " , this might be a tolerable film . However , it is simply another story of a frustrated spinster with issues , who hires a paid escort ( Dermot Mulroney ) she reads about in a Time magazine article to travel to London for her sister 's London wedding . How new is this plot?<br /><br />Neither funny , nor remotely romantic , the Wedding Date slides over the storyline of deceptive sex by bride and best man , and paid for escorts to pass off the film as Four Weddings without Hugh , and definitely , a dead end deal for the naive groom who is ignorant to the sexual history of his bride ( Amy Adams ) . While Messing has perfected the repressed princess , 30- something woman with a failed relationship history , her neurotic and drunken moves on yet another faux beau is simply the restating of her TV series . If this woman is an actress , get a role that does not rehash what is already on prime time.<br /><br />Lots of drunken female bonding , cricket visual jokes , and Mulroney in a towel ( nice ! ) , but the film is a bore with the obvious happy ending . Expected Messing sequel : Divorce Date .
0 No cinematic achievements here , however that 's not even the important question . How does it fare in its endeavour to be a competent date movie -- and star vehicle?<br /><br />The formula requires the cute female lead a la Ryan or Aniston -- check ; there 's a built - in TV audience!<br /><br />Add thick - headed , compliant men , usually including the problem ex - boyfriend / fianc√©e -- check . < br /><br />Assemble a plot that maximizes the bankability of the stars . So far , so good.<br /><br />What is the male lead to consist of ? He has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience ( and the gay flight stewards ) instantly swoon . But ... he can not be so hunky as to threaten to the male audience , and he ca n't outshine the star . Roll cameras ... <br /><br />The problem is Messing thinks she 's still in a sitcom ... she has only one presentation : as the wide - eyed doormat that she 's made a career out of . A capable actress might have pulled it off after the love scene , where things promptly nosedive into the soap suds . < br /><br />You ca n't help feeling good for Mulroney ... you can read it in his face that he sees through all of this . He 's gotten all the respect of a lifetime .260 hitter . This time , he smacks one out to the warning track , and no one can figure out what to do , as he amusedly takes home plate .
0 The best thing I can say about this film is that it is well - paced . It did not fall flat . The next best things are the supporting performances by the actor playing foppish groom - to - be Edward , the always marvelous Holland Taylor , and the actor playing Taylor 's husband . The actor helping to critique Messing 's potential outfits in an early scene brings a delightful absurd - yet - winning quality to the proceedings . Okay , that 's about it on the positive side.<br /><br />Dermot Mulroney , whom I adore , is far more believable expressing contempt for Messing than in any scene where he 's attempting to be either businesslike or supporting . As others noted , he appears to have no emotional investment in this enterprise other than wrapping it up as quickly as possible . Messing , on the other hand , sincerely tries to carry the film and to create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney . She is adequate doing so , but is simply not strong enough an actress to pull all of this off without help . Give her an " E " for effort and a " C+ " for achievement . Given Mulroney 's indifference , the one thing that could 've helped Messing would have been a brilliantly cavalier Irons - esquire performance from the actor playing her ex - fianc√© , Jeffrey . Instead , his performance is weak - kneed , mewling , and feckless.<br /><br />If I tried to analyze this one any further , I 'd obviously be paying more attention than most of the people involved . It 's harmless enough to pass time if you have nothing else to do , and less obnoxious ( and less creative ) than The Wedding Singer , but you 're much better off watching " My Best Friend 's Wedding " again .
0 I found this movie to be a great idea , that did n't deliver . It seems they found a way to build suspense , but could n't stage their payoffs very well . In one case the police , are on the clock to find the hideout of the kidnappers . They painstakingly go from dentist to dentist to match a dental record . At the same time , the kidnapped man ( Mason ) escapes through the elevator shaft . After all the build up , the police arrive at the same time he gets free , which is very anti - climatic to say the least . There are also large narration scenes that take us " inside the thinking " of the terrorized husband and wife , which detracts from the suspense rather than adds to it . We are fully aware of their tension , and the voice - over is an insult and robs the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with the fear , as Hitchcock proved time and again , is far more effective . The greatest disappointment , is to sit through the whole movie , and the get the quick , rather bland ending . I mean it just ... "ends " in a snore .
0 The exclamation point in the title is appropriate , albeit an understatement . This movie does n't just cry -- it shrieks loud enough to shatter glass.<br /><br />Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made shrill , humorless suspense thrillers that strove for a semi - documentary feel . Here , they shot on actual New York locations with tinny " real - life " acoustics to jack up the verisimilitude . But the naturalism of the sound recording only serves to amplify the Stones ' maladroit dialog and the mouth - frothing histrionics of tortured butterfly Inger Stevens.<br /><br />In a performance completely devoid of modulation , Stevens plays the wife of electronics whiz James Mason ( looking haggard and bored ) ; both are held captive by extortionist Rod Steiger ( looking bloated and bored ) and his slimy cohorts in a scheme to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that Mason has unwittingly helped construct.<br /><br />Here is another credibility - straining instance of a criminal mastermind so brilliantly attentive to every detail , yet knuckleheaded enough to hire a drug - addicted degenerate as an underling . The Stones ' idea of nail - biting tension is to trap the hysterical Stevens alone with Benzedrine - popping rapist Neville Brand , filling the frame with his sweaty , drooling kisser . But the camera work is so leaden and Brand so ( uncharacteristically ) demure that the effect is hardly lurid , much less suspenseful . The Stones , a square pair at heart , do n't even have the courage of their own lack of convictions.<br /><br />The film , which ends with the portly Steiger chasing the fleet - footed Stevens on a subway train track , is as clumsy as its ungainly heavy . With Angie Dickinson as Steiger 's amoral girlfriend , Jack Klugman , Kenneth Tobey , and Barney Philips .
0 I discovered this movie on IFC , and I thought it would be interesting . For " tiny " love stories , some of the stories really dragged on in this movie . The fact that none of these women had names almost makes you suspect that the actresses were talking about their own real sex lives , including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt . I have to admit , I want to start seeing some more romantic views of first sexual encounters again , like in " Strike!(1998 ) , " when Odette Sinclair 's acquaintances started asking about her presumed first time , and Tweety asked " Was it beautiful?" < br /><br />Some might think re - enactments and flashbacks would improve this movie . I think it would make things even worse . It does n't necessarily have to be hardcore porn to get my attention , but somehow I just expected more .
0 Contrary to another reviewer , I think that this is WELL - written , especially the more fictional it is , because greater imagination would be required ; and well acted , because there were no other characters with whom to share the focus of these dozen - minutes - plus , well - done monologues . But I 'm just not entertained by such solemn , pious rememberances . Everybody has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others . Everybody has problems and some are more intense than others . These are just ten , not - very - atypical stories and problems , exemplifying how anybody 's life ( or part of it ) is fodder for film . Then again , I think poorly of TV 's reality shows , too . So , if that 's your bag , you may like this . It 's the kind of stuff that would make for good ' phone and/or internet gossip ; but absolutely without other - than - verbal action . And , although each of the speakers is female , I 'm gon na leave gender outta this .
0 This is a movie about how men think women think about love . No woman describes a one - night sexual encounter and declares it a love story.<br /><br />Of the ten monologues I felt only three really had any kind of truth ring through them . I kept waiting for the film to get better , and it did a bit , but never better enough.<br /><br />This is an interesting concept , and I kept wanting it to be good , but it never succeeded . Maybe if they actually WERE love stories it would have worked .
0 Evidently lots of people really like this , but I found it infantilising and reasonably offensive codswallop , saved from oblivion by Jane Russell and a couple of memorable musical numbers , especially the opener ( but there 's a marked dip in invention later on ) . I do n't get on with Monroe - she 's supposed to be playing a dumb blonde who ai n't that dumb , but she just comes over as dumb . Russell ca n't quite convince when she claims never to have been in a gymnasium , but is otherwise rather wonderful . The men are staggeringly uninteresting , as is the plot . By no means atrocious , but so patchy that , if this is a classic , God help us all .
0 This film is hardly good , not great at all . A few memorable scenes and the unlucky choice of pairing Norma Jean with an actual actress . Jane Russell has it all working for her , Marilyn 's lesser woman and/or actress . One can only wonder why this is considered being one of the highlights of her lame career . 3/10
0 The Soloist has all ingredients to impress the Academy . Its director , Joe Wright , has already authored a best picture candidate . The leading actor , Robert Downey Jr. , starred in a widely praised superhero film . Finally , the movie itself is a drama . When it was mysteriously pulled from release in late 2008 , filmgoers and critics were baffled . Now that I 've seen it , I assure you Universal did n't just delay this film to promote Iron Man - Oscar buzz . The Soloist is a weak drama with no external conflict that is vastly inferior to any 2009 best picture candidates.<br /><br />Downey and co - star Jamie Fox are n't to be blamed for this mishap . Joe Wright is largely at fault but even he ca n't save a Lifetime story . Many movies are too complex and alienate viewers . This one is unusually simple . It 's a movie about a newspaper reporter , Steve Lopez ( Downey ) , who befriends a homeless musician , Nathaniel Ayers ( Jamie Fox ) . That 's it . Ayers is schizophrenic and does n't resonate with Lopez 's traditional approach to friendship . The two become friends . They begin this movie as acquaintances and are BFFs by its end . Tension consists of moments like this : will Ayers let Lopez take him to the homeless shelter ? This material would have been better suited as a made - for - TV production rather than a feature film.<br /><br />Wright includes many scenes of cheap humor to obscure the lack of content . Lopez battles yard - defiling raccoons in what I consider a sub - plot . Do you remember when this happened in Atonement or Pride and Prejudice ? Those films were structured enough to permit an occasional joke but nothing so prolonged . Ayers ' back story is fleshed out when it does n't need to be . Worst of all , these scenes are not connected and appear at random intervals . It 's a way of admitting that the main story carries little appeal . Nathaniel was a violin prodigy with a tough upbringing ( I was too ) . This is a fabricated attempt to create sympathy with Ayers when most of us already have it . He 's a homeless schizophrenic for crying out loud ! The movie somewhat conveys humanity 's love for music , like Amadeus and Beethoven Lives Upstairs . It is n't as effective as either of those pictures , however . The entire film is hinged on Ayers ' schizophrenia . It ultimately is how he interacts with everyone else . His being a musician is a nice touch but hardly worth including . The film does n't incorporate this characteristic fully into his persona . Take music out of Amadeus or Beethoven Lives Upstairs , and no film remains . The Soloist is more about friendship in general than music . Nathaniel could be a writer or film critic and few lines of dialog would need to be seriously altered.<br /><br />This is only Joe Wright 's third film , and his first that is n't a romance staring Keira Knightley . Let 's hope this film is n't an indication of how limited his abilities are . There are stylistic nods to his earlier works but The Soloist is much weaker than either of them . In his defense , Universal should not have agreed to widely release this picture . This film seems tailored for Imagine Entertainment ( distributors of Changeling ) . I would n't be so disappointed with it if had a limited release . Its poor box office performance may inhibit better dramas from being distributed nationally .
0 Anyone who has seen ' Shine',Scott Hicks film of the heartbreaking yet ultimately joyful life of the pianist David Helfgotts ; will I am sure realise that ' The SOLOIST ' is very poor in comparison . It is as slow as a lullaby ( I took five breaks answering emails just to wake up ) . The depiction of the homeless area way over the top and extremely self indulgent , on a par I fear with the awful beach battle depiction in Joe Wrights other disaster Attonment . .J Fox performance was an extremely poor example of acting and lacked credibility from the offset . Downey on the other hand ; although struggling with a badly paced film , still manages to charm,9Is it me or is he turning into George Clooney in more ways than one ? ) . Comparing both these well known so called ' STAR'actors though is unnecessary as the light that shines brightest as far as acting is concerned must be that of ' shine 's ' Geoeffry Rush who 's brilliant performance definitely SHONE far brighter in my sky . With both ' Attonment ' and ' The Soloist ' the written word wins far more prizes for empathy of subject . Read the book and articles or wait for the DVD its bound to be in the bargain basement soon .
0 What could have been an engaging - and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor . Fox is OK as Nathaniel Ayers , the Julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row . Looking for a good story to boost his flagging career , reporter Steve Lopez { Robert " rehab " Downey } gets to know him and tells his story . Taking every element of the classic " how we hit the skids " movies , borrowing very liberally from " A Beautiful Mind " , taking the bogus " feel good " attitude of films like " Rocky "- you pick the sequel number - and whipping up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie . It is corny , trite , utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments . I hate to say it , but this is the kind of movie that , if you say you hated it , people will give you bad looks . I really wish I could say something positive about this film , but I really ca n't . The acting redeems it somewhat , but not enough for me to give it more than one star . Strictly made for TV movie stuff . Not worth your time .
0 When you pick a movie I hope one factor you will consider , are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way ? This is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society . When a comedian / actor makes curl sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves ( do I want to support that behavior ) ? In this case Mr. Foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong , good behavior from bad that loving - kindness is better than hatefulness . Mr. Foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from . Saying sorry does not get him off the hook . It will not undue the hurt or remove the bad behavior he spreads to our youth . One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it . No longer see anything they are part of . We can not change them but we can stop the fame we give them .
0 Charlotte 's deadly beauty and lethal kicks make the movie cooler than it 'd be otherwise . The story is so poor and Charlotte 's character dies in such a foolish way , that you wonder if this 's the ending they had thought of for this movie . I wish somebody could tell that an alternative ending exists , but I fear it does n't . As for the rest of the cst , well I 'd say they simply did n't act very well ; although the blame should be put on the poor script . This movie reminds me of Rush Hour 2 where Zhang Ziyi dies in absurd way , since she had been the only one who had stolen the show during the whole movie . I could give this movie 2/5
0 You ever sit through a movie and after it 's all over it 's like one big " wtf ! ? " . < br /><br />Welcome to Decoy . < br /><br />Another straight to video action fodder flick you can immediately forget about having watched or better yet do n't watch it at all . Peter Weller and Robert Patrick star and are quickly wasted in this going nowheres fast mercenaries - for - hire action dud where the story is pretty darn bad and the action sucks and what 's the point of watching an action flick if the action blows ? Robert Patrick in particular hits a new low in an action sequence that has him firing a machine gun while standing on the hood of a moving school bus . Co - stars the ambient Charlotte Lewis and Canada 's own Scott Hylands ( of TV 's Night Heat fame ) .
0 A pointless movie with nothing but gratuitous violence . The only fun I had was playing " spot the location " , as much of it was filmed in my home town of Regina , Saskatchewan . I like to support locally produced films but this one was a major disappointment .
0 Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a comedy . Sadly and annoyingly , here it is , flaccid and cheesy and overbaked from Lala land . How did the di - erector get it so wrong ? Well , mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously . Unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay clich√© ( but somehow cute) ... or is that clich√© piled upon clich√© . No value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sant 's GERRY ..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER how is it all such a lead weight ? Well this auteur must have soooooo mad that he did n't get to Burt and BOOGIE first that he had to make his own . Convoluted and undeveloped apart from the ' unrequited love 's a bore ' theme left over from a faded Streisand lyric , we have only moody beefcake and TV serial level storyline left . The un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the Gerries into to desert and gets stuck there . In Oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called MONEYSHOT . Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY it too suffered from an auteur more awful than Orson so they re - filmed half of it , got a ruthless TV editor to chop it up and down down to 72 minutes and hey - presto .. comedy , tonight ! A lesson there in when bad films turn good by lightening up . I guess THE FLUFFER stiffed on release and after seeing it not perform , I can understand why .
0 This is a great idea for a film but it , unfortunately , does n't turn out to be a great movie . What starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a Fluffer in love with his Fluffee spirals out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a veritable stew of plots , with liberal borrowings from BOOGIE NIGHTS , THELMA AND LOUISE , SHOWGIRLS , FRISK , and even a curious " dash " of 400 BLOWS thrown in towards the end . ( At least the director did his research ! ) The result is not necessarily boring but , in the end , this slick , well - produced flick does n't quite add up to anything . However , the actors all do a game job with the material and there are a few good laughs at the behind - the - scenes world of gay porn.<br /><br / >
0 I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine . It was n't a highly recommended one by the critic . The storyline is different and I am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands . Directing and acting were awful ! ! I had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs . Although the movie started promisingly , it got worse and worse . I think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters .. I still think that it is worth watching as I have n't seen films subjecting gay porn . Do n't keep your expectations high though , then you will be very disappointed . * out of * * * * *
0 This was god awful . The story was all over the place and more often than not I was confused because of horrible editing . I felt no sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough . They were extremely superficial people with no dimension . Cheesy , cheesy stereotypes with subplots that went nowhere . The stripper chick was just a distraction , even if she was decent looking . I do n't know what this was attempting to be , but how shocked was I when they showed this trash on Sundance ? I almost cancelled my subscription . You 'd think a channel like that would show more quality films . There are much , much better gay and lesbian themed films out there . " The Celluloid Closet " is an excellent documentary . I thoroughly enjoyed " Wigstock : The Movie " . I 'm sure there are others that have slipped my mind at the moment , but what I 'm trying to say is that this just was n't worth it . If you catch it on TV , ok , but otherwise do n't bother.<br /><br />There were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice ( sad I can count them on one hand ) , otherwise the cinematography was pretty crappy as well . The lighting was way off in a lot of places . I think some of the effects were used to try and add to something that just had practically nothing going for it.<br /><br />I ca n't deny Johnny Rebel is pretty hot ( without the blond hair of course ) . Too bad his acting did nothing for me . Stick with real porn , buddy.<br /><br />3/10 .
0 The Fluffer may have strong elements of porn industry truth to it - but that does n't make up for the fact that it 's pretty shabbily directed and acted - and with a very mediocre script.<br /><br />B grade from start to the exceedingly drawn out finish.<br /><br />It would be embarassing to think of the general public being offered this piece as an example of state of the art gay film making.<br /><br />Hopefully it has a limited life in the gay film festival circuit and is allowed to die a natural death on video.<br /><br />This film will open the Queer Film Weekend in Brisbane on April 10 , 2002 . I think its success there will be strongly influenced by the amount of alcohol consumed in the preceding cocktail party - they 're gon na need it .
0 I entered the theatre intending to pass a pleasant 90 minutes being entertained if not enlightened . I left neither entertained nor enlightened . This movie ca n't make up its mind what it wants to be and ends up being not much of anything . There are a few funny lines and a few incredibly pretentious movie references ( The 400 Blows -- for this character ? come off it ! ) . While none of the characters gets treated with much respect , the over thirty gay men get the worst of it : all predatory , fat , sad , slobs . If you 're in the mood for a movie dealing with gay relationships check out Parting Glances , Longtime Companion , Trick , All Over the Guy , Red Dirt , Maurice , Philadelphia instead . You 'll thank me.<br /><br / >
0 Oh , well , this movie starts off well . It 's kinda funny and seems like it could be a fun movie . Then it becomes a bit serious and goes off the rails . It sort of wants to be ' Boogie Nights ' but it ca n't achieve it . If only it stayed with the tone of the first quarter of the film ...
0 But this movie was a bore . The history part was fine but the musical part was not . Not one song I cared about and no soundtrack to be heard.<br /><br />If Sweet Jesus " was suppose to be comic relief it never work . If John Adams was suppose to be the obnoxious annoying one , the rest of them were trying to overthrow him in every scene.<br /><br />Hancock and Jefferson were the only bearable characters in the whole movie.<br /><br />The historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their historical context were interesting enough but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical.<br /><br />Shouldn't you be humming the songs after a musical , except for a few chirps , nothing else was worth the breath .
0 I guess you have to give some points for the sheer courage of writing a musical around a history lesson but how about some decent music ? < br /><br />Is the cartoonish acting of Howard DeSilva meant to pique the interest of otherwise jaded children ? < br /><br />Is William Daniels ' campy contemporary ( for the time ) acting style meant to appeal to a 1960s/70s demographic ? < br /><br />Do we need all the " in - jokes " about NY & NJ ? ( I can hear the blue - haired Broadway audience guffawing on cue . ) < br /><br />Sorry , I find the whole piece dated , boring & the acting far too strident for the screen
0 1993 was the year . This was long before Phillip Seymour Thomas had won an Oscar . Who knew I would be an extra in a movie with him ? I was actually a paid extra in " My Boyfriend 's Back , " which was shot in a suburb of Austin called Georgetown , TX . The original title was " Johnny Zombie " ( thank God the producers had a change of heart ! ) I was in the theater scene . I rushed out to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters . It is more of a comedy than a horror movie . But ... for a good laugh , you might want to check it out . Nothing that is even close to " Dawn of the Dead " or even " Shaun of the Dead " quality , but the cheese factor is good enough . ciao
0 I have seen over 1000 movies and this one stands out as one of the worst movies that I have ever seen . It is a shame that they had to associate this garbage to The Angels 1963 song " My Boyfriend 's Back . " If you have to make a choice between watching this movie and painful dental work , I would suggest the dental work .
0 I 'm easily entertained . I enjoyed " Hot Shots " and " The Naked Gun " and their many sequels , even when most people found them unbearable . I 've even managed to enjoy most Pauly Shore movies . There is only one movie that I 've seen that I can honestly say was bad ... and this was it . It 's been a while since I 've seen it , but I do remember sitting in the theater thinking , " This is a dumb movie . Why did I see this ? " It 's honestly the only movie that I can not recommend .
0 Turn your backs away or you 're gon na get in big trouble out of MY BOYFRIEND 'S BACK ! Only a happy ending can bloom your innocence that is full of gloom and doom at the very moment you 're watching this . It 's safe to say that the entire movie falls apart , with a sarcastic approach and tribute to zombie shows that defy nonsense to the max . We get a name like " Johnny " every so often , and this " Johnny " has nowhere to go . There is n't a specific reason to why our " dead corpse " crawls out of his grave just to survive until prom night , so that renders the movie totally useless . Without a feeling of sorrow , his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he 's dead . Johnny takes a bite out of Eddie 's arm afterwards . The viewer is asked a tough question : Why does the movie have to be this cornball ? There is an answer . Any resemblance to all persons living or dead is purely coincidental . " Living " is a coincidence . " Dead " has nothing in common with the movie . Show this one to your girlfriend and she 'll skip the senior prom , turning your life into a deserted ruin . Blah ! ! !
0 Please make me forget . Please . Please . This is the worst film I have ever had the misfortune to watch . I consider the film an insult to my brain as well as my backside who both have suffered from me sitting and watching this film . I have yet to see what damage it has caused my sight and my ability to complete sentences . What a load of garbage ! ! And do n't get me started about the acting ... Someone please help me forget ! ! " Weird Science " -- come back ! ! Everything is forgiven ... <br /><br />I am " proud " to give this film the first 1 here at IMDb ... And I 've voted for hundreds of films ... Many of them c**p but this is so bad I ca n't even believe it . Someone actually came up with the idea and thought it was worthy of becoming a film ? Someone actually read the script and decided to produce the film ? Someone read the script and auditioned for it ? Someone saw the film and decided * not * to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity ? * These * are the questions I want answers to . Not the philosophical question about that tree in the woods and well , you know ...
0 I saw this move several years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival if I recall . I liked it , it showed great potential . I guess most people here are blasting this film because the film did seem hobbled together ( by the filmmaker 's own admission on the official site -- the short was exhibited as a " rough - cut").<br /><br />But nonetheless , it was an easy - going comedy . I think many people try to read far too much into a comedy . All they are supposed to do is make you laugh -- that 's all . I did just that at its showing , so it succeeded on that level . Just my 2 Cents Anyway .
0 This film is just a shame . Orlando , Florida seems to becoming a more recognized filmmaking area ( like Vancouver 's rise to prominance ) . The Brothers was shot in Central Florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area ( which made great strides with the Indie film Walking Across Africa and the great HBO miniseries From Earth To The Moon).<br /><br />I will try to be as honest as possible . I think Orlando was the perfect place to film The Brothers . It had the potential to give a new spin on the ' Boy Band ' craze . After all , both N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys come from this area . But , The Brothers falls short probably because of a weak script . Both lead characters are flat with almost no development ( part of this could be the amatuer actors , but some of it is certainly the way the script was written).<br /><br />Also a problem is the choice of jokes . Many of the jokes are too repetitive ( they do come off funny the first time , but it does grow to be a bit boring ) . Some of the ' concert ' scenes are staged poorly ( and many of these scenes also do n't seem to move the story along in any way).<br /><br />I had high hopes for this one , but alas its a disappointing effort . I also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short . But I think the best thing for filmmaker John Figg is to move to different genres ( quickly ) . Comedy is n't his strong suit . But , its indisputable that he definitely is one of the more prominant filmmakers in the Orlando area ( its just a shame that right now he 's infamous , not famous).<br /><br / >
0 this is just a terrible ' comedy ' -- it really is a bad film . there are no funny elements . no jokes that are funny . i do n't know how some people can claim this dismal short film could be ' smartest ' or ' quality . ' perhaps if its the only film that a person has seen you can make that claim of the brothers . but , i have seen thousands of better films : namely leonard part six ( now , that 's funny ) ! i do n't know how the brothers is even considered eligible to be listed on the internet movie database : its more like a home video than an actual film.<br /><br />jokes aside , just skip this film . a root canal is more enjoyable that this cliche - ridden unfunny material .
0 I noticed that this film has taken the brunt of a lot of insults . It probably earned some of them , but it was n't that bad . Well , I 'll be honest : I never want to see this film again . It was a bad film . But I do n't hate this film , it tried to tell a story . As a drama , this film could work very well actually . I just think the filmmakers misgauged which road to take when they made this ( they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy ) . With a rewrite , it could have been a great film . But as a satire , it did n't work in its current form -- many scenes did not fit within the context of the plot : for example , the robbery scene makes little sense in the story . Still , it was n't the worst independent film ever made -- is it in the Top 10 Worst ? That 's debatable .
0 i ca n't figure out who greenlighted this thing ! it has no redeeming qualities , none , nada , zip , zilch.<br /><br />the acting was bad . the directing was bad . the writing was bad . the plot was bad . the music was bad . the editing was bad . .... well , at least the filmmakers were consistent .
0 I have been an environmentalist for years and was really looking forward to this show . I had it set to record all episodes because I thought I could really learn some great new things . I probably could if I could get past Rachelle.<br /><br />I'm sure a lot of this is staged to seem like a reality show and appeal to that class of viewer . It does n't work for someone who 's really interested in improving the planet.<br /><br />This show should be called Nagging with Rachelle.<br /><br />Since Ed is such a great font of information , maybe a second show that 's really serious about the environment would be a good idea . Dumbing things down is not necessary for some of us . < br /><br />I no longer record episodes or watch the show , but do let me know if a real green show may be in the works .
0 Is there a movement more intolerant and more judgmental than the environmentalist movement ? To a budding young socialist joining the circus must seem as intimidating as joining a real circus . Even though such people normally outsource their brain to Hollywood for these important issues , the teachings of Hollywood can often seem fragmented and confusing . Fortunately Ed is here to teach neo - hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism.<br /><br />Here you 'll learn the art of wagging your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark smirk . You 'll learn how to shrug off logic and science with powerful arguments of fear . You 'll learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by labeling it as the gateway to planetary Armageddon.<br /><br />In addition to learning how to lie with a straight face you 'll also learn how to shrug off accusations that are deflected your way no matter how much of a hypocrite you are . You 'll be able to use as much energy as Al Gore yet while having people treat you as if you were Amish.<br /><br />In the second season was even more useful as we were able to visit other Hollywood Gods , holy be thy names , and audit - i.e. judge - their lifestyles . NOTE : This is the only time it 's appropriate for an envirofascist to judge another because it allows the victim the chance to buy up all sorts of expensive and trendy eco - toys so that they can wag their finger in other people 's faces.<br /><br />What does Ed have in store for us in season three ? Maybe he 'll teach us how to be judgmental while sleeping !
0 " Algie , the Miner " is one bad and unfunny silent comedy . The timing of the slapstick is completely off . This is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they 're supposed to be funny or not . However , the actual quality of the film is irrelevant . This is mandatory viewing for film buffs mainly because its one of the earliest examples of gay cinema . The main character of Algie is an effeminate guy , acting much like the stereotypical " pansy " common in many early films . The film has the homophobic attitude common of the time . " Algie , the Miner " is pretty awful , but fascinating from a historical viewpoint . ( 3/10 )
0 To say Funky Forest : The First Contact is a bad movie is an understatement of incredible proportions . I can really get into a good art house film , even a surreal and twisted romp like El Topo , Naked Lunch , and Survive Style 5 + , because those movies actually have something worth discussing when the credits roll.<br /><br />FFFC attempts at every avenue to be this deep and intellectual , essentially there is no substance in this movie . This movie is badly done , the visuals in this movie are not inspiring , the dialog is worse , the musical numbers destroy this movie .. I chuckled for GUITAR BROTHERS , but that was immediately wiped out by something completely unnecessary , and irrelevant . It attempted to be deep and meaningful I think , but its just pretentious disoriented nonsense . Freshman film students without a camera could craft something more interesting.<br /><br />Guitar Brothers and the stand up routines in between skits get 1 point each , everything else is just badly paced , pseudo - creative , heavy handed attempts at being AS good as films by other REAL directors like , Sogo Ishii , David Lynch , and Jodoworsky . Give me a break . I am convinced that people that rave about FFFC are doing so because they have no idea of what they saw , because it was nothing but mild pertinent statements here and there mixed with stupidity and blended until you puke on your own shoes.<br /><br />This movie was an extreme disappointment , coming off the high that was Survive Style 5 + , a film that actually has meaning , combined with excellent use of scenery , cinematography , catchy dialog , funny moments , good soundtrack , excellent performances , fantastic pacing and flow . FFFC features the exact opposite in every way , boring scenery ( 20 minutes staring at a bland beach at night ? a completely white stage ? Alien balls floating in white space ? a dinky school hallway and then a ... school hallway ? ) , terrible cinematography , forgettable dialog , nothing funny or humorous , save the fact you just wasted your life for two hours , soundtrack ? , amateurish performances , uneven , disjointed , and often flat out dragging pacing , zero flow whatsoever.<br /><br />There are those that claim this is what makes FFFC a great movie , that it is so unconventional at every turn that its pure genius . This is simply a way to stroke your own ego it seems , because " unpredictable " could be a good quality for a film if it was n't coupled with " boring " , " innane " , and " terrible " . Personally I have spoken with two people who admitted to me that FFFC was terrible when they left the theater , but overwhelming rave by art - house elitist made them watch the movie again and then come back to me with a ... " Hey it was pretty good I liked it".<br /><br />I'm going to put my foot down , this movie is slop , I do n't care if Roger Ebert says this film is the best thing he 's ever watched since he lost his own virginity . " The Emperor 's new cloak " I say ... this movie is no way indicative of the other psychedelic / trippy films to come from Japan in the last 10 years . Taste of Tea , Party 7 , and Kamikaze Girls are much better movies ( even with a low budget ) , and none can honestly compare with Survive Style 5 + . Watch FFFC only if your interested in making a pretentious pile of nothing on a shoestring budget .
0 Crazed Shotgun toting - incest driven - revenge seeking truck drivers & obsessive control disorder " daddy raped me when I was 12 " handcuff carrying , all latex wearing prostitutes is just a few of the character you will be introduced to in this complete disgrace of a movie that can easily be viewed on any cable TV station ( IE : Skinemax ) at 4 am on Sunday nights . ( ¬Ö And yes I know that was an entire sentence , but bare with me people ; this is a long - winded review for a short pointless film).<br /><br />Filmed in " somewhere " Canada , with almost no budget , the plot to this freak show is trite , the police in it obviously never heard of " State Jurisdiction " because they end up chasing both Miya ( Hookers ) and Trent ( idiotic , Anal Retentive , Generic , insecure College Student ) all across the U.S. ( and I thought only the FBI could do that ) . The camera is shaky , the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad it might actually cause unintentional acid flashbacks to movies like " Ishtar " and " Leonard Part 6".<br /><br />As far as the Skin scenes go ( which is the only reason to even rent this movie , do n't even think of buying it ) there are two of them . The first one is the only one worth watching though which is the Dominatrix Sex scene with Kari Salin and _ _ _ _ ( insert unknown actor here , he 's obviously done nothing else worth noting ) in a seedy , disgusting Motel room ( the kind with the busted sink that drips , and the soda machine outside that only has blue tonic water left in it ) . It 's all S&M ( riding crops , handcuffs , hot wax , and underwear licking ) folks and in the end , he gets left in a motel room , with no money and cops waiting at his door ( that 's goes to show you guys , do n't let a hooker tie you up in a " middle - of - nowhere " motel room ) . Sadly though , Kari shows no skin worth remembering , and that alone can cause deep - seeded traumatic experiences for some gentlemen , so that is definitely a downer towards this flick.<br /><br />As for the ending , * Snicker*Snicker * I know you probably would n't mind if I revealed it to you but I wo n't , you should spend your hard earned money for that one . All in all I give it a 1/5 for action , a 3/5 for Skin ( See last paragraph ) and a 0/0 for acting , character development or intricate plot twists.<br /><br />- Laughing Man
0 ( There are Spoilers ) Homicidal nymphomaniac hooker Miya , Kari Wuhrer , takes over the life and car of 18 virgin , even though he 's too embarrassed to admit it , collage freshmen Trent Colbert , Kristoffer Ryan . By the end of the movie Myia not only deflowers but give poor innocent and naive Trent a lesson in how to spot a dangerous nut job and keep as far away for him , or her , in order to keep from ending up turning into one . < br /><br />Hanging around a trucker rest - stop Miya is picked up by Roy , Burt Young , for some hot and heavy action , in the back seat of his buggy . Roy is either too drunk or stupid to realize that Miya is non other then his estranged daughter ! Outraged that Miya is reluctant to get it on with him Roy almost strangles her to death only to be interrupted by first year collage student Trent Colbert who plows into the rest - area side swiping one of the truckers . < br /><br />Seeing her chance Miya jumps into Trent 's car and the two are off in what turns out to be the weirdest car chase ever put into a movie . Going all across the North Eastern USA the two end up involved in a truck car smash - up a murder and a shootout with the state troopers that then leads to Trent 's parents home , with them being held hostage . It 's there that there 's another wild shootout between the crazed Miya with an entire SWAT team reinforced by the local police and state troopers . < br /><br />You would expect a movie like " Hit and Run " to be intentionally or unintentionally funny but it 's not . In fact the film is very disturbing in how Miya treats everyone in the film that she comes in contact with even her perverted and child - molesting father Roy . Getting Trent to drive her all over the North - East Miya gets the poor slob drunk having it on with him in a motel room , together with whips handcuffs and a lighted candle . Miya also gets it on with the motel owner the horny Mr. Foster by tricking him into giving her his gun , as being part of some weird sex game . After holding Foster up she takes off with Trent 's , who out cold in his motel room , wallet with some $ 400.00 in it yet does n't bother to drive away with his car . < br /><br />Needing the money to pay for gas to get home to his parents for Thanksgiving Trent gets a call on his cellphone from Miya to pick her up at a local diner to get his money back . Like the jerk that he is Trent picks up Miya , who 's now a fugitive from he law , and later gets involved with her father Roy on the open highway as he tries to run both Trent & Miya off the road . < br /><br />The chase ends up in this deserted wear - house that Roy chases Miya , out running him on a muddy road in high - heels , into with him getting it in the you know where with a blast from his own shotgun . Roy was so busy trying to take his pants off that he forgot he left the gun unattended . < br /><br />With both a holdup and murder , as well as a hit and run , charge against them the two desperadoes stop off at a S&M / Tattoo boutique where Trent gets his ear and nose pierced and is dressed up in leather and chains , by Myri , together with a matching his and hers dog collar . This in order to meet his straight - laced and conservative parents for Thanksgiving Dinner . < br /><br />Having a running shootout with the state troopers , with one of them ending up badly injured , the two fugitives from the law end up at Trent 's parents Mr & Mrs Colbet , David Keith & Elaine Martyn home with the entire local police force , with a SWAT team , waiting for them there . < br /><br />Obnoxious movie with a truly disturbing final ending that made you wonder what exactly the movie was trying , if at all , to tell it 's audience . You felt a lot of sympathy for Miya at first but as the movie rolled along to it 's downbeat ending that evaporated as fast as a tray of ice cubs in Death Valley . Even though Roy was the most unlikable person in the movie at first by the time the film ended Miya totally eclipsed him .
0 I 've had a thing for this Kari chick for a while , and as far as how she looked in this movie , no complaints . But after catching it last night in HIGH DEFINITION , I am certain : that 's the only thing in the movie that is n't substandard . The script is horrible , the acting is horrible , the direction is horrible . I saw in another comment someone commenting on how great the sex scenes were ... what ? Not at all . When a movie is this bad you might as well just turn it into softcore porn , but instead I get to see some pasty white dude blocking me from seeing Wuhrer 's body and scenes that offer me nothing except a tease . They should have just gone cinemax so that the movie was n't a complete waste of time , but no . With a script this awful they should 've capitalized on Wuhrer 's looks , since that 's the lone pro of the movie . 2/10 , only because she looked so hot .
0 I actually had hopes for this movie since I 've seen Kari in a few other things and think she has some talent . Alas , this dud is a case study in what not to do in a screenplay . Completely undefined characters without a shred of likeability , and no plot whatsoever . Is it a road / buddy / comedy / thriller / romance / drama ? The filmmakers do n't have a clue , and neither do we .
0 Run away from this movie . Even by B - movie standards this movie is dreadful . It is also insidious in it 's theme . The main theme is that people who reject society and have no respect for anything are cool and worth admiring . People who treat others with respect are losers . Guncrazy is a movie that speaks for the disenfranchised a lot better than this movie , see it instead.<br /><br />No normal kid would do what Trent does . State Troopers do not work as they do in this film etc . Seeing this movie makes you realize why writers use the hooker - with - a - heart - of - gold cliche . Mija is a completely unsympathetic hooker , who yes , has had a terrible life . However , she is such a terrible person the audience can not identify with her.<br /><br />Usually there is one thing a movie can be recommended for , in this case there is none . It is such a ridiculous movie it insults the person who tries to identify with the main characters . The acting is adequate by B - movie standards and the direction presents nothing new or interesting .
0 During a sleepless night , I was switching through the channels & found this embarrassment of a movie . What were they thinking?<br /><br />If this is life after " Remote Control " for Kari ( Wuhrer ) Salin , no wonder she 's gone nowhere.<br /><br />And why did David Keith take this role ? It 's pathetic!<br /><br />Anyway , I turned on the movie near the end , so I did n't get much of the plot . But this must 've been the best part . This nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix - ish girl ... this scene is straight out of the comic books -- or the cheap porn movies . She calls the mother anal retentive and kisses the father " Oh , I did n't expect tongue ! " Great lines!<br /><br />After this , I had to see how it ended .. <br /><br />Well , of course , this bitch from hell has a helluva past , so the SWAT team is upstairs . And yes ... they surround her ! And YES YES ! The kid blows her brains out ! ! ! ! AHAHHAHAHAHA!!<br /><br />This is must - see TV . < br /><br / >
0 MY EYES ! IN THE NAME OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY MAKE ME UNSEE THIS MOVIE ! what drugs are you people on ! this could very well be the worst movie ever ! i felt like i was on a bad acid trip the whole time , i need to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster . From start to finish glow ropes is an unholy masterpiece of satanic cinema . when i thought to watch this movie with my Jewish best friend and his family we thought " oh hey , this may be funny ! it will probably be bad but still a little funny " how wrong we were , we were not prepared for how awful this movie could be . All of my friends lined up for lobotomies as soon as the film was over , and during the course of the movie , one of my friends attempted to hang himself with his belt while another tried to slit his wrists with a wooden spoon . I wish I had watched the video from The Ring instead , that way the pain and suffering would be over in only seven short days . For all who wish to see this movie , YOU ARE NOT PREPARED ! you may think you are some sort of " tough guy " by renting this but this movie will break you , push you to the ground and urinate on you .
0 I sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations . My expectations were no where near low enough . I honestly could not tell what genre this movie was from watching it , and if it was a comedy , the humor was completely missed . The plot was nonexistent and the acting was horrendous . My friends and I managed to watch approximately 30 to 40 minutes of this film before we turned it off and promptly begged the video store to take it back . I do NOT recommend this movie to anyone unless you are purposely trying to watch the worst movies of all time . I honestly do n't know how this film lasted more than a day in theatres and moreover I can not understand why anyone would willing watch it , considering not only it 's very uninteresting title but also the lack of any famous actors / actresses in it 's cast . This review is not a joke and I honestly think this could possibly be the worst movie ever made . It 's certainly the worst movie I 've ever had to sit through .
0 I can only assume that the other reviewers of this " film " are stockholders in the production company , as this was quite possibly the worst movie I 've seen in the last five years . From the opening shot of a Rabbi laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason , it was clear that the actors in this film would kill to be considered " B - Level . " Both my wife and I were in a great mood before starting this film , and we were genuinely looking forward to a funny popcorn movie . We knew we had n't rented Citizen Kane , and we were n't expecting to see the most amazing movie ever . However , after 40 minutes of enduring the most painfully unfunny bit of garbage I 've ever seen , we shut it off instead of wasting another minutes of our lives.<br /><br />If a " comedy " with no laughs , terrible acting , thin plot and annoying characters are your thing , then this film is for you . Honestly , Troll 2 is better -- at least I laughed at the popcorn sex scene.<br /><br />I can not justify writing a longer review of this picture because I 've already wasted almost an hour trying to find one joke .
0 This movie is pretty awful but I have some interesting information about it:<br /><br />It was filmed in 1976 at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff , AZ , as well as at Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona , AZ . A good bulk of the extras in the film are then - drama students from NAU . I was a freshman there that year , minoring in theatre , but for some reason I did n't get involved with the production . I did however know several people who did and can supply this rather odd fact:<br /><br />There is a scene in this movie where two of the principals , as part of their hazing ritual , have to run naked into the woods . They are seen from behind in the movie , doing just that . The thing is , those are n't the actors at all but two guys I knew from the theatre department . The identity of these " stunt posteriors " will remain anonymous , at least to this website , unless they decide to , um , " reveal " themselves !
0 " The Hazing " is one of them films I always wanted to see solely based on the illustrated cover image here on IMDb . Yes , that 's how shallow I am ! I do n't care if ten million people call it a crap movie , the poster looks awesome so I guess I 'll just have to see it ¬Ö  Now , " The Hazing " can somewhat be described like its alternate title : curious ! The poster and title make it sound like a genuine horror movie set on campus and dealing with sinister initiation rites , but this movie is actually more of a crossbreed between comedy and thriller . First of all , there 's something very wrong with the tagline on the old VHS box I watched . It says : He had good grades , a good girl and good buddies ¬Ö  until they put him through the Hazing " . That 's not the case , actually . Protagonist Gilbert Lewis is finally accepted by an acclaimed campus through an athletics scholarship . It takes over half the movie before we even hear about his girlfriend back home and the only " buddy " he has is a very nerdy Charles Martin Smith ( still with hair in this film ) . Both of them are approached to become members of the prestigious " Delts " fraternity , but during their hazing exam ¬ñ in which they have to descend a mountain dressed in their tidy white undies ¬ñ Barney falls off a cliff and breaks his leg . When Lewis returns with the other frat boys , Barney froze to death already . Together they intended to keep the body frozen for five days and then claim he never returned from a weekend ski - trip . With Barney 's body hidden in the cafeteria freezer , Lewis has to cover for him so that Barney 's absence does n't look suspicious . The set - up of " The Hazing " is quite original and potentially innovative , but the problem here is that the execution could easily have been a lot better . The tone is too steady and too serious for a comedy movie , even a black one , but on the other hand there are n't any proper attempts to build up suspense or thrills , neither . The soundtrack is cheerful and full of light - headed tunes , but that 's nearly not enough to make this film a comedy . Around an hour into the film , the plot also runs out of steam and idea , and the makers have no better alternative to fill up the emptiness with romantic compilations of Lewis and his outer town girlfriend biking through the countryside . I did n't like the final twist , because it 's quite implausible and because it has been done numerous times before and after ( though admittedly after ) . " The Hazing " is not a complete waste of time , but still I 'm glad I found an ex - rental tape at a friend 's house instead of having to spend any money on the recently released DVD .
0 There is not a speck of entertainment in this entire film . There 's not one scary , funny , or even interesting scene in this film . It advertises itself as a horror , then goes on to call itself a comedy . It does n't even ATTEMPT humor . Neither does it attempt to be scary.<br /><br />In order to not be bored by this film , you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth . If you like this movie even a LITTLE BIT than you have no standard for what you watch at all . I 'm having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this . Its not funny , scary , shocking , or intriguing . So was it supposed to be a drama ? Because it really was n't dramatic either.<br /><br />Please just do yourself a favor and do n't watch this film . Life is too precious to be wasting 90 minutes of it watching this .
0 Although the movie takes place at an " Ivy League " college , it was in fact shot entirely in Northern Arizona , mostly at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff in the fall of 1976 . I was involved in the theater department there , and most of the extras in the film are then - members of the theater department . < br /><br />There is an absolutely ludicrous scene in this film ( if you know your Arizona geography ) that shows several cast members riding bikes from the college to a creek . We NAU'ers know that the campus and said creek ( Actually Oak Creek Canyon ) are about 35 miles apart , and while the trip there is all downhill , it would be literally IMPOSSIBLE to ride a bike back UP that same road !
0 This should be re - titled " The Curious Case Of The Unscrupulous Filmmakers Who Misrepresented A Non - horror Snorer As A Shock Film . " It 's one long , boring tale of a fraternity hazing , a gag so transparent that even Flounder from Delta House could see through it . Jeff East , an actor in the dues - paying stage , can be forgiven for taking any work he could get . The same ca n't be said for Charles Martin Smith , who formerly acted for such cinematic heavyweights as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah . Once available on tape but , thankfully , not out on DVD . Misrepresented garbage like this belongs in a landfill and nowhere else .
0 I 'm glad the folks at IMDb were able to decipher what genre this film falls into . I had a suspicion it was trying to be a comedy , but since it also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama I was n't sure . For a comedy it is amazingly bereft of even the slightest venture into the realms of humour - right up until the ridiculous " twist " ending , which confirms what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is . It is hard to describe just how amateurish THE HAZING really is . Did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing ? Actually worth watching so that you can stare at the screen in slack - jawed disbelief at how terrible it is .
0 This comedy is really not funny . It ' a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact . It 's a caper film so derivative -- yes , even back then -- it has no snap.<br /><br />The cast is adequate . More than that it 's hard to say . However , what 's nice is that the players are unfamiliar . At MGM , this would have starred Robert Montgomery . The wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresses.<br /><br />We can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today . And the production values are n't awful . Yet it makes no real impression.<br /><br />It 's a generic knockoff . And who wants that ?
0 I do n't know why , but when I am asked about bad movies I have seen , I often think of " The Air Up There " . I know that technically , lots of movies are horrible compared to it , and I have seen worse acting . it 's just that it 's so bland , so predictable . In a word : mediocre .
0 Wow , what a snoozer . Definately one of bacon 's worst films . The bad acting coupled with a formulatic , if not incredulous , script make me yearn for time I wasted on viewing this on cable television back . Not really much I can say about it , a basketball scout gets too attached to the person he 's recruiting , who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war which happens to be decided by ( spoiler ) a basketball game . Grade : F+
0 Manoj Agrawal after the failure of PARDESI BABU(1998 ) returned with this film < br /><br />The film has Govinda in 8 - 9 roles , as his father , mother , grandfather , sister and later - on he also has disguises < br /><br />He in short is a useless detective send on a case by his friend to get proofs against his wife , whose photos he looses at the airport while flirting with Rani < br /><br />He disguises as a Sardarji in the plane and again as a girl The funny part is how easily and in short time he does that?<br /><br />Then he disguises as a french singer and enters a TV to get proofs lol and then as a maharashtrian(yes inside the TV itself ) < br /><br />The rest of the film has the same mistaken identities and ends on a predictable note There are some funny scenes like Govinda being bashed by an African and also many other portions < br /><br />Direction by Manoj Agrawal is okay Music is okay < br /><br />Amongst actors Govinda again proves he is one of the most watchable actors He as usual is fantastic though he has done such roles before he fits in all the get ups and roles too well here again though the much hyped 6 - 7 roles do n't actually fit in the film Rani looks fat , teams up well with Govinda thatz it She is nothing great and kept doing such type of roles Amongst rest Nirmal Pandey is as usual Johny Lever is too loud at times and funny in places in 1 role and irritates as the older Tinnu Anand is okay Satish Kaushik is hilarious , Paresh is okay Tanaaz is okay
0 This is a copy of the 1948 Doris Day classic , Romance on the High Seas.<br /><br />The story line is more or less same but is contemporary . Govinda plays a sharp witted fellow who replaces the husband on the trip . While Rani plays the college friend of the wife who does her the same favour . They ostensibly try to catch each other out while the actual husband and wife tries to trip each other in Bombay.<br /><br />On the trip , Govinda mistakes another girl for Sanjiv 's wife and spies on her while falling in love with the ravishing Rani.<br /><br />Lever plays a dual role of father and son both lawyers specialising in divorce proceedings . They are pitted against each other for the warring couple.<br /><br />It is a poor attempt at copying the original classics and the songs are quite appalling . The comedy is slap - stick and will not make one laugh too much .
0 After reading the first 5 reviews on IMDb I was very enthusiastic about this movie . But it 's really an awful movie , the total time you see the alien is about 5 minutes ( the rest of the movie is cheap suspense ) , the acting is over the top en the story , oh boy , which story?<br /><br />The story does n't seem to go in a direction , first they capture the alien ( after 7 years ! they finally succeed ) , then they do n't know what to do with it ( after 7 years ? ) and even want to release it ( why the hell did they capture it ? ) . Then the girlfriend , who 's acting is the most over the top , wants to walk away from this madness , then suddenly she does n't , then again , she does and then she does n't . Then they come to the conclusion that killing the alien will kill the whole human race ( and remember , in all those years no other human have seen these permanently settled aliens ) and what do they do ? They torture it and blow a bunch of aliens to peaces.<br /><br />This is my first review on IMDb , I 'm a very lazy person who does n't write very soon , so listen to my warning : this move is not worth your time , do n't watch this movie .
0 I might not have been the biggest Blair Witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort , so I was looking forward to Altered , especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various IMDb comments . " Unique " , " intelligent " , " A future cult classic " and so on ... you got ta wonder where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor effort.<br /><br />Because alas , Altered is a poor , weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect . The silliness is not funny . The horror and gore is not scary . And whatever " thinking " aspect some poor fellows saw in this movie were due to severe delusions because there 's certainly nothing profound or smart about this mess.<br /><br />OK , so we know nothing stands out . Is it at least bearable ? Is the experience worthwhile in any way ? Unfortunately , no . For starters , get very poor acting . It 's not a stretch to say most B - movies these days feature better acting . The plot ? Boring and messy . Dialogs ? Many amateurs actually do better.<br /><br />It 's really the direction that puzzles . I did not expect major improvements over Blair Witch but at least small steps forward . Instead , our director seems to have worsen over time , completely oblivious to previous experiences.<br /><br />If there is a major flaw in Altered , it 's the main set . A major part of the plot takes place in a single location , where the main characters are confined but S√°nchez has failed to give the place any personality whatsoever . Considering that in Blair Witch , the forest plays a major part and is as much a character ( an antagonist , if you will ) as the three students , you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here . But no ... this place has no personality whatsoever thanks to sloppy direction and no attention to details.<br /><br />There 's nothing salvageable here . Die hard fans of " Blair Witch " are better off following Daniel Myrick . Although his output is far from being golden , it shows better structure than S√°nchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are applied ( unfortunately , in weak stories but still ) .
0 This weekend just passed I watched " 28 Weeks Later " which was very good . After that I watched this film . < br /><br />I have tell you it is one of the most boring so called horror you could ever watch . The scenes were unrealistic , there was no script and no plot . The alien creature was unreal . And the fight scenes mild compared to a school yard fight . And to make it worse the guy named Cody had an uncontrollable loose filthy tongue which distracts attention from the main film.<br /><br />Forget about this movie ; rather go and watch 28 Weeks Later.<br /><br />Cheers , Mesake C.
0 I 'd have to admit that the draw of this movie is director Eduardo Sanchez , who helmed the wildly popular and successful Blair Witch Project . Besides , this is an alien movie of sorts , and sounded something like Stephen King 's Dreamcatchers , one of those movies that the critics hated , but I enjoyed.<br /><br />But nope , unfortunately I felt that for the most parts , Altered is a waste of time , so I shall keep this review short . Premises are always promising , and Altered 's no different . It tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger , and as usual , others will take you as a nutcase imagining stuff . Stories about alien abduction always have to deal with probes into the orifices , so I shall not go into details , but you get the drift it 's damn uncomfortable , and something you 'd like to forget.<br /><br />What if you 're given a chance for revenge ? That is , you manage to successfully hunt down , and capture one alive . What will you do ? For this group , it 's a gleeful payback time , or so they thought . And this is where the movie begins to develop into a snoozefest , with bad , uninspiring dialogue , and even worse acting . Even if it 's low budgeted , there are n't many redeeming factors , be it strength of storyline , or any help from the cast in making their characters just a tad interesting . It 's the standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script , coupled with some cheap scare tactics employed.<br /><br />What 's good though is the makeup . Much effort has been put into making some of the stuff which I sha n't mention , because that 'll spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable . Other than that , there are the usual cheap special effects , blood and gory moments which is nothing you 've never seen before.<br /><br />Watch this only as a last resort . Compared to the other monster movie in town - Feast , this one is less fun , and takes itself too seriously . Bogged down by an uninspiring direction , you 've been warned .
0 My first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us Blair Witch Project which was a masterpiece in comparison to this piece of garbage . The acting was on the caliber of a 6th grade production of Oklahoma and the plot , such as there was , is predictable , boring and inane . 85 % of the script is four letter words and innumerable variations on them . Mother F seems to be the " writer 's " favorite because it is used constantly . It must have taken all of 10 minutes to write this script in some dive at last call . Thank God I rented it and could jump through most of it on fast forward . Do n't waste your time or money with this .
0 I 'm 47 years old and I 've spent as much of my life as I can remember , a fan of horror and sci - fi films . Be they silent , black and white , no budget or big budget , there are very few of them that I ca n't find something to like about . That said , I 'll give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects but that 's all . This is a case of effects over story . Truth is we live in a time where there is very little left that has n't been seen in a horror film . Therefor for a film of any kind to really entertain it must have a good , original story . A good story can overcome poor effects and bad acting but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie . This movie does n't even have good acting , only good effects . So unless you can only about the gore , pass this one up .
0 I felt this movie started out well . The acting was spot on and I felt for all the characters situation , even though the true family unit was not completely revealed . We never got enough info on the father to truly feel his pain for his whole involvement or the build up for his animosity with Tobe . I mean in one scene you see him admiring her for tensity and in another scene he just about takes her head off . Another problem with the movie was it just unraveled and lost all focus by the end , and I was begging for it to just be over with . Any movie with such a long drawn out , and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or above just for the acting . We are looking at the over all quality of the movie experience . In the case of this movie the end is so bad I seriously contemplated just walking out of the theater . This movie pulled me in then just spit me out .
0 This film really got off to a great start . It had the potential to turn into a really heartrending , romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between " Harlan " and Tobe in long , poetic and idyllic scenes . It really did n't need to be anything more than that , and for a moment there I became excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film for its own sake , another timeless classic , a modern myth perhaps . Why , oh why , then mess it up halfway through by making the lead character ( Norton)another psycho ? Maybe I 'm missing the point , but do we really need another film about psychos ? Or is this need in Hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature indicative of a more general malaise in the movie industry ? For a moment there , I was going to make a mental note of the director 's name ; now I 'm left feeling indifferent . At least it should be added in the film 's defense that all the actors seemed to invest in their roles . Also , Evan Rachel Wood is really lovely to look at and a good actress with lots of potential .
0 I saw this film in my cinema class . I am glad that I did not pay to see it . I came into it with an open mind , and was even a little excited . I really enjoy Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood , and the rest of the cast was interesting . I just never connected with this movie . The acting was great , the cinematography was interesting , but the storyline , or rather , lack thereof , was a problem . There was no central , connecting theme to the movie . Was it a romance between Norton and Wood ? Well , no , not really . Was it a western ? Kind of , but no . I 'm all for twists in movies , I recently saw " Brick " and loved it , but the place that this movie went was just too out there . It was so weird , and if I were n't required to have sat through the whole film , I would have walked out . The writing was n't terrible , but it was just all over the place . By the time this movie ended , I was just left terribly confused and wishing that it had ended sooner . There was just something about this film that did n't resonate , I understand more offbeat films like " Fight Club " , but I just did not care about the characters at all .
0 The longer this film went on - and it seemed to tediously go on for ever- the more annoyed I became , as quite frankly , what a waste of time sitting through this total nonsense . How on earth do people get to make films like this , or indeed receive finance for such rubbish ? Do n't be fooled by the relatively high ratings on IMDb as it just proves you can fool some of the people all the time . And in this picture the main players have an obsession with guns , so it is not difficult to work out the way this movie will ultimately unfold . America can never understand that the rest of the world finds it bizarre how society in the USA has such an obscene and fatal ' gun culture ' . < br /><br />Anyhow:<br /><br />The lead actor portrays a loser who escapes into a fantasy world of being a cowboy in an Urban sprawl . He comes across a family with two spoiled brat children , a teenage girl and boy ; taken care of by a strict single parent father who can barely cope . The cowboy is seduced by the teenage girl or vice - versa , and the impressionable boy is seemingly taken in by the lunacy of the loser.<br /><br />The cowboy spends the whole time in a state of unreality and depression . A total loser who prefers to go to the beach then work for living , and then commits a burglary on his family as he is too lazy to make money legally.<br /><br />Ask yourself:<br /><br />Who wants to watch either a sad failed loser in a fantasy world holding a death wish , or indeed view a poor family who are in effect not much better than white trash?!<br /><br />This film is pointless drivel.<br /><br />It only saves itself from getting the lowest mark possible by some half listen able music:<br /><br />2/10 .
0 was sort of enjoying this movie until the issues of Ed Norton 's facial hair . Without revealing any plot details -- on one afternoon he was sporting a light beard but by the same evening the beard was gone and a very luxuriant moustache was in place . It was much fuller than the moustache that went with the beard . Later on , in the course of a dark night in the open the moustache was gone and he appeared cleans haven . This was on an occasion where stopping to shave would n't be an option . These continuity discrepancies totally distracted me from the rest of the movie and ruined any credibility it had previously had . Also , I found the lengthy scene of the cowboy alone in his bedroom was way too reminiscent of De Niro in Taxi Driver . Even if it was meant to be an homage it was laid on too thickly for this viewer .
0 I really wanted to like this film , but the story is ridicules . I do n't want to spoil this film , - do n't worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen - but here 's an example of how sloppy this film was put together . The Cowboy and " Twig " ride up the ridge . The Cowboy has a handle bar mustache . The Cowboy and " Twig " get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge . The Cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film . Sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave , in dark , on the back of a horse.<br /><br />To be fair , the acting by the four main characters is solid .
0 OK , the story - a simpleminded loony enters a life of bored to death young chick and her kid brother and wreaks havoc in their lives - is mildly interesting one . Anyway , ideas are nothing ( everyone has some ... ) - the execution is everything.<br /><br />This is what bothered me with this flick . And it did bother me immensely . The rhythm ( directing , editing ) was slow , the pace was uneven and the climax expected . We have seen those frigging highways five , six , seven times - why ? Norton character 's troubles were seen as a childish game , not enough deep to understand his problems / soul / blah and to root for or against him . Is he a coward , a manipulator or just a loony ? References to the " Taxi Driver " were ridiculous and unnecessary and for certain not in favor for this flick ( or to E.N. for that matter).<br /><br />And IMHO , it is cowardly executed at the end . Cheap emotional tricks for teenage lovers somewhere in Mid America . This guy should have killed the kid , blamed the father , create a real havoc . Or the kid should have killed the father at the end etc . , but no , we have gotten cheesy ending where kids miss the loony , the father is puzzled over his own life and relationship with them and the loony , of course , dies . The happy dysfunctional family stays unharmed , safe and happily bored again so we could enjoy our pop - corns , undisturbed.<br /><br />And that scene where the loony enters the movie , oh my God , I would have to think long and hard to find something stupider than that ! You do not shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew . Creators of that movie probably thought that was a good idea but it was more than annoying . Again , if you 're a 16 years old girl somewhere in Kansas nowhere or whatever - where and dream about having sex with a crazy man twice your age , OK , then you might enjoy this movie and its " message " .
0 What starts out as a gentle country yarn , inoffensive and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as Edward Norton 's initially charming Harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the sinister , as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern wild western.<br /><br />An amiable rancher ( Norton ) wanders into town and charms a young girl ( Evan Rachel Wood ) , seemingly rescuing her from a dead - end existence with her bad - tempered father with a whirlwind romance , but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye.<br /><br />Edward Norton ¬ñ a real chameleon actor ( with changing facial hair to match ) playing a country hick , accent slightly dodgy but maybe because he 's merely trying to act the part without worrying about the accent . He certainly makes it appear effortless to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about Harlan . However , with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where Harlan is coming from , and what seemed like a good performance from Norton gradually becomes confused . Evan Rachel Wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her eyelids at Norton.<br /><br />Down in the Valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace , and by never really making the protagonist 's motives clear the audience 's sympathies for the characters remain uncertain . Should we like this drifter or not ? Even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear . This ambiguity is to the film 's detriment , as if the writer could not make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a hotch - potch . Had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film , but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess . Fans of old - fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the film but will be put off by the darkening tone . Completist fans of Norton aside ( or fans of the lush scenery of the San Fernando valley ) , give this a miss .
0 I can not stand this show ! Has there ever been even one redeeming quality , one funny punchline , or one plot line that " did n't " make the average viewer want to drown himself in a bowl of soggy cornflakes ? < br /><br />The voices . Oh , those horrible , wretched voices . Akin to repeatedly dragging a set of fine cutlery across a dusty blackboard , each character is uniquely annoying in his or her aptitude for shrill , nasal vocals . Cosmo sounds like a whining mongrel , Vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew , and Timmy 's dad makes every line sound like a bad impersonation of a game show host ( Guy Smiley from " Sesame Street " comes to mind).<br /><br />The animation is awful ; even the producers of " Yu - Gi - Oh ! " laugh at the overwhelmingly bad artwork on this show . Every character has buck teeth , or a square head , or a head three sizes too big for his or her body . And what 's with having the characters speak every single line wide - eyed and grinning , as though posing for a photo op with the president ? Then , there is the fact that every character on the show is completely moronic . Not since the subtle grace of Amelia Bedelia , Homer Simpson , and Buddy Lembeck of " Charles in Charge " fame have characters been portrayed as so unrealistically dumb . Usually " unrealistic " is synonymous with " unfunny " , and that is most definitely the case here . There has n't been this much slapstick based on cluelessness since " The Naked Gun 33 1/3" ... and at least Leslie Nielson was good at it.<br /><br />Finally , the premise of the show ( and it 's the same every single episode , so big time spoiler alert here ) : Timmy wishes for something with his two " Fairly Oddparents " , something goes wrong , there 's always some contrived reason why he ca n't immediately reverse course and wish away the damage , and then everything turns out just fine in the end . Oh , and on a side note , Timmy 's parents never believe him when he complains about Vicky , and they continue to employ her at every opportunity . Maybe it 's just me , but it seems that a kids ' show containing the subtle message that it pretty much does no good whatsoever to tell on an abusive babysitter probably is n't a great idea . < br /><br />If you 're writing a paper and want to cite an example of just how far the quality of cartoons has fallen , " The Fairly Odd Parents " has to be a great place to start . A prime example of television producers throwing together a worthless product aimed at kids with little or no effort simply because they know that someone somewhere will watch it .
0 * Spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead*<br /><br />When this show first started , I found it tolerable and fun . Fairly Oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked . It also had high ratings along with Spongebob . But it started to fall because of the following crap that Butch Hartman and his team shoved into the show.<br /><br />First off , toilet humor is n't all that funny . You can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp , but that 's pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a clich√© joke . Next there are the kiddie jokes . Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross - dressing . LOLOLOL ! ! ! I just ca n't stop laughing at such gay bliss ! Somebody help me ! But of course , this show would n't suck that bad if it were n't for stereotypes . Did you see how the team portrayed Australians ? They saw them as nothing but kangaroo - loving , boomerang - throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert . But now ... Is the coup de grace of WHY this show truly sucks the loudest of them all ... OVER - USED JOKES ! ! ! The show constantly pulls up the same jokes ( the majority of them being unfunny ) thinking it is like the greatest thing ever ! Cosmo is mostly the one to blame . I hated how they kept on mentioning " Super Toilet " ( which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well ) and Cosmo would freak out . And who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in Dimmsdale would use in that one e - mail episode ? You know , the one in which every single parent ( oblivious to other parents saying it ) would utter the EXACT same sentence before breaking into their kid 's room ? Yes , it may be first class humor to some people , but it is pure s * * * to others.<br /><br />If I 'm not mistaken , I do believe Butch Hartman said something about ending the show . Thank God ! Everyone around my area says it 's , like , the funniest Nickelodeon show ever . I just ca n't agree with it ¬Ö  I think it 's just another pile of horse dung that we get on our cartoon stations everyday , only worse .
0 I first started watching this show probably around the year of 2003 or 2004 with my friends . Of course , at the time I was younger and enjoyed some of the jokes on this show . I was 11 in 2003 , and I am 14 now ( 2007 ) . Though my age probably plays a major role in how I judge this show , after reading other 's reviews , I have come to see that after the third season , this show went down the tubes . I agree . This show is obnoxious , repetitive and usually focuses on the same plot.<br /><br />The show revolves around Timmy Turner , who was granted two Fairy Godparents because basically his life was horrible - his parents were never around , and he had a nasty baby - sitter . The plot of the entire show is that this kid ( Timmy ) and his Godparents always wish up some destruction that can not be prevented by making another wish , because something in " Da Rules " says they ca n't . The show has a lot of lines that keep being repeated , like " magic can not break true love , super toilet " or even just some scummy jokes lines that Nickelodeon probably thought was funny and decided to put in the episode various times.<br /><br />The show is aimed at kids younger than 10 , because it involves gross situations and " kid humor " that most kids of my age would n't care for . The character voice selection could 've been better too . Timmy has an extremely loud , shrill , feminine voice as does Cosmo . Wanda sounds like an old lady . Timmy 's dad sounds like some announcer or game show host , Timmy 's mom 's voice is too exaggerated to sound feminine . Attitudes in this show are : in some episodes , Timmy talks back and acts spoiled and snobbish . Wanda apparently is smart and wise . Cosmo is stupid , dumb and incapable of thinking as is Timmy 's dad . Timmy 's mom seems to end up doing whatever Timmy 's dad does.<br /><br />The show is too far flung from reality to get my likings anymore . Maybe as a younger kid , I could see more of the humor in this show , but as I grow up , it really grows old . And not to sound conceded or " trashing " but the show does have that mentality that makes you want to commit homicidal activity towards the characters . A show like this just has to be your attitude , if you know what I mean . If not , it basically disgusts you .
0 Seriously , the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind . This show is n't funny , it is n't clever , it is n't original , it 's just a steaming pile of bull crap . Let me start with the characters . The characters are all one - dimensional morons with loud , exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard . The voice acting could 've been better . Then there 's the animation . MY GOD , it hurts my eyes just looking at it . Everything is too flat , too pointy , too bright , and too candy coated . Then there 's the humor , or lack thereof . It 's completely idiotic ! They just take these B - grade jokes that are n't even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death . They also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me . And finally , last and least , the music . It 's just plain annoying . It sounds like it was composed on a child 's computer and generates no emotion whatsoever . I wish there was a score lower than 1 , I really do . This show seriously needs to be canceled . It 's a show I try to avoid like the plague . Whenever I hear the theme song I immediately turn the TV off . If you 've never watched this show then do n't . Watch quality programming like The Simpsons or Futurama .
0 During the first 3 seasons Fairly Odd Parents was as tasty as hard candy , bright and sweet and addictive . Now it 's as tasty as Pepto - Bismol . And unfortunately Pepto - Bismol is what you 'll need after viewing the more recent episodes , where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence resulting in no laughs . Cosmo , once one of the more endearing Nick characters , has devolved into an abusive unfunny cretin that the cast of Family Guy would n't even want to know . Timmy has become a selfish arrogant jerkwad that Bart Simpson would happily beat the snot out of ( and given Timmy 's snottiness , that would take a lot of beating ) . And poor Wanda ... a real charmer who 's become the victim of her husband and godchild , she 's now labeled a " nag " for caring about the well - being of others . Plus Cosmo 's stupidity causes pain to everyone else but he 's never punished for it , nor does he learn any lessons . Which pretty much sums up Butch Hartman 's attitude towards kids : they 're crude , vulgar and not too bright . Thank god this crummy toon has been cancelled , along with Butch Hartman 's darling , Danny Phantom . At least Butch got what he deserved - unlike Cosmo .
0 There are some redeeming qualities to this show . One is that the theme tune does have a decent melody . The show does have a nice premise . Also , I am probably in the minority , but I like Wanda . I like the fact she is caring , and is more a mother figure to Timmy . However , despite all this , I do not like this show , it is n't excrement but I do find it very annoying.<br /><br />I would n't say that it is the best animated show on Planet Earth . When I use that term for an animated TV show , I think of Peter Pan and the Pirates , I think of Darkwing Duck , I think of Scooby Doo and I think of Talespin . And I hope I am not the only one who really likes the Wild Thornberrys and resent the fact it gets poked fun at . Nor do I think Fairly Odd Parents is the worst animated show on Planet Earth . I accept it 's annoying , and in some ways overrated , but it is n't the worst show on Nickolodean . That is Chalk Zone , god that show is unwatchable . But the worst animated show I 've ever seen is Shaggy and Scooby Doo : Get a Clue , which is crudely animated , unfunny and frankly a disgrace.<br /><br />One thing I do n't like about this show is the animation . The characters , forgive me if I offend , have very weird facial features , and a lot of the backgrounds are dull and lack the colour that make Spongebob Squarepants and Wild Thornberrys so nice to look at . The characters with the exception of Wanda I find very annoying . I ca n't believe such a talented voice actress like Tara Strong(aka . Charendoff ) voiced Timmy . Timmy I do n't find very likable as a lead character at all , he is annoying and sometimes patronising , and he is a poor decision maker as well . And his voice gets on my nerves . I actually like Strong but not in this show . Another annoying character is Cosmo , the supposedly funny character . Instead , his jokes are as unfunny as they could become . They are either a ) contrived , or b ) over familiar . Timmy 's parents are awful characters , who do n't give a toss about their son , and their personalities wear well thin.<br /><br />The story lines are very unoriginal on the most part , and I keep thinking , where have I seen this before . The episodes after the arrival of the baby I thought were unwatchable . Even worse is the scripts , very unfunny , childish , witless and suffer from a complete lack of energy.<br /><br />All in all , not the worst show ever , but pretty poor for an animation fan , and fairly uncomfortable to sit through . 3/10- there are redeeming qualities , and I completely understand if people like it . Bethany Cox
0 I really hate this retarded show , it SUCKS ! big time , and personally I think it is insulting to fairy kind ( if you believe in fairies that is ) ; I mean the people who had come up with such crap ' ought to have their heads examine huh ? and also there is a LOT of craziness ( the evil school teacher , which I think is getting really old ) and also stupidity ( the boy 's parents and fairy godfather ) in this show - two of the things that I dispised and loathe in the WHOLE world ( especially stupidity).<br /><br />Overall , I say that this show is so f * * * * * ' annoying and should not be seen by prying eyes at ALL ( it would make'em bleed to death ) !
0 This gets a two because I liked it as a kid , but it became so redundant that I just started to hate it ... I ca n't give this a descriptive review because it would be restating one thing after the other , I probably would n't say anything that everyone else did n't say already.<br /><br />The only other thing about this show is that it 's pretty nasty , with the kid with the boil to that twisted babysitter to the stupidity that runs around and about in it . I have a cousin that loves this show and he 's the strangest and dumbest person I have met . This show should be pulled from the air . It 's always the same thing over and over ... They need to put better shows on Nick . I 'm getting really really tired of stuff like this .
0 What a HUGE pile of dung . Shot - on - video ( REALLY crappy camcorder , NOT digital ) pile of garbage . It is without a doubt , the stupidest thing ever made . The fact that this crap was actually released is completely asanine . Everyone who sees it will become stupider for having watched it . Seriously . I felt like it killed several brain cells after I watched this garbage . The positive reviews of this a$$crap were obviously made by the " filmmaker " ( and I use the term VERY loosely ) himself and/or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like this waste of life . Trust me , stay the hell away from this video . You 'll thank me for it . Avoid it like herpes .
0 I 've never actually seen this film but can tell you one thing about its production . While a comedy / oldies radio DJ in 1988 , I got a call from the production company . They asked if I 'd write and record a bit they 'd drop into the soundtrack as sounds eminating from a TV ( the television screen itself would never be shown ) . I said sure , wrote a parody of ' 50s sci - fi monster clich√©s , rounded up some sound effects and called in another DJ , Pam Landry , to play the female part . As she happened to be on the air at the time , she put on a long song , joined me at the mike in the production room and we cut the voicetrack in a single take . Giggling , she then went back to her show while I mixed in the goofy sound effects . We 'd have never done it if we 'd known that " Woodchipper Massacre " was going to be such a turkey -- but , then again , we never got paid for our efforts , either ! -- Gary Theroux
0 This pile of sh!t is tied in my book as the worst thing ever made . I ca n't BELIEVE that someone actually relased this CRAP , let alone acually MADE it . HORRIBLE , HORRIBLE , HORRIBLE . Not even worth mentioning the damn story or any details about it . THAT 's how bad it actually is . Avoid it like SARS !
0 This series had potential , but I suppose the budget would n't allow it to see that potential . An interesting setup , not dissimilar to " lost " it falls flat after the 1st episode . The whole series , 6 episodes , could have made a compelling 90 minute film , but the makers chose to drag it on and on . Many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward . The music was very annoying and did not work overall . There were few characters we cared about as their characters did not grow during the time frame--- well , one grew a bit . The ending was as terrible as the rest of series . The only kudos here is to the art dept and set dressers , they created an interesting look , too bad the writer and director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element
0 No artful writeup here because it does n't deserve one . Not an art film . Not even one of those ' hidden ' gems . You know , like those movies you hear about through a friend who saw this amazing movie downtown where they show all the good independents and art films.<br /><br />Just pack it into the christmas boxes , and dispose of quickly .
0 Not only does this movie have a poor plot , bad direction , and terrible acting , its opens up a whole new meaning to racism.<br /><br />In this film " White " chicks are the sluts , " White " boys are the wana - be gangsters , and successful ( yes again ) " White " businessmen are revolting toilet shitters.<br /><br />I just wonder what would happen if I made the exact same movie with the exact same story line and script , only I made it about Caucasians . " He dude , its good to finally see your've stopped dating those black chicks".<br /><br />Nobody seems to notice it , but watch this film again and you 'll vomit at how they have portrayed the new Zealand " white boys " . All of a sudden its white folks who are the main cause of gang aggression , and whores out for a quick bang . Only Samoans girls have a heart , there 's no such thing as a non - slutty white girl.<br /><br />It disgusts me that they could n't make this film without giving the Caucasian community in New Zealand a repulsive profile . If you think I 'm overgeneralizing , go watch this film , and see what you make of the " white boys " . Just because Samoans choose to call us " white boys " in actual life , does n't mean its funny . If I said hey black boy I 'll loose my teeth.<br /><br />Don't see this movie . Do n't waste your money . Do n't be racist .
0 The clich√©d Polynesian males drink , fight and make a stream of sexist , stupid and unfunny remarks . Real life Polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped , cardboard characters . The supposedly Samoan girl did n't look or act Samoan at all , seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim . With weak as water story lines you ca n't say anything about the acting - even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script . It 's sad to see Polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene , and only two or three ' jokes ' . What a waste of Kiwi taxpayers ' money , what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community . It 's better not to make movies if they 're as bad and mindless as this .
0 It seems to me , as a recent film school graduate , that in these times of New Zealand film reaching new heights , the general public seems to think every New Zealand film made is great . Sione 's Wedding proves this is dead wrong.<br /><br />It 's completely overrated and not funny , and far from the ' hilarious ' film other users of IMDb have commented . The only really funny thing I found in this film was Derek the wannabe black guy , but other than that the jokes were recycled crap that we 'd all heard before.<br /><br />Being of half - Samoan decent , I wanted to see how the film was going to deal with Polynesian representation . It was a complete balls - up - I know it 's a supposed comedy , but I did n't feel like the characters had anything new to say about Polynesian identity , even if it was in a tongue - in - cheek manner . I was most disappointed with the ending of the film and the resolution of the character 's relationships - Mikaele was the player who only messed around with white women , comes to slightly turn his ways when the ' Dusky Maiden ' comes to town , has an epiphany that maybe he should start looking for a stable relationship , then at the very last minute rejects it and accepts his position as a Polynesian Playboy for palagi women . I did n't understand why they did this.<br /><br />All in all , it was very disappointing . My whole family went to see it expecting to have a good laugh , but ended up being really bitter about paying to see it at the cinema . The jokes are lame at best , the acting , particularly of Sefa 's girlfriend , APPALLING , and honestly I would 've been happy if I had got my hands on one of those pirated copies of the film to save myself the $ 15 ticket price.<br /><br />I think the only good thing to come from the movie is that it 's the second step ( behind No . 2 , of course , a far superior film to this one ) in the birth of Polynesian cinema . I hope Pacific filmmakers in the future can learn from Sione 's Wedding in how to NOT reflect Polynesia and have something more meaningful and sensible to say . Even if it is done in a comedic fashion .
0 Probably New Zealands worst Movie ever made < br /><br />The Jokes They are not funny . Used from other movies & just plain corny The acting Is bad even though there is a great cast < br /><br />The story is Uninteresting & Boring Has more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers pizza kind of like the acting Has been do 1,000 times before < br /><br />I watched this when it came on TV but was so boring could only stand 30 minutes of it . < br /><br />This movie sucks < br /><br />Do not watch it , < br /><br />Watch paint dry instead
0 Despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in New Zealand , any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved . Apart from a clich√©s - only plot , the movie is let down by some weak acting , accents , and overall lack of tension.<br /><br />Whilst having the overall look of a big budget ( for NZ ) , the feel is decidedly small - town Kiwi ... <br /><br />Has anyone not seen The Brothers ? ? ( http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/ ) Those who have will pick the similarities straightaway .... I've heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clich√©d " boys talking crap " , but it comes across as forced ... <br /><br />I believe Oscar Keightley sees himself as deeply ironic , but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious.<br /><br />Those who have any doubts left at all that Samoans - living - in - NZ culture has been deeply , hopefully not permanently , affected by American speech , culture , and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie.<br /><br />Robbie magasiva always looks good on screen , but is let down by the script .. <br /><br />It always rubs me up the wrong way when a " comedy " has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way , you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clich√©d punchline - see the wanna be white boy ... <br /><br />I know someone who found this movie hilarious -however , that person has the brains of a tadpole , and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars .... <br /><br />That kinda sums up the mentality of this flick , OK but not great , fun but not funny ..... Wake up NZ - this is NOT a 5 star movie despite all the glowing ( middle class white guilt ? ? :-) ) reviews .... <br /><br />My advice ? if you watch it , get drunk first ! ! !
0 The most positive thing I can say for this dull witted local " comedy " production is that it 's inoffensive . In fact it 's so astonishingly bland that one wonders how many dozens of re - writes by committee it went through to have such a complete removal of personality . It 's not witty , it 's not entertaining , it 's not insightful , and it 's not charming . It 's just a staid , laughless , progression of four losers who must change their ways - and their attitudes towards women - to be allowed to attend their best friend 's wedding.<br /><br />With acting that would be sub par for the local amateur dramatics society , a plot line so tired it 'd make a forty third season of ' Allo ' Allo look fresh , and jokes about as humorous as watching decaying vegetables , Sione 's Wedding nonetheless scored ten ( yes 10 ) nominations in the NZ film awards recently.<br /><br />Fortunately , somebody saw sense and it did n't win any .
0 I just sat in the theater bored as hell , i wanted to leave halfway through the movie . The plot is simple 4 Samoan guys wreck weddings . So They have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding . Yawn.<br /><br />The thing that peeved me off the most was the so - called crude jokes ... They were highly UNfunny , clich√©d and thrown in your face , to make you get into the already dull movie . The acting was below - average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot.<br /><br />All in all , one of the worse movies i 've seen of 2006 , unfunny , bad acting , just ugly.<br /><br />Well thank god a friend shouted me . < br /><br />Avoid .
0 Ever wonder why Pacific Islanders seem to automatically assume the sense of humour of Black Americans ? regardless of their ethnic origins ? Well this film will not provide any answers to this often pondered question - but it will provide an excellent case study.<br /><br />From its onset this film acts as a sort of " Old School " for Pacific Island New Zealanders , which immediately raises the question what exactly is the point of such a task . Is it meant to perpetuate ingrained stereotypes of Pacific Island New Zealanders ? or is it intended to exploit this potential market ? The story is weak , jokes humorless , and the ending is expected . This film has done nothing for New Zealand cinema , as it is merely an appropriated romantic comedy that is devoid of any merit .
0 Avoid this crap at all costs . Bad script , bad directing , bad acting , bad editing , bad sound , and bad music . Get the idea ? This movie tries to be western flavored , it 's not . It tries to be hard core violent , it 's not . It tries to present a fresh look at an old genre , it does n't . The actors try there best , and my heart goes out to them . But with such inane material to work with it 's hard to make something shine . To me this has all of the looks of a " fresh outta film school gon na set the world on fire " first attempt . Freshmen film makers often bite off more that they , or their budget , can chew . The best thing they can do is to take a few steps back , reassess what is possible , and work within their limited budget the next time out .
0 I can see where the film makers were going with this . But they never really reach their destination . It 's supposed to be a homage to Spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame . " But unfortunately it fall short in its attempt . It does n't have that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for . The characters are not vile and desperate enough like their Italian western counterparts . And , failing these two points , it lacks the humor of a successful parody . In fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film , but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it could n't possibly be taken seriously . Unfortunately , they also missed the humor mark by a mile . A whole lotta bad movie !
0 Sadly IMDb does not allow me to rate Judges lower than 1 . What a shame . This ghastly movie is so bad that I actually turned the damned thing off well before the ending . The script had a few bright moments , but the directing , editing , acting , audio quality , and especially timing on line delivery was so abhorrent as make Judges utterly unbearable.<br /><br />Judges was advertised as being like a modern day comic book style western , but in reality was nothing of the sort . What it is most like is dog poop on the bottom of your shoe . You can try to pretend it is okay , but it just keeps on stinking.<br /><br />Why video stores think it is okay to carry this kind of crap with constant gaps in the audio and worse than high school drama class acting is beyond me . We rent movies in order to see something better that what is on television . But Judges is worse than the most pathetic SciFi Channel original . I intend to demand my money back from Hollywood Video .
0 The plot is rocky . The acting is somewhere south of a Jr. High School play . The cinematography is not bad but it looks like it was cut with a machete . I could n't decide of this was an intentionally hokey flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film . Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD . People running around in a ' lawless ' modern town wearing quick - draw 6 gun rigs . It has more than its fair share of ' cutsey ' stuff . Picture the Good Guys pulling up to an old farm house , and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitching rail . Picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western ( hemisphere ) movie sporting a Japanese sound track but with English sub - titles . It 's all really strange but might be improved if watching it while partaking in a little peyote . It 's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie clich√© you can think of . There 's even a modern version of the good hearted dance - hall girl , AND a twanging Jew's - harp in the soundtrack . Really ! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session , tell 'em your DVD player died .
0 It 's sad when you can see what a movie was attempting to do , and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark . Film students should take this as a lesson and a warning . Would be graduate has an idea . He wants total control . So he writes , directs , produces , his cinematic masterpiece all by himself . Usually , his concept is far beyond his budget . Usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with . Usually , he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes . Usually , he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it 's attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget . Usually , he ends up with a series of encounters ( we can not do justice by calling them scenes ) that feel like they were written by a 12 year old . And usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that fail to grab the viewer . When you look at Judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it 's just the usual fare .
0 I had high hopes for this movie . The theater monologue is great and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man , with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies . < br /><br />I am a fan of a lot of Belgian movies , but this movie is bad . It 's completely unbelievable that actors who are 34 are suddenly playing the roles of teenagers . The " linguistic games " were hideous and over the top . Nothing about the film seemed real to me . The ending was way too deus ex machina for me.<br /><br />I am very disappointed and think I wasted an hour and a half of my life .
0 Oh my goodness . This was a real big mess that just could n't help itself . Jeffrey ( Jon Heder ) is a 29 year old man still living with his mum ( Diane Keaton ) and not planning on going anywhere . Until his mother meets a rich businessman named Mert ( Jeff Daniels ) who she may be getting married to.<br /><br />It would have been an OK movie if Heder did n't play his Jeffrey so annoying , from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse . In the end , we are supposed to like him , but there was no reason to as he had n't changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />Keaton does n't look to even be trying and is in horrible form after 2007 's Because I Said So . Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton , and where supposed to believe that their mother and son ? The only saving grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris although they do n't look very interested either . Apart from a few little smiles , this film really does n't deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at ! If your in the mood for a recent Diane Keaton flick watch Mad Money or Smother which are a lot better than this abysmal effort .
0 Starts really well , nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about 5 minutes , the charm is lost.<br /><br />The character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from American Pie and Loser without the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the Pie movies more of a commercial success.<br /><br />Let 's be honest - Heder 's acting was pretty poor . Keaton , Daniels and Faris did their best but had no substantial plot or script to get their teeth into The movie just plods on without any pace or clear logical storyline justifying its length.<br /><br />The ending is about as predictable as they come - so predictable I 've ticked the spoilers box for this one line.<br /><br />My advice : avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to do / listen to or watch and even then you 'll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life .
0 ... except for Jon Heder . This guy tanked the entire movie.<br /><br />The plot sounded entertaining . A 29 year old slacker son(Heder)still lives with widowed mom ( Keaton)who happens to meet a new love ( Daniels ) . Slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship . He also meets a girl(Faris).<br /><br />I really liked the performance of Daniels and especially Faris but whoever casted Hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach . Heders performance is annoying , which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy , problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale . At the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you 're upset about the end . In the future every movie with this guy will be a no go for me !
0 The wife and I saw a preview of this movie while watching another DVD and thought " Jon Heder , Diane Keaton , Jeff Daniels and Eli Wallach , it 's got ta be better than summer reruns , so I ordered it from local library . Well , any episode of " Lawrence Welk " would bring more laughs than " Mama 's Boy " . I actually felt sorry for the actors for having to read the script in the privacy of their own homes and I could n't imagine what it must have been like for them to have to actually say their lines in front of a camera . Perhaps , at least , maybe next time they 're offered a movie of this sort , they 'll " Just Say No ! ' A one anna two ....
0 This movie is poorly conceived , poorly acted , and poorly written.<br /><br />Jon Heder is terribly annoying , and can not escape the same Napolean Dynamite routine . Self - obsessed and ignorant.<br /><br />Furthermore , Diane Keaton plays the same manish , overly obsessed mother , who cares too much and yet not nearly enough about the lives of her children ( see Because I Said So ) . < br /><br />Anna Faris , though i generally like her , plays a vapid idiot in this film as well.<br /><br />Jeff Daniels is passable but nothing special . < br /><br />Please , skip this film if you want to keep your soul .
0 Yet another " son who wo n't grow up " flick , and just the other recent like entries . Heder in another bad wig , channeling Napoleon for , what , the third time ? Anna Faris is forgettable , as always ; Jeff Daniels phoned this one in from another state , at least ; and Diane Keaton ... how does one become typecast this late in a career ? Do not bother . Nothing is said here that has n't been covered many times over . I will say this ; it 's about a hundred times better than " Failure To Launch " . There are very few amusing bits in the movie , unless you think Eli Wallach cursing is funny . Ha , Ha ! He 's old and he dropped the f - bomb ! Tee , hee , hee . Pitiful !
0 John Heder was absolutely horrendous in this movie . I felt like I was watching a bad college kid act for the first time in a student film . Anna Farris was par for the course , not good , but not horrible ( plus she 's cute ) . Dianne Keaton should have known better . Jeff Daniels was the only saving grace in this movie ( even though it was poor judgement on his part as well ) . < br /><br />All in all , I would avoid this at all costs . I 'm just glad I did n't pay to see it ! < br /><br />John Heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of ' the dorky kid , ' unless he does some SERIOUS work on his acting chops .
0 ... in an otherwise ghastly , misbegotten , would - be Oedipal comedy.<br /><br />I was the lone victim at a 7:20 screening tonight ( 3 days after the movie opened ) , so there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers heeded warnings.<br /><br />The bloom is off Jon Heder 's rose . The emerging double chin is n't his fault ; but rehashing his geeky kid shtick in another bad wig simply is n't working . It would be another crime if this were to be Eli Wallach 's last screen appearance . Diane Keaton will probably survive having taken this paycheck - basically because so few will have seen her in this , the very worst vehicle she 's chosen in the last few weeks.<br /><br />Sitting alone in the theater tonight I came alive ( laughed , even ) whenever Daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the film 's sole three dimensional character . He really is among our very best actors.<br /><br />In summary , even Jeff Daniels 's work ca n't redeem this picture .
0 You have to respect this movie . It may be " just a dumb kid 's movie " but it 's the # 1 most frequently requested film title in online movie forums , requested by people who remember the story but ca n't remember the title . Therefore what follows is a much - needed , detailed plot description , since I have n't been able to find such a description anywhere else on the Internet.<br /><br />A typical 2-story house is shown in suburbia . 7-year - old Bridget narrates about suspecting something is going on since she and her 11-year - old brother Andrew are getting presents from their parents for no apparent reason . Bridget 's present is a stuffed penguin that she immediately names Sweet William . Bridget describes her relatives : Aunt Ruth , a bossy nurse taking care of grandmother , Grams the hugging grandmother who makes dolls out of socks , and her brother Andrew , who 's into electronics and is grumpy . Grams accidentally hangs up on the lieutenant - governor , which indicates she 's getting in the way while living with the family . The two children eat breakfast while the adults discuss moving Grams to a retirement home . Bridget makes an awful - looking pancake sandwich containing cereal , eggs , bacon , strawberries , and syrup , as Andrew looks on incredulously . The two kids then discuss Grams , and Andrew says bluntly that Grams is being " put out to pasture . " Bridget talks with Grams in the attic , has a play tea party with Sweet William in her bedroom , then a living doll unexpectedly pops out of her bedroom closet mirror.<br /><br />Bridget and the living doll become acquainted . The curly - haired living female doll is named Huggins and lives in Huggaland . Bridget gives Huggins a baseball cap from Andrew 's room . Huggins hides under some laundry when Bridget 's mother comes by , then the mother throws the laundry into the washing machine with Huggins in it . Bridget rescues Huggins and dries her off with a hair drier . They discuss the problem with Grams getting old and having to move away , Huggins says Bridget could talk to the bookworm in Huggaland about it , since he knows everything . They step through the mirror to visit Huggaland , but one of Bridget 's tennis shoes becomes lodged in the mirror.<br /><br />Rather than walk around with one shoe , Bridget goes without shoes in Huggaland . They immediately meet Hugsy , a curly - haired living boy doll in Huggaland . Huggins gives Hugsy the baseball cap . They also meet Tickles , Bubbles , Impkins , and Tweaker , and all the dolls sing a song while sitting on a bridge . Hugsy takes Bridget and Huggins in his hugwagon to see the bookworm , who lives atop a stack of giant books . The bookworm consults " the old encyclopedia " and finds that old age can be cured by eating the fruit of the " youngberry tree . " However , only one such tree exists , and it 's in the country of Shrugs , ruled by the mad queen of quartz . The only way to travel to Shrugs is to jump down a deep hole that is located inside a nearby giant book.<br /><br />Bridget and the two dolls gulp three times , jump down the hole , and tumble out . Soon they walk down a sideways sidewalk , hear the sea of glass breaking , and fall off the sidewalk when the sideways gravity ends . They encounter " the hairy behemoth , " which looks like a mastodon , has four tusks , and breathes fire out its trunk . But Hugsy boldly goes over and hugs the behemoth , who thereby turns into a baby elephant whose name is Hodgepodge . Hodgepodge had been under a spell by the queen , and owes Hugsy a favor , so they all ride on Hodgepodge 's back to the castle . They enter the castle , are surrounded by troll - like beings , the queen ( Queen Admira ) comes , and Bridget asks for a few youngberries . The queen refuses , then eats one for herself , and brags about her own youthful good looks while looking in a hand mirror . Hodgepodge faints when the queen says he should be " digested . " The queen is upset when Bridget mentions that wicked witches should have warts , so the queen freezes Bridget and orders the three others to be taken to the dungeon . But the queen carelessly leaves the key to the youngberry tree 's dome by the lock to the dome - lifting apparatus.<br /><br />Hodgepodge wakes up in the dungeon and uses his " noodle " ( trunk ) to pull the jail 's door down , thereby freeing himself and the two dolls with him . They find Bridget standing petrified , the dolls hug her , which causes Bridget to be revived . Before they flee , Bridget finds the left - behind key to the youngberry tree dome , lifts the dome off , and they pick some glowing youngberries and put them in a jar . The queen catches them , but the queen 's arm is trapped under the descending dome while reaching for the key that Bridget left on the ground . The queen suddenly turns very old since she is deprived of the youth - giving berries , and appears to die . Soon Bridget steps back through the mirror into her bedroom but trips on the bottom of the mirror , spilling the berries onto her floor , and the berries quickly vanish into smoke , one by one . Her mother calls for her and Andrew to say goodbye to Grams , who is leaving for a retirement home . Andrew drops his usual grumpy , standoffish facade and hugs Grams , telling her he loves her and that he does n't want her to go away . Their father is moved , and decides to keep Grams there after all , and everybody hugs and cries , including Aunt Ruthie , who had been the main person pressuring Grams to move out.<br /><br />Andrew asks Bridget for his St. Louis Cardinals cap , Bridget starts to explain how she gave it to Huggins of Huggaland , but Andrew does n't want to listen to what he believes are her fantasy stories , so he turns around to look for it in her bedroom . One of the dolls secretly hands the cap back through the mirror to Bridget , Bridget puts the cap on Andrew 's head , Andrew is mystified , and leaves her bedroom without saying anything . Bridget cheerfully waves at the mirror .
0 I being of Puertorican descent , had mixed fillings about this " documentary " . First I was offended that Ms. Perez compared Senor Campos to Che Guevarra . Also just a point of fact , Mr . John Leguzaimo is not of Puertorican descent . His parents came from Columbia . Whomever did research on this was not very accurate . I feel that the future of our race rests on education . This message should have been resounding throughout this film , Education is our road to freedom and power I think any future endeavors of this production team should make this their focus . In my opinion , this film swayed toward an anti - American sentiment .
0 I hated the way Ms. Perez portrayed Puerto Ricans ! We are not all ghetto - and we do speak Spanish- not Puerto Rican ! I can not speak for the uneducated persons you have run into . But our language is intact , our island is our pride . Puerto Rico is better off economically than any other Caribbean island ! I 'm glad we are not like Cuba , Dominican Republic or Haiti , free from American influence ? Free in true poverty , not the U.S. standard of poverty . We are not victims we are resilient , humble , honest and intelligent people . Our ancestry does include strong African roots , but not " black " roots- I have nothing in common with Black Americans 9do the research).<br /><br />The analogy between Pedro Albizu , Che Guevarra and Martin L. King could not be more off the mark.<br /><br />MLK was a great hero a true revolutionary- an honest man who saw a day when we would all be free.<br /><br />Che Guevarra helped Castro create the Cuba that is today , is that why boat fulls of Cubans risk their lives to come to America- because Che made such a better place for them ? You had a great , awesome , bright idea but you politicized it too much . We have so many things to be proud of as a people - do n't bring shame to our people by victimizing us . I am not a Nuyorican and perhaps that is why I ca n't share your views . I am Puerto Rican , I speak Spanish , I am not a victim and I have been able to accomplish many of my goals in America . If there is a part 2 in the future - less politics more history more stories of triumph- there are many.<br /><br />Damaris Maldonado
0 I am so appalled by this documentary . I am deeply embarrassed and ashamed by the way Puertoricans were portrayed . This documentary was not about the culture of Puertoricans . It was about the culture of Nuyoricans . Puertoricans and Nuyoricans are two different cultures . Very different cultures and should not be generalized to the Puerto Rican population . Rosie , before you make a documentary , you need to do the research . You also need to check and make sure your sources are credible . Puerto Ricans are not all loud and they do have class , which is one thing the documentary lacked to show . When I saw Rosie and Jimmie on the View and Rosie on Martha Stewart I was very excited about watching . I even made sure to let my parents know since they love Puerto Rico so much . After the first five minutes I could not believe how the documentary bashed the US and made Puerto Ricans look like a bunch of guinea pigs . You need to go and visit Puerto Rico and you will see that Puerto Rico is not a 3rd world country where more than 50 % of the population is in poverty . Puerto Rico has colleges and well known Universities , roads , cars , shopping centers , malls ( The largest Kmart and JCPenney 's I 've ever seen ) , restaurants , theaters , beaches , hotels(Ritz , Hilton , etc . ) , casinos , churches , agriculture , Auto Expresso , and restaurants just to name a few . Poverty ? NOT 50 % of the population is . Puerto Rican culture is about family , music , food , celebrating , and trying to move forward not backward . Oh , and new cousins do n't just pop up out of no where . No that is not a Puerto Rican thing , that is a ghetto thing . We are not bastards . Parents of Puertorican descent who would like to teach their children about Puerto Rico should invest in a trip with the family so they can see first hand what Puerto Rico is all about . They will see its beauty , people and culture . Please do n't show them this documentary because it will only cloud their minds with negativity . Oh , and please do n't tell your American friends to watch this documentary because it will only make the Puertorican people look ignorant.<br /><br />Yes , I am born and raised PUERTO RICAN from the island . Just so you know !
0 I was excited to hear that someone had made a documentary on what it was like to be Puerto Rican . When I heard it was Rosie Perez , I wondered .. could she possibly know what it is really like to be Puerto Rican . As far as I knew .... she was a Nuyorican . Well anyway , I anxiously sat with my popcorn to watch . I realized 10 min into it that my initial apprehension was right . Rosie Perez has little knowledge about what it is like to be Puerto Rican . This " documentary " is more a 1st hand , very very personal account on what it is like to be a Nuyorican .. and all of what that entails . She ( like most of the Nuyoricans I know ) have a watered down , partial and sometimes twisted sense of history . ( How could they not .. they live here . ) Yes , all of them are proud . As they should be ! But a lot do n't know the ins and outs of the REAL culture , history and political background or language for the most part . It all became very very apparent with her participation in the Vieques issue . Regardless of my personal take is on this issue .. at least I know what the hell the fight is for . There is she is getting arrested for something she knew little about .. and only participated in because it was a " Puerto Rican Cause " I really do n't understand how she is not embarrassed to admit to it . For those of you that are not Puerto Rican , please view this as a partial account of a woman 's journey of self discovery and acceptance . Do not take this as gospel ... a lot of it is n't even true . Please consider the source . Rosie is an actress ; not a historian . This movie is not and should never be , for other Nuyoricans , the base for their information . Instead , just a step towards finding more info , learning and debating what the reality is . Not just the one coming from this woman 's eyes .
0 Rosie wasted a lot of TV time talking about the Tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of the modern day Puerto Rican . They were not . The truth is that the Africans and the Spanish were and she knows it . What kills me is that she is standing on the screen looking like some average light skin black chick ( with an obvious black daddy , cousins and auntie)pretending to truly acknowledge the real essence of what makes them the modern day Puerto Ricans , but barely mentioned how Africans influenced the way their Spanish is spoken , the food and music . She is so typical and I lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does . Also , since she wants to dance around her African - ness then she need not take more roles associated with blackness ( i.e. Lackawanna Blues ) . We can find a prideful Black Latina next time ( thank you Zoe Saldana , Gina Torres , Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa).<br /><br />To the Puerto Rican on here that said they are African and not " black" .... thank you . We " blacks " certainly do not have anything in common with " you " so there is no love lost . But , since you are probably in the States and have benefited from the Civil Rights movement we would like for you refuse any decent human treatment you received courtesy of the blood , sweat and tears from the backs of the " blacks " you share nothing with.<br /><br />If I am correct Puerto Ricans have a terrible image in the media , but we blacks do not spend our time trying to disrespect you because we know that the media loves to exploits the low points and behaviors of all minorities to maintain mindless generalizations . However , you evidently have fed into the hype that one you are somehow white or superior ... you are not . Also , you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is BET ... again you are incorrect and need to take a vacation out of the hood . Try visiting Atlanta , Ga. , Houston , Texas , Charlotte , N.C. Trust me none of those blacks want to claim your " culture " either .
0 I am Puerto Rican and this is one of the worst documentary of I 've ever seen of any type . You can see that the people on it are clueless . They do n't know much about Puerto Rico and its culture . They claim to be Puerto Rican because they are from Puerto Rican descendants , but they probably know less than others who are not from there . You can see while they are talking that they are contradicting themselves . If you would like to see a real , and I mean a real , genuine documentary from Puerto Rico , then you must see " Mi Puerto Rico " . That 's a serious , real documentary . Not like this piece of junk . Rosie Perez based this documentary on herself . I thought it was suppose to be about Puerto Ricans . They keep repeating I did n't know . Well , that 's about the only thing they got right on this so called documentary . I hate to see such a piece of garbage being done using the name of the Island . It brings down the standards .
0 I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico , and I ended up watching one about Nuyoricans . When I go to Puerto Rico , I fail to see the 50 % that live in poverty . When I do see struggling people , they are usually Haitians , Dominicans , or Cubans that have recently arrived to the island . There is no such thing as spanglish ... either you speak Spanish , or you do n't .... and from what I heard ... you do n't . Pedro Albizo Campos IS NOT MLK to me . MLK was a great man . Campos is a great man to those that want independence which is 1 % . To the rest he as loco as Osama Bin Laden . Puertoricans that want independence are a bunch of fools . If you want any proof to all of you dreamers of an independent Puerto Rico see Cuba , Haiti , Dominican Republic , Bahamas , all of South and Central America , and Mexico . Its worked wonders for them . This documentary is not about Puerto Rico , this documentary was about the Nuyoricans and their struggles.<br /><br />To the person that complaint that not enough of Africa was on the show ... it was suppose to be about Puerto Rico ... not Africa . Denzel will make one shortly just for you.<br /><br />In conclusion ... to all those ignorant white people that think we need green cards to come to the US , and want to learn how the prime minister runs things , this is not a good documentary about Puertorican culture . Tell your kids to pay attention in Geography , and History class.<br /><br />***Update***<br /><br />Bocabonita ... " doc . " was about Nuyoricans . She promoted it as if its how we all feel . Should have been titled ... " yo soy nuyorican ... lunche ... can't speak Spanish . " PLEASE STOP USING PUERTO RICO , RICAN , BORICUA , OR ANYTHING ELSE ASSOCIATED WITH PR WITH THIS NUYORICAN HISTORICAL LESSON . God forbid they play this on the island .
0 Yes , this was pure unbelievable condescending babble . We know that the French often have a skewed idea of the USA , it 's puritanism and views towards sex . As an American ( Hoosier ) who lives in France , I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes . And while some of these preconceived notions may be true , NOT ONE ELEMENT of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real . A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big ? Where in the world would you find that ? A juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass ? A town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from Chicago , but with no major gas station , no Tvs in the home , no McDonalds , no kids ... A population that knows each other 's intimate details yet relentlessly gets together like one big family that hates each other . The adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe , have farms but do n't harvest , kill the guy they do n't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it , and all with equal emotion ? The liberated French girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity , the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an Illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy ? HELP ! I am so baffled and astounded by the absurdity of this film that I am not expressing clearly how ridiculous it is . Go see it for the A - to - Z primer on what to avoid . Gosh , I hope I did n't ruin it for you !
0 Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes , only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film I 've ever seen . Sort of like a high school film project . What was Rosanna Arquette thinking ? ? And what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town ? Pretty hard to get involved with this one . No lessons to be learned from it , no brilliant insights , just stilted and quite ridiculous ( but lots of skin , if that intrigues you ) videotaped nonsense .... What was with the bisexual relationship , out of nowhere , after all the heterosexual encounters . And what was with that absurd dance , with everybody playing their stereotyped roles ? Give this one a pass , it 's like a million other miles of bad , wasted film , money that could have been spent on starving children or Aids in Africa .....
0 Jean - Marc Barr ( Being Light , The big blue , Dogville ) has directed and interpreted this strange movie which is the second installment of some kind of trilogy . I might be wrong but I do n't think this movie 's part of the Dogma ' 95 manifesto , though it really looks like it . I 'm not really sure of what I think about this film . All actors are good . They deliver pretty good performances , especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean - Marc Barr . The story is somehow interesting . But I do n't know , there 's something about the movie that I do n't like . The sex scenes are way too long . It goes from an interesting work of art to an erotic piece of crap I do n't know exactly where it stands . Sure it 's not a bad movie , but I wo n't suggest people to see it neither I 'll tell them not to watch . Just do as you want .

0 The TV productions at the 2000 's start were between weak and bad . Before marks like ( Alias , Lost , Prison Break , Desperate Housewives , or Monk ) the TV did n't have the right hit yet , which could capture the attention and the interests of the 2000s ' viewer . Titles like ( Relic Hunter ) , ( Mutant X ) , ( The Lost World ) , ( Sheena ) , or even ( Baywatch Hawaii ) were n't encouraging for you to watch and follow , or at least were n't that captivating and interesting all the time as what preceded them . ( Special Unit 2 ) was no exception . In fact it 's Men in Black meets The X Files ' spoof ! ( As if these were the special unit 1 ) . But even according to this brilliant formula ; it did n't work well . It was promising ; at the time there was some saturation out of the " supernatural " cases after a decade of many X files already , so the natural spirit to lampoon it naughtily too ( imagine Mulder as womanizer ! ) . However ( Special Unit 2 ) was n't the strongest in this , or a strong when it comes to make a comic Sci - Fi show . It was highly ridiculous , where for instance every sexy situation must turn into ugly disgusting one . It enjoyed that bad taste sickeningly . ( Michael Landes ) was non - charismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian . His chemistry with ( Alexondra Lee ) , as well as any supposed sexual attention , was all languid . Sure the show got a funny look but overall it was unfunny work . It 's clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main idea . Among ( Evan Katz ) 's other works as a co - writer and a co - producer like ( Seven Days ) before or ( 24 ) later this must be a low point ! . Despite the distinctive personality , it managed to be a silly jest for most of the time . Therefore if that was there goal , so they made one of the silliest indeed ! And truly , it would be one of the rarest times to be thankful for the cancellation of a show after 19 episodes of it only !
0 This show had pretty good stories , but bad dialog . The main character was especially annoying . It 's quite obvious why this show was canceled , although , like most UPN shows , I never knew it even existed until it was in syndicated re - runs.<br /><br />Most of it 's plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies , leading me to think the producers did n't have an original idea in their heads . < br /><br />I have n't commented enough . You 've got to have at least ten lines of text . The special effect were not bad for a 2001 show.<br /><br />The gnome was a nice character .
0 A great concept gone wrong . Poor acting , even worse writing .... After watching the first two episodes I was wondering why it ever made it to season two . The characters are forgettable , the writing is poor , the sets are just OK . The special effects are simply sad - so much better has been made in the same time - frame - where is the money going on this one ? The first episode starts out interesting then goes downhill fast - the precept of the whole show is just silly . Now do n't get me wrong , I am a huge Sci - Fi fan and ' geek ' - but this show simply does n't cut it . As I said in the beginning , I am truly surprised it made it to season two - so much better has been canceled after only one season ( Jake 2.0 for example ) . This show was just bad .
0 A well - intentioned movie about Sonja Horowitz ( Ren√©e Zellweger ) , the wife of devout Talmudic scholar Mendel ( Glenn Fitzgerald ) . who is deeply unhappy . Mendel 's brother Sender ( Christopher Eccleston ) sees this and hires her to work in the field in which she 's already an expert¬ójewelry . He also starts an affair with her , and then when she spends time with a Puerto Rican artist , he dumps her and betrays her to the family , which shuts her out . There 's a subplot in which Sonja 's dead brother talks to her , and apparently takes the form of a magical beggar woman , but why is not clear . Much is not clear , unfortunately , including what is going on with Sonja , why she tells the Rebbe there 's a fire inside her and maybe it 's not from god , and what this means , and what the magical beggar woman tells her means . To an extent the story touches on the plight of women in the ultra - orthodox community , and yet Sonja is not exactly liberated . Nor is the notion of being redeemed by the love of a man of another race very well - thought - out . The title comes from the biblical definition of the worth of a good woman¬óand yet it 's the bastard Sender who quotes it to Sonja . Zellweger struggles with the part ; she 's supposed to be a Jew from the mid - west and sometimes her accent is flat , and at other times it 's taken on the characteristic sounds of Brooklyn . She 's at her best when she 's being tough and taking charge , but ultimately the movie 's a mess .
0 The movie is steeped in religion , so it is impossible to separate it from religion in commenting upon it . In my opinion , this movie pretends to explore deep issues , but thrives on stereotypes and prejudices ; with little true insight . What the people in the movie ( and therefore , the writer ) failed to see was grace . They failed to understand that God is the author of beauty and He is the Creator of passion and sexual gratification in the proper context of marriage bonds . To imply that the people of the society in which the story is based believe that nudity is sinful , and both the man & the woman enjoying the act of marriage is dirty , is just an oversimplification . Such stereotypes really do n't exist , for even Jewish holy writings speak clearly of the caring husband who will seek his wife 's pleasure before his own . Scripture says that a man ought to love his wife as his own flesh , and that no man ever hated his own flesh , but he nourishes and cherishes it . Even if you want to ignore the New Testament , the writers & characters completely ignore that there are passages such as the Song of Solomon in the Old Testament , and the even the book of Proverbs which says , " Rejoice in the wife of thy youth , let her breasts satisfy you always " ! How can that be read in any way other way than that God knows , and approves of , and smiles on , the marital union and the enjoyment thereof ? Real men do n't ignore the value and needs of their wives . Those that do deny a very basic teaching of the Judeo / Christian religion . God NEVER said those things . It 's absurd . Sonia rebelled because of the misapplication of the teachings of the true God of Abraham . It did n't need to be so . How sad . What Sonia desperately needed was TRUTH , not tradition . In knowing , loving and obeying God , we love others more ; before ourselves . That is the faith of the God of Abraham , Isaac , Jacob & Joseph ; once for all delivered to the Saints ; bought & paid for by Jesus Christ , the Righteous . But alright , ignore all this and abandon ancient , holy Scripture and turn to the wisdom of homeless people & ghosts . That 's a good plan . I would never recommend this movie ; partly because the sexual content is unnecessarily graphic , but also because it really does n't offer any valuable insight . Check out " Yentl " if you want to see a much more useful treatment of Jewish tradition at odds with society .
0 OK , admittedly as an Orthodox woman who LIVES in Boro Park , I 'm going to be a little biased against this film . However , it seemed that Boaz Yakin 's sole purpose in making this film was Orthodox - bashing . With our wigs , modest attire , and separate seating , we 're a pretty easy target already . Yakin never made it past the surface . The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese : 1 . Yosi tells Sonia off for loving him more than G - d or their parents . Then he deliberately defies his father 's order that he not go swimming because of his poor health . 2 . Sonia flips out at her son 's bris . Why would a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction ? It 's hard to believe that she never attended one before . Let 's face it , even Reform Jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays . 3 . Was Mendel sleeping during his chosson classes ? He 's supposed to satisfy his wife 's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street . Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park ! 4 . Sonia and Mendel had to have been married for over a year , and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other ? A little clue -- arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with . Nor will she be shunned by the community if the marriage does n't work out . 5 . If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly , she did not have to go through her lecherous brother - in - law . There are Orthodox female doctors , lawyers , teachers , etc . Sonia came off as more whiny than sympathetic . Instead of taking control of her life , she sat back and waited for things to happen , and then complained that she did n't like the outcome . That 's not standing up to one 's environment ; that 's pandering to stereotype . Frankly , I think she got what she deserved .
0 We can start with the wooden acting but this film is a disaster . Having grown up in NY I can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people . I 'm not even a defender of the culture in any way and found this to be a Hollywoodized piece of trash to fit its own fictional , ridiculous culture presentation and language that anyone who watches Seinfeld knows is inaccurate . This is a colossal waste of time and , even worse , is not exactly interesting since the outcome is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are laughably bad . Who acts this way ? Nobody.<br /><br />The writer 's name sounds Israeli or something of that nature but it is clear he does n't have a clue about the subject he is writing about . Looking at his bio , it is shocking he lived in New York and wonder how much real connection he had with the community . Even mediocre films like " A Stranger Among Us " are better and more closer to the truth than this dreck . Reading this guy 's credits it 's no wonder he has written scripts on all C grade films that somehow feature stars . shocking . Perhaps he knows someone because this script is even below par for a bad Dolph Lundgren film .
0 This film has so little class in comparison to Strangers on a Train or even , Accidental Meeting for that matter , that despite plot similarities I would n't feel right in actually comparing this to either of them . The Yancy Butler character came across as such a dopey dimwit I was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue watching.<br /><br />I do n't enjoy many Lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home . I often groan silently but this film caused me to protest out loud , stand up leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself , before I returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torture.<br /><br />Dean Morgan , Rochester , NY
0 This movie was so bad it was laughable . I could n't resist watching it though . The plot is standard , the acting quite horrible ( supporting cast such as the nutty neighbor and the lawyer friend were better actors ) . Kind of amusing if you have some time to waste and like seeing the conclusion to a dramatic plot.<br /><br />The headliner who plays " Kathy " was just fascinating because I could n't decide if her deadpan , flat affect was the result of bad surgery or simply bad acting ( I decided it was both ) . This leaves the script to comment on , which was pretty awful . Pat remarks , idiotic decisions , and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the movie . Maybe this is what was so riveting ; I do n't know . I just watched it to see how bad it could be . ( Actually the dialog does n't even qualify to be called " cliche ' " - but it 's almost completely inane.)<br /><br />All in all , very bad , cheaply made movie . The sets , the same scenes ( a house , a building ) were shown over and over with no artistry or actual tie - in to the action ; more like props that were randomly dropped into the action in a bad play . A chase scene could have been shot by any juvenile in a warehouse or an old school : poorly shot , cheap props , minimal action .... and I still wanted to see the ending . Go figure .
0 There is a bit of a spoiler below , which could ruin the surprise of the ONE unexpected and truly funny scene in this film . There is also information about the first film in this series.<br /><br />I caught this film on DVD , which someone gave as a gift to my roommate . It came as a set together with the first film in the " Blind Dead " series.<br /><br />This movie was certainly much worse than the first , " La Noche del Terror Ciego " . In addition , many of the features of the first movie were changed significantly . To boot , the movie was dubbed in English ( the first was subtitled ) , which I tend to find distracting.<br /><br />The concept behind the series is that in the distant past a local branch of the Knights Templar was involved in heinous and secret rituals . Upon discovery of these crimes , the local peasantry put the Templars to death in such a manner that their eyes can no longer be used , thus preventing them from returning from Hell to exact their revenge . We then jump to modern times where because of some event , the Templars arise from the dead to exact their revenge upon the villagers whose ancestors messed them up in the first place . Of course , since the undead knights have no eyes , they can only find their victims when they make some sort of noise.<br /><br />The Templars were a secretive order , from about the 12th century , coming out of the Crusades . They were only around for about 150 years , before they were suppressed in the early 1300s by the Pope and others . Because they were secretive , there were always rumors about their ceremonies , particularly for initiation . Also , because of the way the society was organized , you did n't necessarily have church officials overseeing things , which meant they did n't have an inside man when things heated up . And , because of the nature of their trials , they were tortured into confessions . The order was strongest in France , but did exist in Portugal and Spain , where the movies take place.<br /><br />Where the first movie had a virgin sacrifice and knights drinking the blood directly from the body of the virgin ( breast shots here , of course , this is a horror film after all ) , and then , once the knights come back to life , they attack their victims by eating them alive and sucking their blood ; in this sequel , this all disappears . You still have the same scene ( redone , not the same footage ) of them sacrificing the virgin , but they drain the blood into a bowl and drink it from that . Thus , when they come back , they just hack people up with their swords or claw people to death , which I have to say is a much less effective means of disturbing your audience . There 's also a time problem : in the first film the dating is much closer to the Templars , where here they are now saying it is the 500 anniversary of the peasants burning these guys at the stake , which would date it around 1473 . And the way that the Templars lose their eyes is much less interesting as well . In the first , they have them pecked out by crows . Now they are simply burned out , and in quite a ridiculous manner.<br /><br />Oh yeah , and maybe it was just me , but there seemed to be a lot of people from the first movie reappearing in this film ( despite having died ) . Not really a problem , since the movie is completely different and not a sequel in the sense of a continuation , but odd none - the - less.<br /><br />The highlight of this movie is the rich fellow who uses a child to distract the undead while he makes a break for the jeep . The child 's father had already been suckered by this rich man into making an attempt to get the jeep , so he walks out and tells her to find her father . It comes somewhat out of the blue , and is easily the funniest scene in the film . Of course , why the child does n't die at this point is beyond me , and disappointed for horror fans.<br /><br />I could n't possibly recommend this film to anyone . It is n't so bad that it becomes funny , so it just ends up being a mediocre horror film . The bulk of the film has several people holed up in a church , each making various attempts to go it alone in order to escape the blind dead who have them surrounded . When the film ends , you are not surprised at the outcome at all ; in fact , quite disappointed . If you are into the novelty of seeing a Spanish horror film , see the first movie , which at least has some innovative ideas and not so expected outcomes .
0 oh my god , i give this film three stars out of ten for the following reasons . the final sequence is once again quite effectively handled and it was absolutely hilarious . that is what it gets those three points for . other than that , it was atrocious . it was nt meant to be this funny , that much is obvious , but the dubbing , the acting of the dubbed voices , the dialogue they said , where often hilarious . the actions performed , and/or not performed also lead to much hilarity and/or throwing things at the screen . such as when the whole town is being slaughtered and one small group of people stand on a balcony looking on as if they were watching a cooking glass , or the " attempted " escapes from the church in which they hole up.<br /><br />evil mayor : i think something is going on outside so you should go upstairs and look out the window.<br /><br />hero : ok.<br /><br />evil mayor : now is my chance to make some idiot go outside and flail around with fire being totally ineffective and getting hacked up.<br /><br />insert sequence in which this occurs.<br /><br />evil mayor : damn , wait , i will get this small child and she will walk outside and cry pappa seemingly obvlious to the fact that those rotten corpses are not just spooky strangers but are actually zombies with no flesh or skin or anything and she will lead them away and i will flee ! insert sequence in which this occurs.<br /><br />hero ( upstairs ) : he is trying to escape again , fool , and he has left the door open , he is silly , this is a nice view.<br /><br />woman : where is my daughter?<br /><br />hero ( downstairs now ) : i do nt know , i can not see her anyway and she was not outside because i could not see her despite her being out there and me having a view of the entire neighbourhood and she is standing right outside , where on earth could she be?<br /><br />needless to say , anybody would be throwing things at the screen after 10 minutes of this . so , watch the first film with a couple of friends , having a few drinks , and make sure by the time you get to watching this one , you are absolutely blindly drunk and can just giggle at the stupidity of it all . and there was nt even any decent gore , such a shame .
0 This superior inferiority to the original dumb " Blind Dead " movie is another trash bin waste . So many people have hyped up these films that I ca n't believe what they say about it . Since I was a kid I have heard about how scary and great these films are and I saw them all and was throughly disappointed , was everyone on drugs , from the 1970 's or do they just not know how boring this crude is ?
0 My first exposure to the Templarios & not a good one . I was excited to find this title among the offerings from Anchor Bay Video , which has brought us other cult classics such as " Spider Baby " . The print quality is excellent , but this alone ca n't hide the fact that the film is deadly dull . There 's a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the Templars ( & set the whole thing in motion ) , but everything else in the movie is slow , ponderous & , ultimately , unfulfilling . Adding insult to injury : the movie was dubbed , not subtitled , as promised on the video jacket .
0 beyond the fact crazy people exist and there are religious nuts out there.<br /><br />The characters basically make no sense most of the time.<br /><br />The film has no real beginning , middle or ending , nor is anything ever explained much.<br /><br />The film opens with a young man , with the unlikely name of Hazel Motes , apparently returning from a stint in the army.<br /><br />He hitches a ride to a two story house that is in extreme disrepair , windows boarded over . He goes in the house , walks around and finally writes a note that he leaves there . This scene comes to nothing , and we learn nothing further about the house or its history.<br /><br />It is never explained exactly whose house this is , or where the people have gone , but we are given the impression Hazel has probably lived there at one time.<br /><br />Hazel decides to go to a city . Why - we do n't know . Once he arrives in this city he writes down a name & address that he sees on a bathroom wall , and goes to visit this woman , who is a surprisingly fat hooker . He sees her for awhile and then he apparently is n't seeing her anymore . Like everything else in this movie , it comes to nothing and serves no purpose.<br /><br />A young man named Enoch , tries to befriend him , but Hazel really is n't interested , although they keep crossing paths.<br /><br />Enoch is about as crazy as you can get . One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage where the chimps are and talk at them insultingly.<br /><br />We never really know why Enoch behaves as he does , or why Hazel behaves as he does , beyond the fact Hazel had an overdose of old time scary , fundamentalist religion via his grandfather.<br /><br />Enoch later becomes enthralled with a man who dresses in a gorilla suit , and manages to get the gorilla suit from him and then runs around in it.<br /><br />Hazel , who is wound rather tight and seems to be in a constant borderline rage does a bit of street preaching . I got the impression he was trying to free himself from the untruths of the religion that had been drilled into him.<br /><br />He has several encounters with a preacher and his daughter , although their interactions never really make any particular point , and there is no plot line.<br /><br />Eventually Hazel succumbs to complete religious fervor and begins self - harming.<br /><br />It is a very odd film . Interesting in it 's oddness but other than that it has absolutely nothing going for it.<br /><br />The cast does an outstanding job , but this film completely fails to deliver either a point of view or a storyline.<br /><br />The film also has the characters tossing around the N word from time to time with no connection to the rest of the dialog.<br /><br />2 stars
0 I realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always problematic . That is the only positive thing I can say about this truly horrid adaptation.<br /><br />Have you read ' Wise Blood ? ' It 's an amazing book . Flannery O'Connor wrote about the south as no one else has . She was a southerner herself , a devout catholic , and a remarkably gifted writer . In her first novel she wove together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith , doubt , and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising evenhandedness . The characters in the book may seem outrageous to those who have not lived in the rural south , but I can assure you that such people do exist . Not only do they exist , they are human beings with families , feelings , and concerns like anyone else . Flannery 's intentions were so often misunderstood - she was not lampooning these backwoods zealots - she saw in them the beautiful operation of what she would have called ' grace' ... even in the most violent , distressing , and maddening of circumstances . To read ' Wise Blood ' is to be washed over with a sense of dread and impending doom . Finally , it is to think long and hard about our judgments and preconceptions - our entire world view.<br /><br />None of this comes through in John Huston 's ' Gilligan 's Island'-like adaptation . None . It is a farce . A bad farce . The entire film is saturated with a hauteur that turns the stomach . The acting is poor , the southern accents are fake and insulting . The filmmakers show no insight into the thinking of religious southerners . Ms. O'Connor 's intense prose are reduced to sight gags and cheap , amateur theatre . The soundtrack is a mixture of hayseed silliness and ' Clockwork Orange'-style cheeseball electronics that does n't fit the story or even the MOVIE . I was granted free admission to this movie and almost walked out . Truly , truly terrible.<br /><br />As an aside , I do not agree with Ms. O'Connor 's religious views , and while I was raised in the deep south , years ago I made my way north and have not looked back . But the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals ( like every other place on earth ) , and the cartoonish mockery with which southerners and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive . If you 're into being offended ( which I am not ) , then this movie most DEFINITELY crosses the line.<br /><br />I do n't like to talk crap about an artist 's work - John Huston was a man that I did not know , and I 'm sure he was a sincere and gifted filmmaker , to which his respected place in film history attests . My views are clearly skewed by having read ( and loved ) Flannery O'Connor 's work . So I do n't claim to be coming from any other perspective . Maybe as a stand - alone film it works for cinephiles . But for Flannery O'Connor fans - and , I might add , for self - respecting southerners and openminded individuals of all stripes - this movie is a waste of time .
0 John Huston 's Wise Blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of Flannery O'Connor 's book than I could have imagined . From the utterly terrible acting performances ( and do n't you , " Oh that was done on purpose , you just do n't get it " me ! ) to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files , this film was revolting . I viewed it with no ill - will at the outset , and , in fact , expected a pleasant experience . But the misrepresentation of the southern characters , from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting , comedic way their faith was portrayed , was inexcusable . Right down to it 's end , which was completely devoid of any character sentiment , it failed in every place that O'Connor 's book shined and resonated . The actors portraying the " southern " policemen may as well have been eating smothered hot - dogs from NYC street stands and quoting Godfather . The one redeeming acting performance was Ned Beatty 's lively and dead - on representation of Hoover Shoates , a religious con - artist who hears Moates preaching the Church of Christ Without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities . O'Connor 's powerful book is most well - known for it 's creepy , religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of " Faith " . Mr. Huston 's film is a shameful mockery of the author 's intentions , as they are understood by me and most of her fans , if I may be so bold as to say so . While I acknowledge that I ca n't know exactly what the author wished to convey , I have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan . If I viewed Wise Blood the way Mr. Huston apparently did , I would have thrown it in the trash . For Flannery 's sake , and mine , I forgive you , John Huston . The forgetting .... that will take some time .
0 This " screwy comedy " seems very forced . Indeed , the actors TRY very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script . And , as a result it does n't really go anywhere . The idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant after getting a quickie divorce just is n't all that funny . And then , when Cooper sneaks off with the baby because he does n't want it put up for adoption just seems terribly unfunny and it 's really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy . It 's really a shame , too , as the actors were more capable than the script and I found myself just bored by the whole mess . Considering that Cooper made so many GOOD comedies , I recommend you see them instead .
0 This movie starts out promisingly , with an early scene in which Frank Morgan advises against Gary Cooper 's marriage to his daughter , Anita Louise . Frank Morgan , playing an unabashed gold - digger , loudly complains to Cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family - including his daughter , Anita Louise . I am a fan of all 3 actors . Frank Morgan is ( to my mind ) a Hollywood treasure , Cooper a legend , and Louise a very lovely , versatile and under - appreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role . I also have nothing against Teresa Wright , and while not blessed with great range , she usually delivers heart - warming performances.<br /><br />From a promising opening , the story slides downhill all the way to the end . I found nothing humorous about burning down the home of Cooper 's would - be in - laws . The butler in such a fastidious , non - smoking household would never just blithely walk away , allowing Cooper to continue smoking , or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his ill - timed cigarette . Moreover , nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it . And finally , nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket ! This whole sequence just made Cooper seem foolish and gauche . It is a poor contrivance - ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not laughter . < br /><br />The forced medical examination of Cooper is equally contrived . Nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent ! That Cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny - it 's absurd ! Stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense , and that , too , is nothing to laugh about . Finally , the scenes of Cooper 's overly fastidious , neurotic attention to his baby 's feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies . But to me they just seem tedious and slow . The wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes , while paradoxically , the script writer went to sleep.<br /><br />The lines are just not in the script to generate humor . They just miss on all cylinders . The laughs come not a mile - a - minute , but more like a light year - a - minute . The only time the movie has any energy or humor is when Frank Morgan is on camera.<br /><br />The scene that is totally wasted is when both of Cooper 's love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together . There is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine , but none of it was extracted.<br /><br />In the end , one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt . Predictably , it is the Anita Louise character , who gets jilted on her would - be - wedding night ! While it is not on camera , that is her fate , and it is not particularly funny - even as a loose end . She had n't done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic ( unlike Gail Patrick , say , in My Favorite Wife ) . Consequently , I was expecting ( perhaps " hoping " is a better word in the context of the film ! ) for Anita Louise to enjoy a happy ending , too . The fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie 's end really undermines the effect of the " happy ending " for Cooper and Wright.<br /><br />I kept waiting for something to happen , for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era ... And it never delivered . A good performance by Frank Morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here .
0 Why is it that a woman can not be a strong character in a movie without sleeping with the leading man ? The campaign manager in this movie dreams of leading Tom Sellick to the White House . It 's all she can think about . So , why on earth must she have had an affair with him ? It added nothing to the plot and served only to demean successful women . The only value of that tidbit was the cute " we 've all slept with your husband " scene . < br /><br />Also , could n't the people who made this movie have watched the national conventions they were spoofing ? Airing between the two major political conventions only served to highlight their total ignorance of the nomination and selection process .
0 Dreadful acting . A thinly veiled attempt to slam those on the left side of the aisle.<br /><br />Women are subjugated and revolve around men . Tom Selleck shows his acting range from A to B.
0 Another trashy Grade Z quickie from the prolific Albert Pyun . Tim Thomerson¬¥s 13 inch Clint Eastwood - like cop from outer space chases an ugly flying head ( ! ) to Earth and gets involved in a gang war in South Bronx ! Mercifully short , but deadeningly dull , with the cheesiest effects since Attack of the 50Ft Woman . They should have fired the continuity guy , too : Note how Thomerson¬¥s sunglasses disappears and reappears in every second shot . Laughably bad , but that¬¥s why we watch these movies , ain¬¥t it ? Sequel ¬¥ Dollman Vs . Demonic Toys ¬¥ is reportedly even worse , if that¬¥s possible.<br /><br />0 ( of * * * * ) < br /><br / >
0 This film is really unbelievable . I 've seen so much cheap trash - movies , especially a lot ' Full Moon'-Pictures , but ' Dollman ' is really hard . So much comes together : the laughable story , the actors always at the edge of parody and the special effects ! How long I could talk about them ! It is a really bad movie , but also one of the funniest ones . If you 're a fan of bad movies to laugh about , you have to see it . And do n't miss ' Dollman vs. Demonic Toys ' . It really funnier and worse .
0 Feh . This movie started out in an interesting manner , but quickly ran the gamut from confusing to dull . The confusing parts happened mostly at the beginning , where the cut scenes are so numerous that its hard to tell just what is going on for the first twenty minutes or so . The dull comes later , with a tepid romance between the two living people(pusses both ) . The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the film , which is sad . If the rest of the cast had been up to her caliber , the movie might have been better.<br /><br />Maybe . Because the storyline gets really interesting for awhile , as it appears that the insane priestess mother of the dead sixteen year old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from the dead , with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all of the other dead people would come back as well , take on solid human form , and most likely start killing off everybody . A sort of Japanese mystical Night of the Living Dead type thing . But this does n't come to pass . Even though this hairy unwashed priest with a tiny basket strapped to his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will come to pass if the priestess finishes her ritual , she does just that and the only dead person who manifests is her daughter . No mass rising of the dead , no walking army of corpses , nothing . The priest merely makes the girl 's spirit go back to the land of the dead , taking the washed out wuss of a boyfriend with her , as she 'd crushed his spine like peanut brittle(at which point I was tempted to cheer loudly , as this idiot went over to kiss and fondle the DEAD girl,,ewwww ! ! ! ) . The Robitussen sucking , spineless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end as she leaves the village for the last time , and that 's it . No real horror , no real creepiness , which the Japanese tend to do far better than American film makers with their emphasis on over - the - top cheesy face make - up , no screaming mimis . I was very disappointed .
0 As a girl , Hinako moved away from her small village to Tokyo , leaving behind her two best friends , Fumiya and Sayori . She returns as a young woman , surprised to find that Sayori died when she was a teenager . She reunites with Fumiya and they are horrified to learn that Sayori is mysteriously being resurrected via the island of Shikoku . Oh boy . I rented this because I like Asian horror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama a nifty actress . Unfortunately , if I had to describe Shikoku in one word , it would be " fruity . " This movie is silly , boring , poorly filmed , unimaginative , and most of all , unscary . Kuriyama has minimal screen time as the resurrected Sayori , and her character is given little to work with .
0 This quasi J - horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of Shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends . She finds that one , the daughter of the village priestess , drowned several years earlier . She and Fumiko ( another childhood friend ) then learn that Sayori 's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic . Already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts . Nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie . Unlike stellar J - horror films , the suspense does n't really build , the result does n't seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurd.<br /><br />This movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy . Sometimes you get this at poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long . You end up eating it , because you need it with the meal , because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice , but it almost ruins the meal because of the gluey , gooey tastelessness of it all . 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
0 I must say that I am fairly disappointed by this " horror " movie . I did not get scared even once while watching it . It also is not very suspenseful either .... I was able to guess the ending half way through the movie ... So .. what 's left?<br /><br />"The Ring " is a trully scary movie ... I wish other movies would stop copying from it ( e.g. the trade - mark : long hair ) . Please give me some originality.<br /><br />Will not recommend this movie .
0 This was one film i wanted to watch always when it released The promos were eye catching and Govinda in a negative role was a surprise < br /><br />But the film is n't that good < br /><br />It has lot of flaws < br /><br />The start is good and till the murder everything goes well but the film falls flat when the romance track starts between Govinda and Karisma and the songs that follow < br /><br />Then the twist about Govinda and Tabu being in love leaves more doubts and flaws and then How come Govinda turns into a rich criminal from a poor villager?<br /><br />The last flashback too is prolonged and also the entire clash between Govinda - Karisma and Tabu < br /><br />N Chandra disappoints Music is okay , Bahot Khoobsurat stands out < br /><br />Govinda tries a negative role and does very well in it though he overdoes it too much at times Karisma is good but irritates at times with her cries Tabu is okay Nirmal Pandey still does n't know the difference between loud screaming and acting rest are okay
0 i am a big fan of karishma Kapoor and Govinda . I watched this film after i had seen Fiza , which was absolutley brilliant.<br /><br />There are films that are bad , and there are films that are cr*p . but this film just takes the biscuit.<br /><br />We were so annoyed that we were conned out of paying our money expecting a decent film.<br /><br />avoid at all cost , do nt even rent it.<br /><br />1/10
0 " I went to the movies , to see ' Beat Street ' / it was n't bad , it was kinda ' neat / ' Krush Groove ' was a flick , that I did n't mind / but when it came to ' Rappin ' , I drew the line . " Word to your mother.<br /><br />Want me to stop?<br /><br />That 's just a small sample of the stupa - fly style of rhymin ' on display in this waste of film and location permits . This movie is seriously wack ( that s 80s - speak for just f*cking awful ) . As an emcee , Mario Van Peebles is one hell of an actor . And as an actor , Mario Van Peebles is one hell of a bodybuilder.<br /><br />Any film calling itself " Rappin ' " had better deliver at that genre 's highest standard of the time . So why were 6 year olds rolling in the aisles , even back in the day when standards were so knee - high - to-"Webster "- low ? Because this rap is weak . So weak that not even B.E.T. or Comedy Central will touch it with a 10-foot gold - rope chain.<br /><br />Blondie 's " Rapture " is def poetry next to this bit of Dr. Suess in the hood . So do n't be a boobie , avoid this movie!<br /><br / >
0 I have copy of this on VHS , I think they ( The television networks ) should play this every year for the next twenty years . So that we do n't forget what was and that we remember not to do the same mistakes again . Like putting some people in the director 's chair , where they do n't belong . This movie Rappin ' is like a vaudevillian musical , for those who ca n't sing , or act . This movie is as much fun as trying to teach the ' blind ' to drive a city bus.<br /><br />John Hood , ( Peebles ) has just got out of prison and he 's headed back to the old neighborhood . In serving time for an all - to - nice crime of necessity , of course . John heads back onto the old street and is greeted by kids dogs old ladies and his peer homeys as they dance and sing all along the way.<br /><br />I would recommend this if I was sentimental , or if in truth someone was smoking medicinal pot prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma . Either way this is a poorly directed , scripted , acted and even produced ( I never thought I 'd sat that ) satire of ghetto life with the ' Hood ' . Although , I think the redeeming part of the story , through the wannabe gang fight sequences and the dance numbers , his friends care about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from being torn down and cleaned up . < br /><br />Forget Sonny spoon , Mario could have won an Oscar for that in comparison to this Rap . Oh well if you find yourself wanting to laugh yourself silly and three - quarters embarrassed , be sure to drink first . < br /><br />And please , watch responsibly . ( No stars , better luck next time ! )
0 Fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman . The lead actress Stacey Walker is well - cast and strangely attractive . She resembles a deranged Renee Zellweger with a bad hair - do . This chick only made two of these films and then moved back to Texas . The music is terrible . One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville ( from the TV show THE ROOKIES ) using a different name.<br /><br />Best line in the film from Tony - " Are you putting me on , doll ? None of my chicks put me on " . Good B / W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs ( EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others ) . Good locales ( cool swimming pool , also used in THE DEFILERS ) . Strange ending but fitting . A 4 out of 10 . Best performance Stacey Walker .
0 " Paula , I may be a bitch , but I 'll never be a butch ! " < br /><br />A hilarious line in an otherwise rather tiresome skin flick which features a pretty honey in Stacey Walker , but that 's about all . This gal 's a real tease who lures her boyfriends , co - workers and even her lesbian roommate Paula into her bedroom , but then turns into a whack job who cries " rape " and calls for the police ! < br /><br />The schizophrenic personality of this certified c**t is interesting for maybe a little while , but this story ultimately turns into a real repetitive one - note affair . At least the ending is worth the wait , for those who will still care by that time .
0 I 'm hearing rumors of an upcoming " Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu - ray Disc " . With advances over the past 25 years ranging from Steady - cam to CGI , it 'll be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvigorated . I just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left in my mouth by that whole Magnavision demonstration fiasco.<br /><br />And yes ... " Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Betamax VCR " was a brilliant milestone in entertainment history . After the tentative " Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Compact Cassette " and the downright tacky " Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the 8-Track Tape " , who would have expected such a glorious piece of cinema ? I 'm weeping right now just thinking about it .
0 While this outing certainly does n't live up to its predecessor , it does have more than its share of memorable moments . My personal favorite , just after laying waste to a city block with his " Videodisc Cannon , " we see a close up of Nimoy 's face . As a single tear sheds from his left eye , we know at that point that Nimoy is more than just a killing machine . The viewer ca n't help but be pulled into his emotional turmoil and we understand that his previously flat affect was only a facade . Absolute brilliance ! ! ! The sex scenes display a nice balance , carnal , but not pornographic . Afterwards , I felt I had a pretty good understanding of how to work the Magnavision Videodisc Player . Too bad they have n't produced them in over 25 years .
0 Twin brothers separated at birth ( Due to the deaths of their parents ) reunite twenty five years later to avenge their parents and take back their million dollar tunnel . Double Impact runs at two hours long and basically adds no real approach to the Corsican Brothers plot and Jean - Claude Van Damme while adequate as the evil twin brother is just embarrassing as the good twin brother . Also the action sequences are n't as exciting this time and Jean - Claude relies more on gunfire then on his martial arts . Also the supporting cast is wasted and at two hours the movie is just plain dull.<br /><br / > * out of 4(Bad )
0 Plot Synopsis : Hong Kong , 1966 . Paul Wagner , the man who built the Victoria Tunnel , is murdered along with his wife by his associates . His twin sons , Chad & Alex , are split apart . 25 years later , Chad , a karate instructor in Los Angeles , & Alex , a smuggler living in Hong Kong , join forces to avenge their parents ' murder & rightfully claim the tunnel.<br /><br />This is the second time that Jean - Claude Van Damme & Sheldon Lettich have worked together , having previously done " Lionheart " . This is also the first of three films to feature Van Damme playing dual roles ( " Maximum Risk " & " Replicant " are the others ) . The plot is a very simplistic take on the revenge story , the film 's sole redeeming feature being Van Damme 's performance as two very different people ¬ñ the prissy rich kid & the rough-&-tumble , cigar chomping tough guy . As it goes , Van Damme does n't do a very good job in either role , although his take on Alex is mildly amusing . It is puzzling as to have the brothers mistaken for each other , with them wearing different clothes & having different hairstyles . Bolo Yeung makes a very worthy henchman for the baddies .
0 Normally , I do n't like revenge films .... PERIOD . But Double Impact has a little more than your typical revenge plot premise . You see , DI has action , accuracy , exotic locales(i.e . Hong Kong ) , awesome gun battles , and enough martial arts to satisfy your cravings for impressive unarmed combat . Like all revenge flicks , it has villains you 'd love to throw out of a plate - glass window on the top floor of a 40-story building ! However , Double Impact has none of the sensationalist crap that suffocates the plot and the elitist , racist , and venomous social stereotypes that invaded " Eye for an Eye " and " Death Wish 2".<br /><br />But in the plot department Double Impact is as transparent as saran wrap . Chad and Alex 's parents were killed by a mob hit squad connected to a family friend with money problems or at least that 's what I remembered . The explanation of why the boys were talking in French accents is a lousy one . It was n't the watery plot that made this movie bad , but the use of clich√©d lines and moves from other movies ( from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride ) really made it worse . But nonetheless Double Impact is still watchable . But why is that shitty movies like this have villains(for example , that greedy British guy that killed Chad and Alex 's parents and that lethal lesbian redhead chick ) you would love to hate with fiber of your being ?
0 Please , even if you are in the worst of the moods , refrain from watching this flick . < br /><br />I do n't think whether anything was right with this movie at all . On a friend 's recommendation I watched this and I literally flushed 1h and 48 min of my life down the closet . Poor acting , stupid direction , weak storyline and pathetic action sequences - and when you blend this together you get " Double Impact " . Even least of the expectations were not met . < br /><br />I guess I did learn one thing - Never watch Van Damme action flicks . They are pure wastage of time !
0 I do n't see how anyone who even likes Van Damne could like this movie.<br /><br />The movie actually starts out with some promise . I would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent . The actions scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a great start and is good lead in to the main story . However , the film is all down hill from there . < br /><br />It would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise . That is the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills . One brother is supposed to be skilled in Martial Arts , but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms . How convenient when the time arises that the brother who has never picked up a gun before all of the sudden is a great marksman , and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all of the sudden doing the splits and high kicks.<br /><br />The plot , action , etc . are just plain ridiculous . My favorite scenes ? How about when Van Damne is confronting an armed soldier with an AK-47 . The soldier is about 100 yards away . Instead of aiming and shooting at Van Damne he is doing a war cry like he is wielding a battle axe and running at him . Van Damne proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him, ... while he is still about 75 to 80 yards away . < br /><br />This movie has one of the most disappointing endings . Bolo Yeung is a skilled martial artist . However , instead of choreographing a decent fight . Bolo is throwing barrels at Van Damne like Donkey Kong . Absolutely aggravating movie that had so much promise . If your a Van Damne fan , save your time and see Hard Target or one of his earlier films .
0 Gee , what a heck of a movie ! ... I said I wanted to become a specialist in bad movies from all decades , so I decided to start by this one . It was a pretty adequate choice . I entered this adventure to find some lost gems and uncomprehended masterpieces , but I did n't see anything of the sort in this pastel - coloured mess . I have n't really watched many bad films before , but I 've got the feeling this is what 's called " so bad that 's good " , probably because it is so unintentionally damn funny ! First of all , there are the inaccuracies . There are plot - related inaccuracies , physical inaccuracies , and also psychological inaccuracies . The latter in particular are as insane as Van Damme 's ass cheeks inside that blue spandex . Extremely tacky lines exist too and I wo n't even start to talk about some of the hilarious action moves . There is n't exactly bad acting from everyone involved in that hot mess of a movie , except in one particular case . Geoffrey Lewis looks completely pathetic as Frank , which is an utterly stupid character . And , to tell the truth , I was actually very surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job playing the twins . He succeeded in achieving a different tone and mood in the two roles that was convincing to me . But the movie was mostly very bad and the sad part is that it was produced by a major motion picture studio ... which is now bankrupt .
0 Jean - Claude Van Damme plays twin brothers Alex and Chad , both whom are martial arts expert who team up to take down the mobsters responsible for the murder of the parents in this empty headed martial arts actioner which does n't have a plot that would make better use of the gimmick of having two Jean - Claude Van Dammes . Some okay actionscenes , but this is not one of Van Damme 's best .
0 I would of enjoyed this film but Van Damme just does the same old same old rubbish time after time . Poo knickers fight scenes as per usually . The only thing this loser left out was the Russians normally end up being killed in the end . This film is utter doggy do do of the highest nature , please please please Van Damme get some acting lessons , you need them . Anyone who likes Van Damme has issues , It seems sad that the only way Van Damme ever gets any acting work is when he co writes the film , co produces the film and does the screen play for the film . AVOID VAN DAMME AND HIS SLICKED BACK NASTY WIG . I give this film a two out of ten , because the one with the the sandman was better . To add insult to injury I wasted a quid on this manure
0 I suppose if you like pure action ... you 'll find it here . I suppose if you find a gorgeous blonde designed to be screwed ... find it here . I suppose if you want to find a couple of extra baddies , headed by 1 - 2 extra , EXTRA baddy bosses who meat a nasty end ... you 'll find it here.<br /><br />Overall , routine stuff , and the good guys come out on top big time under extra - ordinary circumstances.<br /><br />What I marvel most at ... How the good guys armed only with pistols , can kill dozens of bad guys with machine guns who are shooting at them at point blank range ... and missing . The goodies even get time to reload their pistols amid the hail of machine guns bullets.<br /><br />Ho - hum ! ! !
0 Well , it was funny in spots . This film is a 4 or maybe a 3 . Its a film that sits on the video shelf and gathers dust . Rent this one after you seen everything else . Beats boredom , but not by that much . My wife like like this film better then I do , maybe its not that bad .
0 I 've written at least a half dozen scathing reviews of this abysmal little flick and none get published , so I must opine that someone at imdb.com really likes this awful movie . The idea that a bunch of oilmen can resurrect a military tank that has set in the desert for over a decade , and make a fighting machine of it again is ludicrous . So is the acting and direction . Pass on it .
0 In a movie that follows a struggling actor , played , evidently , by a struggling actor , this does no favours for Chris Klein . He struggles to bring anything memorable to the role and meanders on through the shallow script managing to display , what could only be described as , a bland leading man . The story exists , but that is all , and fails to show any basic start , middle and end and the viewer is left shrugging his shoulders feeling as though nothing in the past hour and three quarters has really happened.<br /><br />One bright light in the midst of this is Fred Durst , who manages to stand out above his seemingly averagely talented co - stars and does a semi - decent job of bringing the backward character of Legde to life . Whether Fred can re - create this when working with a higher calibre of cast remains to be seen but I'l be watching out for him in future .
0 Dumb is as dumb does , in this thoroughly uninteresting , supposed black comedy . Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile , eventually morphs into an uninspired version of " The Three Amigos " , only without any laughs . In order for black comedy to work , it must be outrageous , which " Play Dead " is not . In order for black comedy to work , it can not be mean spirited , which " Play Dead " is . What " Play Dead " really is , is a town full of nut jobs . Fred Dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton 's character from " A Simple Plan " , while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of , well , Jake Busey . - MERK
0 It 's been a long time since I last saw a movie this bad .. The acting is very average , the story is horribly boring , and I 'm at a loss for words as to the execution . It was completely unoriginal . O , and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood 's a pregnant Schwarzenegger ! < br /><br />One of the first scenes ( the one with the television show - where the hell are you ? ) got it right - the cast was 80 % of let 's face it - forgotten actors . If they were hoping for a career relaunch , then I think it might never happen with this on their CV ! The script had the potential , but neither 80 % of the actors nor the director ( who 's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor ) pulled it off . Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.<br /><br />I'm sorry , but if you ever consider watching this - I highly recommend you turn to something less traumatic , because not only it 's a total loss of time , but also a weak example of what bad cinema looks like .
0 Once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent . Reuniting with some former co - stars to clean up the town.<br /><br />Low key , often to the point of blandness , " action " comedy mostly just does n't work . Part of the problem is the casting Chris Klien as a former action hero . he 's not bad , but he 's really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy . As I said he 's not bad , he 's just just miscast for what his back story is . The real problem here is the combination of the script , which really is n't funny and seems artificial at times , and the direction which is pedestrian to the port of dullness . There is no life in the way things are set up . Its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list . It makes for an un - engaging film . And yet the film occasionally springs to life , such as the in the final show down that ends the film . That sequence works , but because the earlier parts of the film floundered its drained of much of its power.<br /><br />I ca n't really recommend the film . Its worth a shot if you 're a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms , but otherwise this is just a disappointment .
0 After having watched Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of it , I finally had a chance to see it 's sequel Life In Transformation . I was truly dissappointed as it did not nearly stand up to the high standards of the first . 90 minutes of people with baskets on their head is not my idea of a good movie . The Philip Glass score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first . Compared with Koyaanisqatsi this movie seemed slow and pointless . A watered down version of Baraka , which is the same idea but done better . I truly hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste .
0 I should have trusted my instincts better : No expectations - no disappointments . Instead , however , I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi ( 1983 ) and was brutally disappointed . Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a cheap attempt to cash in on the cult success of its predecessor , and - artistically - it fails miserably . It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi , hurriedly threw it together , placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to hurriedly throw together some banal background music , which is incessantly repeated . Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes , Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of mundane images in slow - motion ( if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode , you 'll see what I mean ) . What disappointed me the most , however , was Philip Glass 's soundtrack . I could n't - and still ca n't - believe that these commercial - sounding New Age type drones , which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by any 14-year - old on a Casio calculator , were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly - synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi . All in all , a big waste of time ! My advice : Forget commercialism ! Watch Koyaanisqatsi again instead !
0 Drones , ethnic drumming , bad synthesizer piping , children singing . The most patronizing " world music " imaginable . This is a tourist film , and a lousy one . What really kills it is the incoherent sequences . India , Egypt , South America , Africa , etc , etc . No transitions , no visual explanation of why we 're suddenly ten thousand miles away , no ideas expressed in images . Just a bunch of footage of third - worlders with " baskets on their heads " as another reviewer said . Walking along endlessly as if that had some deep meaning . If these guys wanted to make a 3rd World music video , all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of Koya were shot , and film in Mexico . That would have been a much better setting for " life in transformation." < br /><br />But no . What they decided on was a scrambled tourist itinerary covering half the globe and mind - deadeningly overcranked filter shots . The only thing to recommend this film is that it does n't suck quite as much as Naqoyqatsi.<br /><br />RstJ
0 It was a good story , but not very well told . I liked the themes and the main story line , which was n't as clear as it could have been . Maybe there was too much going on and a lack of ability to reign it all in . The acting was okay to cheesy , some were stronger than others and even the stronger actors had their moments of lesser quality acting . It took me a couple of months to get through the entire movie because it did n't keep my attention and the flow was just bad . I only just finished watching it and I 'm glad I did as the movie finally gets moving and has some continuity toward the end . Again , a good story , but the delivery was sub par . Would recommend it for the story line and maybe a little eye candy , and I do mean , a little .
0 This foolish , implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hard - boiled police detective delivers some nearly - audible lines confirming our greatest fears : He is dead . Perhaps the film would have been saved had the director forgone the dazzling star power of A. Martinez in favor of this sadly - anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment . That a no - name hack - tor off the street could salvage such a dishwater film is no less likely than a villain committing murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver . His moment is brief ; his promise is immense . Perhaps we will be treated to more screen time by this obscure thespian if there is ever a sequel to this ill - advised film .
0 in this movie , joe pesci slams dunks a basketball . joe pesci ... <br /><br />and being consistent , the rest of the script is equally not believable.<br /><br />pesci is a funny guy , which saves this film from sinking int the absolute back of the cellar , but the other roles were pretty bad . the father was a greedy businessman who valued money more than people , which was n't even well - played . instead of the man being an archetypal villain , he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs . then there 's the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something ... i do n't even remember ... she was that forgettable.<br /><br />anyone who rates this movie above a 5 or 6 is a paid member of some sort of film studio trying to up the reputation of this sunken film , or at least one of those millions of media minions who ca n't critique efficiently ( you know , the people who feel bad if they give anything a mark below 6).<br /><br />stay away ... far away . and shame on comedy central , where i saw this film . they usually pick better .

0 Profanity , stupidity , self - indulgence , and bad acting all join forces for a true tour de force in terrible movie - making . Pesci 's attempt to prove My Cousin Vinny was no fluke , shows the opposite instead . He is generally too lightweight and foulmouthed to handle the lead . A true must - miss !
0 I have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget films , so that was not my problem with it . My problem with it is that I felt like I was watching my next door neighbor 's home movie . IMO everything about it just seemed like a guy wrote out a quick story , grabbed a camera , and started shooting . I understand how hard this must be to do effectively , but when I pay to rent a film , I expect to feel like I am watching some type of professionally made movie.<br /><br />John Schneider has a huge resume , is a great actor , and was fine in this film . The other people in it were not . I understand how it must be fun , and cheaper to use friends , and relatives as the cast , but it does n't make for convincing acting . It seemed like the way it was shot , he was trying to give many of the scenes a more interesting look , but when the writing , plot , and acting are there to begin with , that type of style is n't necessary , and it is a distraction.<br /><br />Also on a technical level , it had digital artifacts all over the place . In the first scene of all of those fine cars , when they did a slow scan of them , they appeared to jerk back and forth just a little bit . The problem is n't in my viewing equipment , ( Benq PE-8700 84 " diagonal ) but somewhere in the production . I 've never seen that kind of artifact in a professionally made film before . Then there was the sound . It sounded like they did n't do any voice - overs , which may be o.k . unless it sounded like the track in this film . It sounded like the built in microphone on the camera .
0 The eight Jean Rollin film I have watched is also possibly the weirdest ; the intriguing plot ( such as it is ) seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along ! A would - be female vampire ( scantily - clad , as promised by the title ) is held in captivity inside a remote ch√¢teau and emerges only to ' feast ' on the blood of willing victims ( who are apparently members of a suicide club ) As if unsure where all of this would lead him , the writer - director ultimately has the human villain ¬ñ actually the blank - faced hero 's kinky father ¬ñ ludicrously revealed as a mutant ( ? ! ) from the future ! The languorous pace and dream - like atmosphere ( the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl ) are , of course , typical of both the film - maker ( ditto the seashore setting at the { anti}climax ) and the " Euro - Cult " style , as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display . Personally , the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor Bernard Musson ( who appeared in six latter - day Luis Bunuel films ) crop up bemusedly through it from time to time !
0 French director Jean Rollin is n't exactly known for great films , and this confusing mess is one of the reasons why . One of the most confusing things about this production is the title . For a director who is well known for directing erotic films about lesbian vampires ; you would expect a film with the word ' nude ' in the title to be a particularly bare - breasted one ; but in fact , there 's not a lot of nudity here at all . Instead of erotic lesbian vampires with no clothes on ; we 've got a cumbersome plot about a man who wants to unlock the secret to immortality , a young woman whose affliction might hold the key and a suicide cult , who do n't get to do much . The film starts off promisingly with a sequence that sees a young girl carried off by a mysterious bunch of people in masks under the watchful eye of a young French man , who also happens to be the son of a man of importance . Through his investigation , he soon discovers that this woman is not just a normal lady , and as he delves deeper into the cult ; he discovers that can not be killed by bullets , drinks blood and ca n't go out in daylight ... sounds like a clear cut case of vampirism to me.<br /><br />Jean Rollin keeps the fantasy atmosphere going throughout the film , but it fails to be interesting because the plot is so badly executed . It is possible to keep up with what 's going on , but only because there 's so many other films that follow similar plots to this one . The director seems to know that he 's messed up the plotting too , as the climax is basically an excuse to explain the film to the audience . There is a twist thrown in at the end also ; but the film would have been better without it . I guess this was Jean Rollin 's attempt to be a little original , but it comes off as a ham - fisted attempt at such , rather than a logical continuation of the story . The cinematography is fairly neat , with lots of the plot taking place in suitably Gothic locations . The girls on board complete what is a pretty picture , and what Rollin 's film lacks in logic and consistency , it somewhat makes up for in style . In the film 's defence , it was made in 1969 ; which somewhat explains the lack of shocks but I ca n't recommend this movie as it does n't have much about it that is worth taking note of .
0 Jean Rollin artistic nonsense about vampires , aliens and the quest for immortality.<br /><br />The women are beautiful and the photography stunning . The dialog is inane . Its a laughable mess . Great to look at but as any semblance of a horror film or thriller purely awful . I 'm trying to figure out if we 're suppose to be scared or not . At the same time is it a put on or not ? Its an odd mix of art film and horror that never quite meshes and while its nice to look at it never seems to " mean " anything , and its by no means scary even if the occasional shot or sequence creates a moment of frisson Its well made pretentious twaddle . Something to leave on in the background as a living wall paper for those who like naked women .
0 from the start of this movie you soon become aware that the name of the film has nothing to do with the movie itself from watching a naked woman being chased by people in very silly masks to servants running round in the worst clothing I 've ever seen and all this in subtitles makes this the kind of movie you should think twice about seeing and as the film slowly moves along you soon realise that the vampire is not a vampire you got to wonder where the title came from some parts of the film made a bit of sense with Pierre and is father but as the film gets to its really silly ending you have got to think why end a film this way and surly they had a better ending if only in there heads this is not a film to watch basically
0 When I first saw this film in cinema 11 years ago , I loved it . I still think the directing and cinematography are excellent , as is the music . But it 's really the script that has over the time started to bother me more and more . I find Emma Thompson 's writing self - absorbed and unfaithful to the original book ; she has reduced Marianne to a side - character , a second fiddle to her much too old , much too severe Elinor - she in the movie is given many sort of ' focus moments ' , and often they appear to be there just to show off Thompson herself.<br /><br />I do understand her cutting off several characters from the book , but leaving out the one scene where Willoughby in the book is redeemed ? For someone who red and cherished the book long before the movie , those are the things always difficult to digest.<br /><br />As for the actors , I love Kate Winslet as Marianne . She is not given the best script in the world to work with but she still pulls it up gracefully , without too much sentimentality . Alan Rickman is great , a bit old perhaps , but he plays the role beautifully . And Elizabeth Spriggs , she is absolutely fantastic as always .
0 To be honest , I did n't like " Executive Decision " - which was obvious the template - very much , but compared to this piece of crap , it looks like a masterpiece of art.<br /><br />Not only that the people moving in the film ( the term actors would be an insult for all other actors ) should attend more acting classes , the guy who build the setting has n't even seen an aircraft from afar . It is so ridiculous , that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard , but this is only the tip of the iceberg . The film is full of illogicalness ( e.g. : use sleeping - gas , then do n't use it , then use it anyway ) , which dropped my rating finally to the bottom.<br /><br />You can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk .
0 One Stinko of a movie featuring a shopworn plot and , to be kind , acting of less than Oscar caliber . But to me the single worst flaw was the total misrepresentation of a jet aircraft , and especially a 747 . Some of the major blunders:<br /><br />1 . No Flight Engineer ( or even a flight engineer station . 2 . Mis - identifying the F-16 interceptors as F-15 's ( no resmblance whatsoever ) . 3 . Loading passengers into an " aft baggage compartment " supposedly accesible from the cabin - Even if such a compartment existed , placing that much weight that far aft would make the aircraft unflyable . 4 . Hollow point bullets that " wo n't damage the aircraft " . 5 . The entire landing procedure was so bad I wanted to puke . 6 . An SR-71 ( of all planes ) with a pressure seal hatch 7 . Opening a cabin door outward - into the wind - in flight!!<br /><br />Ah nuts , it was just a truly lousy movie . Got ta make the list of bottom 10 of the year .
0 What a complete piece of trash . Plot notwithstanding , when a movie 's action revolves around airplanes , you 'd think the writers / producers / director ( or ANYONE ! ) would do a little bit of homework as to at least a FEW of the details . The mistakes were so glaring that I was fuming by the end of the movie . Here are just a few : I 'm glad I missed the SR-71 sequence - certain to have been worse than the " Air Force One " F-117 spectacle . Commercial airlines usually have their logos painted on the aircraft rather than BOEING 747 ¬ñ likely the ( cheap ) use of some Boeing advertising / publicity footage by the director . Exposed wiring connected by wire nuts is mediocre at best for house wiring , much less multi - million dollar aircraft avionics wiring . Airplanes like the 747 rely on pressure alone rather than ship 's supply oxygen to maintain breathable air , and if they did rely on an on - board supply , the canister would be far bigger than fist sized . Medical tape is not a suitable substitute for a threaded hose connection . Those were F-16s , NOT F-15s . Mach 1 + ( speed of sound ) would be difficult to attain on a static engine run up for takeoff ( watch the airspeed indicator ) . " Standard formation " is simply keeping the formation inside one nautical mile , " route " formation is what they were flying - not the most useful formation for an intercept . " Acquiring missile lock " is not likely to get an airline pilot 's attention - they have no radar detection or countermeasures . " Wait for my signal " is not inter - flight communication for preparing to fire anything . Depressurization from a door opening in flight is not grounds for an immediate steep left bank . Yelling into a headset does not make it transmit . Magnetic headings are given as " headings " not " bearings , " and headings are between 001 and 360 degrees ( compasses in the air are just like compasses on the ground ! ) , so turning left ( not " port " ¬ñ that 's a boat thing ) from a " bearing " of 618 to 502 is just stupid . It is in most cases impossible to just " turn the yoke left until the correct heading is reached " ¬ñ that sort of thing will result in 360 degree rolls until the yoke is centered again . The likelihood of a flight attendant immediately finding and successfully engaging the autopilot is only slightly greater than the likelihood of her actually landing the jet safely . Airplanes do n't stall immediately upon pulling the throttle back , and 747s have more than one little lever to control the multi - engine thrust . Flaps are lowered in increments usually just prior to and immediately following landing gear extension , not seconds before landing ( good way to crash ) . Wheel brakes are required to stop an airplane , simply pulling the throttle(s ) ( this time a different lever in the movie ) to idle will just allow you to go off the end of the runway at a slower speed . Did I mention that those fighter aircraft were F-16s and NOT F-15s ? Guess I did ¬Ö  And that 's just what I REMEMBER from recently watching this horrific movie .
0 Spoilers ? Maybe a few details , but nothing too plot related . Not like it would matter with this movie . < br /><br />Air Rage blatantly rips off the mid - air infiltration premise of Executive Decision . Ice - T leads a team of four " elite " commandos who wear baggy black shirts that we can only imagine must conceal invisible body armor as their idiotic tactics ( similar to what 3rd graders use when playing Star Wars on the playground ) lead them to absorb a hail of gunfire . < br /><br />What entertained me the most about this flick was the use of look - alike has - been actors . You 'll immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who once acted in a movie that you really liked , though it was so long ago that you probably wo n't be able to place it ( it was Porky 's ) . Here Cyril plays a decent knock - off of a Bill Paxton character . Most Hilarious is porker Gil Gerard , who 's so fat that you will never recognize him as TV 's Buck Rogers . Instead of evoking his mildly heroic character past , Gerard gives us a passable performance of the crusty fat tough guy persona , which was clearly imagineered for John Goodman . Finally , Alex Cord gives us a nice hybrid look - alike performance as a Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas type . In the 10 years since New Jack City , Ice - T 's acting has deteriorated remarkably . It 's not acting so much as regurgitation of lines that he might have actually memorized . < br /><br />One of the items that plays into this movie is a CD - ROM of classified information . It 's being hand carried , and it 's apparently and unbelievably not encrypted , despite the security - savvy aura of Gerard 's NSA character . What a joke . I 'm severely doubting that the information purported to be on the CD would ever even all be assembled into a portable format . < br /><br />Despite being in a closed aircraft without silencers , the gunfire is about as loud as canned air , and causes nary a person to flinch , so apparently no foley budget . The assortment of weapons chosen is pretty funny . The flight attendant 's use of a coffee pot is about the most realistic depiction of violence in the film . When she takes intuitively to the mini - Uzi pistol , which has got to be one of the worst pistol designs ever , that 's just too stupid . A true elite team would carry MP-5s for this type thing or maybe SOCOMM .45s , or even customized Hi- Powers if they were really old school , or maybe something FN 5.7 if new school ... The lame - o standard issue 92Fs are totally unbelievable , having lost most of their cool after Lethal Weapon I. The bad guys , supposedly experienced soldier of fortune types , have an assorted mixture of absurdity , like the aforementioned mini - Uzi pistol and a Tec-9 with the infamous non - functional barrel extender that is n't a silencer . < br /><br />There was one touch of realism on which I would like to correct the other reviewers : The flight attendant and Ice - T did lower the craft to 10,000 feet for " breathable air " before they opened the door . And I also got the impression that the flight attendant was NOT able to get the door closed , that she basically just gave up on that point . As far as the landing , there was no mention of flaps until about 2 seconds before touchdown . Sigh . < br /><br />Only the Dukes of Hazard eluding Roscoe P. Coltrane at the " pass " could shame this movie for use of stock footage . They obviously chose the incredible ( and retired ) SR-71 because they could n't get stock of an F-117 . Aside from the fact that they were mothballed already in 2001 , let 's also forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the B-2 , and that at point blank range ... Well , I 'm no expert , but I 'm having doubts as to whether it would be invisible on Radar . < br /><br />As others have pointed out , the repeated references to " F-15s " when they were showing F -16s was laughable . Details of the 747 were pretty stupid . No airline would put that few passengers on a 747 to begin with , not to mention everything else that was idiotic about it . Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring . < br /><br />Wow . What a show . Catch it on Stars or something . Do n't pay to rent it , but do watch it for laughs . In contention for worst movie ever , right up there with No Holds Barred , which at least had some originality .
0 Besides all of the technical mistakes .... < br /><br />How about a female flight attendant who 's able to kill , all by herself , 4 out of the 7 terrorists ( including ex marines ) , 2 of whom without even using a gun . Then , she lands the plane perfectly . We 're not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton ; we 're talking about a regular , frightened , yet very well composed flight attendant . :D How about the leader in charge of the assault / rescue squad , having a full - proof ( according to the logic of the script ) plan of sleep - gassing everyone and having someone from his team fly the plane . Only he decides at the spur of the moment to change plans and instead lead an attack on the terrorists , guns blazing , not knowing where the terrorists are , or how many , and not securing a position of advantage , so that his whole team gets easily wiped out . Yeah , that 's using the old noggin . Only later to decide to use the sleep gas anyway . And it turns out useless for all intensive purposes.<br /><br />Bad as this movie was , though , I could n't stop myself from watching and wondering , what next ? :D I ca n't help but imagine all the excellent , unemployed script writers thinking to themselves , it 's not fair . lol ! :D
0 I ve finished seeing the movie 10 minutes ago .. WoW i still ca nt believe what i 've watched.<br /><br />This is absolutely the worst movie EVER . If i would list all the flaws in the movie , this review would take me a lot of sentences . ( very funny flaws , because of being that bad though)<br /><br />You got to be Amazed with the skill of the commandos assigned to rescue the plane . they did n't even know how to move.<br /><br />Ice - t is so bad actor ... and the thing i do n't understand , is how the production wanted him to be like a hero , but he 's a zero .. <br /><br />of course the major flaws will be the landing of an 747 , needing only 3 or 4 tips from a guy in transmission to land the plane ... amazing .. as well as the dead bodys that had almost no blood at all .. <br /><br />But i strongly recommend of watching this movie , as its very interesting to see how bad can something get
0 This has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made . The plot looked intriguing like that of Passenger 57 . But with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better . The plot has been worked out in the worst possible way . Just a few of the awful moments in the movie , A flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds ? ! ? Thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet , that s impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience . When on the runway ( perfectly straight of course ) she is instructed to pull on the flaps , HUH ! ! Come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds , when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power ! I can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie , but then my reply would become the size of the English dictionary . This is a movie you want to miss , take my word for it !
0 When i come on IMDb boards , I'm always fed up when i see a " the worst movie ever " post . After watching this * movie*,i think that i am soon going to create my own post!!<br /><br />The opening titles : great , some kind of lame zoom on a gas oven ( yeah , focus on the fire = explosions = great action packed movie!!)<br /><br />The actors : I think that Ice T is a cool rapper , even a nice actor ( sometimes , i insist,"sometimes " ) but the Steven seagal like policeman he plays is ... beyond the words . The rest of the cast is ... well i do n't know where those actors were hired but jeez!!I bet my dog would have been a much better actor than them!!<br /><br />The plot : Hijacking.original is n't it??<br /><br />The action sequences : The first shot of the movie is an explosion . I told myself , well , cool!!At least there will be some nice pyrotechnics ... I was dead wrong . The rest of the movie is mostly filled with low rent stock shots taken from the Air Force ... <br /><br />The dialogs are hilarious , the music is pure crap , the end is happy ( i mean i was happy at the end because the movie was over!!!)<br /><br />My cousin who was watching the movie was delighted ( I 'm 22 , she 's 42 ... well).I was on the verge of taking the movie and burn it . Maybe next time I 'm gon na watch it ... (who said never ? ? ? )
0 Words ca n't describe how bad this movie is . I ca n't explain it by writing only . You have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how horrible a movie really can be . Not that I recommend you to do that . There are so many clich√©s , mistakes ( and all other negative things you can imagine ) here that will just make you cry . To start with the technical first , there are a LOT of mistakes regarding the airplane . I wo n't list them here , but just mention the coloring of the plane . They did n't even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline , but instead used a 747 painted in the original Boeing livery . Very bad . The plot is stupid and has been done many times before , only much , much better . There are so many ridiculous moments here that i lost count of it really early . Also , I was on the bad guys ' side all the time in the movie , because the good guys were so stupid . " Executive Decision " should without a doubt be you 're choice over this one , even the " Turbulence "- movies are better . In fact , every other movie in the world is better than this one .
0 Firstly , I wo n't tell you WHY I rented this movie , as I 'm still confused myself ... <br /><br />Air Rage is much like any movie I 've seen where a plane is hijacked . There is of course that one important person on the plane , and the hijacker looking for revenge . The sad thing is , some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other movies . Are we really becoming so unoriginal so quickly?<br /><br />Although it 's Ice - T ( who for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at ACTING while he 's not busy putting the " c " back in front of rap ) who is glorified on the cover , the movie actually stars the less than amazing Kim Oja as a stewardess who is ' surprisingly ' OVERLOOKED by the five hijackers , which naturally comes back to haunt them . As for the rest of the cast , the only person I managed to recognize was Steve Hytner , more commonly known as Kenny Bania from " Seinfeld".<br /><br />I ca n't forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie , when a hijacker used about a POUND of PLASTIQUE to blow a lock off a door ... BRILLIANT.<br /><br />The plot was unnaturally predictable.<br /><br />The script - atrocious . It got to the point where I could say something , which I felt would make a stupid comment , and it would be the next line in the movie.<br /><br />As for special effects ... the only thing special about this movie is that I wasted the cost of electricity to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes.<br /><br />And the title - the movie DID take place in the Air . But due to the less than stellar performances , the only Rage in the movie was that of the viewer.<br /><br />So , if you 're in the mood to even pick apart a movie , just because it 's bad . Please SAVE YOURSELF , do n't choose this .
0 I signed in just to comment on how awfully stupid this movie is . Besides being a rip - off of Executive Decision or Air Force One or any other kind of terrorist story , this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate seeing a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well . It 's hard to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid , clich√© - ridden script to work with . It 's bad enough if you groan once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence , but when you find yourself groaning over and over again , you have to conclude that the director also is n't the brightest bulb in the movie business , nor are the producers for deciding to bring this story to the screen in the first place . The mostly low - rent actors you can excuse for taking on this assignment , because they most likely showed up to get the money and exposure , not that being a part of this joke - of - a - movie is going to earn them any awards or recognition . It may end up embarrassing them for having such poor judgment as to get involved in such a loser . I see no point in summarizing the plot or even in giving any examples to prove my case , for , to do so , would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could withstand . Just as studying well - made movies can inspire you how to make a good , skillfully put - together work of art and beauty , the only thing that you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what NOT to do and what does NOT work ! Be warned .
0 do n't expect much from this film . In many ways this film resembles a film that Doris Day starred in in 1956,title , Julie . In this film Doris , who was a flight attendant , stewardess , in those days , landed the air craft after her derange husband , played by Louis Jordan shot the captain . She did a far better job , more convincing , than Kim Ojah , who took control of a 747 and manage to land it without much help from the control tower . I know a little about 747 aircraft , i use to be a flight attendant myself . Like i said , do not expect much from this film , it was done on a cheap budget . The producers were to cheap to use a plane with the name of a airline on it . Oceanic is one name that several movies have used . The only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the aircraft .
0 This is the worst movie I have ever seen . Everyone involved should be embarrassed . Everyone . Ice - T is pitiful , the dialogue is absolutely awful , and hokie does not begin to describe the performances by every single actor in this movie . The plot steals heavily from Executive Decision , but compared to Air Rage , Executive Decision is Academy Award material . I have never been so disappointed when watching a movie . Air Rage should be burned with its ashes locked in a vault never to see the light of day again . Anyone who has seen it should take a shower and wash the stink of horrible movie off of them . The best part of this movie probably comes from the ending , when the credits rolled . This was easily the worst movie I have ever seen . < br /><br />Ice - T should stick to Law and Order , and the other people in this film should retire early or commit suicide . Either way , they should never attempt to be in a movie again .
0 What can you say about a grainy , poorly filmed 16 mm stag film , where the best and most attractive performer is a German Shepherd ? Nothing that would be positive . Avoid this travesty at all costs . In any case , it would be difficult to find , since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the USA . I strongly suggest IMDb to re - visit their weighting formula for establishing ratings , since an 8.8 rating for this piece of fecal matter is absurd ! I am , by no means , a prude and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70 's & 80 's ; but this is inferior product even by the looser standards of the ( then illegal ) stag loop .
0 Linda Lovelace was the victim of a sadistic woman hater , Chuck Traynor . I do n't understand how having sex with a dog ( which is animal abuse , as well ) can be found to be entertaining or funny . Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was coerced into making these films . I know some people will criticize this comment but I feel strongly that these types of films fuel the fire of hatred and further misogynistic feelings towards women . This society continues to portray women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings . We call ourselves " civilized " however I feel we have a long way to go before we can ever scratch the surface of being civilized .
0 The Comeback starts off looking promising , with a brutal death scene by a mask wearing killer . The mask itself is pretty cool too , and looks almost identical to the one used in the 1990 's slasher film " Granny " . From then on the film is mostly boring . We get a few more deaths , which again are good , but there 's not enough of them . The reason the deaths are so good is because they are frenzied and bloody . The story behind the film is actually rather interesting and would have worked very well had it not been so boring for the most part . < br /><br />I would avoid this unless you 're a die - hard collector - there 's not enough here to even make it an average slasher flick .
0 Friday the 13th step over ! There is officially a worse movie than your hateful series out there . I won this movie in a contest at college , and it was a waste of money even if it was free . Jack Jones stars as a truly awful singer whose trying to find some murderers or something . At least Friday the Thirteenth never bored me . I 'd rather have my fingernails pulled than see this again .
0 Gritty , dusty western from director Richard Brooks , who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clich√©s intact . Early 1900s horse race attracts a low - keyed cowboy ( Gene Hackman ) , a suave gambler ( James Coburn ) , a cocky kid ( Jan Michael Vincent ) , and even a FEMALE ( a surprisingly game Candice Bergen ) . Once the preliminaries are out of the way ( with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part ) , this becomes a fairly engrossing entry , though one which breaks no new ground ( it instead resembles something from Gary Cooper 's era ) . Good - looking , if overlong piece has macho verve and a fine cast , yet the mechanisms of the plot get tiresome rather quickly . * * from * * * *
0 Here 's a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just do n't have it . Director Richard Brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game ; How much better his THE PROFESSIONALS was ! The horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the non - slow motion scenes . This film needed to be sped - up , if anything . That horse lather sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire tracks in those desert tracking moments- just lazy . sloppy work . Too bad . The actors did OK , but I 've certainly seen all of them do better . Ben Johnson 's always a joy , though . I first saw this flick almost 30 years ago ; was disappointed then and remained so upon second viewing 30 years later .
0 This is a movie about animal cruelty . Under the guise of a marathon race , we see depictions of extreme animal abuse , including literally running a horse to death IN SLOW MOTION . The guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the burial / burning of the horse , which of course is still dead , having been tortured to death . This is one of the sickest , slimiest movies I 've ever had the displeasure of viewing . As Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their DYING animals , we 're supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race . I 'd like to put the producers and director in a marathon race ; I 'll decide when they 're finished , probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing .
0 Ohhh the brutality , ohhhhh the dying breed , ohhhh the sense of loss , ohhhh the prejudice ! Jeez , when are all you whiney revisionists going to stop analyzing Westerns for crying out loud ? S**t happens . If it offends your socially engineered sensibilities then go back to the comfort of your Meryl Steep collection.<br /><br />Boring , tedious , and very tiresome waste of celluloid - particularly in light of Coburn / Hackman / Bergen 's presence . Nothing interesting or intriguing here , unless you are obsessed with 19th century desert dentisty . May have been a little better without the constant diversion of the out - of - place mexican guy with the bad tooth . A monument to the stupid ultra - left creeping sensitivity of the 60/70 's . Virtually impossible to sit through the entire film . I think I 'd rather have my eyes stapled open for the entire Lucky Luke / Trinity series . 4 Horses/10-all deader'n hell .
0 The plot of this movie hangs on one important point : that this murderer was also a responsible , loving , caring father . Not that being a father and a murderer is impossible . But this man is shown murdering a teenage girl without provocation or reason and without emotion . This girl was someone 's daughter . I do n't think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so cold - blooded to someone else 's daughter . Or , alternately , could have been so cold blooded and yet worry about and care for his own daughter . And the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask his victim 's parents to take in and care for his daughter is beyond belief.<br /><br />That said , the characters were acted with conviction by the actors . I thought changing Scott Bakula 's eye color did make him seem more cold and menacing than he usually is . You could n't see into his eyes at all .
0 The idea of In the Name of the People is good , a murderer does n't want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter . And you could expect of the actors , especially Scott Bakula to do some good acting , unfortunately they do n't ! In the Name of The People turns out to be the regular Friday night tearjerker . The flashbacks with the girl that was killed are pretty pathetic and at a certain stage you can just predict what the actors will say ... If you want to watch a good film about this subject then watch Dean Man Walking !
0 I 'm sorry to report that I have seen this film several times . When it bombed at the box office , it was repeated nightly for about a month on HBO . And I watched it over and over because television in general is so bad -- or was at that time . I no longer watch , so it might be wonderful now -- like Samuel L Jackson says about swine , " It might taste like sweet potato pie , but I 'll never know because I would n't eat the filthy mfer . " Let 's see . Dudley plays Arthur wandering in the desert , always a few steps behind Moses . It came out right after Life of Bryan , so you can guess where the inspiration for this came from . The few mildly funny bits go on way too long until you just close your eyes and grit your teeth . There 's one scene where Arthur and Dom Deluise meet in the desert , both of them dragged out and dessicated , dying of thirst . Then they meet like old acquaintances who did n't really know each other very well , promise to do lunch . It could have been funny.<br /><br />But the scene that I remember most clearly is a meeting with pharaoh in which pharaoh is a black street kid done up in full King Tut regalia . He must have read the lines straight because at some point before the release , they overdubbed his scene with the Hollywood equivalent of black street lingo voiced by a Jimmy Walker wannabe ( Kid Dyno - wannabe ) . Or it might have been Jimmy Walker -- who knows ? Who cares . They managed to turn an essentially boring scene into a very racist , very unfunny , very long piece of excrement , one of those legendary things that just wo n't flush , no matter how many times you try , so you leave it there for someone else to deal with.<br /><br />Well that 's my review . If you rent this movie ( DON'T BUY IT , WHATEVER YOU DO ! ) prepare yourself with a bottle of tequila and a six pack of Corona.<br /><br />Now that they 've remade the Poseiden Adventure , this one is probably high on the list for remakes . Maybe they 'll hire a comedy writer this time .
0 In the questionable comedy vein of Mel Brooks , " Wholly Moses ! " tries to take the Bible story of Moses and make fun of it , resulting in the unfunniest Biblical spoof ever filmed.<br /><br />There is no real plot here , just excuses to trot out stalwart comedy talent in underwritten roles . Dudley Moore and Laraine Newman are on a bus tour of the Holy Land , when they stumble across an ancient scroll in a cave . There they read the story of Herschel and Zerelda , also played by Moore and Newman . Herschel 's life parallels Moses ' . He was sent down the river to be found by the pharaoh 's family at the same time Moses was . Herschel 's birth father , the late James Coco , becomes Herschel 's slave after Herschel is rescued by idol makers and works as a sculptor . Eventually Herschel comes to work for the pharaoh as an astronomer , is banished , and ends up tending Moses ' flock of sheep . Herschel and Moses are brothers in law , marrying sisters , and Herschel thinks God has chosen him to free his people in Egypt . Of course , Moses was receiving the Divine Word , but Herschel misunderstood . I 'll pause here to laugh hysterically ... pause ... anyway , the rest of the film is a series of badly written scenes involving Moore and actors who are making " special appearances . " These scenes do not propel the plot forward , they bring what little story there is to a grinding halt.<br /><br />Jack Gilford plays a tailor . Dom DeLuise has maybe three lines when he meets Herschel in the desert . John Houseman is an archangel , just giving the same line readings he gave in " The Paper Chase . " David L. Lander is a fake blind man " healed " by Herschel . Andrea Martin is one of Zerelda 's sisters . I was not sure who Madeline Kahn was supposed to be , she gives a ride to Herschel , and has about a minute and a half of screen time . John Ritter plays a very unfunny devil . Richard Pryor has one scene as the pharaoh , but it was obviously shot at a different time than Moore 's scene because the two do not appear onscreen together ! In the end , Zerelda turns into a pillar of salt after looking back on New Sodom 's destruction , ha ha . Herschel writes the Ten Commandments , and gives them to Moses , who is basking in all the glory . In the final scenes , the screenwriter decide to try and salvage this shallow film by having Herschel bait God into an argument . God comes off as an all powerful bully who was leading Herschel around for his own amusement , speaking through him only to give him the Ten Commandments . We even have Zerelda quip " God works in mysterious ways , " thereby excusing everyone 's very unChristian behavior during the film.<br /><br />This film is not funny . There is nary a laugh to be found anywhere . At least Monty Python made fun of many established religious mainstays in " Life of Brian " in addition to their questionable take on Jesus ' life , but here the humor consists of poo poo jokes and characters constantly bumping their heads . This makes Mel Brooks look like Merchant / Ivory . Churchgoers will be offended , not by the film 's attitude toward religion , but by the smugness the movie exhibits , impressed with their own hoitytoityness ( I know , not a word ) on a subject they obviously know nothing about . " Wholly Moses ! " is wholly bad , and an embarassment to all involved . I suggest you read the Book instead.<br /><br />This is rated ( PG ) for some physical violence , profanity , sexual references , and adult situations .
0 > you are warned this is a spoiler ! > This movie is so bad that i doubt i can write enough lines . great direction the shots were well thought out . the actors were very good particularly Richard pryor tho i would have liked to have seen more of him . Madeline Kahn and john houseman were classic . Dudley More god bless him could have done better . John Ritter again i would have liked to see more of him . In my opinion this failure is due totally to writer failure . Maybe the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating . Its just too bad that so much money went into this boiler , when with a little change here and there would in my opinion fixed it . They must have paid the writers standard rates . To produce one chuckle .
0 I attempted watching this movie twice and even then fast forwarding the irritating parts but still could not make it to the end.<br /><br />I do n't understand how this movie * genuinely * got any good reviews . I think these people giving such good reviews are just trying to hype the movie for marketing purposes . Their reviews seem very unrealistic and it looks like an inside job , which makes things more pitiful . Movies should get true positive comments on their own steam and not contrived ones ! ! < br /><br />The acting was reminiscent of a cheesy porno movie , and not in a funny way . I do n't mind low budget movies with bad acting if they know how to work with it . < br /><br />I found the lead character to be irritating . His facial expressions and humor was unbearably childish . I thought this was intentional to make the womens conspiracy seem more enjoyable and founded , but they were even worse . < br /><br />The script was also very awkward ( his bosses overdone business speech ) and the unfunny sarcastic remarks . < br /><br />I did not find anything redeeming about this movie other than some of the attractive women.<br /><br />Never have I felt that a rating was this misleading . I was interested by its premise but scared off by everything else . Of course see it if you want , but I just did n't want anyone else to get their hopes up / waste their time . < br /><br />Maybe it is just me ... Probably not .
0 this video is 100 % retarded . besides the brain cell killing acting and plot , it 's way too long . do n't waste your money at the video store . i actually was mad that i sat through this garbage and spent money on it . just absolutely awful .
0 Ah yes the 1980s , a time of Reaganomics and Sly , Chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies . At the time I couldn`t believe how movies like RAMBO , MISSING IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR ( And who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN ? ) made money at the box office , they`re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly . TROMA`S WAR is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you`ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place ? Of course not . TROMA`S WAR lacks any sort of sophistication - though it does make the point that there`s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones - and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up . Maybe it is ?
0 This is truly an awful movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life . It is simultaneously bland and offensive , with nudity and lots and lots of violence . However , the nudity is not that exciting , and the violence is repetitive and boring . Also , the plot is flimsy at best , the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped , and the acting is some of the worst I have ever seen . < br /><br />I have heard that this movie is supposed to be funny , but it 's not . I did not laugh once while watching it , nor did I even crack a smile . The makers of this film tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie , and they failed on both counts . < br /><br />Some poorly made movies are funny because they are so bad , but this is not one of them .
0 I 'm not ruining anything when I inform you that you get to see a woman have sex with a goat in this movie . If that is your thing , then your movie has arrived.<br /><br />A woman and her husband go to see her estranged sister in the family mansion in the woods . Her sister is a creepy lady to say the least , and she seems to have interests that go beyond family love . On the side a group of unsavory characters show up and begin enacting all kinds of pagan rituals.<br /><br />The plotting is pretty weak and the characters are pretty dumb . The woman sticks around even after her husband starts turning into a jerk and hanging out with the pagans , even continues the have sex with him . On the exploitative side of things , there is much bared flesh and a couple of kinky couplings , but nothing that has n't been better somewhere else . Oh , and the aforementioned goat - sex scene.<br /><br />Most viewers wo n't make it to the end . Exploitation fans will ride it out , but will be left wanting more.<br /><br />4/10
0 Extremely thin ' plot ' of satanic rituals or some such mumbo - jumbo provides the hokey excuse to thread copious amounts of sex scenes together . Straight vanilla sex , masturbation , lesbianism , S&M , bestiality , incest , and a few other sexual proliferation 's all get their time in the spotlight here . The problem is the storyline is so dull that the rampant sexuality gets pretty tedious after awhile . Who knew that a film with an intimate goat/ girl encounter could be so damn boring ? Well now I do.<br /><br />Eye Candy : Venessa Hidalgo shows all ; Helga Line provides T&A ( both on display quite frequently ) ; women viewers get the occasional penis.<br /><br />My Grade : D+<br /><br />Region 1 DVD Extras : Trailers for " Pick Up " , " Legend of Eight Samurai " , " Do n't Answer the Phone " , " Prime Evil " , & " Sister Street Fighter " ( also the same DVD holds a second feature movie " Evil Eye " )
0 I absolutely despise this movie . No wonder Jose Larraz " disowned " it at one point and refuses to discuss it . I admire Larraz 's work , especially his more obscure slasher / sex maniac thrillers like SAVAGE LUST or SCREAM AND DIE . His work has a kind of inescapable artiness about it that he ca n't seem to switch off , owing in part to his secondary career as a painter & cartoonist . It 's too bad he never made a Western , his vision would have been perfect.<br /><br />BLACK CANDLES is easily his most notorious film and probably his best known after the masterpiece VAMPYRES . And it 's notoriety revolves around one scene where a Satanic coven enacts a bizarre rite involving extracting the reproductive fluid of a goat -- symbolizing The Beast -- as some kind of nauseating balm to be used in preparing the waif like sister of a murdered man for her role as the bride of Satan . The scene in question is staged in a way that looks rather convincing even without the display of any plumbing apparatus the goat may have been endowed with , relying upon the histrionics of the actress recruited to play the supplicant in the ritual and lots of guttural chanting on the film 's recycled musical score heard in a half - dozen films attributed to Jacinto Molina . The perverse nature of the scene is more implied than shown in graphic detail , heightened somewhat by the knowledge that said supplicant is actually the teen - aged daughter of the Satanic priest . My but they had fun concocting this movie.<br /><br />The problem with it is that there is n't much to deconstruct or contemplate aside from the paper thin ROSEMARY 'S BABY derived story of a woman being weaned into her role as Satan 's bride by a sophisticated coven of Satanists living in the hedgrowed outlands of a very sinister Britain . Led by Eurohorror sensation Helga Line these Satanists are comprised of doctors , lawyers , land owning magnates and other upper crust dignitaries who actually owe their professional success to their worship of the devil . All you have to do is sell your soul and the world can be yours , only watch out whom you may sell out to pay back petty personal conflict or you may end up being felched with a sword.<br /><br />The film attempts to combine this heady Satanic trip with oodles or borderline graphic sex , and should correctly be regarded as a kind of apex or culmination of the sex and horror Spanish thriller traditions popularized in part by Mr. Molina & Ms. Line , and which had amazingly flourished under the disapproving eye of one Generalissimo Franco , the dictator who controlled Spain up until 1976 . While he lived his decree was that Spanish cinema was to be free of graphic depictions of on - screen sex . Spanish directors often made two versions of their films , one with the sex concealed for their own screens and one with the fornication on display for export . As difficult as it was for the filmmakers to express themselves the result was a sort of interesting tension that usually results when artists flirt with the forbidden : Spanish horror from the 1970s has a very special flavor to it that is somewhat of an acquired taste . It 's not for everyone.<br /><br />But in a bizarre turn of events , without Franco 's influence on their culture Spanish horror sort of dried up in the late 1970s , when their Gothic castles and demonic orgies suddenly found themselves pass√© when compared to new sensations like JAWS and the STAR WARS phenomenon . And without Franco 's constraints their were suddenly a flood of overtly graphic thrillers that came tumbling out of the pipes in the very late 70s / early 80s , of which BLACK CANDLES is perhaps the best known due to it 's emphasis on sexual deviancy with a barnyard animal . Larraz ' major horror films have always revolved around sexual taboos ( the lesbianism of VAMPYRES , the incest of SCREAM AND DIE & DEVIATION ) but here the effect of the depravity is to overshadow the rest of the production . Nobody cares about anything else but the traditionally censored trip to the Goat Barn , and watching a cut version without the scene in the barn is almost an exercise in pointlessness . The sex is n't graphic enough to rate as porn and the chills are n't chilling enough to rate as horror.<br /><br />So , BLACK CANDLES is essentially a behavior study -- Here is how high society British Satanists might behave in their secluded mansions out in the West Midlands or whatever . Between sex scenes the actors / actresses sit around and have lots of discussions . The best thing the film has going for it is an undeniably oppressive atmosphere of claustrophobia , with most of it 's action taking place in the tightly confined interiors of Ms. Line 's character 's mansion . Nearly every avenue of fornication is hinted at so fans of soft - core sex romps with a hinting of supernatural horror will be amused , and of course the vicarious sex criminals amongst us will enjoy choking their chickens to the goat barn scene . But the ultimate conclusion of the film is silly , pretentious , intelligence insulting , and probably perfect for such an otherwise forgettable exercise in applied sleaze.<br /><br />2/10 ; Without the Goat Barn this movie just is n't the same , and with the scene it 's probably a bit too much for most viewers . Larraz was correct to disown it .
0 Black Candles is rather a muddled mess from the same director that brought us " Vampyres " and much later , " Rest in Pieces " , among others .. I'm only noting the ones I 've seen . At any rate , we have a couple making love and then somewhere near by a pin is poised over a voodoo doll and then pierces it , and the man keels over . Not sure if it was good for either of them , at that point . Fast forward to where the man 's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will , or something to that effect , and of course everybody else except her is in on something , which happens to be devil worship . It 's really hard to say who is who at moments during the movie and it does get a bit confusing at times . To spice things up though , there 's a simulated bestiality scene ( I HOPE it 's simulated ) with a black goat , sure to be a crowd pleaser . Ugh . At times this echoes " Rosemary 's Baby " , minus the baby , because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty Satanic herbs these are too , because that keeps getting remarked upon . However , the herbs are n't the only thing that reeks about this film . The end seems to be back to the beginning again , and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they 've been during the middle part . It 's not unwatchable , it 's just not very good , and I guess it all depends on what you like to see in films , and there was n't much here that did anything much for me . 3 out of 10 .
0 When Carol ( Vanessa Hidalgo ) starts looking into her brother 's death , she begins to suspect something more sinister than " natural causes " . The closer she gets to the truth , the more of a threat she becomes to her sister - in - law , Fiona ( Helga Line ) , and the rest of the local Satanists . They 'll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways.<br /><br />If you 're into sleazy , Satanic - themed movies , Black Candles has a lot to offer . The movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft - core sex . One scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed . Unfortunately , all the sleaze in the world ca n't save Black Candles . Most of the movie is a total bore . Other than the one scene I 've already mentioned , the numerous sex scenes are n't shocking and certainly are n't sexy . The acting is spotty at best . Even genre favorite Helga Line gives a disappointing performance . The plot really does n't matter . Its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together . I 'm only familiar with one other movie directed by Jose Ramon Larraz . Compared with his Daughters of Darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror , Black Candles comes off as amateurish . 3/10 is about the best I can do .
0 What made me track this movie down was the viewing Vampyres , I thought I have to get the other movies this guy ( Larroz ) has made , I was sorry I tracked this down , it is a weak attempt at an occult / satanic type movie laden with sex and only sex(with ugly actors and actresses , this is an excuse for sleaze . The only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere , avoid this one , too much hype surrounds it , not worth the effort of finding it , this refers to the welcome to the grind house edition . I hope he has some other movies which lives up to Vampyres , Oh and the goat scene was very boring , I understand that this is what carries the hype .
0 One of the cornerstones of low - budget cinema is taking a well - known , classic storyline and making a complete bastardization out of it . Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule . The screenwriter takes the enduring Phantom of the Opera storyline and moves it into a late ' 80s shopping mall . However , the " Phantom 's " goal now is simply to get revenge upon those responsible for disfiguring his face and murdering his family . The special effects do provide a good chuckle , especially when body parts begin appearing in dishes from the yogurt stand . Pauly Shore has a small role which does not allow him to be as fully obnoxious as one would expect , mostly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of MTV fame had not yet arrived . If you 're looking for a few good laughs at the expense of the actors and special effects crew , check this flick out . Otherwise , keep on looking for something else .
0 Phantom of the Mall is a film that fits best in the " easily forgotten " category . It 's a pretty lousy variant on the famous story by Gaston Leroux , the Phantom of the Opera . Not a bad idea to itself , but the plot and production of this movie are way to weak to bring a decent homage to that story . On the bright side , Gaston Leroux does n't has to turn over in his grave just yet . It could have been a lot worse . < br /><br />Phantom of the Mall has too many useless flashbacks in it and way too many boring sequences to make it memorable . Also , the scriptwriters wanted to give too much draught to the story than necessary . And even though there 's a lot of mystery getting build up about the character of Eric ... the basic plot is ordinary and d√©j√† - vu . * * * SPOILERS * * * It 's about a young couple that brutally gets torn apart because the boy gets killed in a fire . That fire was set to his house because he and his parents refused to sell their home in order to make room for a huge mall to be build . The boy survived the fire and he has hidden himself in the mall to avenge himself . Meanwhile he guards his girl who now works in the mall and tries to forget her loss * * * * END SPOILERS * * * This pretty simple - but rather effective - plot gets thickened by lots of pointless elements and annoying conspiracy theories . While it should just be an entertaining horror movie , it desperately tries to be an intelligent thriller ... and that 's not what the fans look for . There are a few innovative killings but they 're not satisfying enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie . And besides , Phantom of the Mall could have used at least a bit of humor ! ! This entire production - the cast included - takes itself way too serious . < br /><br />I'll try to finish with a few positive aspects ... Like for example , it stars Ken Foree ! ! Die - hard horror fans will certainly recognize him as Peter for Dawn of the Dead ! That 's like the horror milestone that yet has to find an equal . Even though his role in this movie is limited and even completely unnecessary ... it was good to see him again . TV - movie fans will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as the mayor , she 's a fine actress and an elegant lady . Pauly Shore is also in this but I ca n't stand him ... so my opinion about him may be a bit biased . And finally , a bit of praise for the leading actress named Kari Whitman . She 's an extremely beautiful girl and she does have a bit of talent ... too bad she never made it to the top . Actually , this movie is her biggest achievement and that says enough about her career ...
0 Somewhere between the Food Court and Zip 's , the mall in this film < br /><br />has an explosives store . This is the only place the title character < br /><br />can purchase the bomb he plants in the mall in the dull finale.<br /><br />A fictional town has a new mall , built on some land that was < br /><br />condemned . Cute Girl ( I did n't catch her name ) gets a job as a < br /><br />waitress there . She lost her boyfriend in a fire at the site where the < br /><br />mall stands . The villainous mall owner hires the arsonist < br /><br />responsible for the fire as a security guard after his first security < br /><br />guard ends up dead . Rob Estes , eons before " Silk Stalkings , " is a < br /><br />photog / reporter trying to find a story . He hooks up with Cute Girl,<br /><br />and their mutual " funny " friend Pauly Shore , and try to find out if Eric < br /><br />is still alive . He is , living in the mall basement ( ? ) and traveling < br /><br />through the air ducts and offing different people who upset his < br /><br />former girlfriend , including the arsonist . Eventually , he kidnaps her < br /><br />and the finale involves the bomb and everyone running from the < br /><br />scene before the big kablooey . Morgan Fairchild is along for the < br /><br />ride as the mayor ... yes , she 's the mayor.<br /><br />Of course , you probably did not need a plot sketch since the entire < br /><br />story is in the title . Someone named Eric is taking revenge against < br /><br />people as a phantom of a mall . This also means there is no < br /><br />suspense . We know Eric is behind this , but we still have to see < br /><br />Estes and Cute Girl go through the motions of a silly investigation.<br /><br />Watch as Fairchild , who we know has been in cahoots with the < br /><br />mall owner all along , pull a gun on our heroic duo in the middle of < br /><br />a crowded party , yet no one says a word as she leads them to her < br /><br />office , and her eventual death . The fictional town is huge , yet nary a < br /><br />policeman is ever called , everyone relies on mall security for order.<br /><br />Eric has been hiding since the mall was built , but I am not sure < br /><br />where . He seems to live in a basement area , but you would think < br /><br />some construction worker would have found him . He also has < br /><br />furnished his love pad quite well , and found a few outlets , since he < br /><br />has electricity . It might be nicer than your own apartment!<br /><br />Pauly Shore fans , both of you , take note . He tricks a security guard < br /><br />out of his booth by mooning the camera . Yes , stop scanning < br /><br />Celebrity Skin and Playgirl , this is where you get to see a grainy < br /><br />black and white shot of Pauly 's south shore , although no weezil.<br /><br />This is just junk , and proof positive that I am down to renting just < br /><br />about anything at the video store to stay in the horror section . This < br /><br />film is not Eric 's revenge , it is the film maker 's revenge for me < br /><br />being dumb enough to watch it . Here is my revenge : I do not < br /><br />recommend it . That 'll show ' em!<br /><br />This is rated ( R ) for physical violence , some gun violence , gore,<br /><br />some profanity , some female nudity , brief male nudity , and some < br /><br />sexual content .
0 On the face of it , Ruiz has set out to make a psychological thriller . Although it 's not as satisfying as a classic piece in that genre , there are compensations . The tensions generated between Huppert and Balibar as women calmly but calculatingly at war over a boy they both claim are compelling ; however , in a true European art - house style , Ruiz does n't give us release of this tension as the women alternately also try to behave compassionately towards each other . The only raised voice is that of Huppert 's waking from a nightmare ( an uncontested irrational event in the film).<br /><br />In fact , if we follow the title , the film is as little about its thriller skeleton as Jane Campion 's In The Cut . Instead it is an intergender psychological study focusing on men . The boy , Camille ( Nils Hugon ) , decides on a practical joke , playing his mother off against an emotionally vulnerable other woman . Both women seem to pander to him rather than scold and this compounds the problem . In the background is an intemperate psychologist ( Charles Berling ) , swift to confront the women in his life - his sister Huppert , the nanny or his pa - and so acting as a symbolic adult counterbalance to the , calm and ( we learn ) manipulative Camille . It is particularly interesting that , like the father in Henry James ' The Turn of The Screw , Denis Podalydes ' law - enforcer Father is absent for the duration of the film . Ruiz fashions an Oedipal moment out of Huppert 's reaction to his return at the film 's close.<br /><br />Read either as a thriller or as a psychiatric essay , this film is ultimately rather disappointing . I 'm officially rather fed up with Mme Huppert 's screen method , which is too buried and so I 'll be looking to see her on stage before I come back to her ( European - enjoyed Heaven 's Gate ) films again . The support is good . Ruiz does the cast no favours though . Quite apart from some poor lighting and some wilfully odd shots , its as if his direction has left characterisation quite out of reach - I 'm thinking particularly of Edith Scob 's Shamanic neighbour to Isabelle , who acts knowing but communicates bafflement . The set pieces do not link up to a forward driving plot - the tension I have already referred to is not only weakly dissipated but wasted in its directional potential.<br /><br />Want to see a good contemporary French thriller ? Go and see L'Appartement instead . 4/10
0 On his birthday a small boys tells his mother he is not her son , and that he wants to go home to his real mother.<br /><br />In some ways Comedy De L'Innocence feels like it comes from a different time of movie - making , perhaps the 60 's or 70 's . Certainly it reminded me of Losey 's Secret Ceremony ( 1968 ) , and Richard Loncraine 's Full Circle ( 1977 ) , both of which deal with loss , grief and relationships between parents and ' lost ' children ( curiously both films star Mia Farrow).<br /><br />All three films are populated with unsympathetic characters who behave in strange and unexplained ways . All three films have a chilly feel , both emotionally and literally . All three films focus on mother - child relationships , and ultimately all three films pose the question - ' what is real , what is imagined ? ' < br /><br />Beautiful but flawed , it offers no easy answers and leaves much hanging , unexplained and strange .
0 I wish I could give this movie a zero , or even lower , because sadly that 's what it deserves . I honestly never walk out of a movie , but this one was so dreadfully awful that I could n't stand another minute of it . Please , please , please- for the sake of mankind- skip this movie . If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really delve into , this is n't it.<br /><br />It has unattractive , unappealing leads , choppy structure , ridiculous dialog , and it is absolutely unconvincing in every imaginable way . On an absolutely basic level , it fails to entertain . Everything about " Mango Kiss " is so stagey , it is WORSE than any student film I have seen.<br /><br />As if that were n't enough , the entire movie relies on constant ( and I mean CONSTANT ) voice over narration . The script writer may as well have written a novel , because they insisted on TELLING everything , instead of SHOWING it . We are just supposed to assume that Lou and Sassafras are the best of friends and have a special connection , even though there is no character development to illustrate this . Also , this film continues to introduce to new characters after the first five minutes , and not in a natural way , but in a freeze - frame of the characters with their name written over the screen . There is no introduction , no development of any of the characters . We do n't really get to know any of them.<br /><br />This is the most amateur movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />I am a gay woman , who watched this film with my roommate ( another gay woman ) and we both found this movie to be a depressing representation of queer cinema . I am beginning to think that lesbian and gay movies are a lot like Christian rock - it does n't matter how atrocious it is , people will still flock to it , and champion it , no matter how poor the quality is . Please do n't rent this ! ! Instead , let 's encourage the production of QUALITY gay and lesbian movies by renting " But I 'm a Cheerleader " or " Fire " or " Heavenly Creatures " , instead of swallowing whatever mindless tripe they aim at the gay community ( i.e. Queer as Folk ) .
0 I borrowed this movie because not only because its gay theme but the thought of role playing really intrigued me . I was pleasantly surprised that it was shot in San Francisco since I live near SF . And of course it was nice to see shots of the Castro district ( although the castro to me really caters more to gay male than female ) . But other than that I ca n't really recommend this movie . The characters are n't really developed for me to care and when they finally started to get to the " role playing " I was already bored out of my mind . And the role playing scenes that I did see were a bit embarrassing to watch . The acting leaves something to be desired . Needless to say I did n't finish the movie . I 'd skip this one .
0 OK , my girlfriend and I rented the DVD and about 30 minutes into the movie , we 'd exchanged a lot of " ehhh , what IS this movie about and more importantly , do I care to find out what it ends with " glances and decided we either needed drugs to keep us interested in the " plot " or just end the pain right there and then and watch something else . We opted for the latter.<br /><br />I liked " But I 'm a Cheerleader " a lot , but Mango Kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste , sorry ! I definitely prefer " D.E.B.S " , " Better Than Chocolate " , " Fucking √Öm√•l " , " Goldfish Memory " and " Fire".<br /><br />-Sorcia
0 In over 70 years of watching movies , This has to be one of the very worst comedies ever made . Mel Brooks , Mike Meyers & a few other have made some very bad comedies , this however is the absolute bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />It is unfunny from the very opening , to the tacked on scene during the credits.<br /><br />Diane Keaton who I normally like must have needed her paycheck badly . She desperately needs to re - learn her craft.<br /><br />Dax Shepard ( I do not know who he is),needs a better director , to show him how to act.<br /><br />Liv Tyler is also not up to her role.<br /><br />Mike White needs to find another character , he has done this same type person a few times too many.<br /><br />Ken Howard who started out years back as a first rate actor , also not as good as he used to be.<br /><br />There is nothing decent I can say on this attempt at movie comedy.<br /><br />Ratings : * ( out of 4 ) points 25(out of 100 ) IMDb 1 ( out of 10 )
0 Whatever happened to Keaton is what I want to know.<br /><br />Actually I do n't , I crawled away , heaving , thinking she must owe half the bookies in Vegas , or maybe not , maybe she was just brainwashed , blackmailed and bored to death . Rich enough to adopt a third - world country , she somehow had to star in yet another cookie - cut , clich√© - ridden drool'athon , based on the same character - franchise she 's been rehashing since ' Father of the Bride'('91 ) . You 'd think she 's going head to head with Mr . Bean.<br /><br />(Spoilers ) < br /><br />So hubby ( Dax ) get 's fired by obnoxious son of boss , his mom ( Keaton)leaves his dad after classic row , and crashes over with her own dog - show in tow , oh those little rascals . Hubby 's got cold - feet for diaper - duty , wifey 's clock a - ticking and hey , let 's toss in a space - cadet as second house - guest for good measure , all in one day because that 's so funny and original . Wife gets fed up and walks away , mom leaves dad for space - cadet and the couple makes up in time for closing credits , 86 very long minutes later.<br /><br />Now if you have to have a space - cadet , he ca n't be devious as well , he ca n't scheme some excuse for his stayover , and if mom leaves dad , she ca n't hop into a cab dressed as a pumpkin just because some scriptwriter agonized over how to cheer thing up . < br /><br />Plus that gag whereby they invite her in only to then discover she 's got her canine entourage in the cab has got to be outlawed by now . And you only get one obnoxious 2-dimensional boss to denigrate . Another movie - killer would be the movie - script the space cadet is toiling away at , supposedly more lame than the actual one , again , dejas - ad - nausea.<br /><br />Liv Tyler does n't seem happy here , her voice was weird at times , it had me wondering if they later had her redub some of it , and she 's a smart one , she 's handled great roles and we 'll forgive her for Jersey Girl , it was disaster - prone , could happen to anyone . Dax Shepard was watchable and that 's being generous considering the material.<br /><br />Personally , it 's the director , the screenwriters and especially the producers that I would love to see tar'n'feathered before shipped to Guantanamo as playthings for the prisoners , and that 's me keeping this ' lite ' .
0 Watching Smother was perhaps the longest not - quite-90-minutes of my life . There was n't a laugh to be had ; in fact , I do n't remember ever cracking a smile . Diane Keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle - aged chain - smoking dog hoarder , the textbook overbearing mother character , a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffers from some kind of personality disorder . She is manipulative , conniving , melodramatic , childish , narcissistic , and worst of all , boring.<br /><br />I suppose I should briefly mention the other characters , but why bother ? It was just a long string of movie clich√©s -- the dippy , socially inept distant relative who 's just trying to break into " The Industry " , the gruff and long - suffering but somehow still lovable father , the mild- mannered wife who just ca n't take it anymore ( but eventually moves beyond the discord and resignedly comes home ) , the herd of unhousebroken dogs who like to chew throw pillows while everyone is away , etc.<br /><br />God , what a snore . I 've never been a Diane Keaton fan and Smother only reminded me why . Overacting is overacting , no matter how many pictures you did in your prime . Her attempts at physical comedy were especially humiliating . What was the director thinking?<br /><br />While I like Dax Shepard and can even sometimes tolerate Liv Tyler , their performances were so lackluster and dull that it was clear that neither actor gave a damn about this movie . That was okay , because neither did I. Keaton 's endless self - absorbed prattling was intolerable and at times Shepard 's dislike for her seemed genuine . By the end of the movie I wanted to slap her myself.<br /><br />Awful .
0 After seeing the poster from the film Smother , I knew I was about to live one of those intolerable film experiences which make me want to take my eyes out . However , I felt a slight optimism because the movie had a solid cast which I thought it was going to rescue the movie . Unfortunately that did not happen . Smother is a horrible movie , but it is not execrable . That is the best I can say about it.<br /><br />The screenplay from Smother ( written by the same guys from License to Wed , something which explains they have anything but talent for writing movies ) is full of cheap and predictable humor . Seriously , I did not laugh even once watching this film . Besides , the solid cast I previously mentioned is absolutely wasted . After the big number of garbage she has been involved in ( like the monumentally atrocious and execrable Because I Said So),some people may think the career from Diane Keaton is extinguishing . However , it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances she has brought in previous decades , on films like Annie Hall or Baby Boom . On Smother , she makes her best effort with her performance , but her character is so horribly written she can not do anything with it . Dax Shepard has left on me a good impression with his solid performances on the films Baby Mama and Idiocracy . However , he does what he can with his character . Mike White also makes a good effort , but he does not reach too far away . He is a very talented screenwriter ( like he has shown on films like The Good Girl and School of Rock),so I would have liked to see he was one of the screenwriters from this movie , instead of only acting on it . Liv Tyler suffers from the same situation of all the previously mentioned actors : being wasted.<br /><br />The worst fail from Smother is being absolutely boring and unfunny . Its screenplay is nothing more than a collection of forced scenes and situations we have seen on sit - coms . Stay far away from this crappy comedy .
0 Totally forgettable . Specially because of the weak acting . This is the first movie I 've seen with Dax Shepard . To my surprise , he 's been around since the late 90 's . I thought he was a newcomer , since his acting was so bland . I could say the same about Liv Tyler . Although I 've seen her do well in other movies , she gave Clare Cooper a strange personality . Liv is not the kind of actress that will give the character a fiery , emotional personality like Diane Keaton would be able to , but it was pretty strange to see her say her lines in whisper mode . It seemed that altogether there simply was n't a very good chemistry going on between the actors , and I think Diane Keaton sensed that as well . She 's a fantastic actress , but seemed just a bit over the top in this movie . It felt like she just wanted to get this movie over as soon as possible . I would n't blame her .
0 If you hit your teens in the 70s , as I did , you probably remember the stories about Studio 54 whether or not you liked disco . An exclusive club , it was the perfect symbol of 70s cultural overindulgence and self - absorption ; there 's even an excellent VH1 documentary about the club that could tell you everything you wanted to know about its heyday , and the stories are easily interesting enough to spawn a very captivating film.<br /><br />Sadly , this is n't it . 54 follows the lives of a few of its employees , a bartender named Shane ( Ryan Phillippe ) , a busboy named Greg ( Breckin Meyer ) , his wife , a coat - check girl , Anita ( Selma Hayek ) , and of course the master of ceremonies himself , Steve Rubell ( Mike Meyers ) . While the goings - on at the club are well represented , this film concerns itself more with the personal lives of the workers , following Shane 's story the closest.<br /><br />The movie works in spurts . Sometimes it captures perfectly the shallowness of the nightlife culture ( such as when Shane is taken to a dinner party and does n't know who ' Errol Flynt ' is ) , and other times it waxes into hokey melodrama . Some of that is inherent in the premise ¬ñ following the underlings as they mingle in the world of the rich and fabulous ¬ñ but a lot of it is due to the kid - gloved treatment with which both the club and Rubell are given throughout the movie . While Rubell certainly electrified the scene in New York with his penchant for over - the - top spectacle and his exclusive hand - picking of the crowds each night , the rampant drugs and sexuality are only briefly touched on ; and Rubell himself , while his excesses are mentioned , come off oddly positive for a guy who was in life a liar , a cheat , a drug abuser , and promiscuous as all hell . Not that I was looking for the man to be pilloried here , but his ego directly contributed to the fall of his club and the diminishing of the nightlife culture he helped to elevate . A final scene where he gazes down at the regulars paternally is so emotionally false as to be patently absurd.<br /><br />Meyers does his best to capture Rubell , but he 's given so little to work with here it 's surprising his performance is effective ; but he 's good , and he helps to anchor the film . Philippe , whom I find generally to be a good actor , is hamstrung here by the shallowness and stupidity of his character ; he 's limited to a deer - in - the - headlights smile or a sullen uncomprehending frown , and even he ca n't translate that into a strong performance . Hayek and Meyer are both okay , again , undercut by the writing , and Neve Campbell ¬ñ prominently featured on the DVD cover ¬ñ appears so briefly she really has an extended cameo.<br /><br />For some reason I still find myself interested , even fascinated , by the popular culture of the second half of the seventies . But even given that , this is not a film that particularly engaged me , despite a predisposition to like it . I 'd say if that era , or that club , has any interest for you , track down the VH1 special rather than this middle - of - the - road melodrama .
0 54 is a film about a club with that very title in the setting of the 70s era . It features the classic good - looking bartender . The sexy females . The high powered owner . The partying . When all entwined together chaos ensues , and the bartender ( played by Phillipe ) seems to be at the brunt of it all.<br /><br />I'm going to be as blunt and honest as possible , whilst avoiding any outright unfair or untrue comments ( like , it 's an ' ok ' film ) . I really do find it a completely dire film complimented by it 's dire cast . Every time I sit down to watch a film casting Salma Hayek , I am always awaiting to see her beauty , radiantly expressed simultaneously with a great performance , but , reality invariably reminds me quite abruptly how utterly talentless she is . I mean , really , what has she ever bequeathed the masses with , other than her immense table dance in ' From Dusk Till Dawn ' ... ? The same goes for Ryan Phillippe , another poor actor who gives nothing to the screen but his good looks and insanely dull facade otherwise known as ' acting ' . Mike Myers , is n't quite as bad as these 2 , he does at least give the Film something worthy . Playing the seedy , extroverted co - founder of the 54 Club . The type that the majority watching would hate ( i.e. job well done ) , he puts in a somewhat convincing performance that gave me rare enjoyment from the flick . But alas , it is not enough to rescue the film from it 's baseless and flat nothingness . Most ' bad ' bad films I find something to take from the film , but this has nothing to it , really . Neve Campbell is n't too bad , but she is just ' there ' . The storyline is dull , it appears the writer was more bent on making a film of this style and embellishment and forgot to add anything else . Any meaning . Any class . Anything at all . Because like most ornaments , they are just hollow pointless objects , that are merely pretty to look at , much akin to the basis of this disastrous film.<br /><br />Genuinely an hour and a half of time I could have spent better doing something much more exciting , like talking to 90 year old relatives on the phone about the weather .
0 " 54 " is a film based on the infamous " Studio 54 " of the 1970s - the hangout for the social elite and party clubbers . In the film , Ryan Phillippe is the main character , based on an actual employee of Studio from 1977 - 1982.<br /><br />The film 's problem is that it 's all glitter and style and no substance . It tries to be a really grimy and probing satire like " Boogie Nights " but ultimately comes across as an inferior wannabe . Mike Myers is given the thankless task of playing cocaine - snorting club owner Steve Rubell . It 's only a slightly comedic role and if this was Myers ' best attempts at sliding into drama like Lemmon and other comedic actors did in their time , it 's a total failure.<br /><br />"54 " could have been insightful and interesting but instead it 's just another dumb teen flick that is n't entertaining or even remotely engaging . View at your own peril .
0 What a waste ! This movie could have really been something decent , but the writing , in particular , is crap , and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting . Mike Meyers was good , and the historical recreation of late 70s decadence was well crafted , but overall , this movie was a big waste of time . Instead , the movie to watch , that deals with similar themes and the same basic time frame , is the great BOOGIE NIGHTS .
0 Unfortunately this film , 54 was a pathetic attempt of the true story of ' Studio 54 . ' The only thing that was good about the picture was ' Mike Myers ' who was a joy to watch . ' Neve Cambpell , ' although her role was little was unfortunately bad . The bottom line is that this film lacked a good performance from the actors , except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt for a good screenplay .
0 Me and my girlfriend went to see this movie as a " Premiere Surprise " that is we bought at ticket to the preview to a movie before it opened here in Denmark . We sat through the 1st hour or so and then we left ! The point of the movie seemed to be simply to portray the era ( and club 54 ) , but it did so at the expence of character development , of which there was none , and plot of which there was little.<br /><br />Seldom have I been so indifferent to the characters in a movie!<br /><br />The music was good though . So if you like to hear some good music and get a fix of that 70ies mood I guess it is OK . But do n't expect to get a plot of believable characters.<br /><br / >
0 Unless you understand wretched excess this movie wo n't really mean much to you . An attempt was made to interject a bit of humanity into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs -- it does n't work.<br /><br />When Salma Hayak does her big disco number her voice is so obviously dubbed it is pathetic -- the producers could at least have gotten someone that sounded remotely like her.<br /><br />The documentary that has been playing on television lately is far superior and gives a much truer view of that period of our history.<br /><br />No one , with the exception of Mikey Myers , could be accused of acting ; however , he does an incredible job .
0 I know no one cares , but I do . This film is historic for one reason . It is the unity of two heroes from two great seventies sci - fi films . Well , one is great , and one is quite bad . The great one is truly great , in fact it 's the best . The bad one is truly bad , in fact it 's the worst . Of course of the great I refer to " Star Wars " and it 's star Mark Hamill , aka " Luke Skywalker " , who is the hero of this film about a kid who gets his Vette swiped and then goes to Vegas ( on a lead ) and after a whole lot of adventures , eventually recovers it . ( Since he 's into fixing cars I guess you can call him " Lube Skywalker " ) . Along the way he meets a hooker with a heart of gold , and ends up facing off with a character played by Kim Milford , the hero from the seventies sci - fi cult film " Laserblast " , which is , as I 've hinted at earlier , the worst sci - fi film ever made . Milford plays the lead baddie whom Hamill must steal his car back from . I realize that no one cares about this meeting of two great sci - fi heroes , but I do . And I also must say that this is one of the best / worst movies of all time . Mark Hamill 's acting needs the force , the plot needs extensive Jedi training , and the character of the hooker played by Annie Potts just might be the most annoying character of all time , ever , in any film I 've ever seen . But it 's a fun movie to watch on a weekend day , or a weekday night , late at night , very late . It 's one of those films that meanders , looking for something but without quite finding it and yet , at the same time , it 's entire purpose is , like free - form jazz , to simply exist as is . And it does . And what is , is n't that great , but you ca n't say it is n't entertaining , because for an hour and a half you might feel ripped off , but you wo n't feel cheated . So turn off your mind , relax , and enjoy this muddled gem without any expectations , and may the force be with you , always .
0 The summer of 1979 , when this flick was a staple on that new movie medium called HBO , was Gas Line Summer & Iranian Hostage Crisis Summer . A change of mood was about to end low - budget , loner - on - a - mission car films , although " Smokey & the Bandit " kept need - for - speed flicks going as live - action Roadrunner cartoons for a few more years . " Corvette Summer " is as quirky as any earlier movie like " Vanishing Point " or " Dirty Mary , Crazy Larry , " if lighter & sexier than most . Just - graduated , high - school automotive genius Kenneth ( Hamill ) hitchhikes to Vegas in pursuit of the car theft ring that ripped off his Shop Class masterpiece , a super - custom , right - hand - drive Vette . In the spiritual limbo of the I-15 desert ( see " Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas " ) he gets into a custom van ( yes , this was the tail end of the van craze , too ) tricked out as a mobile bordello & driven by sassy , aspiring hooker Vanessa ( Potts ) , on her way to Sin City to make her , well , whatever it is ambitious hookers make . VANessa , get it ? Shy , innocent Kenneth is in way over his head in Vegas , with only his all - American resolve & his new friend to help him , although the hard - edged young call girl is predictably less world - wise than she first seems . Why , in the " I am Woman " age , Vanessa invested her talents , money & future in the world 's oldest but least dignified profession over , say , college or even hairdressing , can be explained by young men who 'd like to think that all women at least consider the joys of that career path . Remember the target audience , right ? Hamill is a good choice for the whitebread Kenneth ( the car does n't even belong to him personally , but to his school ) , who wo n't be deterred from his goal by violence , money or even love -- until he finds out why the car was really stolen . Potts acts with style & energy but Vanessa is too incredible for any but the most credulous testosterone machine to buy into . The bad guys are made surprisingly human , especially by the always - fine Brion James . But there 's not much action & this is n't the kind of movie that can be carried by dialog , plot twists or Heavy Themes . You could always reach up , turn the TV dial & plug in your " Pong " console . The similar but meaner Chris Mitchum vehicle " Stingray , " which appeared at about the same time , featured lamer acting but more skin , speed & mayhem . The best features of each film might have produced a Vette movie worth remembering . Thus the Trans Am was left to rule the box - office muscle car showroom . Another forgotten car movie brought back from the dead by " Speed Channel 's " fine weekend series , Lost Drive - in .
0 Annie Potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film . Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the Corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod ( quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie ) , and heads off to Las Vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy.<br /><br />I would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it was n't for the fun of watching Annie Potts in a very early role , and it 's too bad for Hamill that he did n't take a few acting lessons from her . Danny Bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo .
0 This is a pretty bad movie . The plot is sentimental mush . I suppose the production values are OK , decent photography , unobtrusive direction and all that . Mark Hamill was terrible . I 've never cared much for him , and this movie validates that perception . It 's no wonder that he never really had any sort of career aside from his " Star Wars " films . I 'll just say " Buh - bye , Mark " as he sinks into well - deserved obscurity . On the other hand , a very young Annie Potts utterly stole the show . She showed charm , beauty , and acting chops all in one performance . I remember seeing her in " Texasville " recently and taking note of her beauty . It 's interesting seeing her from ten years earlier . Anyway , unless you are interested in Miss Potts , run away from this film screaming for the hills .
0 Mark Hamill should have felt mighty embarrassed with CORVETTE SUMMER ! This time , he uses a new kind of " force " to regain the possession of his dream machine , a bright red ' Vette . It looks like another sour teen - age flick the first half - hour and does a U - turn in heading for the wrong direction . The writing and directing jobs are dreadfully done , with a few scenes you ca n't hardly take . You 're expecting this to happen anyway , and you 're also sniffing the smell of late-70s hodgepodge . Only a former newcomer like Annie Potts would easily steal the show and save this poor movie from the repo creeps ! Her impractical but delightful personality holds on to your interest for good , and this is the finest chance to see her in a swimsuit . Hooray for Annie ! Sorry , Mark ! I guess the Force was n't with you this time around .
0 What if Somerset Maugham had written a novel about a coal miner who decided to search for transcendental enlightenment by trying to join a country club ? If he had , he could have called it The Razor 's Edge , since the Katha - Upanishad tells us , " The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over ; thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard . " But Maugham decided to stick with the well - bred class , and so we have Darryl F. Zanuck 's version of Larry Darrell , recently returned from WWI , carefully groomed , well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner . < br /><br />Or , as Maugham tells us , " This is the young man of whom I write . He is not famous . It may be that when at last his life comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on this earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water . Yet it may be that the way of life he has chosen for himself may have an ever growing influence over his fellow men , so that , long after his death , perhaps , it will be realized that lived in this age a very remarkable creature . " < br /><br />The Razor 's Edge has all of Zanuck 's cultural taste that money could buy . It 's so earnest , so sincere ... so self - important . As Larry goes about his search for wisdom , working in mines , on merchant ships , climbing a Himalayan mountain to learn from an ancient wise man , we have his selfish girl friend , Isabel , played by Gene Tierney , his tragic childhood chum played by Anne Baxter , the girlfriend 's snobbish and impeccably clad uncle played by Clifton Webb , and Willie Maugham himself , played by Herbert Marshall , taking notes . The movie is so insufferably smug about goodness that the only thing that perks it up a bit is Clifton Webb as Elliot Templeton . " If I live to be a hundred I shall never understand how any young man can come to Paris without evening clothes . " Webb has some good lines , but we wind up appreciating Clifton Webb , not Elliot Templeton . < br /><br />Zanuck wanted a prestige hit for Twentieth Century when he bought the rights to Maugham 's novel . He waited a year until Tyrone Power was released from military service . He made sure there were well - dressed extras by the dozens , a score that sounds as if it were meant for a cathedral and he even wrote some of the scenes himself . The effort is as self - conscious as a fat man wearing a rented tux . Despite Hollywood 's view of things in The Razor 's Edge , I can tell you that for most people hard work does n't bring enlightenment , just weariness and low pay . < br /><br />After nearly two - and - a - half hours , we last see Larry carrying his duffle bag on board a tramp steamer in a gale . He 's going to work his way back to America from Europe with a contented smile on his face . " My dear , " Somerset Maugham says to Isabel at the same time in an elaborately decorated parlor , " Larry has found what we all want and what very few of us ever get . I do n't think anyone can fail to be better , and nobler , kinder for knowing him . You see , my dear , goodness is after all the greatest force in the world ... and he 's got it ! " Larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of Dramamine . < br /><br />Maugham , lest we forget , was a fine writer of plays , novels , essays and short stories . To see how the movies could do him justice , watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in Encore , Trio and Quartet . And instead of wasting time with Larry Darrell , spend some time with Lawrence Durrell . The Alexandria Quartet is a good read .
0 The author of numerous novels , plays , and short stories , W. Somerset Maugham ( 1874 - 1965 ) was considered among the world 's great authors during his lifetime , and although his reputation has faded over the years his work continues to command critical respect and a large reading public . Published in 1944 , THE RAZOR 'S EDGE is the tale of a World War I veteran whose search for spiritual enlightenment flies in the face of shallow western values . It was Maugham 's last major novel -- and it was immensely popular . Given that the novel 's conflicts are internalized spiritual and philosophical issues , it was also an extremely odd choice for a film version -- but Darryl F. Zannuck of 20th Century Fox fell in love with the book and snapped up the screen rights shortly after publication.<br /><br />According to film lore , THE RAZOR 'S EDGE was to be directed by the legendary George Cukor from a screenplay by Maugham himself -- and it does seem that Maugham wrote an adaptation . When the film went into production , however , Cukor was replaced by Edmund Goulding , a director less known for artistic touch than a workman - like manner , and the Maugham script was replaced with one by Lamar Trotti , the author of such memorable screenplays as THE OXBOW INCIDENT . Tyrone Power , recently returned from military service during World War II , was cast as the spiritually conflicted Larry Darrell ; Gene Tierney , one of the great beauties of her era , was cast as socialite Isabell Bradley . The supporting cast was particularly notable , including Herbert Marshall , Anne Baxter , Clifton Webb , Lucille Watson , and Elsa Lanchester . Both budget and shooting schedule were lavish , and when the film debuted in 1946 it was greatly admired by public and critics alike.<br /><br />But time has a way of putting things into perspective . Seen today , THE RAZOR 'S EDGE is indeed a beautifully produced film -- but that aside the absolute best one can say for it is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity . As in most cases , the major problem is the script . Although it is reasonably close to Maugham 's novel in terms of plot , it is noticeably off the mark in terms of character and it completely fails to capture the fundamental issues that drive the story . We are told that Larry is in search of enlightenment ; we are told that he receives it ; we are told he acts on it -- but in spite of the occasional and largely superficial comment we are never really told anything about the spiritual , artistic , philosophical , and intellectual processes behind any of it . We are most particularly never told anything significant about the nature of the enlightenment itself . It has the effect of cutting off the story at its knees.<br /><br />We are left with the shell of Maugham 's plot , which centers on the relationship between Larry and Isabell , a woman Larry loves but leaves due to the growing ideological riff that opens up between them . Tyrone Power and Gene Tierney were more noted for physical beauty than talent , but both could turn in good performances when they received solid directorial and script support . Unfortunately , that does not happen here ; they are extremely one - note and Power is greatly miscast to boot . Fortunately , the supporting cast is quite good , with Herbert Marshall , Clifton Webb , and Lucille Watson particularly so ; the then - famous performance by Anne Baxter , however , has not worn as well as one would hope.<br /><br />With a running time of just under two and a half hours , the film also feels unnecessarily long . There is seemingly endless cocktail party - type banter , and indeed the entire India sequence ( which reads as faintly hilarious ) would have been better cut entirely -- an odd situation , for this is the very sequence intended as the crux of the entire film . Regardless of the specific scene , it all just seems to go on and on to no actual point.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself , the film has not been remastered , but the print is extremely good , and while the bonus package is n't particularly memorable neither is noticeably poor . When all is said and done , I give THE RAZOR 'S EDGE four stars for production values and everyone 's willingness to take on the material -- but frankly , this a film best left Power and Tierney fans , who will enjoy it for the sake of the stars , and those whose ideas about spiritual enlightenment are as vague as the film itself.<br /><br />GFT , Amazon Reviewer
0 ( aka : TRINITY IS STILL MY NAME ) This sequel looks like it was done to capitalize on the outstanding European box - office success of THEY CALL ME TRINITY , only this time Joseph E. Levine and Avco - Embassy pictures wanted to capitalize on it in America as well . Too bad they did n't get very far since the Hill / Spencer pictures have had only had marginal success here in the U.S. , and this largely boring , drawn - out film does n't help it out any.<br /><br />Trinity and Bambino swear to their dying father ( Harry Carey Jr. ) that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other . They later get involved with arms - traffickers who smuggle guns out of a monastery , and who mistakenly think they 're a pair of federal agents . It all winds up falling flat in spite of a couple of funny scenes , especially the one where Trinity and Bambino are in a fancy French restaurant and do n't know how to carry themselves . And the scenes with the card sharks was mildly humorous as well.<br /><br />The opening title music sung by Gene Roman sounds like a fair Bobby Goldsboro - like early 70s pop song while the music cues sprinkled throughout the movie are pretty good . Not sure if I 'd want to buy the CD soundtrack of it but some others might.<br /><br />The film could have had a half hour whacked off of it and it would n't have dragged on for so long . It looks like a lot of scenery is being chewed up here . In fact , I lost interest in it about 2/3rds of the way through . The DVD is also terrible , with a constant hum in the soundtrack and a poor print that looks like it should have been sent to that great scrap heap in the sky.<br /><br />A big step down from the previous film.<br /><br />4 out of 10
0 I have seen this movie and the other one . Trinity is my name and i find that this one is worse then the first one . I have no idea why they even made another movie it was stupid and pointless sorry to say that i have all of them . I have sat through them number of times and it still drives me to turn it off 5 minutes into the movie . I like Terence Hill movies and i like Bud Spencer but this movie just drove me up the wall . If it had a different story line or at least more of a plot and more comedy it might have been funner and worth the 5 dollars i spent buying all the movies . But you make mistakes so i would say save your money and do n't bye this movie or any of the ones that go with it trust me on this one .
0 < br /><br />I did n't see They Call Me Trinity , but this sequel is really unfunny at all . It has many gags that are supposed to make people laugh . I guess the filmmaker just do n't have the talent to do it right . Wonder why it was so popular in the 70s .
0 Hollywood , the home of hype , glamor and the search for profits , is scarcely ruled by spiritual values , and so it comes as no surprise that its attempts at investigations of the spiritual life are thin and often silly ( better to go farther afield -- to the films of Bresson , Dreyer , Rossellini and Bergman , for probing depictions of the spirituality ) . " Strange Cargo " is no exception . This odd hybrid of adventure film , love story and religious parable trivializes the very insights it tries to communicate . That a figure of providence and salvation would work to match Verne ( Clark Gable at his most cockily mannered and self - regarding ) and Julie ( Joan Crawford , snarling and spitting out every other word in an attempt to be the Queen of Tough Dames ) seems ludicrous at best . Is this the Patron Saint of the Star System at work , matching warring egos before sending them off to further penal servitude on the M - G - M lot ? BUT . . .there are good supporting performances here , and visually arresting moments : the shadowy prison barracks ; the escaping boat by moonlight , or against a painterly cloudscape ; Julie walking along the seafront as the wind whips up ; Julie and Monsieur Pig ( Peter Lorre ) bargaining for Verne 's freedom as the storm builds ; an unusually ennobling gay prison romance between two convicts . . .Above all , there is Paul Lukas 's dignified and detached performance as Hessler , a murderer who can appreciate Cambreau 's virtues , yet turns his back on him . In the film 's most arresting moment , Hessler , having left Cambreau , stands outside the cabin . We hear the wind through the jungle , see the shadows on his face , which conveys a moment of fear and self - doubt . Then he exits into the night . In this moment , Hessler achieves an ambiguity , depth and existential strength that none of the other characters manage to achieve . is the film 's secret that its deepest sympathies are allied with Hessler ?
0 This film is pure ' Hollywood hokum ' . It is based upon a novel called ' Not Too Narrow ¬Ö  Not Too Deep ' by Richard Sale , which may or may not have been interesting ; it would take research to find out ! The story in the film takes for granted many incidents and much background which obviously existed in the novel but are nowhere to be seen in the film , so either the film was savagely cut or the screenplay was a mess from the start . There is not one millisecond in this film which is remotely realistic , either in terms of events or characters . It is pure Hollywood fantasy in every respect . Two well - known actors , Paul Lukas and Peter Lorre , are so under - used and wasted that there was no point in their being in the film at all . They must have been thrown into the mix in the manner in which one adds a sprinkling of chopped chives to an omelette , hoping that the flavour will be enhanced . The film is a ponderous attempt at producing a ' morality tale ' , and is so corny that it is laughable . The story concerns some hardened criminals imprisoned in French Guiana who want to escape from their French colonial prison through a jungle ( very much a Hollywood set jungle , with a rubber snake ) . Naturally there has to be a woman in the story , so Joan Crawford hams it up as a down - on - her - luck tramp who for some reason becomes irresistible to Clark Gable , one of the escaped criminals . Crawford in escaping through the jungle wears high - heeled shoes and keeps her makeup fresh . Gable flirts and grimaces and makes mawkish expressions , crinkling his brow as was his wo nt , smirking and looking suggestively at everybody , which was his manner of acting . It is hard to treat such a character as a hardened criminal when he is always trying so hard to be Clark Gable that surely he has n't any time left to be a thief . ( Attention - seekers are by definition too busy to steal and unsuited to a task which requires that people NOT see them . ) The whole escapade is so ridiculous that it can only be regarded as light entertainment . An attempt at religiosity and ' depth ' is made by injecting into the story a mysterious ' angel of mercy ' who voluntarily walks into the prison and pretends to be an inmate . He helps in the escape and accompanies all the criminals and ministers to their various deaths , helping them to find ' peace ' in their last gasps . This character is played very well by Ian Hunter , who retains throughout a convincing air of secret knowledge , smiles enigmatically , makes cryptic prophetic remarks , and has a small spot trained on his face to give him a heavenly glow . The theme is meant to be redemption . You might call it the Donald Duck version of ' Hollywood Goes Moral and Gets Heavy ' . For real depth , Hitchcock 's ' I Confess ' of 1953 shows how it should really be done . By contrast , this piece of trivial nonsense shows just how bare the cupboards of Meaning were in Tinsel Town , and that when they went rummaging for something that might mean something , all they could come up with was , you guessed it , more tinsel .
0 Hollywood always had trouble coming to terms with a " religious picture . " Strange Cargo proves to be no exception . Although utilizing the talents of a superb cast , and produced on a top budget , with suitably moody photography by Robert Planck , the movie fails dismally on the credibility score . Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements upsets the viewer 's involvement in the action and with the fate of the characters . I found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphors , parallels and biblical references , and impossible to accept bathed - in - light Ian Hunter 's smug know - it - all as a Christ figure . And the censors in Boston , Detroit and Providence at least agreed with me . The movie was banned . Few Boston / Detroit / Providence moviegoers , if any , complained or journeyed to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that Gable and Crawford had somehow become involved in a " message picture . " It flopped everywhere.<br /><br />Oddly enough , the movie has enjoyed something of a revival on TV . A home atmosphere appears to make the movie 's allegory more receptive to viewers . However , despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film , the plot of this Strange Cargo flows along predictable , heavily moralistic lines that will have no - one guessing how the principal characters will eventually come to terms with destiny .
0 I watched this with a growing sense of unease . Why would God , in the shape of Ian Hunter , help these particular people in their attempted escape from Devils Island ? And what was he doing there in the first place ? I mean , I know God works in mysterious ways , but helping thieves and murderers and prostitutes find redemption , forgiveness and changes - of - heart in such a godforsaken location .... In any event it is hardly a likeable movie . Whatever Gable had by way of charm is missing in this portrait of a thoroughly selfish man , Crawford is as endearing as ever she was i.e. to me , not at all , and the whole look of the film makes it seem as if it was made 10 years before . Compared to contemperaneous films like " Stagecoach " and " Mr. Deeds Goes to Town " , this looks prehistoric .
0 What a great word " re - imagining " is . Is n't that what they call Dawn of the Dead MMIV ( 2004 ) ? A clever word indeed - it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate , " remake " that is , and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination . Well , damn , was I misled . At least I was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of " re - imagining , " though it played a role.<br /><br />Still , why make a remake ? Directors do it for only a few reasons really : to update a movie for a modern audience , or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it . An homage , if you will . Nonetheless , it all generally ( I do admit exceptions ) boils down to one thing : stealing someone 's idea and reshaping it ( or " re - imagining " it ) so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it . It 's like Coles'/Cliffs ' notes ; dump everything in a blender , purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors . In other words , a great marketing scheme.<br /><br />So what 's wrong with this one ? Well , I 'll start with what I liked . I liked the opening scenes . Thanks to CGI and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust Romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means . We see the city in ruins , thousands of zombies : chaos and death . Two words that look beautiful on screen . Then it all falls apart.<br /><br />This set - up leads nowhere . The movie does what almost every remake does . It adds more of everything except character , atmosphere , and story . It 's noisier , ( in some sense ) bloodier , and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots . The setting , the mall which played a crucial role in the original film 's story and theme , is purely coincidental . The idea communicated in Romero 's film , the pure ecstatic joy of having " a mall all to yourself as a fortress , " is gone here . Further , this " re - imagining " has no moxie , no spirit , no balls . It assumes ( probably quite rightly ) that the audience has no attention span and does n't bother to get us interested in the characters or the story . The film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original . You actually grew to care about those people in Romero 's version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall . Here , you do n't care when or who goes : what matters is how they go.<br /><br />What else is their to say ? The film is not scary . It has one or two " jump " scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects . As a story it 's really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it . The humor is also reduced to a few one - liners ( and one really good character : Andy ) . After that , what remains ? An ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued , inevitable ambiguity of the original film . But , despite it being a pretty bad film ( though not quite as bad as some other remakes ) , it should be remembered for one thing : it kicked The Passion of Christ from it 's number one spot in the box office . Well done zombies .
0 Funny how many of the people who say this is far superior to Romero 's version tend to be very young ( judging by their other posts ) . What we have here is a slick , action packed , gory and " Whoopee " filled 2 hour MTV video . Frantic editing , pop - video camera work , " cool " music blah blah blah < br /><br />Actually it ai n't bad compared to other recent remakes ( Chainsaw Massacre was a total disaster ) ... pretty good acting all round , totally predictable in the " who will die next " stakes and a total cash in on the Dawn Of The Dead name that will generate plenty of revenue alone by fans of the original who will go and see it out of curiosity ... <br /><br />Don't remakes of classics get on your nerves ? Can they REALLY not come up with something original ? Why remake Dawn Of The Dead ? The things that made the original special ( the middle segment kids think is so boring is supposed to be slow to show how when you get everything you ever wanted you still ai n't happy ) are totally missing . This is an action flick , plain and simple . The faster the better . If you are into action flicks ( and as this , the 2004 version is well done ) fair enough , but for anyone who likes a little substance to their films ... get ready to sigh ( again) ... <br /><br />Watch the cinemas over the next few years as we get The Godfather series remade by whoever the most fashionable Pop director is at the moment , and Star Wars remade , with all the kids saying how the new version is miles better cos the old version is slow and boring and holds a camera shot for more than 5 seconds ... <br /><br />Not bad , but in 10 years they will still be discussing the Romero version , not this pap
0 When I went and saw this movie , I had great expectations . But I had so wrong . This movie was exactly as every other horror movies . It 's a virus , zombies etc . Exactly as Resident Evil and many , many other movies . But the difference with this , and other movies , is that the story is very week . It 's bad actors and boring music . The photo is OK but the rest is total crap . Do n't see this " horror " movie , go and see the Ring 2 or any other movie who 's much more of a story . I hope they will stop making horror movies who has a virus and the virus spread and make people to zombies . We have seen enough of that . The only good thing in the movie is when they are standing at a roof and shoot famous , infected celebrities .
0 What a horrible movie . I can not believe i wasted 90 mins of my life watching this re - make . Please tell me why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer starred in this film ? Mehki Pfifer is great in E.R and Ving Rhames probably did n't know what he was doing . I feel terrible for them . The music background i must say did not fit AT ALLLLL with the story and it 's amazing how you can find these directors who have absolutely no lives in creating a well and balanced film . I hope that in the future no director as horrible as this one was , could ever distroy such a great classic film . This film should not have been made in the first place . An advice to everyone who has seen it , please tell me that i 'm right because i could n't possibly be the only viewer who did not enjoy it.<br /><br />BOOOOOO ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! -10 out of 10 .
0 The plot is about a female nurse , named Anna , is caught in the middle of a world - wide chaos as flesh - eating zombies begin rising up and taking over the world and attacking the living . She escapes into the streets and is rescued by a black police officer . So far , so good ! I usually enjoy horror movies , but this piece of film does n't deserve to be called horror . It 's not even thrilling , just ridiculous . Even " the Flintstones " or " Kukla , Fran and Ollie " will give you more excitement . It 's like watching a bunch of bloodthirsty drunkards not being able to get into a shopping mall to by more liquor . The heroes who has locked themselves in , inside the shopping - mall to avoid being eaten by the hoodlums outside , are not better either . Even though they does n't seem to be drunk , they give the impression of being mentally disabled . Save your money instead of spending it on this !
0 Just do n't bother . I thought I would see a movie with great supspense and action.<br /><br />But it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start . In the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed . Towards the end the it gets better but not really great . I think the director took this movie just too serious . In such a kind of a movie even if u do n't care about the plot at least you want some nice action . I nearly dozed off in the middle / main part of it . Rating 3/10.<br /><br />derboiler .
0 What the hell is this ? Its one of the dumbest movies I 've seen . I do n't understand why people on this site love it so much . Its senseless & nudity for no reason . Its worst then Resident Evil . I strongly do n't recomend it unless you want to watch chessy , bad acting crap . Watch real horor movies such as Stephen King 's It , The Shining , Jurassic Park(kinda horor ) , JAWS , etc . Leave this crap for a rental when there is nothing else to rent . It is bad as Crudy vs Gayson . Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is better then this crap.<br /><br />Oh wow flesh eating zombies . How many damn zobie movies do we need . SKip this one.<br /><br / > * outta * * * *
0 < br /><br />Worst . Movie . Ever.<br /><br />What was the purpose of filming this remake ( aside from turning it into a 90-minute informercial for the movie 's soundtrack ) ? Zombies that * run * ? ? ? I guess the director never watched the original " Dead " films , which show stiff - limbed ( from rigor mortis ) creatures shuffling / shambling toward their living prey.<br /><br />And how , exactly , did the survivors know which boat in the marina belonged to the recently departed Steve?<br /><br />1/10
0 I was so eager to see this one of my favorite TV shows . I saw Universal trademark followed with a newly acquainted title and theme song which still impress me . Computer animation on some scenery like a solid title name"The Jetsons " or a dimension view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more made this version splendid and fantastic . Shortly after that till the end ... I could n't believe my eyes!!!!How lucky I was that I could forget all I had seen . Just songs by Tiffany and its theme song in new arrangement were in my head . Anyway , I wish to see this space - aged family ( also The Flintstones and Yogi Bear ) in all graphic computer design as Toy story or Bug 's life . The best style for Hanna - Barbera 's in my opinion .
0 I 'm all for the idea of a grand epic of the American Revolutionary War . This ai n't it . ( And for that matter , neither was the Emmerich / Devlin / Gibson THE PATRIOT . But I digress.)<br /><br />I saw this film at a publicity screening at the old MGM Studios ( now Sony ) just before it came out . The audience had high expectations for this expensive period piece , written by veteran Robert Dillon , directed by the esteemed Hugh Hudson ( of CHARIOTS OF FIRE fame ) , and starring Al Pacino.<br /><br />But it did n't take long for people to start squirming in their seats , whispering derisive comments about Pacino 's horribly misconceived accent -- he was supposed to be an American frontiersman of Scottish ancestry ( ! ) -- and that of Nastassja Kinski , who was supposed to be recently emigrated from England ( ! ! ) . Then the story started and it all went downhill fast.<br /><br />Motivations were muddled , dialogue was atrocious , events had no historical or political context . What there was of a plot lurched forward on absurd coincidence ; by the second or third time that alleged lovers Pacino and Kinski stumbled into each other it had become a bad joke . Donald Sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a British officer / pederast . His accent was all over the map too . I guess there were n't any English actors available.<br /><br />Lots of people left . Those who stayed tried to stifle giggles , then openly guffawed . I stuck it out -- I figured that at least the battle scenes might be good . I was wrong . Inexplicably , Hudson chose to film them with hand - held cameras , not even Steadicam , the jerkiness giving a misplaced newsreel ' authenticity ' which ruined the sense of scale.<br /><br />There was a semi - famous TV reviewer in the audience a few rows ahead of me : ( the late ) Gary Franklin of Channel 7 Eyewitness News . I could tell he was peeved by the behavior of the rest of us . And sure enough , on his TV segment the next day he gave the film a ' 10 ' on his notorious ' Franklin Scale of 1 to 10 ' , while remarking churlishly about the louts who 'd disrupted the screening the night before , who clearly did n't know art when they saw it . What a buffoon.<br /><br />After this disaster , Pacino did n't star in another film for almost 4 years . Hugh Hudson 's career never recovered . You ca n't say I did n't warn you .
0 I ca n't figure Al Pacino out . I watch him in the Godfather , Scarface , Carlito 's Way , and I think I am watching one of the greatest actors of the last thirty years . Then I see him in Two for the Money , Any Given Sunday and Revolution , and I wonder what the guy is thinking.<br /><br />I stumbled on Revolution a few nights ago , and thought I would invest the next two hours on this . Here is a news flash : Want to get prisoners to talk ? Force them to watch this over and over ... they'll confess to anything.<br /><br />I wo n't rehash the plot since there is no coherent plot , but it does take place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to get involved , but ultimately does . While he has no money , no education and dresses like a caveman , a very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason , since they have only two minutes of dialogue together.<br /><br />Quite frankly , if " Al Smith " starred in this movie , instead of " Al Pacino " , it would have ruined their career . The script was horrible , but Pacino 's demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse . Donald Sutherland 's role was laughable . I really ca n't describe it . Natasha Kinski is a main character , but has like 5 lines in the movie . In fact , nobody speaks much in this movie.<br /><br />One of the most laughable premise in the movie is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this uncanny knack to continually run into each other on the battlefield . Its like the entire Northeast is a Starbucks . " Hey , funny to see you here again , on ANOTHER battlefield 100 miles away ... see you in a few months".<br /><br />I am required to give this one star by IMDb , since there is nothing here for a negative score .
0 Brilliant actor as he is , Al Pacino completely derails Revolution ¬ñ his Method acting approach is totally ill - suited to the role of an illiterate trapper caught up in the American War of Independence . Much of the blame should be attributed to director Hugh Hudson ( yes , the man who made Chariots Of Fire just a couple of years earlier ¬ñ talk about a come - down ! ! ) . One of the many jobs of a director is to marshal the actors , coaxing believable performances from them , but in this case Hudson has allowed Pacino to run amok without asking for restraint of any kind . It 's not just Al 's career - low performance that hinders the film though : there are numerous other flaws with Revolution , more of which will be said later.<br /><br />Illiterate trapper Tom Dobb ( Al Pacino ) lives in the north - eastern region of America with his son Ned ( Sid Owen / Dexter Fletcher ) . He leads a simple life ¬ñ living off the land , raising his son , surviving against the elements . The country is lorded over by the English colonialists , but during an eight year period ( 1775 - 83 ) a revolution takes place which ends with the British being defeated and the independent American nation being born . Dobb gets caught up in the events when his boat and his son are conscripted by the Continental Army ¬ñ swept away by events they can barely understand , the Dobbs finds themselves fighting for their lives and freedom in one bloody engagement after another . Tom also falls in love with Daisy McConnahay ( Natassja Kinski ) , a beautiful and fiery woman of British aristocratic ancestry . Their forbidden love is played out against the larger historical context of the fighting.<br /><br />Where to start with the film 's flaws ? Most key actors are miscast ¬ñ Pacino has been criticised enough already , but Kinski fares little better as the renegade aristocrat while Donald Sutherland is hopelessly lost as a ruthless English soldier with a wobbly Yorkshire accent . Robert Dillon 's script is muddled in its attempts to bring massive historical events down to a personal level . At no point does anyone seem to have decided whether this is meant to be an intimate character study with the American Revolution as a backdrop , or an epic war film with a handful of sharply drawn characters used to carry the story along . As a result , the narrative falls into no man 's land , flitting from " grand spectacle " to " small story " indiscriminately and meaninglessly . John Corigliano 's score is quite ghastly , and is poured over the proceedings with neither thought nor subtlety . Hugh Hudson 's direction is clumsy throughout , both in his mismanagement of Pacino and the other key actors , and in the decision to use irritatingly shaky camera work during the action sequences . The idea of the hand - held camera is to create immediacy ¬ñ that feeling of " being there " in the confusion of battle and musket fire . Like so many other things in the film , it does n't work . The one department where the film regains a modicum of respectability is the period detail , with costumes , sets and weaponry that look consistently accurate . But if it 's period detail you 're interested in a trip to the museum would be a better way to spend your time , because as a rousing cinematic experience Revolution does n't even begin to make the grade . Nothing more than a ¬£ 18,000,000 mega - bomb that the ailing British film industry could ill afford in the mid-1980s .
0 This movie was promising : my favorite actor in a historical drama during the Independence war . It had memories from " Dances With Wolves " for the big prairies , Indians , military fights & from " Barry Lyndon " for the British & candles lights atmospheres ... <br /><br />Unfortunately , the script is awful : the continuity of the story is lacking ( cuts with " 5 months later " ; " 3 years later " ) & the romance is so ridiculous that it 's hard to believe in it : America is a big country but the characters kept bumping at each other ; Above all , wait for the ending & you understand how to kill a story ( imagine the same in " Titanic").<br /><br />Sometimes , a bad script is saved by a brilliant filmmaker . Unfortunately bis , Hudson is a poor one . He has already committed " Greystoke " and i find again the same flaws : no dynamic in scenes , in editing , in scoring : it is long , dull , flat .... <br /><br />I knew that this movie was a disaster for Pacino 's career : now i understand . Finally , this last movie for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me : A painful one ...
0 Revolution is a terrible movie , I do n't care if you 're a history teacher , news writer , Al Pacino fan , there 's no way this movie can possibly earn a legitimate ' 10'.<br /><br />The key point to the plot is Tom Dobb ( Al ) trying to get money from a note he got for radical patriots taking his boat . Everything revolves around that note . Tom 's son joins the army to make up for the note , making Tom join the army as well , they go on an adventure trying to get out of the army , years later the war is over and they can finally turn in the note for their boat . The End.<br /><br />It had a few battle scenes , and they were pretty mediocre at best . Transistions between scenes used " five months later " and magically put the characters in some famous historical battle . The love story is a joke , and the movie as a whole is just hard to follow . So save your " Notes " and watch the Patriot instead .
0 Damp telling of the American Revolution.<br /><br />When farmer ' Tom Dobb ' ( Al Pacino ) and his son arrive in New York Harbor , they are immediately conscripted by street urchin Annie Lennox ... Annie Lennox ? ... to contribute to the war effort.<br /><br />After getting chopped down by bits of chain - link fired from British cannons , Tom and his son are promptly chastised by Continental Army sympathizer ' Daisy ' ( Nastassja Kinski ) for ' not standing their ground ' . Following this Kodak moment , a series of digressive chapters take place including Tom 's participation in a ' foxhunt ' in which he must carry a model of " poor old Georgie Washington " stuffed in effigy while running from a lace handkerchief - wielding English captain ( Manning Redwood ) , and having a barbecue with a group of Iroquois Indians as they plan on the best way to sneak back into the fighting so Al and his ingrate kid can kick the crap out of British officer Donald Sutherland 's butt.<br /><br />Director Hugh Hudson presents a unique style of film - making and the atmosphere is as thick as the proverbial London fog , but the scriptwriter 's painting of the redcoats as evil monsters once again reveals Hollywood 's patented hatred of the British.<br /><br />Steven Berkoff appears as an enlisted American soldier .
0 How they got Al Pacino to play in this movie is beyond me . This movie is absolutely terrible . I discovered , after reading some of the other reviews , that a couple of people actually enjoyed this film , which deeply puzzles me , because I do not see how anyone in their right mind could possibly enjoy a movie as awful as Revolution . It 's not just that it 's a bad movie , with a lame plot and overall strangeness that is extremely unpleasant , but it seems as if the filmmakers were either mentally retarded ( which is a very possible explanation as to why this movie sucks like it does , though it probably still sucks even compared to other films made by retards ) or deliberately made every illogical decision to make this movie suck as much as possible . For example , we see Donald Sutherland running around with a huge , fat ugly mole on his face . He does not normally have a mole . The mole does not add to his character . It is extremely ugly and distracting . It 's not like Robert De Niro 's mole ; it 's much worse . Why the hell has he got that mole ? It 's as if the filmmakers just said , " Let 's see , how could we make this movie even worse than it already is ? I know , let 's give Mr. Sutherland a giant , ugly - ass mole right on his face." < br /><br />Another example of the filmmakers ' stupidity is the character Ned . We see , for the first three - quarters of the movie , young Ned . At one point , " six months later " appears on the screen . We see Ned again , and it is , of course , the same actor playing the boy . Five minutes later , " three weeks later " appears on the screen , and all of a sudden we 've got a different actor playing as the now older Ned . What , do they think we 're idiots ? Good God ! Again , it 's like the filmmakers are saying , " How can we possibly make it any worse ? I do n't think we can ... Oh wait ! I just had a terrible idea ! " I know a kid does n't grow much in half a year , which is fine , but he at least grows more than he does in three weeks . Just do n't get another actor to play Ned , or at least get him to play the five minutes when he 's three weeks younger . Furthermore , the kid who plays the " older " Ned does not look any older than " young " Ned . As a matter of fact , he just looks completely different , much skinnier , and no taller or older than the original actor , which is very confusing , as I , like any rational human being , thought at first that it was a new and different character.<br /><br />What , did the first kid die while they were filming the movie ? Because he was in it for the first hour and a half , and then all of a sudden , three weeks later , the guy from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is playing Ned for the last five minutes of the movie . And even if the original actor did die , the filmmakers should have at least gotten an actor who looks like him to play the remainder of his role , and re - shoot the measly five minutes of " six months later " scenes . Better yet , just scrap the movie completely , never finish it and never release , never even tell anybody about it , because by that point they should have realized that their movie sucks and in finishing it they would only waste more money and time and succeed in making one of the worst movies of all time.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this movie is so bad you should n't watch it ; it 's so bad that you SHOULD watch it , just to see how badly it sucks . It 's terrible , terrible .
0 Historically accurate ? Hmm ... Perhaps ... if you squint , and light falls upon the subject just - so . But core accuracy is no compensation for a dismal , patchy and inconsistent plot , reams of cardboard dialogue and an unsatisfying conclusion . The principal characters are merely characterizations ; embarrassing stereotypes that range from the ' enigmatic and noble ' American Indians through to the ' stuffy but sadistic ' British officers . A wretched and unworthy rendition of a fascinating period in American history . I want my money back .
0 I watched this movie also , and altho it is very well done , I found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children .. The terror on this mother 's face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking . And the sad thing is -- internally she dies . Eventually she goes back to the Applacian mountains . All the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has . I remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed . I 'm surprised this movie takes place in Detroit , because when I watched it I thought for sure the people had come to Cincinnati , Ohio . This also was a route for the poor from the mountains .
0 * McCabe and Mrs. Miller * takes place in the turn - of - the - century Pacific Northwest . Into a soggy , muddy mining camp John McCabe ( a hirsute Warren Beatty ) comes barging , full of cigar smoke and big ideas about building a proper saloon / whorehouse for the town , replete with a trio of the sorriest whores in movie history . He also comes with an unearned reputation as a gunslinger : too shameful about this to blatantly advertise it , but not exactly afraid to use it in order to assert alpha - male credentials amongst the locals . And thus he wrangles the boys into building his saloon at the rate of 15 cents an hour.<br /><br />It looks to be a rather sorry operation until Mrs. Miller ( Julie Christie ) shows up on a startling contraption that 's half - railroad car , half - automobile ( where did Altman find that thing ? ) . Mrs. Miller immediately takes on McCabe as a business partner , with the aim of classing up the new joint with proper whores and an insistence that all visitors take a bath before entering . Noting that McCabe does n't know how to add , she also insists on handling the accounts . It 's not clear what McCabe 's function will be.<br /><br />The plot thickens when a pair of oily representatives from the mining company show up in town and offer McCabe to buy him out for five grand . McCabe tells them to buzz off -- he 's holding out for fifteen thousand . The company finds negotiation distasteful , so they hire a trio of assassins to simply kill McCabe . . . though how they think they can get away with murdering a man in broad daylight in the center of town is as unclear as McCabe 's function in the whorehouse partnership . ( Excusing this whopping plot hole on the grounds that the locals would be too cowed to talk does n't cut the mustard when one considers that any reward - money offered by the local Marshal would be pretty tempting . ) < br /><br />*McCabe and Mrs. Miller * , purportedly " classic Seventies cinema " , should be a lot better than it is . The movie tells a pretty good story ; the main characters have the potential to be interesting . There are some striking scenes , especially one involving what looks to be a 14-year - old stone - cold killer . But it 's really , really hard to enjoy a movie when you can hardly hear what anyone is saying and when you can hardly see what anyone is doing . Once again , this director hijacks his own movie with sheer barnyard laziness and sloppiness . According to the trivia - sheet here on IMDb , the movie 's editor griped to Altman that the sound was muddy ; Altman disagreed ; and when everyone said the sound was muddy after the movie 's release , Altman blamed the editor . ( Nice . ) Along with the bad sound , the movie has an atrocious look . Only Robert Altman can hire a world - class DP like Vilmos Zsigmond and make a movie that looks as if they sprayed the camera lenses with dirty dishwater . Reviewers here who praise the " dark brown glow " of this picture have GOT to be kidding me . The interiors are shot through what appears to be a dark scum . The exterior photography is even worse : it 's as if Altman placed 500 fog machines behind the copious trees . During the climactic stretch , when Beatty is dodging the assassins while the local church is on fire , Altman insists on pretty much wholly obscuring the view with an animated snow - fall that reminds one of a Rankin - Bass Christmas special.<br /><br />Look -- I ca n't watch a movie under these conditions . Get back to me when you learn how to place boom mikes , when you remove all that annoying " Altman - esque " overlapping dialog , and when you wipe the lenses with some Windex , or something . 3 stars out of 10 .
0 I 've read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film . I ca n't say that I found much to recommend it . The Leonard Cohen sound track is not only excessively heavy - handed but dreary beyond measure . The film looks authentic enough , but something 's got to happen for it to work , and nothing much does : a cursory plot ( not a real problem for me ) , not much character development , nothing thematically . It just slogs along . Flawed as it is , Cimino 's " Heaven 's Gate " has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film I 'd sooner watch again . For a brilliant reconception of the West , HBO 's " Deadwood " is much superior to " McCabe . "
0 Robert Altman 's downbeat , new - fangled western from Edmund Naughton 's book " McCabe " was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following . Aside from a completely convincing boom - town scenario , the characters here do n't merit much interest , and the picture looks ( intentionally ) brackish and unappealing . Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turn - of - the - century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel ; once the profits start coming in , Beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action . Altman creates a solemn , wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place , but the action in this sorry little town is limited -- most of the story being made up of vignettes -- and Altman 's pacing is deliberately slow . There 's hardly a statement being made ( just the opposite , in fact ) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds . It 's a self - defeating picture , and yet , in an Altman - quirky way , it wears defeat proudly . * * from * * * *
0 Oh God , what an idiotic movie!Incredibly cheap with fake special effects(the creature is played by one guy in lame costume)and stupid plot . All dialogues are unbelievably bad and these actors(HA!HA!HA!) ... they're simply ludicrous . For example I have never seen so annoying characters like in this junk(these dumb kids or pregnant woman with his husband and many more).All in all , this is a great entertainment if you 're drunk . Avoid it like the plague . Am I drunk?I do n't think so ...
0 Blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film but not in any way that makes any possible sense . At one point , some kids are wandering thru the deeper levels , exploring . < br /><br />They begin to discuss what they 'll find down there and one of them ( a girl ) says she bets they 'll find a blue monkey.<br /><br />Yes , that s it . Totally inconsequential to the story , the only sad connection to the title , and no idea why she would suppose she 'd find a blue monkey in a hospital 's basement.<br /><br />I'm embarrassed for having remembered it but somebody had to remember I suppose !
0 Never even knew this movie existed until I found an old VHS copy of it , hidden deep in my dusty horror closet . The title on the box said " Insect " and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80 's horror movie . They can surely be fun , of course , as long as do n't expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you 're not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy make - up effects . Just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in " Blue Monkey " ! The plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal , the acting performances are painful to observe and there 's a total lack of suspense . Following the always - popular trend of " big - bug " movies , " Blue Monkey " handles about a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital . The makers could n't be more evasive about the actual origin of this gigantically over - sized critter ! All we know is that it 's not from outer space and it initially crawled out of a tropical plant . Other than this , there 's absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect all of a sudden comes from ! Like I said , do n't get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay . The first half of the film is entertaining enough , with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters ( an 80-year - old blind and alcoholic lady ! ) but the second half ( when the entire hospital is put to quarantine ) is dreadfully boring . It is also near the end that " Blue Monkey " begins to exaggeratedly rip - off older ( and better ) films . Approaching the climax , they apparently ran out of budget as well , since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit is n't very well camouflaged anymore . " Blue Monkey " is worth a peek in case you 're really bored or if you really want to see every 80 's horror movie ever made . Fans of B - cinema may recognize John Vernon ( " Killer Klowns from Outer Space " , " Curtains " ) in the small and meaningless role of Roger , who 's in charge of the clinic .
0 When I first saw the cover of this movie ( a giant bug chasing a few nurses ) And the name " Blue Monkey " , I knew I was n't in for any big Hollywood movie . I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this cheese - ball flick , who always does a good job in whatever role he tackles .... The FX are pretty corny , there is n't too much of a plot , and I 'm still not sure why this movie is called Blue Monkey , because there is nothing in this movie to do with monkey . But come on people , what did you expect ? ? It 's not really as bad as it seems .... If you enjoy the old 50 's style black and white bug attack movies , this one is basically an updated version , without the updates special FX
0 All this dismaying waste of film stock needs is Count Floyd popping up every sixty seconds . Somehow they got Steve Railsback , Susan Anspach , John Vernon , and Joe Flaherty together on a set and could n't get within five miles , about eight kilometers , of an actual movie . BOY does this thing suck . There is n't one original line , thought , shot , or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close . The magical , ethereal Susan Anspach of Five Easy Pieces - boring . Steve Railsback - boring . John Vernon - boring . The big bug - boring . If this is a scary movie , Buttercream Gang is a thuglife documentary . < br /><br />Seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness . Usually it 's in the opening credits - " Written , Directed , and Produced by " one guy . Or at the very center of the action is some bimbo so talentless that you know there 's one and only one reason this turkey got made . Here , you do n't find out till the very last of the credits , where the cooperation of about a dozen subfunctions of the Canadian Government is gratefully acknowledged . < br /><br />Right now I 'm watching MST 's take on Beast of Yucca Flats to get the taste out of my mouth . Ghod , what an improvement .
0 Now , it would be some sort of clich√© if i began with the bit about the title , so i 'll wait on that . First , this movie made me wonder why kids do stupid things like wander around in labs and break bottles . Then i realized it , this is a movie with a message , that message is beat kids and things like this wo n't happen . Things like what you ask ? Things like a giant insectish monster growing up and causing a bit of mayhem before dying in the typical " kill the monster indirectly " fashion . Now , as promised ... Blue Monkey ... has nothing Blue in it nor any Simian of any kind . Now it snot like i was cheated or anything . The picture on the cover had a giant bug / crab / idiot / thing on the front chasing some screaming nurses . That kinda happened but i wanted apes ! having just enjoyed MOST EXTREME PRIMATE a few nights before(half drunk on Cask and Creame 's brandy mind you ) i was in the mood for more monkey hijacks 80 's style . Not so much . If you like snow boarding apes or blue things this movie is not for you . If you like bugs and good reasons to hit kids , rent this .
0 Blue Monkey ( 1987 ) or ' Invasion of the BodySuckers ' as it 's known here in the UK was a pretty boring horror movie about an old man who gets bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant ! ! ! ! The man gets rushed to hospital , where this worm like creature comes out of his mouth , of course this transforms into this insect monster and proceeds to go on the rampage ! ! Despite Steve Railsback and John Vernon being in the movie , i found it to be boring , with a flat predictable storyline , un - interesting characters , cheap special effects and lack of action ! ! ! ! Horror fans do n't really need to track this rare movie down , you wo nt be missing much trust me ! ! ! I give this movie 2/10 .
0 An older man touches a flower in his wife 's greenhouse that seems to be wilting . He gets pricked by it , or bitten by something on it . He quickly becomes ill , and at the hospital spits out a large writhing white larva of some kind . A later attempt to resuscitate him with paddles results in a splatter of blood.<br /><br />A cop is at the hospital because his partner got badly hurt in a shoot - out . Somehow the cop gets paired up with one of the female doctors , as well as an entomologist who is brought in . There are several young kids wandering around the hospital , who I suppose we 're supposed to find adorable , but who are extremely annoying little brats . They happen to wander into the room where the specimen is being kept , and happen to dump a growth hormone on it . Horror movie logic would say they deserve to die for this , but they 're never even in any danger.<br /><br />The critter grows and starts breeding . People run away from it , and sometimes towards it for some reason . The hospital gets surrounded by military who are prepared to destroy everything if need be.<br /><br />There are no really compelling characters in the movie , and most of the time it seems like people are searching around for the monster . It was fairly boring . Clearly it owes something to the Alien movies , with the monster being born inside a human and having several stages of its growth . There 's also a character named Bishop , and the lead actress has Sigourney Weaver 's hair .

0 This movie is a mess , but at least it 's not pretentious . The box art for the video markets it as a " fun throwback " to 1950s giant bug movies . In reality , it 's a transparent bargain basement ripoff of " Aliens".<br /><br />The producers clearly wanted to make an " ALIEN " picture , but they must n't have had much money . In fact , it does n't look like they had ANY money , really . I hope everyone got paid who worked on this thing.<br /><br />The basic plot is retained -- group of people isolated with murderous insectoid creature -- and an earthbound location is inserted for budgetary reasons , I presume . Instead of setting the film in space , where no one can hear you scream , they set the film in a hospital , where everyone can see your budget laid bare . The amusing thing about " Blue Monkey " ( and there is only one thing amusing about it ) is , the filmmakers did n't abandon the " ALIEN " aesthetics . Even though we 're in a hospital , we still have an improbably cavernous annex where science fiction experiments are being conducted , in this case the venerable " growth hormone " plot device . The annex also doubles as a boiler room ( or something ) , so we can have an explanation for the monster seeking out the warmth . The boiler room is so large that it is laced with multi - leveled steel catwalks , perfect for allowing slime to drip down between the slats.<br /><br />The idea is that a man working in a greenhouse is attacked by a drooping flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location . He touches it and says " Ow " , so we know he 's been hurt . The cut on his finger causes him to lapse into unconsciousness in a matter of minutes , and at the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth ( I guess in an " ALIEN " picture this would be called the " mouthburster " ? ) . The worm is isolated , but some naughty little kids ( leukemia patients ) sneak up on it and " accidentally " give it some experimental growth hormone . You know everyone 's in trouble when some fornicating hospital staff workers are attacked by a camera on a crane , and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some obligatory cocoons , right before he 's grabbed by a pair of semi - convincing insectoid arms . The rest of the movie is dominated by the semi - offscreen monster , semi - obscured by the semi - darkness.<br /><br />Which brings us back to " ALIEN " . How , you ask , can a movie set in a hospital incorporate all those flashing strobe lights that are always in the " ALIEN " movies ? No problem ... a power outage ( or something ) causes the electrical system to go awry , which apparently causes strobe lights to blossom in every room of the hospital and flicker constantly throughout the movie . This doubles as a convenient cloak for the less - than - special effects ( although the bugs are pretty neat looking , they do n't move too well , and the baby bug looks charmingly like a Cootie toy).<br /><br />OK , so what " ALIEN " bases have n't we covered ... OH , water dripping down the walls ! Check ... we'll divide the massive hospital into two parts , then send some of the characters through the damp , drippy basement to get to the other side . Problem solved , we now have the opportunity for numerous " foreboding tunnel " shots . And do n't forget the fog ... well , you never really need an excuse for this in horror movies , do you ? OK , maybe inside of a hospital you do , so we 'll create smoke by having lots of things spark & burn.<br /><br />I have n't said anything about the negligible acting , not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow . I take it " Blue Monkey " was supposed to be lighthearted and fun , and if so then it is a nice try , but the pieces do n't come together and the movie ends up being a real drag . See a film called " Return of the Aliens : The Deadly Spawn " if you want to see a film of this type that gets it right , with even less money and even more marginal acting talent . This one falls flat on its ALIEN .
0 This was the worst MTV Movie Awards EVER ! ! ! I barely laughed , none of the presenters were funny , the hosts really sucked , and the parodies were n't so great either . Why ca n't we go back to the good olden days when the show was a riot ?
0 I usually check out the MTV movie awards to watch a witty , entertaining show that delivers a unique award show ( Chewbacca winning a life - time achievement award as example ) . So this year was no different . While I 'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake , Seann William Scott has always been funny - albiet stupid - to me . I 've laughed at Stiffler in both American Pie movies , and even enjoyed him in Dude Where 's My Car ? . But the MTV movie awards were simply horrible . Nothing was coherrent , humorous , or entertaining . Justin Timberlake should stick to singing and dancing ; he sure as hell ca n't act.<br /><br />I'm curious as to who the writers were for this show . Last year 's performance by Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremly funny ( The Lord of the Rings parody alone was worth watching the entire show ) , but this year was completly different . Did anyone understand Timberlake 's comments regarding Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ( " They 're staring in a movie together , but have never met ! Here they are ... " ) Where was the joke ? Kate and Luke just went into their lame dialogue , never making a reference to the " joke " by Timberlake . And Seann was completly wasted as a talent , not even causing me to smile , yet alone laugh . And what was the point of Harrison Ford 's one - liners ? Did they make ANY sense to anyone ? Perhaps the MTV writers figured the young viewers would only know the aging Ford as Han Solo , Indiania Jones , or the President from Air Force One . I 'm baffled . And would someone tell me the deal with Adrian Brody ? How old is this guy and how old does he THINK he is ? The guy looks 30 , trying to act 19 again .... give it up , show some class ( like in your best actor academy award speech ) and act your age!<br /><br />I give this show 1 star out of 4 , simply because of the speech by Gollam for Best Visual Performance . This was very creative , extremely well done , and caused the only genuine laugh of the entire evening .
0 The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy movies . They have always been ready to destroy cities by huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere . The problem is they have never had the money to succeed in making convincing special effects . This film , released in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace , is no exception . Its ambition is to show three creatures from the giant octopus to the giant lobster trying to have the upper hand on the humans . It 's extremely awkward and laughable , but well quite enjoyable too . After all , we do like these creatures and these films after all , do n't we ?
0 How can such good actors like Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet could have been involved in such a ... a ... well , such a thing ? I ca n't get it . It was awful , very baldy played ( but some of the few leading roles ) , the jokes are dumb and absolutely not funny ... I wo n't talk more about this movie , except for one little piece of advice : Do not go see it , it will be a waste of time and money .
0 I completely agree with the other comment someone should do a What 's up tiger Lily with this film.<br /><br />It has to be one of the worst french films I 've seen in a long time ( actually along with Brotherwood of the Wolves , 2 horrendous films in a much too short period of time).<br /><br />It 's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun . Antoine DeCaunes in particular and Jean Rochefort being among my darlings , I was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor film.<br /><br />Lou Doyon is quite bad , as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they do n't necessarily give you talent.<br /><br />avoid this film , if you want to laugh watch an Alain Chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN .
0 After watching the first 20mn of Blanche(sorry I could n't take more of it ) , I have now confirmed she does not . < br /><br />Basically , this " movie " is an insult to the real french actors participating in this farcical piece of junk . It starts from a concept successfully used in French comedies ( " Deux heures moins le quart avant Jesus Christ " , " La Folie des Grandeurs " , ... ) : a historical movie with anachronic tone / dialogues . This can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a " finesse " of direction avoiding the dreaded " heavy comedy " stigma.<br /><br />Unfortunately , the horsey - faced Lou Doillon ruins everything and Blanche , instead of a comedy , just turns into an horror movie . Horror to cinephiles who want to be puzzled and shocked watching fine actors such as Decaune , Zem or Rochefort struggling in the middle of this gaudy burlesque kitchy - prissy farce .
0 I went to see this a few days ago , and it 's hard to forget that film ... for the wrong reasons . This film is supposed to be funny , it 's not , not a single laugh in the theatre ( perhaps for jos√© garcia and g√©rard Depardieu ) , and it 's boring , boring , boring . It was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying . They just talk to fast and do n't open their enough for us to understand . I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny " what , what did he say " , and i 'm french . I hate to say that , given the fact that i think good films are made here , but i apologise in advance for all foreigners who will go see the film ( if ever shown outside of France ) .<br /><br />We're deeply sorry for that cr@p . 2/10
0 This is one of the worst movies I saw ! I dunno what are the reasons for shoting suck a crap . Do n't waste your time watching this . Good actors , but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues . Hope there 'll be no Blanche 2 :-) Avoid this movie by all means !
0 Avoid this one , unless you want to watch an expensive but badly made movie . Example ? The sound is good but the dialogue is not clear - a cardinal sin in a French film.<br /><br />This film attempts to combine western , drug intrigue and ancien regime costume epic . What ? Well , consider this . The cowboy music is hilarious during sword fights . Or how about the woman in her underwear , holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed?<br /><br />Someone should do a ' What 's Up Tiger Lily ' on this bomb . Rewrite the script and then either dub or subtitle it . Heck , it 's almost that now . ( BTW , Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet , both known to American audiences , have roles . )
0 Sorry , but every time I see a film wherein a woman sucker - punches a man and the man does nothing but cower , the film looses all credibility . So the new ( female ) Starbuck immediately tainted the plot before it even got off the ground ( no pun intended ) . Dirk Benedict was so much more plausible as the sensitive hero - type than the new - age Kattee Sackhoff-- whose overacting will probably be henceforth lauded as " a compelling , exciting , must - see , ground - breaking performance , " by the politically correct new - speak of today 's review copy editors ; but in essence , it is just a tired , old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a townhouse : the biggest clich√© on screens today . I may give this series one more shot , but human caricatures alone will not keep me tuned in . As James Hilton once bemoaned , " A story , please ; just give me a story . "
0 I fail to see the appeal of this series ( which is supposed to be sci - fi ) . It 's really just " let 's see what soap operatically happens this week " and oh , the Cylons are involved through flashbacks.<br /><br />The Cylon " babe " that keeps nailing the other guy is pretty lame , it 's pretty obvious that T&A was added to the show . Every time she pops up I 'm bewildered as to WTF is supposed to be going on . And do n't even try to bullsh*t me about " story arcs".<br /><br />It 's a soap opera with some CGI thrown - in . This is not science fiction aside from the original premise.<br /><br />This series is not everything it 's worked - up to be . If you like trendy , edgy , dodgy , jumpy , vague editor - on - crack camera work , this show might be for you . Since nerds seem to be raving about this show , it 's a clear indication that vocal nerds ' opinions have been changed from Picard 's TNG .
0 I have yesterday seen the second part . And I must say , it was actually better then the first one . At the begin , I realized , It is actually a sequel , not a remake but not a good one . I do not like the old movies and series of Galactica , because the cylons saw like toasters ( just as it was mentioned in this new movie ) and were completely harmless for the old galactica . This movie turns the sides - the Humans were harmless but the whole movie was for me completely chaotic and stupid . Many scenes were unnecessary , for instance the story of the " computer expert " - completely a crap . If I were a scriptwriter I would leave him die in his house , killed by the cylon woman . And the evacuation from the planet ? Oh , please if it would be bombed by 50 Megatons ( why exactly 50 MT ? ? ) nukes , they would be dead killed by the radiation . And how is it actually possible that the big fleet of cylon was completely hidden before the attack ? Aha , it was possibly this computer virus , created by the cylon - the script was probably written by ten - years - old school boy . The good side of the movie is , that the humans are at last defeated ! ! Really defeated , the population is near the extinction ( children are dieing - two times explicit in the movie : 1 . a baby ! ! ! maybe one month old and a girl in age of max ten - what a violence ... ) . And the bad - asses won and I think it is the first time in such sci - fi galaxy fight movie . I also appreciate the design of the cylons ( not only of the humanoid cylon:- ) a good job with these ships - I like the design of the ships by both of them - human an cylons . The human ships are a good never version of the old ones . And galactica - really pretty with these docks , I liked that . But this is all , only the design is not enough . The acting was really bad , the whole plot was expectable ( only two things not - the human - cylon on the ragnardocks and the human - cylon at the end).The dialogs were trivial ( and in the Slovak dabbing just stupid , but that is not fault of the movie ) . The whole movie looked like a pilot film for a series , but who would shoot such series ? What it would be about ? One star for the design the second one for the near extinction of humanity .
0 Rating : 4 out of 10<br /><br />As this mini - series approached , and we were well aware of it for the last six months as Sci - Fi Channel continued to pepper their shows with BG ads , I confess that I felt a growing unease as I learned more.<br /><br />As with any work of cinematic art which has stood up to some test of time , different people go to it to see different things . In this regard , when people think of Battlestar Galactica , they remember different things . For some it is the chromium warriors with the oscillating red light in their visor . For others , it is the fondness that they held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time . Many forget the state of special effects during the late 70s , especially those on television . For some the memories resolve around the story arc . Others still remember the relationships how how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges that they faced.<br /><br />Frankly , I come from the latter group . The core of Battlestar Galactica was the people that pulled together to save one another from an evil empire . Yes , evil . The Cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race yet they did it . While base stars were swirling around , men and women came together to face an enemy with virtually unlimited resources , and somehow they managed to survive until the next show . They did n't survive because they had better technology , or more fire power . They survived because they cared for and trusted each other to get through to the next show.<br /><br />The show had its flaws , and at times was sappy , but they were people you could care about.<br /><br />The writers of this current rendition seemed to never understand this . In some ways he took the least significant part of the original show , the character 's names and a take on the story arc and crafted what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction . Since that was their goal , they can be judged on how well they accomplished it : failure . It was far from a reinvention . In fact it was in many ways one of the most derivitive of science fiction endeavors in a long time . It borrows liberally from ST : TNG , ST : DS9 , Babylon 5 , and even Battlefield Earth . I find that unfortunate.<br /><br />Ronald D. Moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade , and has made contribution to some of the most popular television Science Fiction that you could hope to see . One of the difficulties that he appears to have had was that there could be no conflict in the bridge crew of the Enterprise D & E. That was the inviolable rule of Roddenberry 's ST : TNG . Like many who have lived under that rules of others who then take every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority , Ron Moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons he learned under the acknowledged science fiction master : Gene Roddenberry . Here , instead of writing the best story possible , he has created a dysfuntional cast as I have ever seen with the intent of creating as much cast conflict as he could . Besides being dysfunctional , some of it was not the least bit believable . Anyone who has ever been in the military knows that someone unprovokedly striking a superior officer would not get just a couple of days " in hack , " they could have gotten execution , and they never would have gotten out the next day . It would n't have happened , period , especially in time of war.<br /><br />The thing that I remembered most of Ron Moore 's earlier work was that he was the one who penned the death of Capt . James Kirk . He killed Capt . Kirk , and , alas for me , he has killed Battlestar Galactica .
0 The most horrible retelling of a great series . It should not have been named Battlestar Galactica , because it 's only the same in name alone . Too many changes to just have changes . You have characters turned from male to female , black to asian to cylon all in a way to " attract female audiences , " when there was already strong female characters that could have just been made stronger . Gone are the egyptian feeling . Gone are the quest for earth . The lack of cylons to go to terminator rejects takes away from the film , especially when one is made a fembot . Granted the original show had a lot of cheese to it , but it had a large following . They tried to hold onto this following but give the fans nothing to work with and basically spit in their face as they make it " their own story . " Changes are good , when they make something better , not to just make them .
0 Do n't you just hate it when you order steak but the restaurant gives you chicken?<br /><br />Such is how I felt watching this so - called " Battlestar Galactica " . Arguments can be made over its quality but the fact remains , it 's NOT what the fans ordered.<br /><br />Imagine if you were sitting down at that proverbial restaurant I mentioned . You have waited years for them to bring back their famous New York Strip steak which you loved . When your meal arrives , you find they 've applied the name " New York Strip " to a chicken dish . You complain but the waiter merely states " but ze cheeken , ees really GOOD zir " ! Do you really care if the chicken is good ? You wanted New York Strip - a STEAK ! The waiter then explains , " you zee zir , ze chef wanted to to do , as you zay , zomezing NEW . We felt ze cheeken would be more popular zo we gave it the name of our previous delicious deesh " . You ask if you will ever find the original New York Strip on the menu in the future but are informed that because the restaurant HAS a dish called " New York Strip " now on the menu , you 'll never see the original New York Strip - ever again.<br /><br />Such is the case with creating something NEW and slapping the " Battlestar Galactica " namesake on it.<br /><br / > * This mini series is an affront to all fans of the original show ! * < br /><br />It 's a shame the production team put in charge of this new version obviously held contempt for the original . The team put in charge of resurrecting BG should have LOVED the original series - seeking to improve what the fans loved , not try to shamelessly sell this new series by exploiting the Battlestar Galactica name.<br /><br />If SciFi Channel wanted to give us a NEW show , then DO so ! Give it a new name ! Do n't use the name we fondly remember in an attempt to lure in viewers . That effectively robs us of the chance to see any semblance of the original in the future.<br /><br />We have been waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as BG because we LIKED something about the original ! We did n't simply want the NAME and remnants of the basic concept . There are things we LOVED about the original series!<br /><br />Sadly , probably the BEST elements of the original were those which were omitted . Sure , the original BG was imperfect and could have used some updating . This mini series , however , was not an improvement in any regards but the special effects ( which were good but not anything unusual by today 's standards).<br /><br />Many viewers will debate back and forth about the quality of this NEW show but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream.<br /><br />That being said ... I shall offer some comments about the merits of this new mini by itself ( not in comparison to the original):<br /><br />The battle sequences were the best part . Effort was obviously put into making the effects more " real " in appearance and less " wow - look at that effect " . I would not say these sequences were exceptional by today 's standards yet they were in keeping with made - for - cable original movies . What was the deal with this " pseudo - live - cam " ? Some views tried to fake the effect of a " real " camera with lagging tracking and jerky zooms . However , it was over - used considering there was no apparent SOURCE of these cameras . The infinitely more intelligent series , Babylon 5 , is the only instance I 've seen such " live cams " used effectively , when we were supposedly witnessing action from Security Cams.<br /><br />The script , you ask ? The script felt like it was written by a teenager , FOR other teenagers . The characters felt cardboard and stereotypical . Indeed , the whole story felt pieced together from other well - known stereotypes . The only good features of the entire story were those few elements which were preserved from the original series . It was obviously " dumbed down " for digestion of your average TV audience.<br /><br />The human interaction was pitiful . Rather than drama based on subtle looks , expressions and fine timing , every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious they lost all ability to move any refined viewer . Such was obvious in any interaction between Adama and son . The director must have been trying to make sure the most dense and unfeeling viewer would n't miss it even if not paying attention . Sorry , but real humans do n't behave like the continually.<br /><br />I would n't have considered this a BAD show had it stood on its own . Nothing great ; it will never be revered by true SciFi fans or artisans , but it would be watchable by the masses . I personally could have lived without it , though . I only watched it to see how it really DID capture the spirit of the original . < br /><br />How this mini series will always be remembered is as a symbol of how quality in storytelling has been cast aside to appeal to greater numbers . How even SciFi Channel has " dumbed down " its productions to cater to the masses as opposed to its true niche market , the Science Fiction fans . It will be the time we asked for steak and they insisted on giving us chicken , despite our complaints.<br /><br />I leave you with only one thought - < br /><br />NO " MOORE".<br /><br / >
0 We all knew even before it aired , the Ron Moore mini - series is no Battlestar Galactica . That 's fine . It just means it must stand on its own . It ca n't lean on Battlestar Galactica . If it 's any good , it 's good on it 's own merits , and Ron Moore has something to be proud of . If reports are true , this is what Moore wanted . However , if his mini - series rots , he has shamed all the excellent actors that performed on - screen , not to mention the myriad off - screen personnel . And this is what he 's done.<br /><br />Yes , this mini - series is no remake . I would n't even call it a re - imagining . It 's a new production , inspired by Battlestar Galactica . It does not take place in the Galactica universe , with the same places and jargon and technology . It does n't tell of the Galactica 's search for the thirteenth tribe . Nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that underpinned Galactica . Ron Moore 's mini - series is a space - opera , action flick with a ceremonial nod to Battlestar Galactica.<br /><br />Maybe I should say , " just another " space - opera , action flick . Because as plots go , his has little that 's original , or even interesting . I could relay the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning . But I wo n't inflict that on you . I 'll just hit the most important point . Ready now ? Here it is : Just watch the trailer . It will tell you everything there is in the story.<br /><br />Yes , creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man . ( I guess they forgot Azimov 's rules , again . ) They look like humans , so there 's the whole aliens - among - us thing . At least there 's no time - travel . Oh , and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence . The end result was that when Moore did draw from Galactica , that ceremonial nod , it came off more corny than respectful . I mean , could n't he even think up anything of his own?<br /><br />From the first few minutes , I wanted to watch something else . I did n't care about any of Moore 's characters , since I could n't identify with any of them . This fact hit me in the face when the Cylons began their attack . Armageddon on a planetary scale , and I did n't give a damn . How depressing.<br /><br />Moore 's heroes when faced with an insurmountable obstacle , instead of overcoming it , rather tucked tail and saved their own butts . After all , it was the only way to save humanity , yadda yadda yadda . They took the safe way out , rather than risking their own lives to defend others . At least disgust is not apathy.<br /><br />But in the end , the Ron Moore mini - series was just activity without purpose , a movie on a treadmill , forever running yet going nowhere . And I just wanted it to be over . And by the time it was over , my life - force had been sucked from me . Against my own will , I was turning into a mindless , soulless zombie , probably of the type to which this mini - series would appeal . I needed to replenish myself . I needed to - and I swear this is true - I needed to watch an episode of Babylon 5 . Two episodes , in fact , and I felt much better . And happier .
0 After a lively if predictable opening bank - heist scene , ' Set It Off ' plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink . This is a movie that deals in nasty , threadbare stereotypes instead of characters , preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting , and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought , wit or feeling . In short , it 's no different from 90 % of Hollywood product . But it 's the racial angle that makes ' Set It Off ' a particularly saddening example of contemporary film - making . Posing as a celebration of ' sistahood ' , the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating Afican - American ' gangsta ' stereotype . The gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag . Not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all African Americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the Man , it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else . Worse , ' Set It Off ' exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure . Serious race - related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery , then they 're ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished , the LAPD turns out to be a bunch of caring , guilt - ridden liberals ( tell that to Rodney King ) , and aspirational ' good ' sista , Jada Pinkett Smith , follows the path of upward mobility out of the ' hood and into a world of middle - class self - indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank - manager boyfriend . ' Set It Off ' illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film , pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the ' hood while all the time despising it . While the likes of ' Shaft ' and ' Superfly ' in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well - worn plots , they had a freshness , an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch . ' Set It Off ' would n't be worth getting angry over if was n't a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of African - American film - making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s .
0 An interesting idea ( four African American women crushed under society 's boot heel take their revenge by robbing banks ) is ruined by F. Gary Gray 's horribly slow direction and an excruciating script ( by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier ) full of unintentionally funny moments . Instead of delivering a pointed commentary about the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men cruelly abuse and humiliate them , Gray , Bufford and Lanier prefers to pummel their unsuspecting audience with highbrow notions of operatic tragedy . It 's melodrama at its worst . Gray has his actors linger over every tired line and John Carter 's lazy editing refuses to pick up the slack , choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the performers ' bemused faces . And bemused they are : although actors such as Jada Pinkett , Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have some raw talent ( Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress she 's an excellent rapper ) , they need a surer hand than Gray 's to guide them and as a result they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera . Steer clear .
0 Without a doubt one of the worst movies I 've seen in recent years . The story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with . It 's tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions . Oh no , the cops are on to us , they know who we are , what do we do? ... Let 's rob one more bank then we 're outta here ! What ! ? ! Every character is a stereotype and it 's easy to tell who 's gon na end up dead .
0 I watched this film a long time ago ( aprox 10 years or so ) and liked it then . I remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again . The second time around was not pleasant . The acting is ' so , so ' , the plot is illogical , unreasonable and predictable.<br /><br />The acting ... I'm sure it was n't a stretch for those actresses to play those characters . The plot ... there 's no way in hell those women would have gotten away with the first robbery much less the 2nd . ( side note : Why did TT not realise that even if she came up with a load of money for her court date they would ask where she got it and she would have no logical answer ! Ding , Ding ... we have a crook ! ) . It horribly stereotyped black women in saying basically that the only way black women can ' beat the system ' or obtain a large amount of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources . It plays too much on sympathy b / c all of them die in the end ( bar Jada ) but it 's not sad ( you 're thinking ' They were so stupid ; they deserve to die ) . You just do n't really care about the characters unless you 're a shallow person.<br /><br />I ca n't believe this film rates over a 5 .
0 Thomas Archer ( Ron Eldard ) has his child killed and his wife viciously attacked in a home invasion . Dr. Heller ( Christopher Plummer ) tries to help him through the post traumatic stress . Then Archer finds himself confronted with a man ( Til Schweiger ) bound and gagged to a chair . He is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes to him . And there 's a large assortment of instruments there to help him ... <br /><br />Film is interesting at first ( and shows real restraint in terms of blood and gore ) but gets stupider by the minute and has some highly unlikely plot twists and turns . It all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that I was shocked anyone would actually think of using it anymore . How such talented actors like Eldard , Schweiger and Plummer got involved in crap like this is beyond me . This gets three stars for the acting but the stupid plot and truly unbelievable twists make this a chore to sit through .
0 The premise of the film is that Thomas Archer 's son was murdered and his wife was brutalized -- and he is given a chance at revenge when ( after Post Traumatic Stress Disorder therapy ) , he is put in a room with a man strapped to a chair and told this was the culprit . He is given a large table of implements with which to offer retribution : drills , bats , nails , sledgehammers , torches , whatever you can think of that someone could possibly want to use to physically hurt another human being.<br /><br />We go way too many scenes of torture before we figure out that The Man Archer is torturing is not the man who committed the crime . The two then create an uncomfortable alliance ; who put them in this situation and why.<br /><br />Well , when all is said and done , we do n't really care ...
0 This movie is deeply idiotic . A man wants revenge for a crime- but when he enacts his revenge- there is a video camera pointed right at him the entire time . What man with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do this for so long in front of a video camera?<br /><br />Just the fact that this script could never even happen except with someone unable to dress themselves destroyed it for me- but it got dumber!!!<br /><br />I am thinking the script writers have some serious habits that are cooking their brain cells and making them miss plot holes you can drive an battalion of armored tanks through.<br /><br />PLOT : a man seeks revenge for the death of loved ones , but in the middle of the plot something goes totally wrong , and then the unexpected unfolds.<br /><br />If only these people writing this story had n't been so dumb as to write totally unrealistic plot turns that could never happen this way . To the writers I say- seek help for your serious mental problem .
0 This thing is really awfull . There¬¥s no charachter with weight , they¬¥re all floating around in the BG¬¥s . The Motion Capture is a fine toy , but this movie demostrates that you really need people who knows animation to do an animated film . THE MACHINE CAN¬¥T DO ANYTHING WELL BY ITSELF . If you see it as a bizarre film , you¬¥ll have fun finding mistakes of continuity ... IN A 3D MOVIE ! ! ! It¬¥s funny to watch the princess dress move around like a thing with diferent phisics . You need animators and 3D animators , not data - entries whom know 3D programs . Note the junctions , like the elbows , how they lost volume and get deformed . The person who made the charachter design ( a very good one ) sufered for sure when he / she watched them move , ¬¥ cos you can¬¥t say they come to life .
0 This movie is not only boring , it is also really badly done . The graphics are so bad , they are not even second rate - they are dreadful . The characters do not show any facial expresssions , the voice acting is empty and without any soul , and the plot absolutely lacks .... well ... anything and everything . My 5 year old likes it - but thinks it 's a bit boring . I agree with him .
0 When you have two tower house of performers pitched against each other , the least you can expect is the superb camaraderie and that is the case in this film where we have a 64 yrs old Amitabh Bachchan romances a 34-yr old Tabu . Wait ! In fact that is all there in the name of plot therefore instead of " cheeni " it is the content that is " Kum " in this Adman turned Writer - Director R. Balki 's maiden effort .. <br /><br />Trust the two senior actors to bring the house down with their wise - cracks and bitter - sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional pair , and that is all you find in slow but refreshing first half . The locales of London as captured in rainy season are captivating . By the end of first half , romance completed and mission accomplished . There is not much left to be said . Therefore in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of girl 's father to the extent that he goes for a Satyagrah is really a test of patience . There is an equally strange climax about how he gives in . The result , second half is dry , flat with no energy . There is a subplot with a girl child dying of cancer , not making much impact . Nonetheless , the film is recommended for its fresh approach and the performances .
0 R Balki tries to tell you a story that had been earlier told by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd in a sensuous way . This time it is mixed with mature humors.<br /><br />Amitabh Bachchan is a Chef and owns an Indian Cuisine in London . He is very dominating and arrogant and respects his job just like any other job . According to him , Cooking is an art . Still can not make Hyderabadi Biryani properly.<br /><br />Enter Tabu who sends her the proper Hyderabadi Biryani made by her and they soon starts meeting up and finally falls in love with each other ¬Ö  Amitabh is 65 and Tabu is 35 ¬Ö . No probs ! But one Hitch ! Tabu 's father Paresh Rawal ! ! The couples decide to meet the father for the approval of their marriage . But Amitabh realizes that Tabu 's father is much younger to him . And the complications begin ¬Ö  Performance wise all three actors are brilliant . The script of the film is very tight and interesting . The dialogues of the film are catchy . But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled . The comedy is sometimes not properly understood . The film also tries to go lengthy at some parts.<br /><br />Musically nothing much to sing about except the Title Track . The camera - work is good . Director R Balki could have given much better from this script . But in the second half he himself looks confused . The " Satyagrah " scene of the father looked irritating . But the lines spoken by Amitabh Bachchan during that scene are clap worthy.<br /><br />On the whole , Cheeni Kum needed to have more sugar !
0 In this movie , the old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman , again . He meets her in his restaurant . The younger woman , Tabu , flirts with him . He does not know what to do and asks her out . Her reaction on his invitation is rather weird . Is was supposed to be funny.<br /><br />And that annoys me about this whole movie . It was n't that funny . The jokes and script was terrible ! The only jokes I liked was about the teeth of a waiter , but after a several times , even that began to bore.<br /><br />Amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy . This was a weird relationship ! A little girl with the mind of an old woman ! It was frightening ! I know someone can be attached to a kid , but this man has adult conversations with this child . It did not make any sense.<br /><br />Tabu 's father is Paresh Rawal . He has to give Amitabh a hard time , but we all know Paresh , he ca n't do that . So even the conversation at the end , when they sit all around the table , even that was supposed to be funny.<br /><br />I only like movies who really are funny . I suppose I will never watch this movie again .
0 The subject this latest adman - turned - movieman tries to tackle in his debut ( ad)venture is quite an age - old topic of discussion by almost any cultural standard -- timeless romance ( pun intended).<br /><br />However , the exploration ( and exploitation for Desi auds ) falls woefully short as the usual inclinations to ' pepper , spice and sugar ' up the usual masala mix of b / g score , dialog , dance , drama , etc creates a nice - looking package with not much inside.<br /><br />In the first 40 minutes of the movie , the kitchen scene has been repeated at least 8 - 9 times . Further repeats follow thru - out the movie ( after all the lead character 's a cook ) . But therein lies les problemos -- no story ! Hah , no wonder . Someone forgot to write a script.<br /><br />Amitabh puts in a Cheeni Jyada ( more ) amount of over - acting . Really when is this guy ever gon na stop ? ? How many 60-somethings prance around like that even when teased by a nubile 30-something ? ? ? Timeless mind yes , but surely what about the not - so - ageless bod ? And sole ? Sorry , soul ? ! Reasonably good acting by Paresh Rawal who has the only sensible role in the film . The director lacks any sense of realism getting all caught up in his new - fangled discovery of a hot new idea . Nowhere are we presented with any real - life problems or issues such a pair might face , other than actually getting married which is only the initial obstacle . The sub - plot of a little kid with cancer ( the bachelor boy 's first love ) goes nowhere and whatever little bit of poignancy this otherwise insipid presentation would have evoked is quickly killed off along with the girl 's character.<br /><br />Anyway , nice try but not quite there yet .
0 well i do n't know what people saw in this movie i do n't know . < br /><br />i saw this movie yesterday and i got a severe headache . other than few good dialog there is nothing in this movie.<br /><br />the big b rt now is preaching to fall in love with girls of half of you age . < br /><br />i did n't like the movie at all . i wanted to give 1 rating but giving 3 as < br /><br />i like the role of the small girl who is called " sexy " by AB . my word " DONT WATCH" < br /><br />save your self donot watch this movie.<br /><br />save time and money .
0 Was this a comedy or was it a drama ? I begin this review by asking this question because the film that I just witnessed , Hollywood Shuffle , was neither funny or rather dramatic . While it tried so hard to make a point , because of this lack of definition ( comedy or drama ) , the clever themes and pointed remarks were lost . While I am a strong believer that there is too much racial profiling happening in Hollywood , even today , I do not believe that Townsend 's directorial debut did much to stop it . Instead , I feel it only added more fuel to the fire . Townsend 's comic timing in this film was disastrous due to the fact that the elements he was supposed to be making fun of , he was instead promoting and vice versa . The parts that were supposed to be serious were somehow destroyed by the poor lack of funny comedy . Townsend had a decent concept with this film , but sadly the execution is what ultimately hurt this film . If you watch the preview before the film ( which I constantly do ) , you will immediately get the wrong impression of what you are going to see . The preview gives the impression of a very intelligent , comic film that prides itself on the intelligence of the viewers , but the actually film could not be further from the truth.<br /><br />The main problem with Hollywood Shuffle is not story itself ( because it is lacking in elaboration ) ; it is Townsend 's direction . He had a wonderful concept with this film . Exploit the Hollywood that exploits our race . Decent idea , but why could n't he execute it very well ? The first reason is that his ideas are too random and sporadic . The structure of this film was like watching a heart attack on a monitor at the hospital , we are literally everywhere without any warning or map . It was obvious that Townsend had quite a bit to say , but only a short amount of time to do it in . So , instead of defining his characters , developing his themes , and actually creating a smart film , he just throws it all together and prays that it works . Sadly , it does n't . Instead of a smart comedy , we have a hodgepodge of so many ideas , comedic skits , and underused actors that this film goes from decent to nearly unwatchable . What hurts Townsend the most are his brief , attempt to be funny , interruptions throughout the film . From battling a villain known as Jerry Curl to parodying Siskel & Ebert , Townsend 's attempt to poke fun while speak a message about the film industry falters . This is because these small intermittent skits actually distract from the central focus of the film and actually destroy internally . While Townsend seems to be trying to make a joke about life in Hollywood , he actually is simply connecting to every stereotype and clich√© in the book . What could have been beautiful satire transforms into simply generic humor that never quite stands apart from the rest.<br /><br />So , if you find yourself not laughing at the humor of this story , perhaps there is some comfort in knowing that some of the Wayans brothers are around to help spice up this dull story . WRONG ! The Wayans are in this film , but Townsend demonstrates that he has the ability to even bring the worst out even in this entertaining family . Definitely in their pre - In Living Color moments , we see that comedy was something that all needed to constantly improve upon . Perhaps it was Townsend 's direction , or just maybe this atrocious story , but these typically funny comedians were obviously underused and ignored when it came to critics of this film . I just thought that with the talent pool that Townsend had to pull from that Hollywood Shuffle would have been funny , bright , and a true stab at this obvious Hollywood dilemma . Sadly , it was none of the above.<br /><br />Finally , I would like to say that this was a workable film . There were some moments ( while they were few and way far between ) that had a smile on my face , the final product just did n't settle well with me . Townsend can be funny , but in this film it just felt like he was playing against himself , instead of through his personal experiences and troubles . I realize that he was probably speaking the truth , but it never came through as that . Instead , we are threaded through a weak story , which supports itself with idiotic flash clips that may have worked for a sitcom , but surely did n't work for this film . Even for those that comment that this was his directorial debut and that he was learning from this film , I would have to disagree . If you are starting fresh , either have a tight script or defined themes . Townsend had neither of these , and combined with the inability to control his actors , he just failed in a ball of flames.<br /><br />Overall , this was rather disappointing to watch . It reminded me of a grade school Spelling Bee where it is finally your child 's time to spell . The word is tough , but as the first two to three letters come out , you think that it is going to work perfectly , but then there is that random " P " and silent " R " that forces your excitement to come tumbling down . That is how I felt with Hollywood Shuffle . At first , I saw the potential , I saw the theme and the motive behind the picture , but through fuzzy and inexperienced technique and after the first couple of scenes , I experienced that deep fall feeling . Townsend sank his own ship on this one , and I do n't think Hollywood Shuffle will ever re - submerge as a pivotal moment of Hollywood cinema.<br /><br />Grade : * out of * * * * *
0 OK , so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955.<br /><br />I pity the fools who still think so ... Its absolute rubbish.<br /><br />The story is just ... ridiculous . The characters are absurd caricatures - but this film is not meant to satirise , i m sure its meant to be a serious drama is n't it?<br /><br />Dean and others , are too old for their parts . People say Dean is great in this film , and well , maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly could 've . His character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so . But Dean was a 24 year old man when he made this film . Seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a 4 year old boy ... its pathetic.<br /><br />Natalie Wood is gorgeous , but the early scenes at the police station where she is crying and whining are very unconvincing . It sets a bad precedent for the film ... and for the rest of it , you feel like cringing every time one of these badly acted emotional scenes comes along.<br /><br />It may've been good for its time , but , really , its drivel.<br /><br />It must 've just been hype about Dean 's death that has over - inflated the reputation of this film .
0 Relative to other Columbo movies , this can only be rated a 1 ( awful ) . I seriously do not understand what the other reviewers have seen in this appalling train - crash of a film . It was only through morbid fascination that I continued to watch it - to see what bizarre or inept decision the director would make next.<br /><br />Another reviewer suggested that it was Falk 's only directorial outing because it interfered with his acting role . In fact , I think the real reason lies with the studio bosses , who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money . It 's a wonder they did n't murder HIM .
0 I 've waited a long time to see DR TARR 'S TORTURE DUNGEON and after I watched it , I was really disappointed by it . It 's not the Baroque film I expected it to be . The trailer ( which I saw on a Something Weird DVD ) is much better than the entire film , which is remarkably forgettable . There are almost no stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is interesting but it does n't even come close to other Baroque styled movies out there , from Fellini or Jodorowsky . The characters are dull and there 's almost nothing dramatic going on , even though we see rape , crucifixion , insanity , etc.<br /><br />The main problem with DR TARR 'S TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was a talk - a - thon more than anything else . It was almost like watching a book . I just wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something , instead we see / listen to the main characters chit - chat endlessly about dull stuff.<br /><br />A missed opportunity .
0 A stupid rich guy circa about 1800 wants to visit a nearby mental asylum to see how a famous doctor cares for his patients . Despite an initially hostile response , he is soon cordially invited in and given a tour by the good doctor . And , as the doctor shows him about , he talks and talks and talks ! ! ! And as he talks , loonies run amok here and there doing nothing especially productive . While there is SOME action here and there ( and some of it quite disturbing ) , it 's amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing is -- lacking life and energy , which is odd for a horror flick . Even a guy who thinks he 's a chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiresome . The further this tour takes the guest , the more disturbing it becomes until ultimately you realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and are torturing their keepers . Yet again , despite this twist , the film is amazingly lifeless in many places -- particularly when it moves very slowly as a bizarre ceremony is taking place or people are just wandering about the set . Only when the workers from the asylum found in a prison cell , starving , does the film have any real impact . Considering this plot , it sure is hard to imagine making it boring , but the people who made this cheap exploitational film have ! Now with the same plot and competent writing , acting and direction , this COULD have been an interesting and worthwhile film.<br /><br />You know , now that I think about it , this was the plot of one of the episodes of the original " Star Trek " TV show ! You know , the one with " Lord Garth -- Master of the Universe " and Kirk and Spock are held prisoner by this madman and his crazed followers.<br /><br />A final note : The film has quite a bit of nudity here and there and includes a rape scene , so be forewarned -- it 's not for kids . In fact , considering how worthless the film is , it is n't for anyone ! However , with the version included in the " 50 Movie Pack -- Chilling Classics " , the print is so incredibly bad that it 's hard to see all this flesh due to the print being so very dark .
0 Dr Tarr 's Torture Dungeon is about a journalist who travels to an insane asylum to write about a new technique they use with their patients . However , the journalist soon finds out that things are not what they seem to be , and the asylum is being run by the patients , and the doctors are in cages . First of all , some parts of the film are just plain boring and just makes you want to fall asleep , and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons(A guy who thinks he 's a chicken , for instance ) . I have to admit that the story is actually pretty good , but the film itself bombs . The music of the film is really odd and like something you would hear in some insane comedy , and yes , there is a scene involving dancing chicken men , which pretty much made me want to shut off the screen . Watch this film at your own risk ! < br /><br />Rated : R for Violence and Nudity .
0 I read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot . I 'm an open minded guy after all and I ‚Äôve given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks . As the end credits rolled on this one I searched for meaning and something nice to say . Here goes : " This film was mercifully short . " That 's all I got.<br /><br />Okay , Okay . The sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away from the good bits . I did find myself laughing at this film but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd.<br /><br />By the time of the " chicken dance " at the finale I had just decided to tuck and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall . I do n't know what could have salvaged this film . The acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just was n't any way to make it watchable ; not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts . Maybe I should have sparked a doobie or drank a LOT of beer to get the full experience of the film . Either way , I 'm not watching this film again unless I 'm really depressed . Then I can tell myself ‚Äú At least I was n‚Äôt in ‚Äò Dr. Tarr 's Torture Dungeon.‚Äô I ‚Äôm better than those guys . "
0 All the other comments already said what I was going to say , here goes anyway . I thought this was Italian at first , sorry about that , Italy . I was n't bored because I kept waiting for something to happen . Who did that song about Dr. Tarr and Professor Feather way back when ? Was it Alan Parsons ? Saw this on a Brentwood 10 pack and the quality was as expected , terrible . Full of streaks and stuff . The movie was an incoherent mess . Goofy music and clueless characters . The main guy should have known in the first minute that the doctor was nuttier than the patients . I thought the " doctor " directing the " battle " scene was never going to end . Had some good looking babes though . It seems these dumb ass movies always throw in a naked chick or two and that gets you hooked . I gave it a 2 for the nekkid women . That bird people dance made me want to pull out my own eyeballs . Poe probably did about 3,000 rpms in his grave when this thing came out because it was loosely based on a story of his .
0 Although I rated this movie a 2 for showing a complete lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror film it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale . I could n't figure out what was going on in the movie or who the people were but I did n't care because I knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter . Dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but I believe this is because they started filming without a script . The fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile . It does n't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment . I particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks . I believe the doctor refers to this as treatment . Genius !
0 I got this in the DVD 10 pack CURSE OF THE DEAD . You got ta love those bargain packs . For even if they do n't feature true remastering , restoration and all that hoo - ha , and the films are generally in full - frame pan and scan format , there 's no denying that there are always a few gems included . And by " gems " , I mean there 's always some good crap to be seen , especially if the films are from the ' 70s as The Mansion of Madness is.<br /><br />My copy is called Mansion of Madness , but when the title screens roll it 's Poe 's Dr. Tarr 's Torture Dungeon . Does n't matter , really , as crap is crap is crap , no ? Yes ! But saying this film is completely worthless is not true at all . There are some funky elements here and there , and obviously the flick did have a decent budget.<br /><br />The opening title sequence is cool with its colored negative run through a cheap TV look . The dialogue is always hilarious . Near the beginning of the film , the horse and buggy driver gets out to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road . " WHAT STRENGTH ! " says Our Hero . Funny , then , that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun . You 'll completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he crops up again later near the end . That 's how memorable these characters are.<br /><br />The best part about Mansion of Madness , however , has to be the wacky music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure . It 's like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable . And why all the weirdo slapstick , anyway ? I 'd say my fave moment had to be when the horse and buggy is ambushed by the forest freaks when they pull a stupid looking homemade ghost up by a stick in the middle of the road and make the buggy stop . What the hell ? Oh yeah , there 's plenty of boobies to be seen , too , for those of you that dig such things . Boobies , bad dialogue , and wacky music . That best sums of Mansion of Madness for me . It 's well worth at least one viewing , and may be a lot better if you 've had a few to drink or whatnot . I ca n't say I was ever bored watching it , but I ca n't deny that it 's also a barrel of poop . Kinda like Magical Mystery Tour but with a plot , but not . Hmm.<br /><br />And Mr. Chicken PWNZ .
0 I feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk . The portrayal of madmen in this century is always done with them being so totally bizarre as to be a different species . Their antics are so outrageous as to be totally fictionalized . Everyone is Napoleon or some other historical figure ; or they have a fascination with chickens . They are on the make or beating each other up . It 's as if the scriptwriter said , what can I make up for them to do , without an sense of what insanity or even mental illness is . Watch the wonderful human portrayal in " One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest " where the illnesses are believable and real . I once worked in a State Mental hospital . I did n't see any of these guys . These are too smart and calculating to make them come to life .
0 If this movie were any worse , it would have been directed by Uwe Boll . This nonsensical mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock . It has been a while since I have seen this steaming pile , but I do remember that I wanted to do grievous bodily harm to all those involved . How anyone can give this movie any more than 1 star amazes me to the graciousness of all those that viewed this tripe . I give it one star because there is not a rating lower . All copies of this movie should be burned the ground sowed with salt and reserved as a landfill for the most toxic of waste . No , one copy should be kept under ultra hi security and shown only to film makers as an example of how not to do it .
0 Absolutely dreadful Mexican film supposedly based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe about a newsman wanting to go into the confines of an asylum hidden in the woods to write a story about how it works , etc ... When our hero , Gaston , is given the grand show by Dr. Maillard , head of the asylum , we see all kinds of things which are suppose to be horrific , such as men hanging around long in a dungeon , and comedic , such as our hero being joked upon by soldiers as he climbs down a ladder hanging over the side of a building . Then there is one sight which might have been meant to be both : a human man dressed as a chicken , yes , that 's right a chicken , that pecks around the ground for chicken feed . The scene was to be a comedic highlight of the film , but , at least for me , it was the film 's low point and really most revolting when you considered that grown men and women thought this might even be remotely entertaining . Ah ! That is indeed the real horror that is Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Name Changes . And that brings me to this salient fact about the film which is most films that undergo multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem . Yes , this is obvious , but some have distribution problems and others , of which this is one , have numerous title changes so that someone might unsuspectingly buy the same garbage more than once . This is definitely garbage . It has very little going for it . The only performer worth having a look at is Claudio Brook as the head of the asylum . He is one huge slab of ham as he laughs maniacally , bellows orders , sashays with sword in hand , and praises the chicken . I got so tired of hearing him talk about the " soothing system " as his means to cure the mentally sick . What a bunch of ludicrosity(Hey , a film like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word ) . It wo n't take you long to figure out what is going on in the asylum nor will it be any more interesting . Cinematic chicken scratch !
0 The one sheets and newspaper campaign suggested ( as often they did ) a far more lurid and violent piece than showed up on the drive - in screens . Claude Brook is actually an Americanization of Claudio Brook , who worked in films for years . This one 's quite hard to find anymore ; I 'd love to see it again to compare it to other international horrors of the day , but do n't remember particularly impressed way back when . Chances are it was a chopped up version that made it to U.S. theatres and video . But oh , that one sheet ... still a gem of my later horror collection .
0 I went to a prescreening of this film and was shocked how cheesy it was . It was a combination of every horror / thriller clich√© , trying to comment on many things including pedophilia , Satan worship , undercover cops , affairs , religion ... and it was a mess . the acting was pretty washboard ; the kid and the Jesus dude were alright , but apart from them .... Anyways . I admire the effort ( though slightly failed ) on the attempt at showing the Christian people in a different way ... even though they did that , the way it presented the gospel was a bit stock and kiddish . But then again , it may have to be since he was talking to a little kid ... no . actually , I 've decided it 's just all around bad . music ... oh my gosh ... horrible ... toooo over - dramatic . Okay . I felt bad for the people who made this movie at the premier ; It seemed like a poor student project . I 'm going to stop ranting about this now and say bottom line , go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your life on crap . there you go .
0 Body Slam ( 1987 ) is a flat out terrible movie . The low budget reeks , the direction is pedestrian ( at best ) and the writing and acting is lame . But if you 're into old school wrestling ( circa 1970 's through the mid-80 ' ) then you 'll be more entertained than the average viewer . I have to warn you , this movie stinks on ice . I gave it a two because I felt like being generous . This turkey was " directed " by stunt master Hal Needham . The stars are Roddy Piper , The Tonga Kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c - list actors ( Dirk Benedict).<br /><br />The synopsis of this " movie " is about a promoter who wants to combine " hair rock " and wrestling . But their are others that do n't want him to succeed . There 's more but I do n't want to SPOIL it for you . If you can stomach the bad acting and inane storyline , there 's a few surprises near the end for die - hard wrestling fans . < br /><br />I would n't recommend this to my worse enemy ( and I mean it ) .
0 My roommates & I nearly shorted out our TV from the numerous spit - takes we did while watching this hilarious piece of 1970s self important pseudo - zen dreck . I 'd read about this campfest for ages and scanned my local late night TV listings for YEARS in search of this elusive turd . Several years ago our local ABC affiliate was known for showing cool flicks for its late night weekend flick ( ie " Frogs " , " Night of the Lepus " , etc ) . Then one day it happened : at 1:40am on a Saturday night ( over 5 years ago ) there it was ! We had over 15 folks over and the flick did NOT disappoint!<br /><br />See ! Andy Griffith as the silliest & most unthreatening bad guy since Jaye Davidson in " Stargate"!<br /><br />See ! William Shatner sport a variety of things atop his head that only faintly resemble human hair ( or anything organic for that matter).<br /><br />Hear ! jaw droppingly inane 1970s psychobabble that makes " Chicken Soup For The Soul " sound like BF Skinner < br /><br />Feel ! Content that any decade was better than the 70s.<br /><br />For those still reading ... the plot surrounds a bunch of middle class mid level a -- holes who decide to suck up to their s --- head boss ( Griffith ) by joining him on a cross dessert race that spans California & Mexico . They all wear leather jackets , looking more Christopher Street than anything else . Along the way they stop at a Cantina , get drunk , smoke joints ( the sight Robert " Mike Brady " Reed smoke a joint is an image you wo n't soon forget ) , start a fight , attempt rape , and just act like a bunch of suburban middle class jack offs . Although I have an excellent copy that I taped off TV I WISH this one would be released on video so the whole world could enjoy its half baked goofiness .
0 I went for this movie believing it had good ratings . Firstly , it is ridiculous that they 're releasing a movie originally made in 2001 , seven years later in 2008 here in India . Everything in the movie looks dated . Even for 2001 the movie looks like its been made on a shoe string budget . There is a scene where a taxi hits a man to elaborate how low budget you can get . Anthony Hopkins does n't seem to know what he is doing in the film . He ends up giving a long monologue towards the end . If the film had bright sparks during that scene , I missed it as I was sleeping on my seat . Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt resembles a Devil . She wears ill - fitting trite clothes and scowls at random kids . As for Alec Baldwin a scene where he goes to meet Webster for the first time is not to be missed . What a waste of money ! As Anthony Hopkins rightly put it , " Go back home and write better ! "
0 Once again the same familiar story about a man ( writer here ) who sell his soul to the devil in order to have his most desired ambition in life : success . Unfunny script ( we should " go home and write better " ) , ridiculous lines in order to understand the " strong " " Christmanish " message ( our only aspiration in life is to find love , respect and a good friendship ) and a very long trial scene at the end where the agent Hopkins beat the devil ( Jennifer Love Hewitt is no sexy or evil at all ) for all the bad things she made to this unlikable character . Not bad efforts from the actors ( Baldwin also as a director , Cattrall in a " Sex and the City " role again , Aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role ) . P.S. Try also a not so popular film from Greece called " Alloimono stous neous " , a brilliant adaptation of this myth ( an old man give his soul to the devil to get back his youth )
0 I had high hopes for it when I heard that it was being made back in 2001 because I read " The Devil and Daniel Webster " when I was a kid and I found it very interesting . They made some changes to the story that do n't make much sense to me . Daniel Webster in the story was a famous lawyer from New Hampshire in the story . In the movie he is an editor . A lawyer makes more sense since he ends up representing Jabez Stone against the devil him / herself ( he was a man in the story , but was a woman in the movie ) in a trial where both of their souls are on the line . As an editor , it does n't seem likely that Daniel Webster would have the skill to do this.<br /><br />The acting was decent by all except for Alec Baldwin and Dan Aykroyd . These are two actors that I like , they just did an awful job in this movie . It was as though they thought they were acting in a comedy , but the movie was more a serious one than a comedy . This might be partly due to the fact that the movie was filmed with a particular vision in mind , and was then re - edited by somebody else . Given this fact , it 's surprising that it was at all coherent . I was surprised to see a fair amount of SNL cast members in the movie , which further leads me to believe it may have originally been filmed with the intention of it being more of a comedy.<br /><br />All in all I would have to say it was n't completely awful , but it was n't much good . If I could get the hour and a half back and do something else with it , I would . The ending was especially disappointing . As in the original story , Daniel Webster defeats the devil in the trial . Jabez then starts out again at the beginning of the movie ... literally , we are just brought back to the first scene with Jabez , and then the movie abruptly ends . It actually looked as though they just replayed Jabez ' first scene over and called it the end . There is no indication that Jabez has the benefit of any of the knowledge or experience he gained , so who is to say he did n't just repeat his mistakes over again , and perhaps over and over in an endless loop ? It was an extremely disappointing end and did not make a lot of sense . The decent cast , and the acting of everyone except for Baldwin and Aykroyd are the only things that keep this from being a complete and total crap sandwich .
0 This is one of those films that I remember being in the can for years before anything happening w / it . I do n't think it 's terrible , but it 's not really good either . Alec Baldwin was pretty good , but the plot is it kind of flimsy at best . The cast is pretty good in what they 're given , but again you are only as good as the script . Baldwin directing this although I could have sworn he did n't direct all of it , I thought I read somewhere or lots of re - shoots was n't bad but he definitely has some potential in there . Although his work on " 30 Rock " is nothing short of genius & should keep him busy for a little while longer . I just hope the show bows out gracefully a la Seinfeld , but maybe not even that long . 9 years it went . So if you want to see a film that you wo n't get much from , but wo n't really hate either well this is for you . I ca n't remember the last time a film had been wrapped so long before finally being released & only on DVD at that . It was nice to see Alec Baldwin & Anthony Hopkins again together since their excellent yet not much people have seen " The Edge . " Now pick up that excellent film for some real entertainment .
0 I saw this film awhile back ( while working on a trailer for the film 's production company ) and it was TERRIBLE . Hewitt is mediocre at best , Hopkins phones his performance in ( but still blows away Hewitt in their scenes together ) and Alec looks bored . Trust me on this : you should avoid this film like the plague if it ever gets released . It seems to go on forever as the tired plot unfolds at a snail 's pace . It is relentlessly unfunny , the cinematography is crappy and the direction is pedestrian . Alec Baldwin should go to film school if he plans to direct again . In terms of his acting , his character is totally unlikable , which makes it impossible to root for him . Dan Ackroyd is pretty funny and the surprising makeup of the jury near the film 's end is cute , but this film is just plain awful .
0 Believe it or not , " The Woodchipper Massacre " gave me full - blown gonorrhea ! That 's right , I 've got a rainbow of discharge spewing from me just because a group of kids went playing around with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the Devil and got distribution . It 's beyond my comprehension how anyone with moderate intelligence could tolerate this pant - load of a film . The only reason I managed to sit through the whole thing ( not without several suicide attempts along the way ) was because , well first off , I was delirious with boredom , and second - I guess I wanted to further explore this newly discovered type of hate I was experiencing ... This movie is a ' shot - on - video ' " horror / comedy " about three siblings who are left for the weekend in the care of their bitchy elderly aunt . The youngest kid ends up stabbing the old lady accidentally with his Rambo - replica hunting knife . They then get to dismembering auntie with various tools ( apparently she did n't have a single drop of blood in her body ! ) and heave her into their dad 's rented wood chipper ... Her convict son then stops by looking for his mom and the kids end up grinding that jackass too ... I do n't recall ever seeing a cast of annoying actors that actually caused me nausea . Seriously , that one blond chick 's voice had me wincing in pain constantly . ALL of the actors were downright atrocious - literally just screaming their phony sounding dialog and cracking jokes that must 've been written by a chimp that just did n't care ! Now , I can usually appreciate independent efforts , but only from those who can realize that people other than their relatives might be watching this ! I do n't need to see a 3 minute shot of a car pulling out of a drive - way and a torturous , painfully long lawn grooming montage with some ridiculous , fluttery music playing over it . Plus , why the hell does the box of this movie have a bloody piano on it ? ! There WAS a piano in ONE scene and no one is killed near it ! I 'm through with reminiscing about this movie . Unless you like insufferable crap , I would advise anyone with half a brain to avoid this trash .
0 The only reason I even gave it a 1 out of 10 is because the option to give it zero out of 10 was not allowed . This was the biggest waste of time I 've ever endured . For roughly 75 minutes , you are subjected to the WORST acting ( and I do n't mean that in a good way either , like as in KILLER NERD which had great horrible acting ) and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also has absolutely NOTHING to do with a massacre . The reason I even rented this piece of crap was because it has massacre in the title . That said , there was only one killing in the entire movie and it was pretty lame at that . You spend more time watching the kids bickering and doing yard work than anything . Speaking of the kids , the little boy actor is probably the most irritating child actor since bob from house by the cemetery . Did I mention it was shot on video as well ? If you want to throw away money and over an hour of your life , then by all means watch it . But if you savor your hard earned dollars and time , then stray as far away as possible .
0 Saw a trailer for this on another video , and decided to rent when it came out . Boy , was I disappointed ! The story is extremely boring , the acting ( aside from Christopher Walken ) is bad , and I could n't care less about the characters , aside from really wanting to see Nora 's husband get thrashed . Christopher Walken 's role is such a throw - away , what a tease !
0 This movie could have been very good , but comes up way short . Cheesy special effects and so - so acting . I could have looked past that if the story was n't so lousy . If there was more of a background story , it would have been better . The plot centers around an evil Druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines . The movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything , it just keeps plodding on . Christopher Walken has a part , but it is completely senseless , as is most of the movie . This movie had potential , but it looks like some really bad made for TV movie . I would avoid this movie .
0 This is a total waste of money . The production is poor , the special effects are terrible . In my country they had the courage to put this film on video named as " The Mummy " because of the success of Brendan Fraser`s film . I`m sure that you can find better horror movies .
0 This movie is more deceiving than ever , using a suspenseful looking actor like Walken to play in this piece of junk made it look like he had nothing better to do than play a boring role like this one ! And the fact that the movie was supposed to be about some witch and you really do n't see that until almost the end of the movie but meanwhile you have to sit and watch this boring film while it gets , or tries to get to the meaning of the point and you have to go through this whole trail of boring actors and actresses thinking the whole time of how you passed off another movie and decided on this one and how you have just waisted your money just makes the whole point of time useless sitting there . I 'd rather watch cartoons for goodness sakes . Leave this one alone , please !
0 < br /><br />Upon concluding my viewing of " Trance , " or " The Eternal , " or whatever the producers are calling this film , I wondered to myself , " Out of all of the bad movies I could have seen , could n't I have at least seen one that was entertaining ? " Even if a film is not well made in terms of acting , directing , writing , or what have you , it can at least be fun , and therefore worthwhile . But not only is this film bad in artistic value , it 's incredibly boring . For a plot of such thinness , it moves awfully slowly , with little dramatic tension . At the very least , in a low - brow attempt at entertainment , the deaths of the characters could have been cool and/or gory , but the creators of this dreck failed in that department as well.<br /><br />What does this movie have going for it ? Pretty much nothing , unless you get entertainment out of watching Christopher Walken , who is capable of being brilliant , put so little effort into his acting that he falls into self - parody mode ( WHY did he decide to do this film anyway?).<br /><br />I give this film 3/10 , because , God help us , there actually have been worse movies made before .
0 This film takes what could have been a good idea , a mummified 2000 year old witch and completely destroys it . Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry - out . They go to stay with her Nan and Uncle . The uncle has discovered a 2000 year old witch preserved in the peat . He revives her and she takes the form of Nora . She can not be killed conventionally,(more is the pity ) . Nora , however , works out a way to do so.<br /><br />This is a Gothic horror movie that has been done on the cheap . It is a sprawling mess . I have to ask why anyone would want to make such a bad film . I am tempted to learn witchcraft in order to make it disappear.<br /><br />AVOID AT ALL COSTS
0 A young American woman visits her Irish roots and fends off a druid witch who is out to possess her . Sounds intriguing but after an interesting start , I got lost and spent most of the time wondering where it was going . The movie seems to be dithering in two directions -- are we watching the travails of the Irish - American woman battling her alcohol problem or are we watching a straight off horror flick about an evil witch that returns from the past ? The director ca n't seem to decide . The two does n't seem to gel and in the end you get nowhere . This could be so much better done and the story seemed to drag towards the end . This was most boring and disappointing .
0 Well - when the cameo appearance of Jason Miller ( looking even more eroded than he did in Exorcist IV ) is the high point of a picture , what 've you got?<br /><br />It 's a little bit country , a little bit rock n ' roll : mix two drunks with money who drag their kid all over the place with a bog - dried mummy ( have you figured that one out yet - DRIED in a bog ? ) in the basement , Christopher Walken with a bad dye job , and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they 'd developed her.<br /><br />I understand - sort of - that they 're going back to visit her relatives . After that .... <br /><br />Problem : There are several interesting flashbacks to what I must assume is her mother being killed in a car bombing ( I think ) . This is never connected to anything . < br /><br />Problem : What do we need the grandmother for ? Now , the grandmother could be interesting . She speaks Gaelic , or Celtic , or something . Maybe you can make something of her . The best they can do is that she 's got a tobacco habit . That 's all.<br /><br />Problem : They cast a real shifty character as the husband . Is he type - cast ( will he sell his wife to the devil ? Maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her)or is he cast against type ( after all , he has a good haircut and nice clothes ) ? He drinks , he hesitates . He 's not a bad guy . Not a good one . But dislikable . Why did n't they DO something with him?<br /><br />No problem : an old boyfriend shows up . The husband knocks him down . He comes back to knock down the husband . ( It gets pretty stupid , but at least THAT character has motivation . ) < br /><br />NOW - she 's an alcoholic , he 's an alcoholic ; he might only have married her for her money . The grandmother is locked in the bedroom . The blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of a witch ( are you following this ? ) who may come to life . In fact , you KNOW she 'll come to life , the music swells . A little girl lives in the house , takes tea to the grandmother ( unlocks the door to do so ) and provides granny with cigarettes . Periodically , granny gets out . But nothing happens . < br /><br />Husband and wife lose the kid in the house , subsequently lose their bedroom . Uncle gets his throat cut in the basement . The leading lady has nose - bleeds . The husband drinks . They both drink . In the face of all of this , the awful truth alluded to in the first over - voice is - omigod - an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old.<br /><br />In spite of all these dangling - thread ingredients , nobody managed to get a story on the screen . No bridge between situations , no graduation from mild disturbance to awful horror , just long slow scenes that go nowhere.;nbody , really , to care about - and they had places to go with that aspect - the innocent kid in the charge of drunks , the grandmother who might be locked up because she 's a monster , but no , her worst fault is smoking . She 's got great hair , good makeup . < br /><br />In short , no plot . Just a little random ( predictable)violence in a dark library , with the rain gushing in , and the sound track cuing us in . You need more than a few drunks and Christopher Walken to make a movie.<br /><br />The production values were good . Oh . Nice scenery , good wardrobe . The cameraman , at least , knew what he was doing.<br /><br />I bought it . Poor me .
0 I thought that I was never going to find a horror movie as bad as " The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre " , but this film compete with it.<br /><br />I¬¥m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie , but I did it 15 minutes after the Trance started . I woke up , and started to watching it agian . Why did I deserve that ? All the movie was a torture , I have to use fast forward to watch it complete.<br /><br />I can¬¥t stand why one of my favourites actors of all time ( MR . WALKEN ) could done this thing . I have to think that he made the director a favor , or he was really in the need of money , because film after film he is doing , he is ruining himself ; and so fast ... <br /><br />What about the movie ? it¬¥s not scary , stupid plot , characters are awful ( but I really liked the one played by Jared Harris ) , effects are very poor , lack of deaths & blood , etc ; in three words , it has anything . And I mean it . Can¬¥t stand how a director can make a film like this.<br /><br />Anyway , When I got more disappointed was when I saw in the video cover , that the film was presented by " Stephen King " , I think he could never present this crap , no ? ( I rented it in Argentina ) . I not recommend it in a million years.<br /><br />I rate this movie with a 2 out of 10 . ( As I say in my " Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre " review , there will be always a worse movies , that s why it don¬¥t deserves a 1 out of 10 )
0 This is some of the worst acting I have ever seen . I love Almereyda 's Nadja , but this is just absolute dreck . Aside from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music this film is just nonstop bad acting and dumb material . Jared Harris is particularly bad , but no one in this is remotely good . The plot is a joke , but not the haha kind . I do n't even know if you can forgive movies that are this bad . Please erase the last hour and a half of my life . How did this director make Nadja and Another Girl Another Planet ?
0 1st watched 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10(Dir - Michael Almereyda ) : Weird story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter 's body . At least I think that was the relationship . A kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike Stephen King 's The Shining . The difference is that there was campiness in Nicholson 's performance that is n't at all in this film . This is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame one - liners and attempts at litening up the mood do n't work at all . The performances are not the problem here , but the story is . Everything does n't seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film . There is a very small throwaway performance by Christopher Walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which , of course , gives him top - billing in an attempt to sell the film . Do n't buy into this gimmick and avoid this film.<br /><br / >
0 Dooohhh ! My Bwainn Hurrrts ! Well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film . How on earth I managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows . < br /><br />Maybe it 's me!!Maybe I do n't get the premise of the film ... or maybe I do n't appreciate it 's alleged mystical atmosphere . In my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to McDonalds.<br /><br />In addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a Tom & Jerry cartoon . Yaarrrghhh ! Why do I do it ? why do I watch such tripe ? It 's enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the Foreign Legion ! ! YAARGH ! ! An absolutley dreadful film in just about every respect . Apart from that it 's not to bad .
0 I 'm sorry but I did n't like this doc very much . I can think of a million ways it could have been better . The people who made it obviously do n't have much imagination . The interviews are n't very interesting and no real insight is offered . The footage is n't assembled in a very informative way , either . It 's too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features . One thing I 'll say is that Isabella Rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets . All considered , this only gets a ' 4 . '
0 This film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew . Based on Shielah Graham 's autobiography , it seems like the powers that be could n't leave well enough alone . They could n't decide if this was to be Graham 's story or Fitzgerald 's story , and also how much they should soft - pedal whoever 's story it turned out to be . So a film that could have been a story about two fascinating ( Fitzgerald ) and notorious ( Ms. Graham)personalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either . Added to this there is absolutely no period feel other than for 1959 . Clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing . However - and this saved the film for me - Kerr has never looked lovelier , and Peck is as always a very handsome man . They truly make a beautiful , mature couple , and I only wish they had better material to work with . There is one scene that does work - Scott goes after Shielah while in a drunken state , and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs . Other than that , the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other Wald produced soaps of the 1950 ( PEYTON PLACE , THE BEST OF EVERYTHING ) .
0 There is a scene in this film at about the 42 minute mark that is among the worst I have seen in some time . As F. Scott Fitzgerald ( Gregory Peck ) and Sheilah Graham ( Deborah Kerr ) are lounging on the beach , suddenly things become tense and Sheilah begins to cry -- at which point she tells her lover about her sordid past . This " dramatic scene " becomes so terribly overdone and histrionic I could n't help but turn to my wife and exclaim how stupid it all was ... as dramatic music swelled on the television as it all came to a phony crescendo . NO ONE experiences moments like this -- no one . Now how much of the rest of the film is true , I can not say , but this particular moment was laughably bad and as fake as an $ 8 Rolex -- and leads me to assume that some of the other reviewers were correct -- the film is a lot of bunk . However , I am not an expert on the life of these two people and the internet did n't seem to clear this up , either . < br /><br />Just who were F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sheilah Graham and what was their relationship really like ? What I do know about Fitzgerald , however , does seem different from what I saw in the film . Was he the suave and decent man we initially see in the film ? Well , considering he was married at the same time he was carrying on with Graham and drank like a fish , I 'd assume he was n't . Was he as obnoxious and boorish as we later see in the film ? Perhaps , but if he was this bad AND yet Ms. Graham stayed with him , then this makes her out to be a complete dummy -- and not someone you 'd like to see featured in a film . And , if he was n't , then the film does a poor disservice to his memory . Either way , it made for a painful and not particularly pleasant viewing experience.<br /><br />The sum total of this film appears to be a tale of two not particularly likable or healthy people . In a dark and salacious way , some might find this all very entertaining , but most are sure to see this as a train wreck with no surprises along the way ! Unpleasant but with glossy production values ( especially the music , which was lovely but way over the top ) it begs the question " why did they even choose to make this in the first place ? " . The bottom line -- it 's a pretty bad film all around and probably not worth your time -- even if , like me , you are big Gregory Peck fan .
0 Based on a self - serving novel by one - time girl friend and groupie of F. Scott Fitzgerald , gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this trashy story . Gregory Peck carries on in shameless excess as a forceful be - drunk - or - be - damned alcoholic ; in contradiction to the gentle and soft spoken real Scott Fitzgerald . Focusing on Fitzgerald 's Hollywood writing era , late in his life , the much - honored author was , in fact , living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known . Fitzgerald was none - too - proud to be recycling his flapper stories in order to support both his wife ( in a mental hospital ) and his daughter ( in college ) . Living in a small apartment and driving a second hand Chevrolet his life was 180 degrees different than as portrayed in this movie.<br /><br />Virtually every 20th Century - Fox movie made during Daryll F. Zanuck 's leadership , as well as virtually every film directed by Henry King , was a work of excellence . Beloved Infidel was the exception .
0 I m proud to say I 've seen all three Fast and Furious films . Sure , the plots are kinda silly , and they might be a little cheesy , but I love them car chases , and all the beautiful cars , and the clandestine midnight races . And Ill gladly see a fourth one.<br /><br />Wanna know what the difference is between those three and Redline?Decent acting , somewhat thought out plot , even if they are potboilers , and last but not least , directors who have a clue . All three were made by very competent directors , all of them took the films in a different direction , equally exciting . Redline looks like the producer picked out a dozen women he slept with on the casting couch , and made them the extras , then picked up his leads from Hollywood 's unemployment line . And the script . Yikes . Its Mystery Science Theatre 3000 bad . This is 70 's made for TV movie bad.<br /><br />Yeah , the movie had a few cool cars , but you do n't really get to see that many in action , and the action is directed so poorly you ca nt get excited by the chases , and if the cars are n't thrilling you , why go to a movie like this?<br /><br />Im in the audience with a bunch of teenagers , and I ca nt stop laughing out loud . Im getting dirty looks , but this was just a debacle.<br /><br />Rent the F&F movies . Go to Nascar Race . Go to a karting track and race yourself . Whatever you do , avoid Redline like bad cheese .
0 After seeing the previews I felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast & furious series . So , I already expected it to have a lacking storyline , but at least this time it wo n't be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans . Unfortunately , I was wrong . If you could only imagine a Fast & Furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you.<br /><br />This is the absolute worst movie I had ever seen ( I 'm being nice - no I would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said ) . Not only was the storyline non - existent , but the action was crap too . I guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie . For an example , there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a SLR McLaren to win . And after the bit where Eddy Griffin got in a fight with one of his " girls " ( an Imus comment would work in this case ) the girl asks to pull over and get out of the PLANE and of course they do in the middle of the desert . After this wonderful scene I could n't take it anymore . So , I only got to see half of this monstrosity . This is the first movie I had ever walked out on . Afterwards , I had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells.<br /><br />I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option . You 're better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home . I will keep all viewers in my prayers .
0 Whoever wrote up " Redline " as a great car movie must be getting paid off by Daniel Sadek to promote this ultra crappy flaming , steaming pile of amateur crap . Easily the worst automotive movie or any movie ever made . This makes Showgirls look like Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Take every cheesy clich√© out of an 80s action TV series , put in some really crappy special effects and lame characters with no relevance and you have living proof that Daniel Sadek should not write screenplays and produce movies but should remain in the real estate business.<br /><br />This is such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most contrived action sequences ever . What offends me is not that the makers of this film are idiots but that they consider the movie going public to be idiots enough to fall for this crap .
0 Before watching this film I had very low expectations and went to just see the cars . Eventually I even regretted going for that reason . Plot is almost non - existent . Character development is non - existent . So many clich√©s and so much jaw - dropping cheesiness existed in the movie that I could only stare and wonder how it was even released . If not for the exotics , I would n't have even rated this movie a 1 . An attempt at a coherent story line is destroyed by the sheer absurdity of this elite racing cult and the laughable characters that make up its members . In fact , the movie 's plot is so predictable and simple - minded that an average child could foretell the majority of the storyline . Bad acting , bad plot , bad jokes , bad movie.<br /><br />Don't see it . Play Gran Turismo HD instead and it 'll satiate your thirst for fast sexy cars without leaving a bad aftertaste .
0 My Favorite part was when the credits started to roll . I wish I could give it a .0000000000001 out of 10 . I really wish I had that Hour and thirty minutes back . Do n't waste your money or time on it . I really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards.<br /><br />Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie did n't destroy her career . But she chose to be in it.<br /><br />All in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked . More than Kazaam and Glitter combined . That 's saying something.<br /><br />Don't < br /><br />Do < br /><br />it ! ! ! !
0 I registered just to make this comment ( which pretty much echos some of the ones here already ) The acting is worse than subpar , it expounds on commonly held stereotypes , has some of the worst displays of tasteless female objectification ( all bod no brain ) , and has some of the cheesiest lines known to man.<br /><br />including but not limited to " allright lets see what these guys can do " I should also mention that when they show the crashes involving innocent civilians , you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves . Eddie Griffin 's character is also one of the most stereotypical black guy personas that just rubs people the wrong way . He may or may not be a good actor but this movie does n't allow for that kind of character exploration . You want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys ? Oceans 11 . This movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience.<br /><br />Even the cars ca n't make up for this fluke of a movie . That Enzo that Griffin wrecked sums up this movie perfectly . It just sucks .
0 Apparently Hollywood is just handing out money to anyone with a camera and the ability to speak . This movie was mind numbingly bad . The casting was terrible , the acting unspeakable , and the story filled with holes . Script ? who needs script ? I was surprised that the movie was n't as verbally vulgar as I thought it would be , however I got enough shots of T&A to last me a lifetime . The movie was like listening to a 19 year old street racer with ADD ( who decided to buy a car instead of go to college ) tell a story . Being so poorly scripted , I thought the two brothers in the film were lovers at first . The scenes at the racetrack , along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of Herbie : Fully Loaded . This is the kind of film is what Grindhouse modeled itself after ... only the writers thought they were being serious .
0 It was almost worth sitting through this entire god - awful " film " just to know that I can never experience anything as bad as this again . Acting - 0 , script - 0 , fight scenes - 0 , male lead - 0 ( cheddar bob from eight mile as a suave war hero who gets the girl ) , Nadia Bjorlin - 10 ( She is gorgeous and not a terrible actress ) . This is the criteria I used to average it out to a two . I lost count but I believe ever movie clich√© , ever , is in this movie . When the driver that supposedly killed her father miraculously shows up at the end to race against her , from out of nowhere it cemented the previous statement . Plus he just shows up for no reason . He was never even mentioned before . I do n't know what else to say here . Just watch it when it comes out on TV in a couple years . At least that way some of it will be edited out for commercials .
0 This movie has some of the most awesome cars I 've ever seen in a movie , and definitely the hottest women , but I would have to say it is still one of the worst movies I 've ever seen.<br /><br />Here is the plot , and if you read it with a little inflection , you have the acting as well.<br /><br />Beginning , bring in characters , hot woman singing ( obvious lip sync ) . Music agent or producer comes in , thinks that she is awesome asks her to race . She turns down , too many bad memories . Flash to war hero , back from war , has several fights , and becomes movie hero with attitude that he is better than everyone . Drive off in fast exotic car . Brother races , then dies . Hero to avenge death , cut away to getting weapons from friend . ( You have never seen this friend before or after , but seems to really care about him ) Are you sure you want to do this ; Yes ; I mean are you really sure ; Yes , give me weapons ; are you REALLY sure ; Yes ; OK , I guess I ca n't talk you out of it , be careful man , I love you.<br /><br />Now he goes to blow up his uncles house who owned the car his brother drove . Finds woman , decides to rescue her , She drives off , and he does n't finish killing his uncle . Now there will be a race to finish the movie . Oh yeah , need to throw in one more scene with bad people coming in to beat up people that do n't really matter , but maybe it adds a little plot . Race is not even that exciting , of course it ends with two cars racing , and one that should win throws in a surprise ending.<br /><br />OK , I just saved you $ 7.00 . You can send all of your money to me , because I should have given you the same amount of enjoyment as this movie does . Do n't get me wrong , the cars are awesome , and Nadija is beautiful , but it is truly an awful movie .
0 This is by far the WORST movie I have ever seen . I was going in expecting a cheesy movie but at least with some cool car scenes / races . What I got was nothing . The racing scene are so low budget they sped them up to make it look like the cars are " going fast " In one scene a Mercedes SLR goes from over 200 to 0 in like 4 seconds by just spinning around in circles . Its just ridiculous.<br /><br />If you wanna see a real movie about cars , see the fast and the furious series . They may be a little cheesy , but 100x better than this movie could ever hope to be . Better yet just watch Mischief 3000 , the best car movie ever made I think .
0 Okay so I went into this movie not really expecting much I figured an action flick similar to The Fast and the Furious . Some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot . Unfortunately I would have to say that this was probably the worst movie I have seen this year . Do n't get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were OK but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely . The story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together . So overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend I would pass on this one for now .
0 You already know how painful to watch this movie is . But I wonder why one of the worst movies ever should include one the most beautiful cars . Why the cars should be not only the victim of violation , but also the only true actors and performers in it . So how on Earth you Porsche , Lamborghini or whatever could allow those people to get in touch with your cars and ruin you reputation for which you give millions . Stop the getting an advantage of the cars and earn money on their chests . It is painful for those who love cars . It is painful for those who love movies.<br /><br />I want my money back ! ! !
0 Redline is a knockoff of Fast & Furious , without any of the redeeming qualities . It does n't need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises , but it needs SOMETHING ! This is the equivalent of a porn film , where the storyline and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end . Except that this is worse , because you do n't get your money 's worth . Mind - numbingly boring , impossible race sequences , and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars , which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this movie . Sure , she 's hot , but who 's that desperate for an on screen female ? I feel like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets , and shook an 8 ball every time they switched scenes . No serious person who races or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the race scenes .
0 Acting is horrible . This film makes Fast and Furious look like an academy award winning film . They throw a few boobs and butts in there to try and keep you interested despite the EXTREMELY weak and far fetched story . There is a reason why people on the internet are n't even downloading this movie . This movie sunk like an iron turd . DO NOT waste your time renting or even downloading it . This film is and always will be a PERMA - TURD . I am now dumber for having watched it . In fact this title should be referred to as a " PERMA - TURD " from now on . Calling it a film is a travesty and insult . abhorrent , abominable , appalling , awful , beastly , cruel , detestable , disagreeable , disgusting , dreadful , eerie , execrable , fairy , fearful , frightful , ghastly , grim , grisly , gruesome , heinous , hideous , horrendous , horrid , loathsome , lousy , lurid , mean , nasty , obnoxious , offensive , repellent , repulsive , revolting , scandalous , scary , shameful , shocking , sickie , terrible , terrifying , ungodly , unholy , unkind
0 The cars in this movie are awesome . The acting in this movie is awful . The plot and driving scenes do n't make much sense and are equally bad . If you get really bothered by movies where someone shifts and suddenly goes ridiculously faster , save yourself the trouble and money . Good movie for racing fans ? Well , there is a part where they make the mistake of referring to a NASCAR driver as a rally car driver . If you ca n't tell the difference , go watch it , you 'll have a blast . It really comes down to this , there are really really really nice cars in this movie , they are driven horribly and are completely unrealistic . The acting is horrible mainly because of the extremely bad plot . If you want to see hot girls , turn on mtv or vh1 instead . I am disappointed that such nice cars would be represented in such a bad movie . If the class of the cars were to match that of the movie , they should be racing with rusted bicycles .
0 " A total waste of time " Just throw in a few explosions , non stop fighting , exotic cars a deranged millionaire , slow motion computer generated car crashes and last but not least a Hugh Hefner like character with wall to wall hot babes , and mix in a blender and you will have this sorry excuse for a movie . I really got a laugh out of the " Dr. Evil " like heavily fortified compound . The plot was somewhere between preposterous and non existent . How many millionaires are willing to make a 25 million dollar bet on a car race ? Answer : 4 but , did n't they become millionaires through fiscal responsibility ? This was written for pubescent males , it plays like a video game . I did enjoy the Gulfstream II landing in the desert though .
0 I 'm sorry to say that there is n't really any way , in my opinion , that an Enzo would really be able to keep up with a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo . The power to weight advantage possessed by the S7 would just be too great . The S7 has a power : weight ratio of 3.93 lbs / hp while the Enzo has 4.61 lbs / hp . The S7s low end is much better too . Sorry Ferrari fans but the Saleen just gets it done so much better.<br /><br />As for other parts of this film , I just have to say it 's so substandard as to be pathetic . The story is way too weak . The acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soaps.<br /><br />I can say that as far as it being a treatise on negative psychology its kind of a gem . This film is nothing if not a glaring definition as to what narcissism and sociopathy are all about . Its all about these rich punks getting their rocks off while showing only traces of feigned remorse for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death too.<br /><br />I ca n't give the film a " 1 Star " rating because it did n't compel me to actually walk out of the theater . I also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the leading female saves it from being completely abysmal .... although there is no way her singing would put her on the cover of ' Variety'.<br /><br />ps : the guy who plays Jason is SOOOOO the skid row version of James Vanderbeek .
0 So it has come to this . Fast , expensive cars that only the upper 1 % will ever drive . The girls that pose next to them in gearhead magazines . Second - tier and no - name actors . Cheap promotional appearances by people from niche culture . < br /><br />This is the garbage that Hollywood has to offer . Do n't get me wrong ; I love the mindless action flick with hot chicks as much as the next guy . But please , will the collective Braintrust that greenlights this stuff please stop , count to ten , breathe , have a hearty " Woooooosaaaaaah " , then rewind twentyfive years and recall what made movies enjoyable once upon a time ? Then actually MAKE some movies like that again ? < br /><br />I have nothing against poker , but the entire pop - culture explosion it has enjoyed over the past five years is ridiculous . Everyone and their mother thinks their Maverick now ( not that half of them even will get that reference ) . Some executive said , " Hey , what demographic do you want to leach $ 9.50 out of ? " " I know , sir . The 18 - 35 market . " " Ok , let 's give them poker , girls , and fast cars . " " Brilliant idea , sir . " The result ? A film that I 've seen a hundred times late at night on Spike TV , and more often than not , starring Dolph Lundgren . < br /><br />Now do n't misunderstand me;I am not a film snob . Over - the - top artsy flicks like The English Patient do n't float my boat , but generic films that should not have even been made straight to DVD bother the hell out of me too . Only adolescent gearheads will have their engines revved by this , and I imagine the ones in the higher end of their IQ range will see this for what it is : a junkyard .
0 I felt like I was watching the Fast and the Furious again , but with different actors and a little bit different plot . I will say the cars in the film are very cool . So , if you like fast cars , then you will probably find this movie mildly entertaining . I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I 've seen her from Days of our Lives . She is a really good singer , but too bad they gave her such lousy songs to sing in this movie . I mean songs about cars ; not exactly what you would here on the radio . Since it is a Hollywood film , you have to give this story a little lee way , but in real life I do n't think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race car , fix a car engine , and be a lead singer . It 's just all very silly.<br /><br />Another side note , any one willing to wager 25 million on a car race is a nut . But it was kinda of cool at the end when Natasha stops right before the finish line and screws Michael over . Priceless.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT : This movie is for car freaks . So , if you like fast cars , then I 'd recommend this .
0 You can not deny that we have an affinity for speed . That 's why movies like Fast and the Furious , Dhoom , Rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences , especially local ones . We live on a tiny island , and I can not fathom why , for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system , most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with 100 % tax when they reach our shores , and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one . Not only that , the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear , lest they reach the sea.<br /><br />And these movies are relatively easy to make . Hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic . For once , those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long , ca n't compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these . Of course there are amongst us ( ahem ) those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects ( otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models , and movies such as these can not do without a leggy model in a frame ) , however , they do n't warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen , even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into Park . The guy sitting beside me , I swear he wet his pants every time his dream car(s ) appear , and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans.<br /><br />So there we have it , the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie . With the Fast and the Furious franchise , the Japanese models like the Evos and the Skylines take centerstage , as does the GT . Here , the Ford GT takes on an incredibly drool - worthy facade modification , that even I 'm impressed , alongside the latest models like the Ferrari Enzos , Porshe Carerra GTs , Koenigsegg CCXs , and every car out there that has wings for doors . But seriously , my heart goes out to the cars each time they 're mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment . I mean , this are perfectly fine , high performance models that are at the apex of motoring , but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow , they do so because they can,<br /><br />There 's no story in Redline , just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties ( the cars that is ) that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible , and with the usual shots of pedals ( always the accelerator , mind you , tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy , and earn you no respect ) , steering wheels , gear shifts ( always shifting up and not down ) , all these while having the actors make pretend that they 're the baddest asses with an engine , snarling and giving each other dirty looks . Not a very tall order for an actor , and that 's why we get the most woeful performances ever , with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids.<br /><br />The heroine ( yes , it made a statement that girls can drive ) Natasha ( a very plasticky looking Nadia Bjorlin ) is one of those million dollar finds - a girl with model looks who do n't mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil , who has racing pedigree within her , and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable ( every line had to do with cars , and when singing about love , just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts , lubricants and going for rides ) . Introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called Infamous ( Eddie Griffin ) , she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a Leo DiCaprio lookalike Iraq war veteran , and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle . Everything else , well like I said , just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race.<br /><br />And it 's almost always the same , as there 's very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars , especially when you know the race is rigged ( for narrative reasons ) and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line . While Fast and Furious had quite charismatic actors , and I will put my head on the chopping block by naming Paul Walker , Sun Kang , and of course , the star it created - Vin Diesel , Redline had none , just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately . It looks like a TV movie in its treatment from the get go , with a very insipid opening sequence where it 's one man , one car , and a 105 minutes race against time to get to Vegas.<br /><br />If not for the cars , then this movie seriously is a piece of junk , with bad acting , bad lines and bad action . Strictly for the car fans , or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines .
0 I like bad movies . I like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip on them for their duration . Then there are abhorrent movies like this . Redline is not just a bad movie , but a telling sign that maybe the American movie industry should please , for the sake of the viewer , at least proofread scripts before funding a movie.<br /><br />If a stereotype took a crap , this movie would spawn from that . The storyline is unbearable , and the acting all around is laughable . Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin have , perhaps , the worst screen chemistry I 've seen in a good while , and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street merchants ( about the only thing they can legitimately qualify for ) . Furthermore , how Angus Macfadyen got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that I ca n't even think of an analogy . I am a loyal fan of his , but this has made me question him.<br /><br />To sum it up . Several people want revenge for different reasons ( and if you care enough to know what they are , you 're a bigger person than me ) , so much so that it turns to violence ( I guess ) . The movie is like Ouroboros , the snake that swallows its own tail , in that it 's an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears . This movie is essentially one big car commercial for the first half , and an indecipherable action movie for the rest , it should be avoided at any and all costs.<br /><br />I wish I could find one positive aspect to this movie , and I think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits do roll.<br /><br />P.S. Nadia Bjorlin , if that was YOU singing those two songs in this movie , then you are a hack , and I hope old age ravages you.<br /><br />P.S.S. If you DO rent this movie looking for a laughable experience , listen for the lyrics to Nadia Bjorlin 's awesome songs .
0 This movie should have been named Need For Speed : The Movie . For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot . This applies perfectly to Redline . The only thing about this movie that was A - Level were the cars . The acting seemed forced and scripted , the premise was flimsy at best , and the plot was almost nonexistent . I only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and , while it was pretty bad , it could have been worse . And at least it was entertaining . I just wish they had showed Eddie Griffin crashing the Enzo somewhere in the movie . All in all , do n't pay for it , do n't go out of your way to see it , but if it 's on Showtime or HBO and there is n't anything else on , it 's a decent distraction .
0 This will be best known for the Ferrari that was crashed when Eddie Griffin was doing promotion.<br /><br />Tale of racing and betting is a poorly made by the numbers that appears to have a director who could n't see the numbers . Largely a point and shoot affair with a group of actors in it for a paycheck . This is not a good movie , but its not bad enough to be watchable and end up as a some what nothing film is n't worth bothering with no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />Misogynistic , despite the fact one of the leads is a woman , this is a film that was clearly made just to get the producer and director close to pretty girls . Want evidence ? There are long lingering shots of women in next to nothing that serve no purpose other than perhaps to get a rise out of people too afraid to rent a porno or the Sports illustrated swimsuit DVD.<br /><br />Avoid this movie at all costs
0 I am a dumber person for renting the DVD REDLINE . Chicago Pictures who made this stupid movie never paid Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various automotive sites including mine which has an ALEXA rating of 16K. They ripped me off on the deal and now I am out $ 16,000 and they wasted much of my personal time ( peter rapport of Palisades Media ) you know who you are!<br /><br />Please do n't rent or buy this movie ! ! ! It sucks and the people behind it are ripoff artists.<br /><br />REDLINE has a cast of losers and poor actors!<br /><br />This movie is a Joke
0 This movie was bad to say the least ! ! ! The plethora of superb cars are disgraced to have have been showcased in this LAME movie . It starts off with a race from L.A. to Las Vegas to be completed in 1HR 45min ... in a Ferrari F430 . I did that in 1HR 50min in a tiny 4cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord . Seriously ... this movie does not do justice to these cars . Obviously these writers are just that and probably drive under the speed limit with their hands @ 10 & 2 o'clock . I remember seeing on the news how Eddie Griffin crashed a 1.5 million dollar Ferrari Enzo going 30 - 40MPH > > > youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms < br /><br />And ... the director ANDY CHENG is THE biggest SELLOUT ! ! ! He brings shame to his own race . I wonder just how many people he orally pleased just to break into Hollywood . He partook in a movie that portrays Asian Americans in such a negative and FALSE way . Asian women>>cheap money grubbing whores . Asian men>>losing compulsive gamblers & thugs that get beat all the time . What the heck is all the fear about asians ? ? Why the need to always portray them in such a negative connotation ? ? I am SO sick of the way Hollywood ALWAYS portrays asians in SUCH a negative and false pretext .
0 I mean , I thought I heard this dialog in the movie , but it was so bad and out of place that I ca n't really believe it . I was laughing so hard at what must have been the worst writing and acting in human history , i was seriously worried that I might have a heart attack and die right there in the theater.<br /><br />So this is the scene I am talking about , the " hero " just watched his brother crash and his brothers car exploded right there just feet away from him ( the hero ) . The " hero " was throwing the expected " fit " at seeing something so tragic and people were trying to hold him back from running into the burning car.<br /><br />In the middle of his fit and his uncontrollable rage / emotional break down he says " I am so sad " - he said that right ? Am I crazy ?
0 VILLA RIDES ( 1968 ) turns out to be something of a big disappointment ! And even though Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the screenplay , along with Robert Towne , it still emerges as a leadenly written movie dryly directed by the undistinguished Buzz Kulik . Firstly , top billed Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for the part ! He 's not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary ! His one note performance lacks the fire and gusto Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have brought to the role . Brynner simply looks like a Russian aristocrat dressed up like a Mexican bandit who is in the middle of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian one . Also , second billed Robert Mitchum is totally wasted in the picture ! His part as a biplane flying ace lobbing home - made bombs from the air in the cause of the revolution is a poorly written meager role that could have been played by any minor star . Mitch has n't a decent line in the entire movie and brings to one 's mind his other Mexican revolution picture the far superior " Bandido " ( 1956 ) which unfortunately nobody seems to have any interest in releasing on DVD . Besides lacking any kind of style " Villa Rides " also suffers badly without the presence of a female star ! There is starlet Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum the glad eye but her casting is merely perfunctory . Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters could have perhaps added a couple of badly needed notches to the faltering story line.<br /><br />There are a couple of good action scenes in the movie but a couple of good action scenes do not a movie make and the less than perfect Panavision picture quality plus the over repetitive Maurice Jarre theme tune does n't help matters.<br /><br />As is Paramount 's wo nt there are no extras - not even a trailer ! Yup , a disappointing movie and DVD presentation that could have been and should have been a whole lot better .
0 A man brings his new wife to his home where his former wife died of an " accident " . His new wife has just been released from an institution and is also VERY rich ! All of the sudden she starts hearing noises and seeing skulls all over the place . Is she going crazy again or is the first wife coming back from the dead ? < br /><br />You've probably guessed the ending so I wo n't spell it out . I saw this many times on Saturday afternoon TV as a kid . Back then , I liked it but I WAS young . Seeing it now I realize how bad it is . It 's horribly acted , badly written , very dull ( even at an hour ) and has a huge cast of FIVE people ( one being the director ) ! Still it does have some good things about it . < br /><br />The music is kinda creepy and the setting itself with the huge empty house and pond nearby is nicely atmospheric . There also are a few scary moments ( I jumped a little when she saw the first skull ) and a somewhat effective ending . All in all it 's definitely NOT a good movie ... but not a total disaster either . It does have a small cult following . I give it a 2.<br /><br />Also try to avoid the Elite DVD Drive - in edition of it ( it 's paired with " Attack of the Giant Leeches " ) . It 's in TERRIBLE shape with jumps and scratches all over . It did n't even look this bad on TV !
0 Welcome to a bad ghost story and someone 's nightmare . This horror tale finds a newly married husband(John Hudson)and wife(Peggy Weber)haunted by the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls found throughout their empty mansion and lily pond . Is the husband really trying to drive his already anxious bride insane ? Or is it the learning challenged gardener Mickey(Alex Nicol)who has taken care of the mansion 's grounds since the death of the original mistress of the house ? This low budget horror flick has a story line that keeps you involved all the way the finale . Special effects are pretty bad even at 1958 standards . I swear at times the screaming skull sounds much like it should be in a Godzilla movie . Also in the cast as Reverend Snow is character actor Russ Conway . By the way ... the lurking gardener(Nicol)is the film 's director . You can catch this as part of AMC 's Monsterfest .
0 " The Screaming Skull " opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now there 's a hook ! The story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick : scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness , then attempts to convince her that she 's going insane with shrill noises , mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times . Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man 's first wife who he was devoted to . Maybe it 's just that the 1950 's did n't have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie , the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane . But then again , when I first saw " House on Haunted Hill " as a nine year old , it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way I 'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong , the film is not terrible , it just seems to get tedious at times . But there 's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home , and the gardens and pool are a nice touch . For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock ( John Hudson ) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull , he just wades right in clothes and all , in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener ( director Alex Nicol in a dual role ) . It makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.<br /><br />In it 's own good way , perhaps the most shocking thing about the film : how about that neat roadster the Whitlock 's make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958 ! That at least made me jump out of my seat !
0 When you have a disembodied skull , an empty mansion , a schizophrenic wife , a scheming cad and a nutzo gardener , throw in a minister and his wife - what have you got?<br /><br />AIP 's answer to insomnia.<br /><br />"The Screaming Skull " gets points for audacity , offering free caskets for anyone who dies of fright from watching the film . Pretty safe bet , when you 're lulled into a stupor by people who think they 're in a production of " Suspense for Dummies".<br /><br />But Peggy Webber was a cutie , anyway . She had a few good moments of acting here and there ( especially when trying to communicate with the gardener ) and no one else fills a nightgown like she . But that scared face she makes - scary in itself . Whoa.<br /><br />As a whole , though , there is little suspense here and everything is telegraphed like a punch thrown by a mime . You ca n't be scared by this film , it 's impossible . It has its moments , but not enough of them.<br /><br />HOWEVER , thanks to a certain Mike Nelson and his two robot pals , there are several moments of pure joy , especially in the copy THEY got hold of ( " The film jumped , and it was really scary!").<br /><br />One star for " The Screaming Skull " , eight and a half for the MST3 K version.<br /><br />Talk about a " Screaming " bore ....
0 I first saw this movie on MST3K. And although I laughed my posterior off at the jokes , I do n't particularly think this movie was all that bad . Sure it was a little hard to understand it is quite obviously low budget , But it had a very Hitchcock - like plot and I can honestly say that when I viewed the non - MST3 K version , I was genuinely entertained . This movie is crying out for a Hollywood remake .
0 * SPOILERS*<br /><br />I'm sure back when this was released in 1958 it was much appropriate for its time . Back then films were slower paced to allow audiences to follow and analyze the story . Here a man moves into a house owned by his last wife that died mysteriously with his new wife . The gardener Mickey ( played by Alex Nicol , who also directed he film ) really is an underappreciated character . He gets a skull to indirectly warn Jenni that she is in trouble , since he knew that there was foul play in the first wife 's death . He ca n't tell Jenni directly what happened , so he tries to scare her off with the skull . Jenni , we also find out , saw her parents die , thus causing a lifetime of mental anguish that lead to institutionalization . Like many audiences today , I found the pacing to be a little too slow for my tastes . But if you like slow - paced horror without a lot of gore , this film is for you.<br /><br / >
0 I could n't tell if " The Screaming Skull " was trying to be a Hitchcock rip off or a modernized Edgar Allen Poe tribute . These days , someone would have chopped it up a bit and presented it as one of those TV anthology episodes from the old " Tales From The Dark Side" ... but only after an extensive rewrite.<br /><br />The sad thing is , there seems to be a nice , nasty little story trying to get out from under the rubble of this movie , and the actors are obviously doing the best they can with both their talent and the material they have to work with . But the director just did n't know how to stage or pace a dramatic scene ; the special effects simply did n't work ; the screenplay telegraphed its threadbare plot points so plainly that a bivalve could have seen them coming ; and the soundtrack kept playing German " oompah band " music when it was supposed to be trying to scare the audience . < br /><br />They tried ; they tried really hard . But this is of interest only as a period piece . I suppose someone very young who had n't seen a lot of suspense or horror might get a charge out " The Screaming Skull " , but someone that young probably would n't get most of the subtext or plot motivation . ( " Mommy , why is that nice man trying to scare the twisty faced scaredy - cat lady ? ? " )
0 As the film begins a narrator warns us THE SCREAMING SKULL is so terrifying you might die of fright -- and if such happens a free burial is guaranteed . Well , I do n't think any one has died of fright from seeing this film , but a few may have died of boredom . THE SCREAMING SKULL is the sort of movie that makes Ed Wood look good.<br /><br />Very loosely based on the famous Francis Marion Crawford story , SKULL is about a wealthy but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances . Once installed in his home , she is tormented by a half - wit gardener , a badly executed portrait , peacocks , and ultimately a skull that rolls around the room and causes her to scream a lot . And to her credit , actress Peggy Webber screams rather well.<br /><br />Unfortunately , her ability to do so is the high point of the film . The plot is pretty transparent , to say the least , and while the cast is actually okay , the script is dreadful and the movie so uninspired you 'll be ready to run screaming yourself . True , the thing only runs about sixty - eight minutes , but it all feels a lot longer . Add to this a truly terrible print quality and there you are.<br /><br />There are films that are so bad they are fun to watch . It is true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has a few howlers -- but the film drags so much I could n't work up more than an occasional giggle , and by the time the whole thing is over your head will roll from ennui . If it were n't for Peggy Webber 's way with a scream , this would be the surefire cure for insomnia . Give it a miss.<br /><br />GFT , Amazon Reviewer
0 * WARNING * Possible spoilers below < br /><br />The film is more boring then anything else . There seems to be some attempt to build tension through badly lit shots of empty rooms and empty lawns , but none of it works.<br /><br />MST3 K did a fairly good job with it , but on its own the movie is mostly tedious.<br /><br />Funny moments:<br /><br />When the fake skull rolls out of a pile of ashes , the wife becomes hysterical and woozy while the husband ( who is trying to drive the wife crazy ) says in a deadpan voice " There is no skull there , there 's no skull." < br /><br />When the real ghost - skulls have the husband caught in a pickle , as if trapped between first and second base .
0 Okay , so the introduction , with its hokey offer of a free coffin to anyone who dies of fright during the film , is so lame it 's funny . And so the first " skull scene " is so drawn out and un - suspenseful it 's funny . The actual plot of the movie is somewhat decent , there 's at least a little bit of genuine food for thought in the behavior of the characters , and the plot twist is decent as horror flicks go . The acting is average , not truly bad . < br /><br />Altogether , this movie does n't quite fall flat in the way a 1/10 movie would . It 's not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or even second lowest . If I just read the screenplay , I 'd say there was potential for this to be a decent movie . It 's just that the horrid direction and production that ruin the movie . So it 's a bad movie , but there are much worse ones out there .
0 As far as cinematography goes , this film was pretty good for the mid 50 's . There were a few times that the lighting was way too hot but the shots were generally in frame and stayed in focus . The acting was above average for a low budget stinker but the direction was horrible . Several scenes were dragged out way too long in an attempt at suspense and the effects were non - existent . The attack by the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with stick pokes and strings . I also could n't help but think the budget did n't allow them to furnish the house so they kept making references to the movers and that all the things in storage should be coming soon . Honestly ... it would have been more entertaining if it were a worse movie . It was n't bad enough to be a " good - bad " movie but was n't good enough to be " good " either . Get the MST3 K version ... it 's more fun .
0 THE SCREAMING SKULL ( 1 outta 5 stars ) This movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits ( an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie , a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music ) but , sadly , the movie is all downhill from there . A widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion ... admonishing his servants and friends that the new Mrs. has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past . Well , in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can . Her husband assures her that it 's all merely in her mind and ... well , you can probably see where this all is going . You will have figured out what 's going on long before our hapless heroine ... because you have probably seen the exact same plot in hundreds of other movies and TV shows ( and done better , too ) . To add to the movie 's myriad transgressions , most cuts of this movie ( on numerous cheap DVD compilations ) seem to be missing a few key scenes . You see the heroine slowly walking towards the window ... she goes to open it ... you know she is going to see something scary ... and then ... suddenly the scene cuts to her sobbing in her husband 's arms . So what did she see ? ? ? I guess we 'll never know .
0 Well I have to admit this was one of my favorites as a kid , when I used to watch it on a home projector as a super-8 reel . Now there is n't much to recommend it , other than the inherent camp value of actors being " terrified " by replicas of human skulls . The special effects are pretty silly , mostly consisting of skulls on wires and superimposed " ghost " images.<br /><br />But there 's something to be said for the sets . The large mansion in which it takes place is pretty creepy , especially since it 's mostly unfurnished ( probably due to budgetary reasons?).<br /><br />It definitely inspires more laughs than screams , however . Just try not to get the giggles when the wife ( who does more than her share of screaming ) goes into the greenhouse and is confronted with the ghost of her husband 's ex .
0 - A newlywed couple move into the home of the husband 's dead former wife . It 's not long before the new wife begins to have the feeling that someone does n't want her in the house . She sees skulls all around the house . But when the husband investigates , he ca n't find anything . Is someone trying to drive her back to the asylum that she was recently discharged from ? Or , is the ghost of the dead wife trying to get the new wife out of her house ? < br /><br />- This is the first time that I 've watched The Screaming Skull without the assistance of the MST3 K crew . And , it will in all likelihood be the last time I watch it this way . Can you say dull ? I 'm not talking ordinary dull - I 'm talking watching grass grow dull . There are great stretches of the movie where nothing happens . The screen could have gone blank and I would have gotten as much entertainment out of it . The characters drone on and on with the most monotonous conversations imaginable . The Screaming Skull could probably be marketed as a sleep aide.<br /><br />- The actors do n't help matters much . Most of them deliver lines with the conviction normally reserved for a grade school play . I have n't looked it up , but I would be shocked to find that anyone associated with this movie ever appeared in anything of cinematic value . I wo n't even go into the script the actors are given to work with . Let 's just say that the characters are given some of the most idiotic lines ever uttered on film.<br /><br />- You 've been warned ! Either avoid this one at all costs or , at least , seek out the MST3 K version .
0 Well , one has to give the director credit for how gutsy he was . Gutsy would be the right term . Not only did he use a total cast of five people ( no extras at ALL ) , but he also decided to use sub - par special effects with a confusing and boring plot , he also , and I AM NOT kidding , put a warning at the beginning of the movie that you might DIE OF FRIGHT ! ! ! However , they do promise a FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIIINNNNN . To have a creepy limping gardener is always a good move . Yaaa - unique - aaawwwwnnn .... <br /><br />If you watch Mystery Science Theater 3000 , you might 've seen this . They like to showcase horrible movies , just to let you know.<br /><br />A good gift for someone you hate .
0 Now I get it . The title refers to each audience member 's immediate post - reaction after 68 minutes of mental torture . Trying too hard to be terrifying , lacking good dialogue even any fear for that matter really makes The Screaming Skull more like A Snoring Dull . Albeit , the mansion and property set in black and white does set a dark tone for the movie , but that 's about it . The only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money on this ! Remember the coffin guarantee in the beginning ? That may be the funniest thing I have ever witnessed on screen . Sad thing is that viewers probably hoped director Alex Nichol was forcibly placed in a coffin , nailed shut , and buried alive for his lame effort . Jenny placed in this unfortunate horrific situation never really draws any sympathy you would feel for a woman whose anxiety is blamed on a haunted , cranial receptacle . Also , her husband John comes off as a condescending wannabe smooth talker , but this does n't work and he ends up proving how tough he is by slapping a helpless cripple around ! Ah , Mickey ¬Ö the days before you could get a restraining order against estate caretakers like him . This guy 's approach is not very good or maybe too much airplane glue . Still , despite his strange persona , Mickey probably is the only good thing going for this movie providing a slight sense of entertainment and I ca n't get enough of a guy saying " It was Mary ! " and rummaging through pots in a greenhouse .
0 After seeing the credits with only one name that I recognize and that was the preacher in this film ( Russ Conway ) , I did not expect much from this film and I was not disappointed . A man is planning on killing his new wife by convincing other people that she is insane and will take her own life . Unbeknown to the husband is that the plastic looking skull that he uses , in contrast , a ghost of a woman apparently his first dead wife has revenge on her mind and uses a real skull . A simple plot with a twist of irony at the end . If you are tired late one night and in need of sleep , this will help you to sleep that sleep .
0 I am SURE there is some sort of IMDB cult that likes movies that MST3 K made fun of . After seeing both this and " Werewolf " and reading dozens of comments about how underated they are , I became convinced that there is some conpiricy going on here . Alot of people are saying that people who hate it " are only scared by gore " , " Do n't know good horror " or stuff like that . Well , I do n't really care for gore , but I do want SOMETHING to happen in a movie ! Most of it is just the wife sitting and looking around ! Or walking around the house / garden ! A movie requires something to give it atmosphoere , you do n't get it by just have pointless scenes were someone walks around and stares . Oh , and " Makes you think " ? Yeah , I was thinking " MOVE ! YOU @#$0&% ! ! " One of the worst horror movie I have ever scene ! < br /><br />P.s . For the record , I am a big fan of the old style of horror , Dracula , Frankenstein , That kind of stuff .
0 I am not a big fan of horror films , and have only seen a handful of them ( and none of the " Halloween"s or " Friday the Thirteenth"s ) - but I can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore . And I 'm pretty sure this is n't scary.<br /><br / > What 's so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere ? In all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots , so there 's no real surprise in any of this film . ( Not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway , but . . .)<br /><br / > The plot concerns Claus Von Bulow 's third cousin ( John Hudson ) , who marries a Donna - reed look - a - like ( Peggey Webber , giving one of the worst performances ever ) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband 's mansion . Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident ? OOOOH ! ! ! ! Wonder who did it!!!!<br /><br / > This is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and/or drive their wife insane . If you want to see a well - done version of this stuff , try " Reversal of Fortune " . And BTW , Jeremy Irons is one hundred times more talented than John Hudson.<br /><br / > The MSTing was okay but nothing special ; paired with the " Gumby " short , however , it makes for good viewing.<br /><br / > Two stars for " The Screaming Skull " ; eight stars for the MST3 K version.<br /><br / > And now , to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow himself : " How bad is this film ? " " You have no idea ! "
0 I saw this movie on Mystery Science Theater 300 . It sucked so much . If I had n't been watching it on MST3 K , I probably would 've thrown it out the window . The characters were incredibly lame and it did n't provide much of a plot in my opinion .
0 The producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for anyone who dies of fright while watching this movie . They should have offered intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker . A young couple moves into a house , where a woman who looks like the woman from the couple lived . Extremely boring , and very predictable . In the end I ended up not caring about anyone in this movie.<br /><br />Avoid this one at all costs .
0 That is the best way I can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husband 's first wife who died under mysterious circumstances . That sounds well and good , but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom . In fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin . Well trust me , no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls , peacocks , weird gardeners , and doors being knocked on . And the music is the worst , it consists of constant tuba music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth grader . And you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking . Someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate . Yes in the end this is a slow paced ( which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour ) , boring little tale , that is easily figured out by the average person . Apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person .
0 OK , I admit I watched this movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000 ( which I am a huge fan of ) , but I am not one of those people who automatically gives an MST3 K movie a 1/10 rating . Although I hate many of the movies they play , and some are among of the worst movies I 've ever seen , I have actually been able to enjoy some MST3 K movies . That being said , this is one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . ( It is no wonder , in fact , that the MST3 K writers themselves commented that this one was one of the worst . Do n't believe me ? Check out their site.)<br /><br />To me , this movie is a good example of what NOT to do in filmmaking . The dialogue is very bad , the acting is worse , the cinematography is pathetic the direction ( while perhaps being the best thing in this movie ) is bad.<br /><br />The pacing is the worst part in this movie . A few times in this movie , the viewer had to wait literally minutes for something to happen . While minutes may not sound like a very long amount of time , it can be in a movie , particularly in this one . I 'm sure it was meant to create a mood , but I was just very bored . It truly felt like ten minutes.<br /><br />If " suspension of disbelief " means " almost falling asleep during a movie " , then this has plenty of that . But THE SCREAMING SKULL is just so horrible , there is no way I could have possibly even gotten interested in anything that was actually going on in the film , and thus the " suspension of disbelief " was indeed non - existant.<br /><br />One of the worst , and probably the most boring movie I 've ever seen.<br /><br />1/10
0 I would of given this film a zero out of ten , but i will give it a two . Reason One is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film , which is not really a reason . Last Point is that Rani Appears in this film and does a smooch with Kamal . I Love Rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress . Which is why i did n't enjoy her in this movie kissing Kamal , but its no big deal . Anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable , lets actually talk about this film . Is it good or bad , I think its a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn . Me being a Fantastic critic , you can see my other 250 + review 's by clicking on my name , I have great taste . The movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema , why is there no morale in this movie . Its a biased movie that s not a true story and it stinks . Watching Kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick , Man ca nt kiss properly anyway .
0 This movie makes a promising start and then gets very confused and muddled . Kamal Hasan has made a lot of effort in getting the period look right , pity he did not spend more time on the plot . Most of the small characters in the movie show up for no particular reason.<br /><br />Overall very disappointing , I would recommend avoiding this movie .
0 I had high expectations for this movie and was excited about renting it but was very disappointed when I saw it . It was very poorly written and sort of just fell apart . There was n't a lot of good anything in this movie except maybe special effects .
0 An interesting idea for a film , both showing the last dragon on earth and showing the struggle he and someone evil have together . When he was younger , Einon got stabbed in the heart , so Bowen ( Dennis Quaid ) took him to the dark lord who gave him half his heart . Now grown up Einon ( David Thewlis ) is now the selfish and evil king . Meanwhile , Bowen is using a new friend Draco the Dragon ( voiced by Sir Sean Connery ) to get rewards for " killing " dragons . But because Einon has half of Draco 's hear , they both feel the pain in one of them is hurt , or killed . Also starring Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert of Glockenspur , Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton , Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur . It was nominated for the Oscar for Best Visual Effects . Worth watching !
0 This movie has such inexorable B class cheapness to all its scenes , effects etc as to make you think they spent 80 % of their budget on Connery . It 's like watching some Wing Commander stuff after Star Wars ( quite apart from content).<br /><br />Story can be described in one word : FLAT . And oh my God I ca n't remember a villain so uninteresting since long long ago . We 're given neither a reason he 's so wicked ( an inborn defect , we 're lead to think : ) nor any real convincedness or flair to his wickedness.<br /><br />If you 're out for Connery rather go rent ` Hunting Forrester ' .
0 It is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels . The script , the acting , the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling . The costumes , sets and pseudo - medieval language are also utterly awful . In an odd way I actually enjoyed this film , once I had accepted that it was n't going to be any good . It seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor , when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise ( albeit not very believable ! ) , but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights , that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films . Let 's just hope that The Lord of the Rings is a bit better ! Oh , and David Thewlis ' haircut makes him look like He - Man . It does !
0 " Diary of Sex Addict " is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness . Probably a movie marketing scam , this flick is a stylish shoot with a good cast and little else going for it . Bottom line , " Diary ... " would have us believe that our sex addict character has the dumbest wife in the world , a stable of babes on the side who have nothing better to do than drop their panties for him at his whim , and no job in spite of being a restaurateur . At the best , this flick could have been good drama . At the worst , cheap softcore . " Diary ... " is n't either and nowhere in between . This one 's for the dumpster . ( D- )
0 This trashy B movie attempts to masquerade as a study of sexual addiction , but it is really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick . The story revolves around Sammy Horn ( subtle name ) played by Michael Des Barres . Sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife Grace ( Rosanna Arquette ) and a young child . He has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree ( and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting Social Security).<br /><br />The story is centered on a conversation with his therapist ( Nastassja Kinski ) where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback . This is nothing more than a convenient launching point for a parade of serial sex acts , which consumes at least 75 % of the screen time.<br /><br />It is hard to know where to begin criticizing a film this bad . The production values are abysmal . The movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a TV soap opera ( at best ) and an amateur porn flick shot in someone 's garage . The direction by Joseph Brutsman is horrible with bad lighting , uninspired framing and poor actor direction . The script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgar.<br /><br />Women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed nymphomaniacs just waiting for an addict like Sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal copulation . As an example , Grace 's sister comes over to indignantly inform Sammy that she knows he 's been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife . His response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin raping her . About three seconds into it she has an epiphany and is instantly converted to one of his sex disciples begging him to give her more . Just as they finish Grace walks in and sis says to her , ` Oh , great to see you , got ta run to pick up Timmy ' and mum 's the word about Sammy 's indiscretions . The bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good ravishment . No spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted it.<br /><br />The sex depictions are all overdone , mechanical , and so poorly simulated that they are more comical than erotic . Most of them are done with both participants fully clothed . The acting is wretched . Michael Des Barres presents all the depth of a rain puddle . He really seems to get into the thrusting and profanity of the sex parts , but when it comes to actually acting with Arquette and Kinski , he is adrift . Rosanna Arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film , giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal . Nastassja Kinski is far too compassionate as the therapist , but at least we have some acting happening here . The rest of the cast is just a collection of elevated body doubles to whom they give thought provoking lines like ` hit me harder , is that the best you can do ? ' and ` Oh , God ¬Ö YES'.<br /><br />This movie is among the worst I have ever seen , a dubious distinction given the thousands of films I have viewed . I have given it the extremely rare dishonor of rating it 1/10 . Not to be seen within three hours of any meal .
0 let me first say , i watched this movie around midnight , and usually there only is trash around this hour , but this movie broke the record < br /><br />first of all the main character is an old non attractive creepy guy , yet he gets to f*ck all girls that come on his path for example he goes to a shop , talks to a girl and then you see them f*ck < br /><br />secondly there are loads of sex scenes , and in many of them there is no nudity at all , i would not have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie would say : fast put your clothes on so we can f*ck!<br /><br />thirdly this movie should show what a sexual addiction can do to a man or a family , this movie only shows soft bad acted erotica it makes me wonder why those actors agreed to play in such trash
0 < br /><br />This movie ( not a film -- clearly recorded on a cheap cam - corder ) may be one of the greatest cinematic stink - bombs in history . Beware : the packaging advertises the flick as an erotic exploration of sex - addiction . The film is not an exploration of anything , and it is no more erotic than staring at one 's own warts . The script is pointless and meandering , with all plot elements serving as segways between supposed sex scenes . However , even the sex scenes are lame lame lame . Except for the first , they are around three seconds long ( then again , maybe my version was cut ) and comically overwrought.<br /><br />If you are looking for a decent film , you do n't want this . If you are looking for a titillating sex - flick , you do n't want this . Whatever your life 's goals , desires , or perspectives , you do not want to watch this movie . How they got Rosanna Arquette , Natashia Kinski , and Ed Begly to act in this stink bomb is puzzling in the extreme .
0 This film was so amateurish I could hardly believe what I was seeing . It is shot on VIDEO ! NOT film ! I have not seen the likes of this since the early 70 's , when late night networks showed movie of the week ' horror flicks ' shot in ...... video . It looks like a bad soap opera , and that is paying it a compliment . Some of the actors give it their best shot . Michael Des Barres does okay with what he is given to do , which is to act like a sex addict out of control . I ca n't say that it is pleasant to watch.<br /><br />Nastassja Kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film , with very little variation in camera angles . I ca n't fault her for someone else 's poor blocking , but she is totally unbelievable in her role . Her little girl voice works against her here . And I consider myself a Nastassja Kinski fan . She is certainly ageless and exotic , but she 's outside her range with this.<br /><br />Alexandra Paul is pathetically overwrought . Every line she delivers is with three exclamation points . Someone must have directed her to scream at all costs . Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew?<br /><br />Finally , Rosanna Arquette as the sweet , maligned wife comes off okay , and probably the most believable of the bunch . But that is not saying much.<br /><br />This has to be the worst film I have seen in years .
0 I fell asleep on my couch at 7:35pm last night watching Larry Sanders ( I usually DirecTivo it , but not last night ) . Woke up at 3 am ( invesment banker on the west coast ) , and was fascinated to see this on HBO2 . I was shocked on how poor this ' movie ' was . Seriously . shocked . So shocked that I had to write a commentary on iMDB . This is really really bad . the writing is boring , but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school.<br /><br />Yes it is shot video . Mind you , that is shot on VIDEO , not DIGITAL VIDEO . It does look like a soap opera . The clips from skateboard videos have a more ' film ' feel to them then this horror.<br /><br />I wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly ca nt remember anything . The shots and blocking are stupid . yes , i chose the word ' stupid ' . not unconventional , not daring , not bold , not boring , just stupid . I know people reviewing this review will say " well give me an example " . I ca nt . It was 3 am . but trust me , I know you will watch it anyway , you will be drawn by the horrible reviews.<br /><br / >
0 A sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life : one as a " happily " married man with a ten year oldish child , the other as a sex fiend . The bulk of the documentary - like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist , listening to his story and intelligently probing him . Nastassja 's role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes . If she had , I would have rated this movie a big fat " F. " As it is , it rates an F+ , implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored . It is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage . " Diary of a Sex Addict " falls into the category of films that once one has seen it , one wishes that one had n't .
0 I was subjected to this atrocity by my wife , tried to turn it off after 10 minutes , but was forced through the whole thing . This must be , hands down , the most gruesome pretense of a movie ever ... <br /><br />There were great script moments , such as:<br /><br />Sammy - " If she gets over here right away , she gets a bonus " Madam - " A boner ? " Sammy - " No , a bonus" < br /><br />To summarize : Horrible script , terrible acting and incredibly illogical .
0 I would n't normally write a comment on - line , but this is the worst movie I 've ever seen . Not only that it 's filmed just like a soap series ( " The young and the restless " is really filmed by professionals compared to this ) , but it also has awful cuts . It has no action . It is full of useless garbage.<br /><br />Here 's an example : a guy wants to kill the main character as he got fired because of him . So ( after loads of crap ) here they are : the guy puts a knife at his throat and says something like " You 're dead now " . Then the main character says : " If you kill me you 're dead . I 've told the police you 're threatening me " . So the ( killer ) guy goes like ( just about to cry ) : " Oh no ... the cops are following me ! ? ! ! Oh ... my God".<br /><br />Remember : this is just an example . I really can not believe this movie actually exists . So : IF you want to see the WORST movie ever ... go ahead , I recommend it :)

0 I really tried to like this movie . It deals with an important problem in any society : sex addiction.<br /><br />In this story we learn that you can lose everything when you 're addicted to sex . In this case , our main character and hero , for having non - stop sex with all kinds of women ( crazy , kinky , neurotic ) puts in jeopardy his marriage , job , and even his life.<br /><br />The production values are terrible ; mainly the acting . Oh , you wo n't enjoy ANY of the sex scenes , most of them are done in very poor taste and you might think you 're watching a home made flick.<br /><br />Second , the plot is just non sense . How could such a smart and beautiful wife stand all the nasty stuff from the husband ? How could she believe him ? ! The threesome situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a while.<br /><br />Also , the scene with the black movie theater attendant is just pointless and will leave you thinking " wtf ? " . < br /><br />Scenes like those you will find plenty . < br /><br />Avoid this movie . Please , avoid it ; it 's not soft core , it 's not a documental , it 's not a dramatic feature . It 's a pretentious effort form a so called documentary director or whatever.<br /><br />Only Mrs. Kinski 's legs on display are worth the watch . I caught it on HBO and I 'm glad I did n't spend my money on it . But those 90 minutes of my life wo n't come back .
0 As many others have stated , this is a terrible movie , from every aspect of movie making . How they ever got some known name actors to take on this project is amazing.<br /><br />Many people have complained that it was shot on ' cheap ' video cameras . Yes , it was shot on video , but not ' cheap ' video . What made it bad was the lighting , white balancing , shooting technique and editing.<br /><br />There were so many different shooting and editing techniques used that it was a production mess . Harsh , inconsistent lighting , over use of hand held shooting ( ala Woody Allen ) , choppy editing ( another Allen technique ) , but poorly done , without real purpose.<br /><br />The lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes is embarrassing ; very amateurish.<br /><br />The simulated sex scenes had no acting value at any level.<br /><br />How this video ever made it to print is beyond me . It is worth watching if only to be amazed at how bad it is .
0 My husband rented this from a video store thinking it was suspense . ( He never reads the synopsis).<br /><br />Well , it would be funny if the thing was watchable . It simply is n't . The same thing over and over , no intrigue , and WHERE did they find the leading man ? . The leading man , Michael Des Barres , is not even feasibly good - looking , especially for this role he is given . Also , sexual harassment at work is something , if you want to see , rent Michael Crichton 's " Disclosure " . At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 90 's . < br /><br />Alexandra Paul , who is usually watchable , plays an embarrassing scene here . There are also lighting effects cheaper than your at home web cam . Do n't even waste time renting this . 0/10 .
0 Ok , I wrote a scathing review b / c the movie is awful . As I was waiting another review ( for Derrida ) of mine to pop up , i decided to check out old reviews of this awful movie . Look at all the positive reviews . They ALL , I say ALL , come from contributors have have not rated any other movie other than this one . Crimminy ! and wait till you to the " rosebud " [ sic ] review.<br /><br />Checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had glowing recommendations for . Oh , shoot ! , they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director . Holy Window - Wipers Batman.<br /><br />Joe , Tony , you suck as writers , and tony , you could n't direct out of a bad script . No jobs for you!<br /><br />ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOW RATED MOVIE !
0 Do n't let the title trick you into watching this movie . I read the title , saw that it came on in the middle of the night , and figured it was one of those soft porn movies . This movie is bad . If you like soft porn movies , then I 'm sorry to say this is n't one . There are a lot of sex but nothing shown and they only last for 5 seconds or so .
0 This movie could had been an interesting character study and could had given some insight on its subject but real problem with this movie is that it does n't have any of this in it . It does n't give any insight- , or solutions to the problem . It 's just the portrayal of ' old ' male sex addict and the problems this is creating for his every day normal life and family . Why would you want to watch this ? It 's all so totally pointless and meaningless.<br /><br />It also really does n't help that the main character is some wrinkly 50 + year old male . You 'll have a hard time identifying yourself- and sympathize for him . He just seems like a dirty old playboy , who is an a constant hunt for woman and sex . He has all kinds of sexual intercourse 's about 3 times a day with different woman and not just only with prostitutes.<br /><br />It also does n't have a bad visual style , though it all feels a bit forced . But nevertheless it 's all better looking than most other direct - to - video productions . Who knows , if the film - makers had been given better material to work with , the movie would had deserved a better faith.<br /><br />The story really gets ridicules at times . There are really some pointless plot - lines that are often more laughable than they were obviously supposed to be . I 'm talking about for instance the whole Ordell plot - line . Things get worse once they movie starts heading toward the ending . Also the whole way the story is being told , cutting back and forth between the events that happened and the main character 's sessions with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap and simple.<br /><br />But as far as bad movies are concerned , this just is n't one of them . It 's not really any better or worse than any other random straight - to - video flick , with similar concepts.<br /><br />Still seems weird and quite amazing that they managed to cast Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. in such a simple small insignificant production as this one is . Guess they were really desperate for work and money.<br /><br />4/10
0 No reason to bother renting this flick . From the opening credits on , I knew I was in trouble.<br /><br />It was filmed as though it was a soft porn movie , but there really is n't anything erotic about it . The look into the world of sex addiction is intriguing , but only to a point.<br /><br />Boring sex scenes , bad plot , and cameos by Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette are n't enough to save this film .
0 This movie could have been a decent B - movie if 3/4 of the the movie was n't so much focusing on the sex scenes . I mean , he 's a sex addict , and I 'm sure that there 's a lot more that goes on with sex addicts outside of having sex on a constant basis . Michael Des Barres did a good job considering what all he had to do , which was n't much . At one point or another , one would have to laugh at him , because his character was so pitiful . Nastassja Kinski was alright in her role as the concerned sex therapist , she could 've of done more though and I 'm not suggesting her having sex . The person that stood out the most to me in this movie was Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as the loving and concerned wife . There 's something about beautiful inside and out that strongly appeals to me . She played that role and as you watched the movie , you start to feel bad for her.<br /><br />"Diary Of A Sex Addict " while not Oscar material or a modern classic to anyone 's standards , is quite informative and does a fair job in showing you how one 's personal demons can take over and ruin the very things in life you think highly of .
0 Sammy Horn ( Michael Des Barres ) is the head chef and owner of a famous restaurant in California . He has a lovely wife , Grace Horn ( Rosanna Arquette ) , who is pregnant , and a beautiful son of about five years old . Sammy indeed loves his family , but like Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde , he has a double life , having sex with many different women . Dr. Jane Bordeaux ( Nastassja Kinski ) is trying to help him . OK , it is my fault : I read the summary of the other IMDB user comments , I saw the IMDB user rating , but I really did not believe that Rosanna Arquette and Nastassja Kinski could participate in such a bad movie . I decided to check it , and actually some comments are very complacent . The storyline , the screenplay and the dialogs are so silly and laughable that even in some X - rated movies we can find more intelligent stories . The photography is so amateurish and naive that in some parts it seems to be taken through a VHS camcorder . Michael Des Barres does not have sense of ridiculous : being an old man , bald , would be acceptable in an advertisement of Viagra or grandfather of the small boy . But as an attractive man who gets and has sex with any woman , it is scary . In Wood Allen 's comedy , maybe he got a chance , but in a ` serious ' movie , it is funny . I am trying to figure out why or how Rosanna Arquette and Nastassja Kinski accepted to participate in such awful , amateurish and trash movie . Do they need money ? Lack of chances in better movies due to their ages ? Are they friends of the ` director ' ( sorry for using this word ) and decided to help and promote him ? I do not know whether the intention of Rosanna Arquette was to show her breasts full of silicone , but it is unacceptable that such a great actress accepts such a script . The same is applicable to the gorgeous Nastassja Kinki . She is presented fat , without make - up , without any glamour . A total lack of respect with one of the most beautiful actress in the cinema history . A fact is really intriguing me : how can a reader , without any personal interest , promote this trash , giving higher ratings or writing favorable comments about this movie ? Are they friends of the ` director ' ( again , I am using this word ... ) or the cast ? It sounds very strange to me that a normal IMDB reader can like such a film . My vote is two.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : ` Viciado Em Sexo ' ( ` Addicted In Sex ' )
0 Race car drivers say that 100 mph seems fast till you 've driven 150 , and 150 mph seems fast till you 've driven 250.<br /><br />OK.<br /><br />Andalusian Dog seems breathtakingly bizarre till you 've seen Eraserhead , and Eraserhead seems breathtakingly bizarre till you 've seen Begotten.<br /><br />And Begotten seems breathtakingly bizarre till you 've seen the works of C. Frederic Hobbs . Race fans , there is NOTHING in all the world of film like the works of C. Frederic Hobbs.<br /><br />Alabama 's Ghost comes as close as any of his films to having a coherent plot , and it only involves hippies , rock concerts , voodoo , ghosts , vampires , robots , magicians , corrupt multinational corporations , elephants and Mystery Gas . And the Fabulous Woodmobile , cruising the Sunset District in San Francisco , of course.<br /><br />What 's really startling is that somebody gave him a LOT of money to make Alabama 's Ghost . There 's sets , lighting , hundreds of extras , costumes , lots and lots of effects . Somehow that makes Alabama 's Ghost SO WRONG . You watch some awful cheeseball like Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby , and at least some part of the weirdness is excusable on the basis that they were obviously making the film off the headroom on their Discover cards . But Alabama 's Ghost was made with an actual budget , and that 's EVIL . I mean , I 've got a script about a tribe of cannibals living in Thunder Bay , Ontario , building a secret temple in the woods out of Twizzlers , and nobody 's beating down MY door waving a checkbook - how did this guy get the funds for FOUR of the flakiest movies ever made ?
0 This is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it , there is a sense of deja vu , do n't be surprised . All they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant . And it does n't get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with . It never works . And like its predecessors , the acting is mediocre.<br /><br />The plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending does n't fit the story . Had this movie ended ten minutes earlier , it would have worked and have been very satisfying and I would have thought it more worthwhile . But here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught . I never like this message resulting from a movie .
0 My god this movie is awfully boring . I am a big fan of Gina Gershon , when I rented this movie I expected a romantic drama , and some great performance from Gershon . Gershon is great as always , but she is not right actress for this role , she is too good for Rade Serbedzija . The romance between Gershon and Serbedzija 's characters is too unconvincing . And I absolutely hated Serbedzija 's character ( a wonman organizer ) , he is not charming in anyway in the movie . How did Dr. Lauren Graham ( Gershon ) is beyond my comprehension . Maybe Sean Connery , Robert DeNiro or Harrison Ford would have done a better job on this role , but they do n't have the European - ish looking I guess . Any way , I was so bored druing the movie . If you are looking for a good Gina Gershon movie , check out Bound , her best film so far . If you are looking for a romantic film about a younger woman and an older man , try some Harrison Ford or Sean Connery movies . Gina Gershon is so underrated , and she deserves better chance than this , I wish her to make better choice in the future .
0 We have an average family . Dad 's a famous rapper , we have the " rebelious teenage daughter " , the adopted white kid , and the cute little kid . And we have careless housemaid , what show has had a housemaid like that ? Do we have a messed - up Brady Bunch ? Yay ! When it first came out I thought it was really cool , mostly because I was young . The music was bad . The raps were so bad and they were too g - rated . All of his raps were about his family and friends and problems . The dad was kind of the " Danny from Full House " type of dad . Always gave the advice out . But he was n't a clean freak . They had a house - keeper for that . Remember ? The plots were basically Lil ' Romeo was in trouble of some sort , or ... not that 's it . Oh and maybe some preteen drama . Yeah that stuff is good . Not really . But its still a good show for kids . But Nikelodean could do better .
0 My title just about sums this heap of crap up I should have taken a hint when I saw it was a Fred olen Ray movie - but i thought ' HEY , IT MIGHT BE BETTER THAN HIS USUAL RUBBISH ' boy , was i wrong ! This has to be the worst movie ever targeted at children . The acting was awful , the humour was non - existent , The Direction was the worst i have ever seen & The special effects would n't seem out of place on a 1950 's Disney movie.<br /><br />WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO DEE - WALLACE STONE ! Who once had such a promising career in the 80 's . Movie veteran & former child actor Russ Tamblyn was a awful bad - guy & the budget was so low it was a totally unbelievable even as a kiddie movie.<br /><br />I have n't seen the sequel made in 1999 and nor do i intend to < br /><br />If you want a good kid movie Watch ' HONEY I SHRUNK / BLEW UP THE KIDS / KID ' OR ANY DISNEY MOVIE < br /><br />MY RATING AS A 19 YO : - 2/10<br /><br />RATING AS A KID MOVIE : - 3/10 AT THE BEST !
0 When this film was released in 1997 the ' special effects ' , such as they are , were poor . They would have been dated even for the 1980s , and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s have had the same or better SFX work . Certainly no - one involved in the production of this film was looking for an Oscar . It 's a wild departure from director Fred Olen Ray 's usual stuff , most of which has the word " Bikini " in the title ( Bikini Pirates , Bikini Chain Gang , Bikini Girls from the Lost Planet , etc ) and are little more than T&A flicks , but here we are with a film rated " U " and aimed squarely at the kiddies . You 've got to give him credit for diversifying ! ! This was a minor direct - to - video cult hit which later resulted in a couple of sequels - Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad . Dee Wallace - Stone ( whose career went downhill fast after 1982s " E.T. ) plays the ' invisible mom ' of the films title and would return for the sequel . Russ Tamblyn ( whose career had been in free - fall even longer since 1961s " West Side Story " ) plays the villainous Dr. Woorter . It 's probably fair to say that most of the cast were at the point in their careers where they would be prepared to work on almost anything just to pay the bills that month - except maybe young Trenton Knight as Josh . It 's rather telling though that although he worked prior to this movie , this child actor did n't work again after the sequel , " Invisible Mom 2 " . Maybe the film was cursed . After all , he was n't that bad in this film . For a child actor , he 's pretty good - no better or worse than any of his more experienced co - stars.<br /><br />As mentioned above , the " invisibility " effects are naff to say the least , the direction is poor , the writing obvious and the acting nothing to write home about . There are plenty of worse films out there though , and for anyone under the age of about ten , this film will no doubt be quite watchable . Most adults will probably want to do a disappearing act of their own while it is on though , and I would n't blame them one bit !
0 Boy oh boy oh golly gee,<br /><br />The most interesting thing in the movie was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create Mom 's " invisibility . " They looked like they were shot on cheap video , and it looks totally unreal , and not even in a good way where its so funny that you end up loving the movie ... <br /><br />I did NOT end up loving this movie . The attempted " steadicam " shots were really pathetic as well . I mean , hey , if they had a low budget flick , that 's fine . You can still make a great movie with a low budget . But , a BAD movie and a low budget AND effects . That makes for a bad combination . In this case , such a doomed combo created the craptastic film , " Invisible Mom . " If you have kids , and your kids have no taste , perhaps they will stay awake through all of this one .
0 When the movie was released it was the biggest hit and it soon became the Blockbuster . But honestly the movie is a ridiculous watch with a plot which glorifies a loser . The movie has a Tag - line - " Preeti Madhura , Tyaga Amara " which means Love 's Sweet but Sacrifice is Immortal . In the movie the hero of the movie ( Ganesh ) sacrifices his love for the leading lady ( Pooja Gandhi ) even though the two loved each other ! His justification is the meaning of the tag - line . This movie influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this " Loser - like Sacrificial " attitude very thoughtful and hence became the cult movie it is , when they could have moved on with their lives . Ganesh 's acting in the movie is Amateurish , Crass and Childishly stupid . He actually looks funny in a song , ( Onde Ondu Sari ... ) when he 's supposed to look all stylish and cool . His looks do n't help the leading role either . His hair style is badly done in most part of the movie . POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT . Her costumes are horrendous in the movie and very inconsistent . < br /><br />The good part about the movie is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music by Mano Murthy which are actually the true saving graces of the movie . Also the lyrics by Jayant Kaikini are very well penned . The Director Yograj Bhat has to be lauded picturization the songs in a tasteful manner . < br /><br />Anyway all - in - all except for the songs , the movie is a very ordinary one ! ! ! ! ! !
0 Chillers starts on a cold , dark stormy night as a bus drops off three passenger 's outside a bus station , a young boy named Mason ( Jesse Emery ) , a college professor Dr. Howard Conrow ( David Wohl ) & a woman named Sharon Phillips ( Laurie Pennington ) . Inside they discover that they have missed their connecting bus & are stranded for the night . In the waiting area they find two other people , Ronnie ( Jim Wolf ) & a sleeping woman named Lindsay ( Marjorie Fitzsimmons ) who is currently having a terrifying nightmare ... <br /><br />While swimming in an indoor pool Lindsay encounters & befriends guy named Billy Waters ( Jesse Johnson ) , the next time Lindsay sees Billy he dives into the pool & then seemingly disappears into thin air before he surfaces . Shortly after Lindsay discovers that Billy Water died in a diving accident 5 years ago ... <br /><br />Lindsay wakes up & tells the others about her nightmare , everyone else responds by saying that they too have suffered disturbing dreams recently & decide to share them to pass the time ... <br /><br />Next up is Mason who tells a story of how he & two friends , Scott ( David R. Hamm ) & Jimmy ( Will Tuckwiller ) , are terrorised during a camping trip ... <br /><br />Then it 's Sharon whose story revolves around a newsman named Tom Williams ( Thom Delventhal ) who she phones up , in no time at all Tom is at her front door but he actually turns out to be a Vampire ... <br /><br />It 's Ronnie 's turn next & he describes how he discovers that he can bring the dead back to life , unfortunately he brings executed mass murderer Nelson Caulder ( Bradford Boll ) back to homicidal life ... <br /><br />Finally Dr. Conrow tells a tale of how two of his students brought an ancient Aztec war - god named Ixpe ( Kimberly Harbour ) back to life ... <br /><br />Then it 's back to the bus station for one last ( predictable ) twist ... <br /><br />Written , produced & directed by Daniel Boyd Chillers is one of the worst horror anthologies I 've ever seen & I usually really like this sub - genre . The script by Boyd lacks what is needed for films such as Chillers to work , you can see the final twist coming a mile off & each story is really lame . The first one is totally pointless & did n't seem to have an ending & the best thing about these anthologies are the short snappy stories that are rounded off with a neat twist . The second story is predictable & , again , just ends without any payoff . So it continues throughout Chillers that each story is deeply unsatisfying to watch & have no reward for doing so . The character 's & dialogue are poorly written , the stories seem to have no original ideas of their own & as a whole the film totally sucks . At least each story does n't last long & I liked the idea behind the linking segments.<br /><br />Director Boyd was obviously working with a very low budget & it shows . All I can say is if you want to watch a 15 odd minute short story set entirely within a swimming pool then Chillers is for you . The stories are neither clever , scary or have any sort of tension or build up to anything . Having said that it does have a few nice scenes & some surprising competence shines through on occasion . Violence & gore wise there is n't much happening in Chillers , a ripped out heart , a decapitated head & a bitten off hand is as gory as it gets.<br /><br />Technically Chillers is poor stuff that wo n't impress anyone . Basic cinematography , bad music , cheap special effects & below average production values . Chillers also features one of the worst closing theme songs ever , period . The acting is also of a very low standard.<br /><br />I am sure a lot of effort was put into Chillers as a low budget film & at least the filmmakers tried so I will give credit for that at least , but that still does n't stop me from thinking it 's crap . Similar anthology films like Tales From the Crypt ( 1972 ) , Asylum ( 1972 ) , The Vault of Horror ( 1973 ) , Dr. Terror 's House of Horrors ( 1965 ) , Creepshow ( 1982 ) & Tales From the Darkside : The Movie ( 1990 ) are far superior to Chillers so watch one of those instead .
0 Five passengers at a bus depot tell each other their scary dreams while waiting to be picked up . But is there more to these nightmares than meets the eye?<br /><br />Lucky me , five bad movies for the price of one ! Each segment features the very worst in acting , special effects , make up and music . And these were supposed to be scary ? Hmm .. I think I 've been more freaked out during an episode of Teletubbies . I swear , you 'll sit there like I was , bored to tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen . Do n't bother . It never does . In fact , I even stopped fast forwarding the commercials , as they were a good deal more entertaining than the main feature . AND the ending is the ultimate cop - out . Yep , none of this actually ever happened . If only the same could be said for the day I set my VCR to record this cobblers .. 2/10
0 Going into this I was expecting anything really good , but after the damage this inflexed on me , I 'm just happy to think strait . It 's hard to think what the film - makers ( HA ! ) this was a good movie . the stories , and I use the world loosely , are incoherent and do make any sense at all . There just stupid things that happen at random . the acting , if can be called acting is horrible I 've seen batter acting in toy ads ! I know it 's a low - budget video - bin garbages , but still even it 's not like they tried . Will after stetting thought it , I feel very sleepy and still # yawws # do , I 'm going to go lie down.<br /><br />WARNNING : DO NOT ATEMP TO DRIVE , WALK , READ OR DO ANY AFTER Watching CHILLERS . OTHER SIDE AFFECTTS MAY ENGULED LOSE OF ANY OR ALL METAL FUNKIONS .
0 OK well i found this movie in my dads old pile of movies and it looked pretty good from the cover but the movie actually sucked ! ! OK the first story with the swimmer was pretty good but it took a while to get into , then the one with the boy was completely retarded ! It was n't even scary ! His dream sounds like a little kid 's bedtime story . Then the news girls one was completely retarded too . I 'm sure someones going to call up the news guy and ask him to go out with you . But that one ended cool where she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on t.v and he said all that junk to her . Next was that pretty gay story about the guy who brought back the dead people .. OMG its so stupid I 'm not even going to say any more about it . The last one was the best . It was n't that scary but the idea of the story was pretty cool .. uh yeah the girl gets possessed and she kills all her classmates or something . Then when they 're all done telling their dreams to each other the losers get on the bus ( TO HELL AHAHAHAH ) and they see all the people from their dreams on the bus(Ha ) . The End .
0 " John Hughes ' son wrote a high school drama ! Wow ! " I thought as I checked the flick 's info here on IMDb , late on a Saturday night , having found myself watching the opening credits on BBC2.<br /><br />I've just finished watching it , and sadly it was downhill from there on . Arguably you ca n't spoil a film this poor , but I 'll leave the spoilers out of this review ... < br /><br />There 's an awful lot of style over very little substance : unfortunately the style has n't dated too well in the eight years since its release . As for the substance , the film tries to pose an interesting look at the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school - life ; but beneath the shiny veneer , a remotely meaningful or relevant argument fails to materialise . Characters are painted in childishly broad strokes , falling into the kind of generic stereotypes the writer 's father sought to question in Breakfast Club . < br /><br />Director Kyle Cooper does a decent job keeping the pace up ( perhaps relying a little too much on montages of information , which soon becomes a tiresome device , but at least pushes the story along ) , but his efforts do n't sufficiently detract from the poor script and bizarre casting ( how anyone is supposed to side with ' Maddox ' , when Blake Shields gurns and glowers his way through the part , I just ca n't understand ) , not to mention the numerous gaping plot holes ( I 'm all for creative license , but when the " bad guys " know the identities of the " good guys " making their lives a misery , but fail to act in any way to stop them , you really have to wonder why this script did n't undergo another few re - drafts before production - did Daddy even read it?).<br /><br />I'm sure a younger audience might get some enjoyment from this film ( and all power to them ) , but they 're really better off sticking with Hughes Sr . 's high school output , and if the idea of school - time rebellion is what really appeals , the 1968 classic " If ... " is a much more satisfying examination of the subject .
0 The guy did a lot of title design for a bunch of movies and I guess one day he said ; I should pick a cheap scenario , try to put as much title in it as a can ( cause after all i 'm a title designer ) and try to persuade people that this is in fact a movie . One of the worst i 've even seen that 's for sure . If you fell the urge to see nice titles , go check out some posters do n't waste your time watching this.<br /><br />It kinda ironic do n't you think , did you saw the poster ? the only part of his project that SHOULD had title work done have almost none !
0 OK , not possibly , honestly the worst movie i 've ever seen.<br /><br />this made absolutely no sense , there was no plot , no characterization , no acting , just nothing.<br /><br />here 's what i thought when i first saw it may 28th , 2003 * * caution , this is a spoiler alert . it 's also alot of me complaining about how bad the movie is::<br /><br />ok so the movie begins and the characters are introduced , but there is no character explanation . as far as i knew the main character was new to this school , but apparently not . also it appeared that he lived by himself ... then that he was a foster kid ... then that his mother was a raging alcoholic who lived with him still . also all his friends apparently had no parents and lived by themselves.<br /><br />now we come to a main plot point , this insane guy has broken out of the insane asylum and is running rampant . now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focus ' intently on him for the contingency of the movie . i think i must have missed a main plot element here , there was no REASON for the main character to get hooked . even if that 's the point , having no reason , why do all his friends , who are skeptical like 5 minutes before , suddenly follow him and do what he wants.<br /><br />so the movie continues on , and it gets all right . they 're running havoc on the school , blah blah blah . but wait a minute ... suddenly everyone knows that the main character is running the ' show ' here . wait a second , did n't the insane guy specifically tell the main character NOT to do that ? it was supposed to be anynomous.<br /><br />ah another important plot element has been skipped over ... the insane guy was supposed to not be insane ... everyone said he was n't insane . but as the story goes on , he is VERY CLEARLY OUT OF HIS MIND . but i thought the news people said he was n't ... hm ... <br /><br />now the movie comes to a close . THAT WAS THE CLOSE ? WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ? not only did the ending not answer any questions about the main character , it did n't answer any questions about the insane guy . are these people in the same situation ? if yes , then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend to this . if no then what is the point in saying " that 's you in two weeks."??<br /><br />*end of the thing ... *<br /><br />that 's what i thought then . that is pretty much what i still think now . it 's 6 months down the line , and if i can get it for free , i might give it another chance , but i doubt it . i highly doubt it .
0 I 'm still trying to figure out if there was a point to this film.<br /><br />For content that 's supposed to be so ' rebellious ' and ' controversial ' the things that Maddox distributes to the students are awfully lame . Students seem to be easily swayed by vague anti - authoritarian sentiments and snippets of words illegibly scrawled onto leaflets . Rebel , everybody.<br /><br />I suppose it would have been too much to ask to have a teenage rebellion film where a school fire alarm does n't get set off.<br /><br />Apparently a ' huge fight up on the football fields ' is a fight that consists of two people.<br /><br />Characters personalities seem to wildly vary at random . A football jock who Maddox was fighting ( and who subsequently got a staple on the face ) is all smiles and apologies the next day.<br /><br />The fact that it does n't come to any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could have been fitted into a half hour after school special . If they had cut most of the attempted pseudo - glitch soundtrack .
0 this film is terrible . The characters are completely unbelievable , and wildly inconsistent . The plot is awful and some of the classroom scenes are cringe - worthy and make for uncomfortable viewing.<br /><br />In fact the quality of the script and characterisation would suggest that this film was written by high school students , only the utter lack of credibility to the school environment would suggest that , in fact , the writers probably never went to high school . The acting in most cases was weak too , although a lot of this was down to a poor script and plot , i am not sure that any actors could have made this film watchable.<br /><br />having said that the sound track was OK , and the cinematography was nice in places ( although the editing was poor ) .
0 About five minutes in , and I saw where this was heading . Bunch of high school kids get annoyed by the school 's administration and thoughts of rebellion start fomenting . I said to my girlfriend : if it gets below a 5 on IMDb , I 'll go and read a book . It got 5.0 , so she persuaded me to go on watching . What are the good things ? Well , it is a good thing this film does not have a story , because you would surely be distracted from it by the editing . It 's like the student 's drawing that was torn up by one of the teachers , all the footage for this film was cut up in a freak accident involving a meat - grinder , and left half the stock destroyed , with the other half spliced into two - second bits . Even in a ten - second scene of the local TV news , there are about six cuts and three different angles . And then there are the montages . These are all set to electronic music , which forewarns you of yet another montage , so that like Pavlov 's dog you start cringing every time you hear it , which is about every three minutes . Oh , I was supposed to say what 's good about this film . Well , the film was shot very well , with a nice color palette , that nicely matched the emotional content - such as there was - of the scenes . Okay , now with the film 's major flaw , and it was n't the story , or lack thereof . The director made that fatal mistake of leading you astray about people and situations , not by clever storytelling , but by being highly selective about what to show about the main characters . That 's just cheating . I guess he did it in order to make the central character more likable . But it just became plain annoying . If the story is full of holes , it 's no good trying to patch it up by misdirecting the viewer . And often there was n't even any point to it . And then the ending . Basically , the main villain of the peace turns out be an okay guy , if a coward . Plus it turns what seemed to be the whole point of the movie , that you should stand up for a just cause on its head , by the already mentioned misdirection , and makes it into a point about the nature of revolutions , that was already made , and much better , by animal farm . It also committed what I call the Bill Cosby sin : no matter how things may seem at first , in the end adults are always right , and children always wrong . And let 's face it : unless you 're me , that 's just not true .
0 I came to NEW PORT SOUTH expecting a surrogate movie about the Columbine school massacre similar to Gus Van Sant 's ELEPHANT and certainly the synopsis in the TV guide stating that a student sociopath rebels against the system did give me that impression but this is a very boring movie where little happens so consider yourself warned < br /><br />The story is about Maddox , a Chicago high school student who decides to strike back at what he perceives to be an authoritarian regime . The major problem is that the character is underwritten and the actor who plays him Blake Shields is unable to embellish any script deficiencies . You have the gut feeling that Maddox should have the evil charisma of Hitler , Saddam or Bin Laden but he never comes across as anything more than a petulant truculent teenager and it 's impossible to believe he could rally any disciples . The subtext of you overthrow one manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious which means NEW PORT SOUTH is an entirely unconvincing drama that 's not worth going out of your way to see
0 This is one of the most irritating , nonsensical movies I 've ever had the misfortune to sit through . Every time it started to look like it might be getting good , out come more sepia tone flashbacks , followed by paranoid idiocy masquerading as social commentary . The main character , Maddox , is a manipulative , would - be rebel who lives in a mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility . The supporting cast are all far more likeable and interesting , but are unfortunately never developed . Nor do we ever really understand the John Stanton character supposedly influencing Maddox to commit the acts of rebellion . At one point , I thought " Aha ! Maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient Stanton ! Now we 're getting somewhere ! " but of course , that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie turns out to be pointless , both from Maddox 's perspective and the viewer 's . Where 's Ferris Bueller when we need him ?
0 This movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong . i really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add which was funny as hell but the movie was n't half as good.<br /><br />The weird part is that the jokes are actually funny , the spoofs of the smoking ban , Jo Bole ... etc . are genuinely good jokes but i do n't know whom to blame this movie flop on.<br /><br />The prime candidates may be:- 1 ) The hammers ( actors ) and hammeresses ( actresses ) and not even the funny kind 2 ) The director 3)The guy who cast the actors and/or the director Anyway if you are really really bored and i mean really see this movie , or else get a copy of each and every ad or teaser of this movie and laugh your butt of because those will be far funnier than the film.<br /><br />p.s the only saving grace of this film is mahesh manjrekar and the funny chappu bhai
0 lets start off by saying that " JAWANI DIWANI " is just a pathetic movie . I agree with the last person who said " I missed the joyride " . lol . < br /><br />The jokes were just terrible . Performances were average . Something went terribly wrong with the film . Emraan totally deserved something better . All CELINA JAITLEY did was expose . Hrishitta bhatt was OK . Emraan hashmi was OK too.<br /><br />MANN ( EMRAAN HASHMI)is a desperate guy who wants to become famous . therefore , he uses RADHA and pretends he loves her , only because her father is a music director and could help him become famous ( since , the father obeys everything his daughter says ) . One day , MANN and his friends go to GOA to have some fun . There he meets ROMA ( CELINA JAITLEY ) and totally falls for her looks and tries to flirt with her BLA BLA BLA . < br /><br />Then , that night ROMA can not open the door to her room , and MANN decides to help her . Seeing that he can not as well , ROMA goes to ask for help . While she is gone , MANN is able to open the door and decides to come inside and sits on her bed BLA BLA BLA . ROMA comes in and they have a one night stand . However , in that one night- stand ROMA falls in love with him . That morning , they spot the underworld don ( MAHESH)who sees it all . The don loves ROMA and could n't stand what he saw . He orders them to get married , and being frightened , MANN obeys the order and Merry 's ROMA . Then , their marriage news ends up in the newspaper . MANN is later finds out that he loves ROMA after they do a music video together . He is now trapped between love and fame . BLA BLA BLA.<br /><br />the movie is horrible . The songs " SINI NE SINI NE " is fantastic the remix version is even better . " DIL DIWANA " is also great . The title track is also awesome . GUYS , AVOID WATCHING THIS MOVIE .
0 This movie was absolutely pathetic . A pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes . At times I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead . I could n't even sit through the whole movie . Emran Hashmi disappoints , and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all . Celina Jaitley was not bad . The only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on Anu Malik and his obsession of shayaris . It was pretty hilarious . The songs " Sini Ne " and its remix version were really good . You can always count on Emran lip - locking and lip - synching a chartbuster . All in all , it seems Emran does n't have a good script from the Bhatts to back him up this time .
0 Okay the promos promised a comedy and people(few ) went to watch it Being the first release of 2006 is not a bad thing , or for that matter of any year , because the first and last films mostly flop except GHAJINI and some more < br /><br />Okay coming to JAWANI DIWANI < br /><br />Review in short The film is about Emraan Hashmi doing his usual stuff sadly it 's annoying this time after repetitions It has an irritating Hrishita Bhatt and a flop Celina Jaitley < br /><br />Cringeworthy dialogues , comedy scenes and badly handled drama and lots of loopholes < br /><br />Direction is bad Emraan Hashmi is annoying here , luckily now he is coming of age But post FOOTPATH and MURDER and some decent work in some more films the actor in him took a backseat and directors focused on his kisses and womaniser image which sadly lost it 's touch after repetitions Hrishita and Celina are bad Mahesh is horrible
0 God this film was just so boring apart from the music which i really loved , i mean what was the point in actually making this movie please anyone who reads this review do not watch this film , it is a waste of time.<br /><br />Emraan can act but was really pathetic In this film , i am actually ashamed to be one of his fans especially in this movie , it was just really bad.<br /><br />Celina is just another pretty face with no lack of talent what so ever , she ca n't act at all , and there was no point of her being in this film , as for the other girl Radha she was okay i guess but could have done better.<br /><br />what a waste of time . please buy the great music and do n't watch this movie .
0 A movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself , Blue Juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and Cornwall . Sean Pertwee is the real star of this film , while the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays his girlfriend and Ewan Mcgregor plays his drug addicted pal.<br /><br />For those who do n't like surfing or Cornwall in the slightest , you 'll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting . The beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes . Plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional . The plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they 're put in.<br /><br />Only Ewan , Sean and Catherine 's characters make this a film worth being on videotape , which is why it was only released on videotape in the US after Ewan and Catherine reached mainstream fame .
0 Note to self- just because a film is foreign , obscure , and stars Catherine Zeta - Jones does n't mean it 's any good . Such is the case with ' Blue Juice , ' a 1995 Brit flick about an unlikely group of surfing enthusiasts in what would seem ( to a dumb American , anyway ) an even more unlikely place to find surfers : Cornwall , England . You might be thinking this has the makings for an amusing , quirky little comedy . If only . The film is just a bit over ninety minutes but it seems interminable . The easiest way to describe it is as a sort of ' 90 's British version of ' Grease ' without the dancing , but even that makes it sound better than it is . No , the best way to take it is as a little slice - of - life set in a small town . Catherine Zeta - Jones plays Chloe , a young woman living with a surfing instructor , JC ( Sean Pertwee ; you remember him ) . Pertwee is actually the film 's star , and his character is something of a surfing legend to a small group of surfing devotees , the requisite oddball group of free spirits that inevitably inhabit films like this . In this case , it consists of a drug dealer who wants to be a journalist , a former nightclub dj who wants to be a record producer , and a fat nerdy guy who , in a needlessly extended scene , gets stoned and loses all his inhibitions which of course turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to him . I ca n't honestly say everything that goes on in ' Blue Juice ' is predictable , since it 's set in a place and reflects customs and manners I 'm not very familiar with , but there 's certainly nothing surprising or even interesting that takes place there or with the characters . The comedy , though , IS very predictable and tired . One can sense the set - ups a mile away and almost recite the dialogue ( in American form , of course ) before the actors do . The relationship between JC and Chloe is every bit as hackneyed . She wants him to grow up ; he wants them to stay the impetuous teenagers they started out being . He 's afraid of losing face with his gang ; she thinks he prefers them to her . You get the idea . As I struggled to stay focused on ' Blue Juice , ' toward the end I felt , as the saying goes , that this was an hour and half of my life I 'd never get back .
0 The only thing worse than surfers without any waves is a film about surfers without any waves . For viewers who love surfing this film will be a gigantic disappointment since the total number of minutes of surfing footage struggles to reach three.<br /><br />The story is a slice of life about beached surfers who are waiting not for the perfect wave , but for any wave at all . J.C. ( Sean Pertwee ) is an aging super surfer who is flirting with a commitment with his girlfriend Chloe ( Catherine Zeta Jones ) . Just as he is about to find grown up bliss with the woman he loves , three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves at the Bone Yard . The trouble is , there are no waves until the very end of the film , so most of the story dissipates itself on a meandering succession of disconnected beach happenings.<br /><br />The acting is mostly mediocre . Sean Pertwee has a few comical moments , but mostly his acting was mundane . Ewan McGregor was decent as the drug dealing wild man , by far the most interesting and peculiar character of the bunch . Probably the funniest performance was turned in by Peter Gunn as Terry who turned his corpulent body into a continual sight gag . Catherine Zeta - Jones was sexy as usual , but her character did n't really have enough meat for her to show much acting ability.<br /><br />There is really not much here on which to comment . I rated it a 3/10 . It 's a real beach bummer .
0 I chose this movie by the cover which was a bad move . It was n't funny at all and the main characters were obnoxious . The girl was beautiful but the story and the acting were terrible . It had absolutely nothing to do with surfing . Terrible movie with a surf " theme " that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers . Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the movie will probably see a resurgence just becuase she is in the limelight now , being married with Gordon Gekko and all , but if you have n't seen it do n't waste your time . A bad movie with GREAT surfing , REAL surfers and AMAZING , BEAUTIFUL cinematography was IN GOD 'S HANDS .
0 Be warned : Neither Zeta - Jones nor McGregor plays the main part as the poster would have you believe . Their roles are in fact minor.<br /><br />The film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama , with neither being really engaging . Especially I find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist , not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fianc√© . The plot drags terribly , and I turned this one off after about 2/3 - unusual for me , as I like to finish what I start . The good acting and beautiful setting takes it from 1 to 2 stars.<br /><br />2/10
0 I saw this dull waste of time on HBO 's Comedy Channel , so I quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy . But there is absolutely nothing funny here . A good cast is basically wasted on a script that I could have written with my left butt - cheek - after it had been beaten senseless by 15th - century Inquisition torturers . The first half is particularly bad , as it has some of the most dull , pointless dialogue I 've come across in a while , and zero comma zero plot to speak of . Just the fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta - Jones are in this little movie and yet this film has less than 1000 votes on this site , should tell you everything . A couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold British coast , but that 's about it.<br /><br />This is the sort of movie that gets made just because the people who wrote it have good connections ( family connections , preferably ) and/or plenty of cash lying around .
0 This has to be the worst , and I mean worst biker movie ever made ! And that 's saying a lot because the line of stinkers is long and smelly!<br /><br />Now at least we know what happened to Ginger after she was rescued from Gilligan 's Island ! A frightened looking Tina Louise(she was probably afraid someone would see this mess!)is a stranded motorist who is tormented by the most repulsive motorcycle gang in film history . But , do n't worry fans ! Batman , I mean Adam West as a hick - town doctor comes to the rescue ! Pow ! Crush ! Boom ! Holy Toledo Batman ! < br /><br />The only good points of this " bomb " are some cute women , some laughable fight scenes , and the still " sexy " Tina Louise !
0 How sad to see the beautiful and talented Tina Louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a film . Tina still looked fit and attractive , but for some reason seems truly frightened . I can understand her fear ; fearing that this 3rd rate stinker would somehow be released to the general public . Also , I 'm a fan of the likable Adam West . Again , as with Tina , Adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age . His acting here is passable , but the script is so bad , that it 's difficult to even listen to the dialog.<br /><br />The movie is a rip - off of the classic Brando biker flick , The Wild Ones ; out - law biker gang is out - of - control in a small hick - town . The bikers here look like a motley group and I sure would n't want them to date my sister . The acting is stiff and wooden , and the story - plot is as old as sand . Hellriders is hell to watch !
0 I was prepared to laugh throughout this movie like a Mystery Science Theater experiment , but it was just boring . It appears that the producers had many biker enthusiast friends , and from there casually decided to make a movie . < br /><br />It is frequently unwatchable . Lots of footage of the bikers riding on a dirt road , with the same music played repeatedly . Unfortunately , Renee Harmon is barely in the movie . Harmon probably would have livened things up . Perhaps she had other commitments the day this was filmed.<br /><br />Of course , the bikers terrorize a small town . Fights , murder , a cowardly cop , a goofy mechanic , etc . One of the bikers always wears a football helmet , a weak attempt to distinguish him from all the other outlaws.<br /><br />The script has nothing to offer . One scene features a biker assaulting a woman , yelling in the lady 's face " You 're all the same ! You 're all the same ! " . We come back to the scene a minute later and he again declares " You 're all the same ! " . Could n't the writer think of something more creative to say??<br /><br />At the end the good guys have killed the bad guys . We also learn that the wedding between middle - aged mechanic Joe and young Susie has been canceled . Susie is going away to college , and we abruptly learn that Joe 's wedding is still on ( but with a different bride ) . End .
0 This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made . Even for a biker movie , it 's rock bottom . The minimal plot involves a gang of bikers taking over a small town ( how original ! ) and the townspeople 's attempts to fight them off . Why do n't they call for outside help ? Who knows ? The fight scenes are obviously fake . Adam West and Tina Louise are in it but both have little to do and both look ashamed to be there ( understandably ) This movie belongs in the trash heap !
0 What else can you say about this movie , except that it 's plain awful . Tina Louise and Adam West are the reasons why to see this , but , that 's it , but their talents are wasted in this junk . I think that they used a double in some of Adam 's scenes , like when he 's running because you ca n't see his face . If Adam was embarrassed in being in Zombie Nightmare , just think what he must 've felt about appearing in this ? ? ? If it was before or after , I'm not sure , but , still , Zombie Nightmare is a classic(check out the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version first and last)compared to this . The gang is very annoying and over - acting by some of the actors . A rip - off of The Wild One starring Marlon Brando , of course . Tina looks stunning though . I hope her and Adam got a good paycheck ! ! Pass !
0 Just bought the VHS on this film for two bucks , Did I waste my money ! Hey , I dig Adam " Batman " West and Tina " Giligan 's Island " Louise , but hello ! This third rate production is a rehash of a dozen other biker films ; crazed bunch of bikers psychos ride into a hick town , beat up everybody and everything , and then are defeated in the man by a dashing hero . Adam West looks the part as a hero , but he 's missing cape , and his Batman uniform . Sorry , just is n't the same . Tina L. looks really nervous and frightened the whole show , but at least we know what happened to " Ginger " once she was rescued from the island ... LOL ! The bikers are a motley group , and known of them ever acted again or at least should n't have . Hell Riders is Hell to Watch !
0 First of all , the reason I 'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave his usual fantastic performance as Lieutenant Columbo . He alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie.<br /><br />I was initially all fired up at reading one poster 's comment that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave " the performance of his career . " To me , it was the abysmal performance by Stevens that absolutely ruined this movie , and so I was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment . Then I thought to myself , what else has Stevens done ? So I checked and , you know , that person was absolutely right . In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made , apparently every one of the 33 projects that Stevens has been in since then has been utter crap , so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career.<br /><br />If you like Columbo , see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one . Do yourself a favor and save the worst for last .
0 This is possibly the worst of all the Columbo movies . Andrew Stevens ' acting is poor as the villain , and the plot is weak . In fact none of the cast seem able to act other than Peter Falk , who puts in a creditable performance as the Lieutenant .
0 Aaron Spelling produced this made for television western that gets awfully plotty for a seventy three minute film . It plays like a probable failed series pilot.<br /><br />Handsome Clint Walker is U.S. Marshal Dave Harmon , who wanders into Yuma , Arizona Territory in time to kill one of the brothers of the local bigwig rancher who is out on a trail drive.<br /><br />Walker takes the other brother to jail . Walker also meets a " cute " homeless Mexican kid who sleeps at the jailhouse . One night , Andres is snoozing when a villain and another man dressed in Army blue take the remaining brother into the street and kill him , pinning the murder on Walker . Not good for your first twenty four hours on the job . Walker visits the local Army fort , and rankles the chains of the commander . The bigwig hears of his brothers ' deaths , and rides back to town in time to get his chains rankled as well . The local native population , who get short changed by the Army on their beef , also get rankled in the chains area . With all these chains getting rankled , Walker still has time to woo the local hotel owner . The Army guy involved in the murder ends up dead , the local cattle buyer is implicated , the indians do a lot of hesitant speechifying , and the climax brings about an unlikely showdown as Walker must prove to the town that the villainous cattle buyer had a boss , someone we have suspected as being too helpful all along.<br /><br />There is a semi - subplot involving the death of Walker 's family at the hands of Army raiders , and I think this would have been the force behind the series , had it been picked up . Instead , the film ends abruptly , and I kept waiting for scenes from next week 's exciting episode . Because of the fade outs for nonexistent commercial breaks , the pacing is all off on this and its story jumps in fits.<br /><br />Walker is handsome , rugged , and has a voice deeper than a well . The rest of the cast is full of television actors you have probably seen in other television movies . Much of the action is pretty lame , and the violence is tepid . The first brother killed gets a shotgun blast midtorso , and falls without a scratch on him . I did not expect " Reservoir Dogs , " but this is the wrong film to use to teach children about the evil of guns ! Speaking of children , the Mexican kid here goes from " cute " to " aneurysm inducing annoyance " very quickly.<br /><br />If you dislike westerns , then you will dislike " Yuma . " If you like westerns , then you will still dislike " Yuma . " I can not recommend it.<br /><br />This is unrated , but contains physical violence and gun violence.<br /><br / >
0 Sunshine is a European import set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980 , it 's the epic story of Hungarian Jews , the Sonnenschein family . This name literally translates to Sunshine . The family has humble beginnings , then is prosperous , becomes upwardly mobile , changes it 's name , and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally . The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations ; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles . For those who missed the WW - II and the Holocaust in Europe , the Sonnenschein ' approach to life does n't work out very well.<br /><br />Sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success , but it is an opportunity missed . The story line , dominated by world history , is predictable and transparent ; this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage . The family ' plot ' lurches from one predictable event [ ie . the Hapsburgs , WW - I , WW - II , Fascism , Communism , etc . ] to the next with little continuity , depth or detail . The Jewish assimilation theme is unfocused , and important sub - themes [ the ' secret ' diary and family philosophy ] that could have given the family character and credibility are l ost until the very end . Alternatively , the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest / infidelity.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material . The " 3 for 1 " casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater . Sunshine is basically Hungarian " History Channel " material . It has the look and feel of Winds of War morphed with Forrest Gump morphed with Something About Sex.<br /><br / >
0 In order to hold the public 's attention for three hours , we were treated not so much to a family 's romp through four generations and 120 years of Hungarian history , as to sexual liaisons with a sister , a sister - in - law and other adulteries . Oh yes , there was also a totally gratuitous rape . Having said all this , the first story of the relationship among the children of the patriarch was fresh and sensual - thanks to Jennifer Ehle .
0 What a long , drawn - out , pointless movie . I 'm sure that historically this film is delightful but as entertainment goes it just does n't make the grade . Ralph Fiennes has been in some fantastic movies , the English Patient , Schindler 's List , but this one was such a let - down . It did n't seem to be going anywhere , his character at the beginning was so shallow and uptight it amazes me that his " sister " would ever have been interested at all . Do n't bother paying to rent this movie , buy yourself a copy of the English Patient instead .
0 This is a film of immense appeal to a relatively well - defined group ( of which I am not a part ) . I went to a preview of this movie not knowing what to expect - I ultimately found it disappointing . The history of a dreadfully dysfunctional ( oftentimes downright " twisted " ) Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup of tea . An epic saga like this should really provide its viewers with something more in the end . Ultimately , pictures such as this are about the human condition - this picture cast almost no new light on any of its more meaningful facets .
0 NOTE TO ALL DIRECTORS : Long is not necessarily good . This movie is incredibly long . However not good . The scenes were drawn out way , way , way , way , way too long . The sex scenes were unnecessary , and often too long . The movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional , but alas it became so boringly long that I can only give it a 2 of 10 . It is way below average.<br /><br />Some other problems also exist in this marathon . < br /><br />1 ) Ralph Fiennes plays a whole family tree . The guy who played the Great - grandfather looks nothing like him , but the Grandfather , Father and the son ( who gives us constant unneeded voice over ) are all Ralph Fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull - headed personality . No one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last , even though photos of them are being snapped at every turn . This one is minor , but if the movie had n't been 3 weeks long it would n't have been so annoying.<br /><br />2 ) The fact that no news from Germany was even whispered for the longest time about Jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous . Some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed . The uncle in France would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave.<br /><br />3 ) The love stories in this movie are totally wrong . You are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short . Suddenly ... people are in love and almost instantly ... married . Then having children . Then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships . This again would not have stuck out so much in a 2 hour movie , but with time spent nothing was given to us.<br /><br />4 ) The ending was just bad . I do n't want to spoil it for anyone , but you wo n't like it either ... unless you are sadistic.<br /><br />The director / writer should be tortured with having to watch this bloated garbage on a weekly basis , I mean endless loop , oops they are the same thing . < br /><br />I wonder if Robert Redford did anything for this movie , I mean I think Istvan Szabo must be modeling his directing career after him . Long drawn out movie which totally ruins any substance in the movie . A short description of ' The Horse Whisperer ' , and Sunshine.<br /><br />Sunshine , perfect title . If you start watching while the sun is shining it will quite possibly be well after dark when you leave .
0 < br /><br />Back in his youth , the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin , but his family forbid it . Many decades later , the old man has raised three children ( two boys and one girl ) , and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children .

0 The sun should set on this movie , forever.<br /><br />It goes on forever ( which is n't usually a bad thing - The English Patient , Schindler 's List ) but is SO tedious . The aging of the actors is unbelievable and so is the drawn - out never - ending story line which really seems to go nowhere.<br /><br />In short , a waste of talent and film .
0 Wow . I read about this movie and it sounded so awful that I had to see it , and my gosh , I can smell it in St Louis . Where do I start ? National Lampoons was trying to follow up 5 years later on the success of Animal House , but they completely missed the mark . I 'll go chronologically with these short flicks.<br /><br />Short Film # 1 < br /><br />Poor Peter Riegert ( Boon from Animal House ) . Apparently , he was n't working back then , so the boys at National Lampoons probably called and said " hey , we 're making a c**ppy movie , wanna be in it ? " Peter was like " well , I 'm not doing much these days , why not ? " He was a great side character in Animal House , but he could n't carry this sorry short flop for 5 minutes.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER The premise is funny enough , with Jason Cooper ( Riegert ) telling his wife to leave him , she needs to find herself . It 's too weird that they 're actually in a happy marriage . So he chases her off , there she goes , and Cooper is in charge of the kids . This , off course , leads to him burning the house down , losing several of the kids , and sleeping with an assortment of New York bimbos ( including an ever so young Diane Lane ) . Then the wife comes back , wants the kids , and the film ends with a coin flip that 'll decide the fate of the children . The idea was actually somewhat clever , but the director stunk . The characters all seem like they 're falling asleep , they HAD to be doped up . Sorry Boon , your legacy was tarnished with this flop.<br /><br />Short Film # 2 < br /><br />MORE SPOILERS < br /><br />Enter Dominique Corsaire . Pretty girl , recently finished college , not sure what to do with her life . So she becomes a slut , starts sleeping around with some mega rich guys , takes their money when they die , and she does n't stop until she beds the most powerful man in the world , Fred Willard ( Ooops , I mean the president of the United States ) . Once again , it could have been funny , and though I was happy that Corsaire ( Ann Dusenberry in real life ) was n't afraid to bare all , her acting was horrible . What a waste of time.<br /><br />Short Film # 3 < br /><br />I ca n't believe I made it this far . Here 's the rookie cop Brent Falcone ( Robby Benson ) with veteran Stan Nagurski ( Richard Widmark ) . Falcone is young , naive , thinks he can really help people , though he becomes cynical after being shot several thousand times . Nagurski , really , has just given up caring . He watches muggings , assaults , you name it , and never intervenes . He figures the world is lawless and he 'll probably get sued if he does anything . Even Christopher Lloyd ( at the end of Taxi 's run ) gets in on the action , getting the police called on him , committing a crime , but having his lawyer there to protect him . God bless America!!<br /><br />Once again , could have been funny , the performances were intentionally campy , but goodness , no energy whatsoever . Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed of having their names on this schlock . I think the writing was n't bad , the ideas were there , but the execution was pulled off as well as the rescue attempt in the Iranian hostage crisis . If I had been a part of this film , I would want my name removed , it 's horrible . Then again , that 's why I watched it.<br /><br />The only good thing about this garbage is that Dr John did the film score ( repeating " Going to the Movies " over and over again ) and the film is n't much longer than an hour and a half . Show this one in film classes with the heading " what you should NEVER do in film - making . " This script should have been left on the shelf because yep , it 's that bad .
0 Facts about National Lampoon Goes to the Movies , a.k.a . National Lampoon 's Movie Madness:<br /><br />1 . The movie is poor , even by Lampoon 's typical standards . 2 . It 's not funny . 3 . No one goes to see a movie.<br /><br />So , after I finished watching it , I began wondering why on earth it 's called ' National Lampoon Goes to the Movies , ' and why it was ever conceived , much less actually made . It would be like calling Austin Powers ' An American Guy Goes to the Movies . ' How lame . He is n't American , and he does n't go to movies . None of the characters in Lampoon 's so - called ' satire ' are funny , and none go see movies , which causes a bit of a problem . I had hoped it would be something in the vein of Mystery Science Theater 3000 , but it isn't.<br /><br />This was National Lampoon 's first film after Animal House , although you could n't tell it from the quality of film . Poorly developed , rough and amateurish by any standard , it induces headaches ¬ñ not a good sign for an 89-minute movie that seems double the length.<br /><br />I've noticed a pattern . Really bad movies are typically renamed ¬ñ and this little disaster falls under that category . It has two separate titles -- probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in 1982/83 . ' Hmm , Movie Madness ¬ñ I 've never heard of this movie before ! Let 's rent it ! ' And then , the realization : ' Hey , wait a minute , this is just National Lampoon Goes to the Movies!'<br /><br />It was shelved by MGM / UA , never to be released into theaters or DVD ; it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade , which is just about the only place you 'll manage to find it.<br /><br />It 's split up into three stories ¬ñ a parody of self - enlargement videos , butter and corporate ruthlessness , and police brutality / cop - buddy films ( I guess ) . The first segment stars Peter Riegert ( Animal House ) as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff . I 'm not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift . Until the sex scene popped up.<br /><br />Part II is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter ( do n't ask ) who decides to become Queen of the Margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products . Ouch ! This contains the only funny line in the movie : ' Only I can make love with my son ! ' If you think that does n't sound very funny , you 're right ¬ñ it 's not . And just imagine ¬ñ it 's the highlight of this film!<br /><br />Part III is about a cop who chases down a serial killer ( Christopher Lloyd ) only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy . It does contain one funny scene but it 's extremely over - acted ¬ñ only Lloyd really exhibits any humor , playing his character dry and compassionate , yet strangely surreal . The part where he 's choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watching it all unfold , at least , evoked a chuckle or two.<br /><br />It 's a shame to watch such a cast of semi - famous names resort to low standards . The writers of each segment clearly believe that they 're being very ironic and clever by spoofing so - called stereotypes ¬ñ the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction , favoring the standard T & A instead of plot ; crude humor instead of witty dialogue ; desperate performances instead of inspired ones . It 's easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material , muttering their lines , often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camera.<br /><br />The movie is n't funny , as I said before . I laughed once , at only one line , and even then it was a halfhearted one . Two chuckles , a smile , and a very weak laugh . Compared to Movie Madness , a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracks.<br /><br />I like National Lampoon 's Vacation series ( or , at least three of four installments ) , and their classic Animal House , but their recent slew of direct - to - video bombs such as Golf Punks ( with that great comic genius Tom Arnold ) provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago . It gets really old , really fast.<br /><br />Sad to see a new film , called Gold Diggers , is being released with their ' stamp of approval . ' It 's like condemning a film before it even hits theaters ¬ñ maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the place ¬Ö < br /><br />Distributor : ' This movie is bad . It gets the National Lampoon stamp of approval . That 'll teach you not to make something so awful next time.'<br /><br />Forget the death penalty . Just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a month.<br /><br />It 's so bad that I ca n't even begin to explain its putrid vileness . I give up .
0 National Lampoon was once a funny magazine . Whether you liked the stoner hippie days of the late sixties or the smug and sassy coke - head days of the seventies ( when the comedy was fortified with plenty of naked babes ) depends very much on your date of birth , but everyone agrees that by the early eighties , middle age had killed off whichever remaining sparks of anarchic humour that the drugs had n't , and offerings like this film and the increasingly terrible spin - off records shot further holes in the hull . Outside of a nicely illustrated title sequence , there 's absolutely nothing to recommend this singularly depressing stinkbug . If you make it through the baffling opening segment , ' Growing Myself ' , hoping things will get better , tough luck - they do n't . Whoever thought the idea of a woman being brutally raped with a stick of butter was comedy gold deserved to have his head handed back to him on a platter of dog mess . If there 's ever a global shortage of guitar picks , the negatives of this rambling , incoherent ragbag of crummy ideas and dire performances may well serve some purpose .
0 I chuckled a few times during this movie . I laughed out loud during the notarizing of the margarine company handover ( pun intended).<br /><br />There are three segments in this movie . The first one is supposed to be a spoof of " woman ' grows up ' and launches career " movies . The Tampax ¬Æ box was the funniest thing in this segment . Most of the cast members are n't listed here on IMDb . They are the lucky ones . Few other people will be able to connect this thing to the ruin of their acting careers.<br /><br />The second segment is a spoof of " sharkish woman sleeps her way to the top and seizes control of huge industry " movies . Robert Culp has several funny moments , all physical humor , including the aforementioned handover . After his character dies the segment sinks lower and lower as Dominique Corsaire rises higher and higher . By the time she becomes First Lady I wanted to rip the cable out of the TV and watch " snow . " I switched to Pakistani music videos instead . I do n't understand Urdu , or whatever language the videos were in . It was still better than listening to the dialogue in this painfully dull " story." < br /><br />Then came " Municipalians " with the * big * stars , half of them on screen for less than a minute : Elisha Cook , Jr. , Christopher Lloyd , Rhea Perlman , Henny Youngman , Julie Kavner , Richard Widmark and ... * Robby Benson . * It 's supposed to be a spoof of " young cop teams with hardened , substance abusing older cop who needs retirement * badly * " movies . The horizontal flash bar on the police car is very impressive . It was interesting seeing old RTD buses , and a Shell gas station sign , and an American Savings sign -- none of them are around anymore . Nagurski 's " Never stop anywhere you might have to get out the car " made me smile momentarily . Then they discuss how boring the young cop is . A lot . Back and forth about how boring he is . That was as boring as this description of how boring it is . Nagurski 's Law Number Four , " Never go into a music store that 's been cut into with an acetylene torch , " made me think that the music store is a real business at the actual location the dispatcher gave . Thinking about that was more interesting than the set - up for the gag which followed . Young Falcone ( Benson ) gets shot . A lot . He becomes a hardened cop like Nagurski . The segment keeps going . On and on . And on . It wo n't stop . It rolls relentlessly onward no matter how many times you wish he 'd just * die * already so this thing will end . It does n't . It goes on and on and on .... Then a " Buffy the Vampire Slayer " episode which I 've seen four times already comes on . Thank God ! This abysmal movie ended while I went to get the mail .
0 I 'll keep the review of this program as short as possible . Skip it . Low budget , not funny , lousy script . Acting not quite as bad as the writing , but still bad . That 's all you need to know , but I will continue for the sake of writing more than necessary.<br /><br />This is a film with three segments , each one parodying some other type of movie . A MUCH funnier film with this same exact idea is " Movie Movie , " with George C. Scott . Very obscure , but worth searching out . MM parodied films of the 1930 's , and did it with elegance , precision and dry wit.<br /><br />This movie did not . It parodies three types of films , supposedly from the late 70 's , early 80 's era , only it is parodying films I 've ( almost ) never heard of . The first is , I guess , a parody of " Kramer Vs . Kramer , " in a way . Peter Reigert does his best with a dirt poor script . The second is a parody , of , I do n't know what ... a Danielle Steele novel ? I mean , you might see a story like this on Lifetime TV , but in a movie theater ? I mean , I remember the 70 's , I was there . This is a soap - opera type parody about a fetching young woman who sleeps her way to power . These type of things usually parody themselves , so I do n't see how this was even necessary.<br /><br />We are on somewhat easier ground with the third segment , " The Municipalians , " which parodies cop movies . I noted elements of " The New Centurians " and some " Dirty Harry " , both of which were almost 10 years old when the film was created . Yeah , nice and current . Robby Benson plays the idealistic young rookie ( over - the - top wimpy ) while Richard Widmark plays the grizzled veteran cop who drinks whiskey while sitting in the police car ( OH ! Stop ! My sides ! He 's actually drinking booze in the Police car ! How irreverent ! ) Note that this was the first film after " Animal House " to have the " National Lampoon " name attached . Wow . To go in five years from that classic flick to this pile of dung is nothing short of shocking . I could go on for hours about the sad decline that caused one of the most cutting - edge and original voices in American humor ( that would be National Lampoon , the original magazine for about its first 10 years or so ) to sell out and begin a long , slow slide into a world of crap , where now the magazine is long gone and it only exists as a brand name to slap on low - budget " comedy " films for a fee . Yet another reason why capitalism ( and cocaine ) sucks so bad.<br /><br />Anyway , this movie is a serious time suck . Do n't waste your 90 minutes . I want mine back . On the positive side , Fred Willard 's in it !
0 I just saw this Movie on a local TV Station ( TV8 's " Big Chuck and Little John " in Cleveland , Ohio ) I had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it.<br /><br />I know of no thesaurus that can even come close to aiding me in describing how bad this movie really is . The script is awful . The acting , well other than one of two exceptions , is pointless since there is nothing in this material that merits any real effort.<br /><br />It looks like a bunch of little ideas , leftover from various writing sessions , that where thrown into a blender . It 's not just funny . The " parody " aspect is strained at best . Some references where almost out of date ( even for the time of it 's release ) . No wonder I had never heard of it , it 's really bad , worse than anything Saturday Night Live , MAD TV or even In Living color put out in their worst days.<br /><br />If you see it on TV , it is a great example of how NOT to make a movie . Whatever you do DON'T WASTE A CENT.<br /><br />Adam
0 This barely watchable film was a bit of an ordeal to sit through . None of the segments are good , but at least the first one was mildly amusing , and the middle one was somewhat imaginative . The final one was just plain brutal , and after sitting through two weak comedic shorts , the third one was truly painful to watch . Even by the low standards of a National Lampoon movie , this one seemed especially boring and joyless .
0 " National Lampoon Goes to the Movies " is the worst movie ever made , surpassing even the witless " Plan 9 from Outer Space . " At least that movie was just inept ; the Lampoon film , on the other hand , is both inept and mean . Once upon a time , movies used to respect their audiences ' intelligence . This one , however , holds a fetid , rotting carcass up to our faces -- and then tries to rub our noses in it.<br /><br />Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only good parts of the movie are the nude scenes ; and I agree , Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh , and very nice flesh it is . But the directors seem not to realize that even T&A needs a good story to surround it . There 's none of that here.<br /><br />Perversely , the film makers save the worst for last . The third of the three segments is the ugliest of the trio . In this vignette , Robby Benson plays an eager - beaver young police officer reporting for duty on his first day on the job . He is paired with a weary , cynical oldtimer played by Richard Widmark . For just a moment , we are given hope that this film will end triumphantly . Surely , we think , the youngster 's spunky attitude will rub off on the cynic and change him for the better.<br /><br />Forlorn hope ! Instead , the cynic wins the day -- and the youngster 's spark is doused forever . " National Lampoon Goes to the Movies " and heads right for the toilet , asking us to follow it down the drain . Nominally , this is a comedy . But where 's the humor ?
0 You can call this one a flop , and that 's a very big one too ! Quality is n't associated with the words National Lampoon , but at least the Vacation and Animal House entries were fun , but this offering has got to be their most inane feature to date that I 've watched . Ugh ! The three piece story crazily attempts to parody the clich√©s and stereotypes that flooded Hollywood genre films , which turns out to be completely unfunny and boorish dross.<br /><br />"Growing Yourself . " - Jason a corporate lawyer decides to quit his job and split up with his wife so they both can grow and do what they always wanted to do . That 's life , as Jason sees it and he takes over looking after the children , but his decision to follow this path might not be the right one.<br /><br />Talk about leaden , boring and stiff . There only real interest is the small performance of the lovely Diane Lane . The satirical element here seems to be pointing out something than actually just delivering it . The silly humour is strained , flat and particularly senseless . Peter Riegert 's keeps it very deadpan in the lead role and Teresa Ganzel bubbles along in her role.<br /><br />"Success Wanters " - After just finishing collage Dominique Corsair gets a job as a stripper and is rape with some butter by the Dairy Company Presidents . For payback she becomes interested in the margarine industry and virtually works her way to the ' very " top.<br /><br />Probably the best one of the three , but the competition was n't too great . The gags seem to want go more subtle with its sexual and power orientated tone , but still they do feel more tacky and forced . The idea had something promising and inventive to build on , but the languid pacing begins to wear thin by the end and disastrous dialogue do n't do it any favours at all . The humour tries , but more often does n't come off , despite the hunger . The seductively Ann Dusenberry is pretty cold and manipulative throughout ( well after the painful ordeal ) and likes to gracefully bare it all quite a bit . Even the skimpy stripper outfit seems to get full workout for the opening half of the story . Popping up in amusing minor cameos ranged from Dick Millar , Mary Woronov , Olympia Dukakis , Fred Willard , Robert Culp and a favourite turn by Joe Spinell.<br /><br />"Municipalians " - A serial killer who leaves copies of his driver 's licence behind after each murder , is being tracked down by an enthusiastically naive rookie cop and his old grizzled partner . However the young cop learns that being tough is the only way to go , when the pair encounter one situation after another.<br /><br />Stupid ! Oh yeah . Sure if you 're going to spoof something extremely over - the - top , make sure laughter will stream off it . Obviously they forgot that ! Even at its 30 minutes running , boy does it drag ! Robby Benson 's gratingly mock performance got rather overbearing with a wearied Richard Widmark doing very little as his partner . Christopher Lloyd underplays the role of serial killer , but his creepily wry and sympathetic performance works well and pretty much shows up the other leads . Elisha Cook Jr. , Rhea Perlman and Harry Reems appear . When the jokes come , they truly feel out of sync and get rather stale with its repetitiveness of making fun of these cop clich√©s.<br /><br />In all , the idiotic material laced with its skits comes across as disposable , and the unbearable script is basically inept and witless . Only one or two few gags make it out each segment , but really there 's too many cheap stinkers or plain misses which stick in your head . This is because it virtually becomes what it 's trying to poke fun at and this basically shows in each story . It loses sight . The performances range from hot to cold , but who ca n't deny the embarrassment that 's felt on most of their faces . Director Bob Giraldi 's first taste is a vapid one for " Growing Yourself " , but " Success Wanters " showed some minor flourishes of mild effectiveness . Henry Jaglom does a labouredly jaded job on " Municipalians " . Rick Meyerowitz 's vividly crass drawings that opens the film , are neatly devised and go on to set the style and mood.<br /><br />This low - brow comedy flunks it by overplaying it , with the main interested being derived by the familiar cameos . But really , is it worth going through this putridly lame and restless get - up , just to spot them . Well , that 's up to you .
0 " National Lampoon Goes to the Movies " ( 1981 ) is absolutely the worst movie ever made , surpassing even the witless " Plan 9 from Outer Space . " The Lampoon film unreels in three separate and unconnected vignettes , each featuring different performers . The only common thread is the total lack of any redeeming qualities.<br /><br />Well , maybe there is one . Another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice , and he 's right . Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash their assets prettily , in part one and part two , respectively . But their glamorous displays are , alas , wasted . The directors seem to have forgotten that even T&A needs a credible story to surround it , and there 's none in sight.<br /><br />The third segment , starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark , is the most disgusting of the three , and an unfortunate choice as the windup of this film . Benson plays an eager - beaver young policeman , brightly reporting for his first day of duty , ready to rid the streets of evil . He is paired with an old , cynical cop played by Widmark , and when these oil - and - water partners set out on their first patrol together , we sense a possible redemption of the film 's earlier failures . Maybe , just maybe , the cynical old - timer will be reformed by his new partner 's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty . Maybe all will end happily after all . But alas , this movie heads straight for the toilet , with no redemption , no happy ending , no coherent story of any kind.<br /><br />Before " National Lampoon Goes to the Movies , " I thought I had already seen the worst schlock that Hollywood could possibly turn out . Unfortunately , I had n't seen the half of it.<br /><br / >
0 " National Lampoon Goes to the Movies " ( 1981 ) is , simply put , the worst movie ever made , far lamer than even the inept " Plan 9 from Outer Space." < br /><br />The Lampoon film is told in three segments , each one supposedly a spoof of a conventional movie genre , but each one landing at our feet with a sickening thud . There is no rhyme or reason for these execrable vignettes , and no discernible story lines.<br /><br />Another reviewer on this site has written that the only good points about the film are the nude scenes . True , Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry do flash a bit of flesh , and very nice it is too . But the directors seem not to realize that even T&A needs a good story to surround it . There 's none of that here.<br /><br />Probably the worst of the three segments is the last one , featuring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark . Here , we see Benson as a young , eager - beaver policeman being paired with a cynical oldtimer played by Widmark . And for just a moment , those of us who are still watching this odious cinematic exercise are heartened by the thought that we are about to see a redemptive tale about how the young , idealistic cop brings about a purifying change in the old - timer 's approach to police work . But no such luck . As we 've said , this film has no redeeming values . It is sickening all the way to the final fade - out -- which , perversely , is stretched out longer than it should last on the screen . Apparently the film makers knew they had a bad thing going , and wanted to make the least of it .
0 This early role for Barbara Shelley(in fact , her first in Britain after working in Italy),was made when she was 24 years old , and it 's certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in 1957 's " Cat Girl . " While blondes and brunettes get most of the attention(I'll always cherish Yutte Stensgaard),the lovely auburn - haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability(one such example being 1960 's " Village of the Damned , " in which her screen time was much less than her character 's husband , George Sanders).She is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of " Cat People , " and is seen to great advantage throughout(it 's difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase).Her character apparently sleeps in the nude , and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened(also exposed 8 years later in 1965 's " Rasputin - The Mad Monk").The ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder(I do n't see what held that dress up , but I 'd sure like to).All in all , proof positive that Barbara Shelley , in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses , rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable , a real test of star power , which she would find soon enough at Hammer 's studios in Bray , for the duration of the 1960 's .
0 The film is a bit tedious . It 's mostly a silent film , with the bulk o the story provided through a series of voice - overs . While making a silent film like this is not such a bad idea , this is one of those films where the lack of dialog and the repetitive early scenes make it simply tedious . You do n't understand the reason for the tedium until well into the picture , and by then it 's too late . The first 40 minutes of film is something of a slow piece of Mexican soft porn , and unimaginative soft porn at that . Later in the film the style of the first 40 minutes starts to makes sense , but it 's too late , because by then the audience is lost . There is some nice location shooting at the National Autonomous University of Mexico . I 've often wondered why more films are n't shot there . The campus is built on the edge of lava fields that lend the campus a very otherworldly feel . My biggest problem with the film is that the director / writer has made the film the way he wanted to see it without regard for how a viewer who does n't know the story will view it . You ca n't ignore the audience when you tell a story .
0 This could have been the gay counterpart to Gone With The Wind given its epic lenght , but instead it satisfied itself by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing occurs . The characters are uni - dimensional and have no other development in the story ( there 's actually no story either ) than looking for each other and kissing . It 's a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposition like having almost no dialog is completely wasted in a film than makes no effort in examining the psychology of its characters with some dignity , and achieving true emotional resonance . On top of that , it pretends to be an " art " film by using the worst naive clich√©s of the cinematic snobbery . But anyway , if someone can identify with its heavy banality , I guess that 's fine .
0 I gave this loooooooooooong film a " 2 " because of the attractive actors and semi - sexy love scenes . Otherwise , if you ca n't read like a speed - reader you will NEVER get through the subtitles that try to keep up with the Spanish speed talking ! And , what the hell is going on in the plot if you ca n't read the subtitles . Endless stares and goof - eyes and constant rejection . Just boring after an hour or so . Some good cinematography but also some so DARK you think your screen has burned out . How this won anything I will never understand . Difficult to talk about " ACTING " since the lead actors seem to just stare and look lovingly at each other when they are not pushing each other away . The character Geraldo is so attractive that it is difficult to believe that ANYONE would push him away . And what is with his mother ? I just plain did n't GET IT most of the time except that there were three guys that all seem to have had a history with each other .... but never figured out who was whose " EX . "
0 how many minutes does it take to paint a poem ? in this film much too long . < br /><br />it tells the story about the impact of a first love between two schoolboys . < br /><br />the boys ca n't withhold touching each other and making love . after a while one gets distracted by a brief encounter with a sensual guy in the disco and that raises doubt : exploration , fantasy , longing , lust and feelings of loosing grip on your love are themes that are all extensively painted with music , close - ups and silent scenes like telling a poem . but it really takes too long , annoying long , shame , the effort was promising
0 Boring , long , pretentious , repetitive , self - involved ¬ñ this move felt like a bad date . Worse , the tedious art - school direction -- with a heavy - handed use of the whirling shot that gets so overdone it almost made me throw up ¬ñ- is constantly screaming to be noticed . Add the thinnest of plots and virtually no dialogue , and the film begins to feel like a four hour epic about 30 minutes in . It gets worse : instead of dialogue there are poorly written voice - overs AND quotes and songs that comment all too obviously on the characters . Really loud opera music too . Blame it all on the director.<br /><br />The actors are all quite good . The lead actor Miguel Angel Hoppe is particularly suited for film stardom . He and the other actors have some tender erotic moments . Even these start to get boring after 5 minutes however , and one wonders if the director is auditioning for a Bel Ami porn job . The stunning college campus architecture as a location in Mexico City is inspiring . How come universities in the US are so bland ( SFSU , UC , etc . ) ? But wait for the DVD on this film . You 'll want to use the fast scan button ¬ñ a lot .
0 This movie is simply far too long , far too repetitive , with the male nudity and sexuality being ( as this is said as a gay with my own collection of adult titles ) far too gratuitous and unnecessary . Much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down to ten minutes and been equally as effective without trying the patience ( and stamina ) of an audience.<br /><br />I saw this movie on an early Saturday afternoon , with a film festival audience ; the type of crowd that tends to be more adventuresome , interested in more experimental or atypical films , such as one without much dialog , shorts , foreign films . The near sell out crowd in an approximate 275 seat theater started to dribble out within the first half of the movie and while the great majority did stay for the " pay off " ( which never actually arrived ) , I have never , in about 14 years of attending any number of film festivals , experimental , gay and otherwise , seen such a large number of people walk away from a film . < br /><br />This movie could easily have been cut down by more than half and been as effective as it was . It also could have gone in different directions , still with a shorter running time , and been far more effective.<br /><br />As it currently exists , this is not something that one can readily recommend or one I would have any desire to watch again .
0 ... and yet , we were told , there was another hour and 20 minutes left to go.<br /><br />Why , oh , why was n't there an editor to tell the writer / director to snip , snip , snip ? Apparently that writer / director has previously done shorts ; as a short , this would have been okay . But the lack of dialogue starts to grate after twenty minutes . The lack of much music glares . The background noises ( talking , traffic , and especially a ubiquitous helicopter ) get old really fast . But the worst failure is in story . There is precious little beyond a short.<br /><br />After an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again . I nearly screamed at the screen , " We get it , we get it ! ! ! ! ! " It 's amazing that after that left the theatre , we could drive home , watch the Daily Show and parts of the Colbert Report , get ready for bed , and know that the audience was STILL trapped in the theatre.<br /><br />It 's not enough to indulge your vision . You have to give the audience enough to share your vision .
0 Just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs unless you have sleep problems . It is a film filled with pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from " Hiroshima mon amour " and it 's all downhill from there . Camera work - imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai . Story line - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles ' " The Love I saw in You Was Just a Mirage " expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours but filled with repetition . For butt numbing pain this film ranks with the benches at the Methodist church my parent dragged me to when I was a kid . I want 2 + hours of my life refunded . Julian Hernandez 's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was " controversial " - that is true only for the film 's narcotic effect .
0 Just another film that exploits gratuitous frontal male nudity ; awful acting , plus , the lovemaking scenes are the most un - sexy I 've ever seen ( and this is not about me not linking the idea of two young men making love , since I 'm gay).<br /><br />Again , as in Mil nubes de paz , Julian Hernandez directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that makes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes but manages to make a 2 hour film with it ... And this time , there is n't even the issue of racism and commodification in the Mexican gay community to talk about ! God gracious have mercy on us !
0 This star - studded British / Spanish co - production looks great , what you can see of it . I have three versions , two VHS , one DVD , and all are terribly cropped , so badly that it looks as if buildings are having conversations with each other . Few films suffer as badly from pan and scan as this one , as director Robert Parrish seems to have been so enamored with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at once , neglecting the middle . Another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning ; not in any of the copies I have . There are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles , one Mexican officer is shot , Shaw and Landau celebrating , and that 's it . We never find out why Shaw has become a priest ( if he really is ) , we never find out what happens to Don Carlos ( Savalas ) although I suspect he was called home to star in Kojak , as his departure seems arbitrary . And there is a strange flashback sequence where Michael Craig ( Mysterious Island ) is dancing around in a bowler hat and bad suit in the great old English music hall tradition to the 1960 hit BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS , not sung by Johnny Horton here but with some lyrics I 've never heard before . On the plus side , the location is great , a huge old ruined fortress with Escher - style stairs leading nowhere , some nice scenery - chewing by Robert Shaw , and good performances by Stevens , Landau , Lettieri , and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas . I did n't really like this film , but I have n't exactly seen it . I will seek the widescreen version and make my decision then .
0 There are some really terrific ideas in this violent movie that , if executed clearly , could have elevated it from Spaghetti - western blandness into something special . Unfortunately , A TOWN CALLED HELL is one of the worst edited movies imaginable ! Scenes start and end abruptly , characters leave for long stretches , the performances ( and accents ) of the actors are pretty inconsistent , etc.<br /><br />Robert Shaw is a Mexican ( ! ) revolutionary who , after taking part in wiping out a village , stays on to become a priest(!) ... ten years later the village is being run by " mayor " Telly Salavas . Stella Stevens arrives looking for revenge on the man who killed her husband . Colonel Martin Landau arrives looking for Shaw . They all yell at each other A LOT and they all shoot each other A LOT . Fernando Rey is in it too ( as a blind man ) . The performances are n't bad , but they are mightily uneven . Savalas has an accent sometimes as does Landau ( who is really grating here ) . Shaw and Rey prove that they are incapable of really embarrassing themselves and Stevens looks pretty foxy ( if a bit out of place amongst the sweaty filth ) .
0 This British - Spanish co - production is one of the countless films shot in Spain in the wake of the unexpected phenomenal success enjoyed by the Italian " Spaghetti " Westerns and , as is typical of such genre efforts , features an eclectic assortment of established and emerging international stars : Robert Shaw , Telly Savalas , Stella Stevens , Martin Landau , Fernando Rey , Michael Craig , Al Lettieri , Dudley Sutton , Antonio Mayans , etc . Ironically , however , this incoherent mess of a movie serves as a shining example as to why that most American of film genres became a dying breed in the 1970s and is nowadays practically ( or is that officially ? ) extinct.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this film , not only because the Western is one of my favorite types of movies but also because it had all the qualities , including an intriguing premise , to be a good one - not to mention the fact that my father had purchased a paperback edition of A TOWN CALLED BASTARD 's novelization following its original release ! As it is , the film 's sole virtue ( if , indeed , it can even be called that ) is its sheer eccentricity : for instance , Stevens , playing a widow out for revenge on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband , sleeps inside a coffin ( ! ) driven around in a carriage by her dumb manservant ( ? ) Sutton ; Savalas , as a blood - thirsty renegade , who at first appears to be the film 's main villain , is unceremoniously dispatched by his own henchman Lettieri very early on in the picture ; the villain of the piece , then , turns out to be Landau who , in the film 's very first scene , is seen pillaging side - by - side our legendary hero - turned - priest Shaw ! ; Fernando Rey , playing a blind peasant , is the only one who can identify rebel Shaw who , in the end turns out to have been merely a front for ... well , nevermind ! As you can see , the plot is very confusing and it gets stranger from there ! The production team responsible for this film were also behind other Western fare around the same period of time , like CUSTER OF THE WEST ( 1967 ) , BAD MAN 'S RIVER ( 1971 ) , CAPTAIN APACHE ( 1971 ) and PANCHO VILLA ( 1972 ) .
0 " A Town Called Hell " ( aka " A Town Called Bastard " ) , a British / Spanish co - production , was made on the heels of Clint Eastwood 's success in the Italian made " Man With No Name " trilogy . The template used in most of these films was to hire recognizable American actors , whose careers were largely in decline and dub their voices . This film is no exception except for the fact that they used some British actors as well.<br /><br />It 's difficult to summarize the plot , but here goes . The story opens with rebels or whatever , led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau raiding a church and killing everyone inside , including the priest . Fast forward to the subject town a few years later where the Shaw character is masquerading as a priest . The mayor of the town ( Telly Savalas ) is a brutal leader who thinks nothing of meting out justice with his gun.<br /><br />Throw into the mix a grieving widow Alvira ( Stella Stevens ) who is searching for her husband 's killer . Add to this the fact that she rides around in a hearse lying dead like in a coffin for God knows why . After the mayor is murdered by his henchman La Bomba ( Al Lettieri ) the town is invaded by a federale Colonel ( Landau ) in search of a rebel leader ( I 'm sorry but the name escapes me ) . The Colonel takes over the town and begins summarily executing the townsfolk to force them to reveal the identity of the leader.<br /><br />Even though they opened the film side by side , its difficult to tell from the dialog that the Landau and Shaw characters know each other . A blind man ( Fernando Rey ) claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face . He does so and .............................................. <br /><br />I'm sure the principals regretted making this film . It 's just plain awful and well deserving of my dreaded " 1 " rating . Shaw spends most of the film fixating his trademark stare at whomever is handy . Even Landau ca n't salvage this film . The beautiful Ms. Stevens is totally wasted here too . Having just made Peckinpah 's " The Ballad of Cable Hogue " the previous year , I found it odd that she would appear in this mess of a movie . Savalas made several of these pictures , ( " Pancho Villa " and " Horror Express " come to mind ) during he pre - Kojak period . Michael Craig is also in it somewhere as a character called " Paco".<br /><br />Fernando Rey appeared in many of these " westerns " although he would emerge to play the villain in the two " French Connection " films . Al Lettieri would also emerge with a role in " The Godfather " ( 1972 ) and go on to other memorable roles before his untimely death in 1975.<br /><br />In all fairness , the version I watched ran only 88 minutes rather than the longer running times of 95 or 97 minutes listed on IMDb , however I ca n't see where an extra 7 or 8 minutes would make much difference.<br /><br />Avoid this one .
0 This is definitely one of the weirder 70 's movies out there , and it 's most notable for kicking off a decade of Bigfoot hysteria . It is also notable for the little touches of insanity throughout the movie , especially when the dark , moody first half is replaced by a MUSICAL INTERLUDE of all things ( as another user pointed out , one of the songs is dedicated to a character , Travis Crabtree , who paddles around in a canoe for a while , then ... leaves , never to be seen again ) . Although it 's painfully dated now , i 's still a fun scary movie to show to kids , and anyone who enjoys either Bigfoot lore or 70 's hillbilly culture is bound to get a kick out of this . My favorite part : a guy gets so scared that he jumps headfirst through a door ( ! ? ) and the narrator explains he went unconscious from " shock . " Uh , I 'd say breaking a door with his head is more likely why he went unconscious , but whatever.<br /><br />4/10 stars , or 7/10 if you like bad Americana .
0 This grainy film has a cult following and one of those word - of - mouth features you just had to see . Maybe hard to believe , but there is a rural community in southwest Arkansas , Fouke , that knows the legend is true . This tale is told in documentary - style narrated by Vern Stierman and filmed in actual locations talking to actual folks involved . The legend changes with the telling , but during the late 60s and most of the 70s the surrounding area of Fouke was visited by a Bigfoot - like creature that traveled along Boggy Creek . Long limbed with three toes and standing over 7 foot tall , this hirsute creature periodically caused damage and frightened the ' bejeebers ' out of most of the community . I personally crossed over the small Boggy Creek bridge in 1974 , and yes the hair on the back of my neck did rise . Of course it was about 1 a.m. in the rain . By the time I arrived in Shreveport , I was laughing .
0 I was expecting a B - Movie French musical . After all , Dh√©ry , Blanche , DeFun√®s were superstars of low budget French films of that time . And it is in color ! But I have hallucination in this unbelievable one hour 30 of pure mediocrity . Musical numbers are awful , and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid . And the songs ? What songs ? This is just a succession of bad numbers , one after another . The only one very rare thing about that thing is the nudity of women . It was not familiar at that time . In fact , some numbers are just there to show us topless women . It adds to the mediocrity ! And try to find young Michel Serrault , the future great actor of French cinema , in a bit part as a musician , in his very first movie . Good luck !
0 I purchased this movie on blu - ray because it promised great visuals and music . I was also a great fan of a similar movie ... Baraka . The movie is very much styled after Baraka , wide angles , very similar shots with cameras set to capture long time passage in each shot . Even some of the scenes were identical ( the street with traffic ) . Whereas Baraka told a great story , juxtaposing nature , man - made environments , spirituality , and horrors of the world in an engrossing fashion and great music , this movie just jumped from shot to shot with no encompassing story , mediocre musical score , and then .... POOF , it 's finished ! I thought there must be some sort of mistake ! History of the world ? Half the movie is Egypt and landscape ( looks like Arizona , but I did n't bother to check ) . Seriously folks , this is horrible , rent it if you must , but do not buy it . The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves for putting this out .
0 I was n't particularly impressed by this movie that has lackluster music and only lasts 40 minutes . Thank God , because I was falling asleep . I makes excellent use of time lapse photography to display the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow , people , water , clouds , etc . Unfortunately , that 's all it is.<br /><br />My preference is for its predecessor , the excellent Koyaanisqatsi made in 1983 at 87 minutes and to prove that a sequel can be better than the original , Powaqqatsi made in 1988 running 90 minutes.<br /><br />Try them both .
0 Who ever wrote the two or three glowing reviews were either involved in the making of this film , term used loosely , or bank rolling it , and should the latter be the case , I would want my seven dollars back ! The actors , again term used loosely , are awful , in fact almost none of them did anything ever again which is a relief . The scenery and everything about this screams , we had 7 dollars to work with and a day to do it in . Was this filmed in someones back yard ? Everything about this project says , low budget . The actors at best were D list . Do not waste your time , unless of course you want to take it back and try to get the rental back . The lead bad guy looks like that punk from the 70s show that ended up marrying his grandmother dummee moore . My local blockbuster video store lists this as the movie most returned with sad commentary attached . Even as a 99 cent rental this flick gathers dust . Someone really must have owed some favors . This is a super stinker and I give it 10 turds .
0 We rented the DVD hoping for a good western . The film was pretty and the scenes reasonable , but the ideas were very bad . Here are my problems with the film.<br /><br />In the first part , why exactly did the bad guy kill the mine owner ? Not really connected to the movie except to establish how bad he was and to have a hideout.<br /><br />The bank employee gone bad just acts too poorly to convincingly decide to hire killers to off his employers . At least keep us guessing . No character developed at all for the bank owners or the bank employee.<br /><br />Very long delay in much of anything happening.<br /><br />Absurd premise that Martin still needed to see the judge after the gang confessed to killing the in - laws . Even more absurd that he confesses to judge and judge will not listen to the sheriff guy . even more ridiculous that Martin his hung and rope breaks then the sheriff takes him at gunpoint to finally head back to his town and save his wife from the bad bank employee . Would n't he just return after the quick dispatch of the gang to save wife and arrest bad bank guy ? Just send the judge a note that gang confessed before being killed on trail ? ? ? ? ! ! ! Overall , very sad acting and no point to movie .
0 THE DECOY is one of those independent productions , made by obvious newcomers , but it does n't have all the usual flaws that sink most such films . It has a definite story , it has adequate acting , the photography is very good , the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men , and the background music is n't overdone . This is a DVD New Release , so people will be looking here to see if it 's worthwhile . I do n't know where all the 10 's come from , as there 's no way this film is that good --- even if you 're the filmmaker 's mother . < br /><br />The last film we saw at a theater was Warner 's trashing of J K Rawlings much - loved and excellent book , Order of the Phoenix . In comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX , consider that PHOENIX ( as made by Warners ) had no story , certainly no acting was allowed by the director , the photography was dreadful , and the wall - of - sound overbearing musical score was just a mess . I rated Phoenix a " 1 " because the scale does n't go any lower . THE DECOY is 4 times better -- in all regards.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity , give THE DECOY a chance . Remember , this is n't " Decoy 3 -- the Shootout " or any such nonsense . It 's original . If your expectations are n't overblown by the foolish " 10 " scores here , you might just enjoy the film on its own terms .
0 Great western I hear you all say ! Brilliant first effort ! Well I 'm not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one I saw . Great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none ! The acting was poor to say the least and I could n't care less about any of the characters , making the whole film pointless . the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to TV low budget rubbish like you see on those " FACT OR FICTION " programmes on sci - fi.<br /><br />Please , if you are looking for a good film , a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half , please look elsewhere .
0 After reading the other reviews for this film I am of the opinion that the high markers are probably paid studio lackeys as the film I saw was absolutely dire , with wooden acting , lacklustre scripting and plodding predictable directing , one of the few plus points has to be the stunning scenery as this film features some stunning backdrops with great sweeping vistas and dramatic skies and wide open prairies , sadly when the most memorable thing in a film is the part featured behind the actors this has to be a warning sign as to the quality of the movie , all in all a thoroughly uninspiring addition to the western genre which even at the very reasonable price it can be obtained on DVD is best to avoid .
0 This movie rivals " Plan 9 " as one of the dumbest movie ever made . Always be concerned when the same person is the:<br /><br />1 . Star 2 . Director 3 . Producer 4 . Writer 5 . Stuntman , and 6 . Editor . Unfortunately , Justin Kreinbrink did all 6 jobs ! IMDb shows that he and his father were western ' stunt men ' . So maybe that was the problem . < br /><br />Here 's just ONE example from the film : in the film the sheriff has to take a witness to another town for protection . Of course , the bad guys find out and are waiting for them . But , what happens ? The good guys are riding along and a shot rings out and hits a tree near them . When the camera shows us the bad guys they 're all just sitting on a log , chatting . What 's wrong with this picture!<br /><br />I could go on . Perhaps this film was meant as a comedy . If so , it did n't do that well either .
0 When his in - laws are viciously murdered by a gang of thugs , a young deputy is ordered to escort his mute friend , forced to take the rap by the gang , to Tucson for trial and ending up having to face the real killers along the way.<br /><br />The Decoy is a real - life decoy sent to video stores to lure you away from better films ! It 's talky , illogical , slow , and ultimately very boring.<br /><br />There 's some good costumes , sets , and photography but nothing else is good about this vanity project from writer / director / producer / star Justin Kreinbrink , who apparently had too much money on his hands.<br /><br />They used to make westerns like this , that were under an hour long . Trim this of about half it 's length and you might have something watchable .
0 In a nutshell : this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really WANTS and TRIES to be something more . It wants to be Harold and Maude , Annie Hall , The Graduate . It wants to be deep and human . It has interesting camera shots , lighting , music , editing , all of which give it the feel of an important movie . The dialog is smart -- at times . There are some " laugh out loud " moments.<br /><br />But here 's what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic late - night - cable , in - flight , time - killer : < br /><br />1 . David Schwimmer -- how many times can Joe sad - sack puppy dog stare blankly into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying ? Maybe some drool would have helped.<br /><br />2 . Gwenneth Paltrow -- she 's really flat here and not just in the chest . Her role is supposed to be this lively , nice , caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations , is very confused as a result , and that is why a sad - sack loser like Schwimmer has any chance with her . But Gwenneth plays her very dull . Combine this with puppy - dog drool - face ( above ) and you have very little chemistry to care about.<br /><br />(I kept picturing someone else in this role -- Kate Hudson for example . ) < br /><br />3 . The script and the plot -- the stuff that happens just basically does n't ring true ; all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and tidy bow on top that it seems like a whistle blew and the script writers just said " oops , time to wrap it up , got a train to catch ! " So they pulled out the Hollywood formula book , checked off all the boxes , and went home .
0 Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely great in this movie , but the story is , unfortunately , half - baked , and David Schwimmer 's energy is sort of like cold mush . When he closes his mouth and gets serious for a moment or two there is a rush of what - might - have - been . Who thought 25-year - old kiddies would be entertaining ?
0 I 'm not to keen on The Pallbearer , it 's not too bad , but just very slow at the times . As the movie goes on , it gets a little more interesting , but nothing brilliant . I really like David Schwimmer and I think he 's good here . I 'm not a massive Gwyneth Paltrow fan , but I do n't mind her sometimes and she 's okay here . The Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie , but if you like the leads then you might enjoy it .
0 I wish I had my rental money back from this piece of trash so I could donate it to the Home for Aged Actors . Total rubbish ! ! Five people watched this movie at the same time and there was n't one single laugh to be heard , lots of yawning though . Paltrow 's a beautiful woman and she was the best thing to look at in the entire so - called comedic movie ..
0 no comment - stupid movie , acting average or worse ... screenplay - no sense at all ... SKIP IT !
0 The Pallbearer is a disappointment and at times extremely boring with a love story that just does n't work partly with the casting of Gwyneth Paltrow ( Julie ) . Gwyneth Paltrow walks through the entire film with a confused look on her face and its hard to tell what David Schwimmer even sees in her.<br /><br />However The Pallbearer at times is funny particularly the church scene and the group scenes with his friends are a laugh but that 's basically it . Watch The Pallbearer for those scenes only and fast forward the rest . Trust me you are n't missing much .
0 ... You ca n't exactly shove her out of the way , because she 's old ; and if you were being charitable you might say that the ponderous gait she ambles along with is n't really her fault . Nevertheless , in these circumstances it 's often difficult not to become irritated when you find yourself dragging your heels in her wake . So it is with " The Pallbearer " , an attempt to do something ' different ' with a romantic comedy that in this way is chiefly hamstrung because the venue is all wrong ; sort of like showing off your ' breakdancing ' skills at a grandparent 's funeral.<br /><br />To further extend the metaphor ( perhaps unwisely ! ) ; like the old lady , one starts to feel with the set - up of the film that its demise can not be far away . Sure enough , this particular ' death ' is agonizingly protracted , slowly chipping away at our reserves of empathy in tiny little increments , as depressingly we come to the realisation that the proceedings are only headed in one direction : Downhill . Its laboured attempts at ' humour ' can be seen coming a mile off - again , not unlike the grim inevitability of death!<br /><br />Returning once again to the image of ' dragging heels ' , the main character , Tom , is shown to ceaselessly repeat this action throughout his life . If there are indeed degrees of ' pathetic ' , then this sap is possibly a good few notches ahead of Schwimmer 's other - more famous - role . To find oneself in the awkward position of having to align audience sympathies with a character even MORE ' clueless ' than Ross is certainly a tough ask even for as ' able ' a comic performer as Schwimmer , but I guess he can find fault with himself for signing on to some seriously ' echoing ' situations in the first place.<br /><br />How will he ever escape his most famous portrayal if he 's picking scripts where the characters could almost be ' interchangeable ' , even if the situations are n't ? A man with a longstanding high - school crush on someone he has n't seen for years . Sound familiar ... ? Paltrow is nothing else if not bland in her ' Rachel ' role , but all of this going over old ground would perhaps be forgivable if the noticeable DIFFERENCES present were n't so incongruous as well . Unfortunately , the romantic element is so well - worn it 's threadbare , and the ' backdrop ' is so inappropriate that it seems the best way to describe the resultant film is as something of a ' stiff ' ... ! 2/10 .
0 Some 25 year olds behave like teenagers , coping with the death of a high - school mate , trying to find their purpose in live and love . The script is so lame that I had to force myself to even finish this movie . Stay away from it . 1/10
0 This film is advertised as a clever romantic comedy . It is neither clever nor romantic and it is definitely not an effective comedy . The fortunes of the well meaning yet pathetic character , " Tom " , oscillate from one extremely embarrassing disaster to another . The only saving graces are the competent performance by Toni Collete and the frequency with which we glimpse Paltrow 's pleasant face . Overall , to be avoided !
0 The interplay between the characters is a moral disaster . You end up disliking most of the characters and you do n't particularly like any of them.<br /><br />Even the two main characters played by David and Gwen are so badly written that you really do n't care one bit about them . The movie has no plot , no direction and no purpose . The single redeeming quality of the movie was to treat it as a glimpse into the messed up lives of a few losers - and that 's hardly stimulating even as an afternoon waste .
0 Life is really too short for movies like this . I knew it could n't be good when I realized what I 'd already suspected - that David Schwimmer would be playing the exact same type of person he plays in ' Friends'.<br /><br />Let 's face it , either the guy ca n't play anything but a nerd or he is never offered any other parts . I have a feeling that it 's a mixture of both.<br /><br />And I have to say that it is extremely difficult to like a movie that utterly wastes the considerable talents of Gwyneth Paltrow , Barbara Hershey , Toni Collette and Carol Kane ! ! !
0 Let 's see ... I'm trying to practice finding the positive in everything , so what kind thing can I say about the Pallbearer?<br /><br />I know ! The performances were -- no , that wo n't work as they succeeded in draining all personality from Gwyneth Paltrow , usually so vibrant , and ended up creating caricatures out of Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... <br /><br />Oh - how 'bout the story -- nope . That is n't gon na fly either , as it was doze - inducing . What was the genre anyway ? It was n't funny , that rules out comedy . It was n't interesting enough to be dramatic . Was that a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow ? I have to ask , as I ca n't be sure - let 's just call it " losers in like . " I 'm sure those behind this film started with a vision , I mean , they must have had one to pitch to the studio suits , but I need help finding it.<br /><br />Even if I were a patient person who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story , I could n't in good conscience recommend a film that allows a guy to go into a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy , fluffy , stupid hair . Speaking of hair -- are we supposed to be amused by the deliberate black roots and platinum locks worn by Hershey?<br /><br />What am I doing ? I already lost 97 irretrievable minutes in the actual watching of the movie -- I can not devote any more time to this loser .
0 Not even Bob Hope , escorted by a raft of fine character actors , can save this poorly written attempt at wartime comedy , as his patented timing has little which which to work . The plot involves a Hollywood film star named Don Bolton ( Hope ) , and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of World War II , followed by his enlistment by mistake in a confused attempt to court a colonel 's daughter ( Dorothy Lamour ) . Bolton 's agent , played by Lynne Overman , and his assistant , portrayed by Eddie Bracken , enlist with him and the three are involved in various escapades regarding training exercises , filmed in the Malibu , California , hills . Paramount budgeted handsomely for this effort , employing some of its top specialists , but direction by the usually reliable David Butler was flaccid , and this must be attributed to a missing comedic element in the scenario . A shift toward the end of the film to create an opportunity for heroism by Bolton is still - born with poor stunt work and camera action in evidence . Oddly , Lynne Overman is given the best lines and this veteran master of the sneer does very well by them . Dorothy Lamour looks lovely and acts nicely , as well , and it is ever a delight to see and hear Clarence Kolb , as her father , whose voice is unique on screen or radio , but there is little they can do to save this film , cursed as it is with an error in script assignment .
0 In one word : excruciating . I was advised to read some articles about this film 's philosophical meanings afterward , but , having sat through the movie 's interminable 115 minutes and being slowly crushed beneath its bloated symbolism and lava - flowing oppressiveness , it seemed better to just report my reactions to the movie . After all , who goes to see a movie with a syllabus in hand ? And this flick was dismal . Lead actor Claude Laydu , from the film 's opening to its end , wears the same wearying and annoying mask of agony as to be practically indistinguishable from the film 's eternal , dreary voice - over . Filming one over the other might have worked better than subjecting an audience to both , as they basically say the same thing : The priest of Ambricourt is a wretched human being . The story , about a persecuted priest who tries to help out a troubled rich family , does nothing toward making its characters remotely interesting or sympathetic , as the family are a bunch of unpleasant weirdos , and the priest , himself , comes across as a nosy pest . The last 30 minutes suggests some breath - taking message about grace and one man 's suffering equaling that of others , but due to all the indulgent close - ups of a suffering Laydu and the vague subtext in Robert Bresson 's script , all I felt was , Finally , it 's over , let 's have some ice - cream . Interesting for fans of Bresson fanatic Paul Schrader , just to see how many elements of character and setting Schrader carried into in his own scripts and movies , especially " Taxidriver " , " Raging Bull " and " Light Sleeper " .
0 I kind of feel like a genius ; I feel like I 'm the only one who saw through this fake film . I watched it three times , once with commentary , and I found myself getting annoyed at all the close - ups , all the times the screen just blacks out , and worst of all , I feel the film never really resolves anything . Yes , the priest dies , but he did n't really seem at peace with the town that gave him so much grief , or with himself . That and he was an idiot . If it were n't for the commentary by Peter Cowie which explained not only the movie but the book it came from , I would n't have been able to stomach it at all . I enjoy French movies , but this is one that was completely absurd.<br /><br />Diary of a Country Priest is filmed in beautiful black and white photography but , that alone can not save this deadly dull tripe . Scene after scene of extreme close - ups where characters do n't say anything until the camera cuts away and goes to a black out do NOT make an interesting or relevant story . How this film ever became a classic is mind boggling : it reminds me more of The Emperor 's New Clothes.<br /><br />Yes , Claude Laydu 's performance is heartfelt and thought provoking , if you are a sadist , but this film left me feeling empty because overall it is a weak impression of the Catholic priesthood , which is an ignoble and inglorious institution of corruption . The young priest 's triumph over the countess 's pride is a weak scene but 90 % of the film will drag you down with its dreary introspection and window into the young priest 's melancholy thoughts . This priest does n't come across so much as being humble as he does just plain pitiful.<br /><br />Being that I do n't speak or understand French I was looking forward to doing the English SUBTITLE thing to help understand the film . Well , the English SUBTITLE is at times impossible to view / read and the text rolls by so quickly that there was much I could not read ( and I am not a particularly slow reader - I just finished Dostoyevsky in 3 days ) . < br /><br />I really wanted to like this film . I try out everything " chosen " by the Criterion Collection , and yet can not see why in many ways this one merits some sort of critical nod . However , I sat through this entire two hour film yearning to feel some sort of empathy for the main character , and it never materialized . He just seemed like a victim rather than a fighter . And for that , I say it stunk .
0 I thoroughly enjoyed Bilal 's graphic novel when it came out , and was amazed when I saw the trailer for this film , and even more so when I found that Bilal had directed it himself . The film , however , was a major letdown . The visuals are nowhere near the rich and gritty texture of the original artworks , and the story is poorly told . Bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel , and he does n't do a very good job at it , either.<br /><br />The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendship - hate relationship between Nikopol and Horus . They were both out of their right time and place , forced together by circumstance . Most of all , they were funny and likable . Not so here . Nikopol has no discernible personality whatsoever , and Horus is a pompous twit who just wants to get laid . Even though the film is French , Horus does n't have to be!<br /><br />We have all seen films we enjoyed , but would n't recommend to everyone , for some reason or other . I would n't recommend Immortel to anyone , except maybe as a warning not to overreach your talent and resources . Bilal 's a master storyteller , but obviously not a master of every visual medium .
0 I saw this at an arty cinema that was also showing " Last Days " and some Charlie Chaplin films . Based on the quality of the other features , I decided to give " Immortel " a chance . I nearly walked out of this movie , and I LIKE science - fiction ! The story is set in a futuristic New York city , filled with Blade Runner - style sky advertisements and some similar debates about cloning / synthetic humans . Unfortunately , the screenplay was not condensed enough for an hour - and - forty - five - minute movie . Three groups exist in this world : humans , artificial humans , and Egyptian gods . The artificial humans seem to have the upper hand and control the politics of the city . The humans are slaves and are used for eugenics and organ donation . The Egyptian gods have a floating pyramid ( modeled on the Great Pyramid of Khufu , and complete with a deteriorated exterior , leaving a smooth " cap " on the pyramid . Would n't a floating futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition ? ) . The pyramid rests above the city and nobody on the ground understands what it is or why it 's there . I wo n't bore you with the so - called plot , but there is lots of unnecessary gore and many gross - out scenes . The film , as I said , looks to have been influenced by Blade Runner , and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix . At the end of the film credits were listed thank - yous to the United Kingdom , France , and Italy . The film is FRENCH , but uses British actors who do n't speak French . Hence , it is obvious that their French dialog has been dubbed . This is a distraction , and I also thought that switching back and forth between real humans and animations quite distracting . It does n't help that the animations are poor -- no better than a video game . Skip this one .
0 I love science fiction , I am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation . I figured a movie that combines these three would be at least enjoyable . I could not have been more wrong : The story ( or actually the lack there of ) was completely uninspired and lacks imagination - while imagination usually is the biggest component of any science fiction story . The dialogue and acting are even worse than in an average porno movie . Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives new meaning to the term ' bad performance ' . Bad acting would n't have been such a huge problem if only ' director ' Bilal did n't take himself so seriously ; all the lines sound like they are supposed to be poetic , it looks like Bilal really thinks he has made a piece of art here . Well , there 's no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk , only pretentiousness ! This man should really stick to making comics , since he fails on all possible accounts as a director . Worst of all is the terrible digital animation , which is so ugly that it actually turns watching this movie into a physically painful experience . The graphics look so fake they even make the werewolves in ' Van Helsing ' look like live actors ! And since half the characters are CGI - animated , it is quite a problem that the CGI - effects look so fake . If the Egyptian Gods actually exist then Bilal 's a dead guy , since they will no doubt take gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way in which he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie .
0 This movie seems to start in the middle , introduces peripheral players as if they were significant and presents main characters without any substance and paper - thin and/or impenetrable back - stories . Almost nobody has a credible or discernible motivation for their actions in this film . The plot rambles and ultimately goes nowhere , the dialogue is clunky and trite and the director has little concept of how to get the best from his actors . It almost feels like there 's a first half of this movie but it never got made.<br /><br />We're told that a mysterious pyramid has appeared over New York City and that Central Park has inexplicably become an arctic wasteland . Yet none of this seems to have caused much of a stir amongst the general population and is only of minimal concern to the government.<br /><br />We're presented with the " evil corporation " in Eugenics but that 's really just a convenient conceit to populate the universe with a couple power - tripping minions . The whole " Eugenics - is - bad " double - entendre is heavy - handed and never really pans out here . We 're supposed to care about the central characters but we never learn enough about them to know why . So much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped that it comes off as a 1-hour , 40-minute fatalistic rationalization for rape.<br /><br />On the " ground - breaking " digitally animated world created here , all I can say is that at about the same time as this film was made several other directors did the same thing with more seamless and believable results.<br /><br />After spending the time to watch this film the most burning question left in my mind was , " so what ? "
0 The Good:<br /><br />Effective color scheme . Good costumes . Top notch set production . Well detailed CGI buildings and vehicles.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Horrible mixture of actors with all CGI actors mixes Fifth Element with Final Fantasy . The CGI actors look even worse than video games from a few years ago . Flawed logic . A giant pyramid shows up and no one researches it , no one really even questions it ? And there is no explanation as to why the god Horus was even cast out , nor was there any reason why he must do something as trivial as impregnate Jill?<br /><br />The Ugly:<br /><br />Awful script . So many unnecessary subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized . The dialog was almost laughable at some points . Random characters and events that are not needed . Dull characters . Jill is supposed to be this mystery , but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer . There is nothing to her . She is uninteresting and boring to watch . She has no substance , no texture . Her character has no redeeming qualities . In fact , there is not one character in the entire film who has any purpose , any goals ( besides the obvious one of Horus ) , any motivation . They are weak and ill - conceived . There are no stakes - the key to screen writing . Horus will not become immortal , but , big deal , he is a bad guy . One can not even decipher whether Horus or Jill is the main character . That is the problem : devoting half the movie to each character means the writer never fully explores one character , never brings one to fruition . They are cardboard cut - outs who walk around and talk and pretty much do nothing but explore the fine set pieces . First time director pacing . Slow , slow , slow . I am still watching the movie as I write this . I can not pay attention because it is boring . Everything is flat . Even the action is not interesting because it is short - lived and sometimes unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />Not worth a watch . Threadbare story , sub - par character development , corny CGI does not save the nice set production .
0 While others may contend that by viewing other works by Bilal , one will better appreciate this movie , it does fail in one major way . It does not stand on its own . The plot is a mishmash that is confuses symbolism with substance . Here 's an idea start with a definite story . Then craft symbolism around it . We start with two different narratives , this female that is somehow turning human , a " god " that is for some reason being judged , but getting one last fling on Earth , and this mysterious John character who seems to be developing some sort of " resort " just beyond the bounds of the city . Why ? None of these questions are answered . But do we care , no . There is no development to want us to empathize with any character in the story , the closest we get Jill and even then the development is spotty at best . Unfortunately the movie gets caught up in the the whole visually impressive ( which it is , ) but at the expense of motivic development . I would love to see this rewritten by someone who could distance themselves from the material a bit and not have to feel that every image has to be in the picture .
0 I love the comics . Although I do have problems fully understanding the stories ¬ñ the visual style is unique with all its dirt , dust and decay . So I thought I knew what I was up for . Surprisingly I understood the main plot ¬ñ but some extremely poorly decisions where made for its visual style . < br /><br />I mean - really bad looking " CG human actors "- in close ups ? ¬Ö Why ? ! It did not work at all ! ! Horus - and the other Egyption gods - was successfully made in CG and very close to the comic version . < br /><br />I think with real actors this movie could have been a cult movie . < br /><br />What a shame .
0 I sat through this film and i have to say it only just managed to keep my attention . The film would have been a bit more bearable if i did not have to watch the awful CGI , for future reference to the industry if your going to use CGI watch this so you know what to avoid.<br /><br />Apparently this is supposed to be a graphic novel for the screen but all i saw was a bad movie which bears no resemblance to a graphic novel whatsoever.<br /><br />All in all , the story was not as bad as the CGI , i was quite impressed with the acting and thought the casting was good and little more character info would have been nice as it did get a little confusing for me on occasion but that 's not surprising as like i said it only just kept my attention , but in all honestly i wish i had given this one a miss .
0 The movie remains in the gray for far too long . Very little gets explained as the movie progresses , with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch . It sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way I 'm going to do that . It is that I watched this movie in the morning , I 'm sure of it that if I watched this movie in the evening I would had fallen asleep . To me the movie was like a poor man 's " Blade Runner".<br /><br />The movie leaves far too many questions and improbabilities . It makes the movie leave a pointless and non - lasting impression.<br /><br />Also the weird look of the movie does n't help much . The movie is halve CGI / halve real life but it 's not done halve as good , impressive , spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as " Sin City " and " 300 " . They even created halve of the characters of the movie by computer , which seemed like a very pointless- and odd choice , also considering that the character animation is n't too impressive looking . Sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously was n't cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really is n't a positive thing to say.<br /><br />Some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting . The main God of the movie constantly says lines such as ; ' I 'm going to do this but it 's none of your concern why I want to do it ' . Than just do n't say anything at all Mr. Horus ! It 's irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie , if you do n't care to explain anything about the plot . Also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its script.<br /><br />The actors still did their very best . They seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special . So I ca n't say anything negative about them.<br /><br />The story and movie is far from original . It rip - offs from a lot of classic and semi - classic , mostly modern , science - fiction movies . It perhaps is also the reason why the movie made a very redundant impression on me.<br /><br />A failed and uninteresting movie experiment.<br /><br />3/10
0 My first attempt at watching this ended in 8 minutes , roughly after the TV report scene , which I could n't handle . It went approximately like this:<br /><br />Reporter 1 : Hmm , there 's a pyramid in our skies . Reporter 2 : I think it 's aliens . * awkward silence * Reporter 1 : In other news ... <br /><br />A few days later I watched it to the end , and it was n't as horrible as I 've imagined , but there are serious problems with this . About half of the plot can be easily discarded . And the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something.<br /><br />What use are the detective , the eugenics people , and the monsters which are disposed of momentarily by Horus ? More amusing was the monopoly scene . " We 're all powerful " Gods " , who have lived for aeons , and of all the games in the multiverse we happen to play monopoly . " Monopoly ? Monopoly ? ! Even Erich von Dainiken looks coherent , compared to that.<br /><br />The other half is terribly lacking . What did our protagonist do to get himself cryo - frozen ? Why was there no big event when he was released at the end ? He had those pesky followers , remember ? What happened to normal humans ? What 's the deal with the masked guy ? How did the blue - haired girl appear ? What 's with her eyesight ? Etcetera , etcetera.<br /><br />Visually it 's OK , more or less , if you disregard the Egyptian Gods looking like walking turds with rotweiller heads .
0 Knowing Enki Bilal 's comics for quite some time , I had to see this movie . I have thought this would be a good way for the artist as Bilal to spread his art and ideas to wider audience . I have also thought this would be a good movie to recommend , and I thought I will enjoy watching it ... I was wrong ! The movie was a true torture to watch . The idea has potential ... but , movie leaves way too much to be desired , and basically everyone who sees this movie is left with impression that he could do it better . I will not make suggestion whether you should see this movie or not . Chances are if you 're reading these pages that you have already seen it , or that you 're gon na see it - but be prepared for very bad 102 minutes .
0 .... CAUSE IT 'S CRAP ! The kind of movie that makes you want to go and smack the movie maker and say " WHY ? " . Horrible camera work ... count the times the camera tries to remain steady on one person and ca n't . The dialog is ridiculous . The acting is comical . It looks like they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie on the least amount of money possible . I 'd bet $ 10 they used home video cameras to make this . Either that , or most of the cameramen were drunk . Truly the trailers are more entertaining than the movie . If you ever want to host a " Worst Movie Party " , bring this one . Want more entertainment ... stare at a wall .
0 Where do they get the money to make films like this ? I mean , there 's nothing redeeming about this film . None of the actors are known , the writing is terrible , the photography is blurry , the story wanders between being a bad version of Repo Man and a nicklodeon western and the acting is unbelievable . For someone who watches all kinds of film , good and bad , I must admit that this film is about the worst I 've seen since Attack of the Eye People back in the 50 's . I do n't really like to trash the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or , heaven forbid , art but this film would seem to appeal to no one . The story bends on a mystical contamination of a person who 's a bad version of the Celtic Soul eater , although he functions more like a male succubus without the sexual overtones . The bad guys have to team up with the good guys in a town where they are unable to escape from . Take it from there as that , alas , is the best part . My advice is that unless you are into bad mythology , amateurish writing , unconvincing acting and tedious settings , you will best be served by leaving this one on the shelf when you 're out renting videos .
0 I still find it difficult to comprehend that a movie as bad as this could be made in Hollywood . The acting and story is simply pathetic & the direction is awful . I do n't see any logic behind this trash except may be that the director had nothing good to do . I took me ten minutes to realize that i had wasted my precious thirty rupees . It filled me with dismay that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap . I bet the movie was made in less than a day . I do n't know what category it falls into . Please , avoid this movie at all costs , just do anything , even bang your head against walls but do n't go for this movie .
0 There is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses are running . If something red catches your eye it is because a white van is parked behind a bush by the trail . I thought I had seen bad but this is it . A white van in a western . Did they not catch this ? Oh well , and I paid top dollar at the rental . It will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie . The talking was so so slow , the acting was mostly OK but could n't be taken seriously due to the poor nature of the filming . There is a door at the sheriffs that looks like a door today with the particular trimming . I say watch this movie , and move Cabin boy into # 2 on the worst of all time .
0 I just got through watching this DVD at home . We love Westerns , so my husband rented it . He started apologizing to me half way through . The saddles , costumes , accents -- everything was off . The part that made me so mad is where the guy did n't shoot the " collector " with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy 's soul . His only excuse was " he only had 2 arrows left . " We watched it all the way through , and , as someone else said ... too many bad things to single out any one reason why it sucked . I mean , the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found , what 's the point of that ? And why were there a grave yard where everyone died on April 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around ? If you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers , this may be your movie . However , if you want a real Western , you will hate this movie .
0 I love Westerns . I could watch them all day . " The Good , the Bad , and the Ugly " is my all time favorite . I watched " Silverado " for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was being featured on CMT . However , this movie , Shiloh Falls is without a doubt the worst Western I have ever watched . The acting was terrible all around . They explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing . The only good part I can think of is the good - looking cantina girl . The very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length . This movie was n't even worth the new rental fee I paid at our local movie rental store . I felt like I was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing . Only reason I finished it was because I hate to not see a movie through to the end . I turned it off half way through because it was so bad . To the director , please do a better job if you decide to make another . This is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to Westerns .
0 This movie was a stupid piece of crap . Bad everything . Why is it that we who love western movies get jilted nine out of ten times when renting westerns . It seems that if you do n't see names like Robert Duval , Kevin Kostner , or Tom Selleck attached to the cover , it is n't worth messing with . For the most part the main action of Shiloh Falls was taking place in 1892 , yet the revolvers used were 1860s models . Even the shooting was bad - in one scene the Marshal fanned his six - shooter about nine times and could n't hit any of three large men who were only about twenty feet away . I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity . Perhaps those who participated in this movie could have taken some lessons at the Sunset Carson School of Acting .
0 Nahhh ! Leila ( Grace Mills ) is a teenager turned on to Satan ( and LSD ) by her archaeologist fianc√© Richard . There 's a neighborhood hippie demon cult hanging out at the local decrepit ancient castle , where Leila and Richard drink blood , drop drugs , join in sex orgies , dance to lame psychedelic rock and participate in black mass ceremonies where the guys wear pants , masks and capes and the women do n't wear anything at all . Unfortunately , these kind of extracurricular activities have left Leila open to demonic possession from the dreaded " spirit of evil . " Leila also comes from a screwed up family , which does n't help either . Her older brother John is a recluse who seems to be in love with her . Her mother Patricia ( Maria Perschy ) is depressed because she thinks she was responsible for the father 's death . To top it off , her sister ( Maria Kosti ) is a slutty semi pro golfer named ( gasp ! ) Debbie Gibson . There 's plenty of hired help around also to waste more time . Two maids ( a young one who takes her clothes off a lot and an old one who spies on everyone ) , plus Udo ( Luis Induni ) , a bald voyeuristic handyman who spies on Leila changing clothes , takes nude pictures of her and sneaks into the pool house to take a sniff of her freshly used bathing suit . Oh yeah and Borg , the pet German Shepherd.<br /><br />Paul Naschy is Father Adrian Dunning , the doubting priest ( zzzzz ) who starts snooping around after John and Richard both have their heads twisted around backwards . Leila tells him " They say I am perverse and I 'm going to prove it is true ! " During her birthday party , she tells her guests " You make me sick ! I hate you all ! " and when mom suggests having a doctor come over she she screeches " I do n't want to see that fat ass ! " Debbie suggests they commit Leila to a " sanitory , " but Leila runs off and joins the cult again . She is rescued ( again ) and brought back home ( for the third time).<br /><br />By this point in the movie , there 's only about ten minutes left to go and all we 've basically seen is some very boring scenes of characters talking and whining about how terrible and f - ed up their lives are and how Leila is acting weird . It 's almost as agonizing to sit through as an Andy Milligan movie , minus the gore and laughs . But finally during the last few minutes we get the movie the title implies - an EXORCIST - like possession flick . Unfortunately , the best part of it are the contact lenses Leila gets to wear . Some cheap time - lapse slashes appear on her arms , legs and face , she gets scabby lips and her eyes take on the appearance of blue and white marbles . She begins reeking of rotted flesh , spits up some clear gunk , starts speaking in her dead dad 's voice , sneaks into her mom 's bedroom , slaps her around a bit and calls her a " filthy bitch of a whore . " In comes Father Adrian , who now finally believes she is indeed possessed , fends off her attempts at seduction , hallucinates frogs and eels are in the kitchen and douses Leila with holy water . Doors open and close , a mirror breaks , there 's sudden thunder and her bed rises up off the floor . After she tackles Dunning and the two roll down the stairs , the spirit is out of her and into - guess who ? Why , Borg the family pooch ! The demon dog then turns on Adrian and chews him up a little before he impales it on a fire poker . Then we get one of the most irritating final shots ever committed to film . It 's Leila on the floor going from her hideous appearance back to her normal sexy self . But then there 's ANOTHER time - lapse effect that sort of seems to suggest that the demon has possibly reentered her body . It 's so badly done , you really have no clue what to make of it , which is the final slap in the face to anyone who has just realized they 've wasted an hour and a half on this worthless POS.<br /><br />Screw the contacts , 1 out of 10 it is .
0 While I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a horror classic , I have to admit that I do n't hold it in quite as high regard as many other horror fans do . As a consequence of that , I have n't seen many of The Exorcist rip - offs , and if Exorcismo is anything to go by , I 'll have to say that 's a good thing as this film is boring as hell and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on it ! In fairness to the other Exorcist rip - offs , this is often considered one of the worst , and so maybe it was n't the best place for me to start . It 's not hard to guess what the plot will be : basically it 's the same as the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit ( which happens to be the spirit of her dead father ) . The village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism . Like many Spanish horror films , this one stars Paul Naschy , who is pretty much the best thing about the film . Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch , who previously directed the derivative Spanish Giallo ' The Killer Wore Gloves ' . I have n't seen any of his other films , but on the basis of these two : I believe that originality was n't one of his strong points . There 's not a lot of good things I can say about the film itself ; it mostly just plods along and the exorcism scene is n't worth waiting for . I certainly do n't recommend it !
0 Why every horror director wants to imitate " The Exorcist " is a complete riddle to me , as William Friedkin 's " classic " is a very overrated film and , in my opinion , not all that tense or shocking . And yet here 's another clean rip - off , a Spanish one this time , that shamelessly repeats the story of a young girl that gets possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family . Paul Naschy ( who I must admit looks quite hot here ) plays the honorable priest who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila 's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend . At first the priest does n't believe it but when John 's body is discovered with its neck twisted , Leila 's demonic behavior becomes more noticeable ... " Exorcism " is not only very unoriginal , it 's also an insufferably boring film ! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore , and yet the result is a tame and overall bloodless drama that 'll nearly put you to sleep ! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments , albeit very stupid , and there 's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze . The absolute lack of budget is no real excuse since Paul Naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money . This is just an awful film , end of story . Other European " The Excorcist " rip - offs are " The Antichrist " and " Beyond the Door " and they suck as well !
0 I grew up watching Inspector Gadget . It was , and still is , one of my favorite cartoons , if not my absolute favorite . I learned a lot of geography and history from the spin - off Inspector Gadget 's Field Trip . I wanted to slip on a banana peel and become the greatest detective ever.<br /><br />But the film has ruined the reputation of the wonderful cartoon.<br /><br />Matthew Broderick , an actor with potential , was definitely NOT the role for Inspector Gadget . First thing- in the film , Inspector Gadget is smart . Not so in the cartoon . In the film , Gadget solves the mystery mostly by himself . In the cartoon , it was almost always Penny , Brain , and the awesome book ( I still want her book ! ) . If Gadget solved the mystery , it was by accident . Gadget in the film seems to be a competent detective , but in the cartoon was pretty dumb , which was where the humor came from.<br /><br />Another thing is that it 's too much " Good Guy v. Bad Guy " in the film . It 's not just meant to be a silly Saturday morning cartoon . Also , Gadget never should have a love story , but Disney Corporation is filled with idiots.<br /><br />Also I miss the true gadgets that Gadget had , and especially the Gadget car . In the movie it was a chic convertible . In the cartoon it was a sedan police car and could turn into a van . It also barely had any gadgets and was mainly there to get him from place to place.<br /><br />But if anything , the one thing that was terrible about the movie was that it was a feature movie . Inspector Gadget was a silly Saturday morning cartoon . The movie was too serious , too overdone , had too much of a plot and was n't even remotely as funny.<br /><br />Tip for those who have n't seen it : NEVER see it . EVER . Watch the cartoon , it 's a true classic .
0 Once again , Disney manages to make a children 's movie which totally ignores its background . About the only thing common with this and the original Gadget cartoons is the names . The most glaring errors are the characters - Penny does not have her book , Brain has been reduced from a character to a fancy prop , Dr Claw is more a show - off than an evil villain , etc . but there are more than that . The horrors start from the first minutes of the film - having Gadget as a security guard called John Brown does n't help identifying him as the classic Inspector Gadget . And right in the beginning we see Disney 's blatant attempt to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman - they introduce Brenda , who only serves to make this movie Disney - compatible . Add to this the fact that the " Claw " seen in this film and the classic Dr Claw are almost diagonally opposite and you 'll see this is going to be nowhere near the original storyline . What would help would be a better storyline to replace it - but as you guessed , Disney failed in that too . The whole movie is just Gadget acting silly for silliness 's sake and lusting after Brenda . As if to add insult to the injury , Disney introduced the " new " Gadgetmobile - it does n't look , function or think like the old Gadgetmobile at all , it 's just the canonical " comic relief " figure . Disney obviously recognised that the Gadget cartoons were a comedy , so they made the film a comedy too , but they took out all the clever running gags ( like the assignment paper exploding in the Chief 's face ) and replaced them with Gadget being a moron , the Gadgetmobile being a wise - ass , and " Claw " showing off . Someone should tell Disney that " children 's movie " does n't imply " total lack of any brain usage " . Gadget should be targeted for children of 10 - 12 years ... not children of 10 - 12 months like this movie . Whatever this movie is supposed to be , it is NOT , repeat NOT , the real Inspector Gadget . Because I love the old Gadget , I hate this .
0 I used to have a fascination with the cartoon back in college when it was being made . It had much the charm of " Get Smart " . While it admittedly had its faults , it was rather enjoyable.<br /><br />Naturally I was very interested in seeing the film version . That was before I saw it . Afterwords I wished it had never been made.<br /><br />Besides being miscast all around ( who on Earth though Broderick was even close to the role ? ) it just did n't make the grade.<br /><br />The effects were reasonable and perhaps the ONLY thing I liked about the movie ; seeing a live - action version of the gadgets in action ! What was missing was a story and treatment which made it funny or charming or interesting.<br /><br />The original was a wacky cartoon with a very lighthearted attitude . It was FUN . The motion picture became murky and took itself FAR too seriously . If it had seriously had a great plot or went crazy enough to make it seem like a " cartoon on film " it might have been enjoyable.<br /><br />As it exists it does n't deserve to be considered part of the " Gadget Legacy " .
0 I grew up watching the old Inspector Gadget cartoon as a kid . It was like Get Smart for kids . Bumbling boob ca n't solve any case and all the work is done by the walking talking dog Brain and his niece Penny . I had heard the live action movie was decent so I checked it out at the library . I rented this movie for free and felt I should have been paid to see this.<br /><br />Broderick comes nowhere near the caliber of acting Don Adams had as the voice of gadget . His voice was all wrong . The girl who played Penny looked nothing like the cartoon Penny . She is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails . But she does do a decent job given what she had to work with . Dabney Coleman gives a good performance as Cheif Quimby . Saldy he never hid in any odd place or had exploding messages tossed at him accidently by Gadget.<br /><br />The gadget mobile was wrong . It never talked in the series and it did fine . Why did they do this?<br /><br />Gadget was too intelligent in this film . In the show he was a complete idiot . Here he had a halfway decent intellect . It would have worked better if he was a moron.<br /><br />Also the completely butchered the catchphrase . Borderick says " Wowser " . It is and should always be " Wowsers " . It sounds lame with out the ' s ' . I got upset when they showed the previews and they did n't have the correct phrase.<br /><br />The ONLY decent gags were during the credits . The lacky for Claw is in front of a support group for recovering henchmen / sidekicks . Seated in the audience is Mr. T , Richard Keil aka Jaws of Bond movie fame , a Herve Villacheze look alike , Oddjob , Kato and more . This is about the only part I laughed at.<br /><br />The other is at the end where Penny is checking out here gadget watch and tells brain to say somethin . Don Adams voices the dog saying that " Brain is n't in right now . Please leave your name at the sound of the woof . Woof . " of course this is n't laugh out loud funny , just a nice piece of nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie . He should have at least voiced the stupid car.<br /><br />Kids will like this , anyone over 13 won't.<br /><br / >
0 I was a huge fan of the original cartoon series , and was looking forward to finally seeing Gadget on the big screen -- but I never in my wildest dreams expected something so extremely extremely terrible . The pace was WAY too fast , there was no plot , and ' wowser ! ' - what the hell is that ? ? It was ' WOWSERS ! ! ' .
0 Well . Where to begin . Let 's just say this ; avoid this movie at all < br /><br />costs . It 's based on a cartoon series . The movie makes the cartoon look < br /><br />like Hamlet . Filled with emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to be < br /><br />here , lousy camera work , terrible music , and enough product placement to < br /><br />make you want to never visit Yahoo ! again , this movie is really the < br /><br />bottom of the barrel . To quote the New Yorker , Matthew Broderick and < br /><br />Rupert Everett mug their way through this picture with the gay abandon < br /><br />of men who have spotted a rare species of paycheck in the distance." < br /><br />They should pay us some of the millions they earned for watching it.<br /><br />Awful .
0 If you enjoy seeing what must have started as a 2 hour movie in unconnected bursts of unwatchability , you 'll love this film . Otherwise , you 'll just wonder how they could have made such a film from something so simple to translate to the big screen as Inspector Gadget.<br /><br />In the previews for the film , many scenes were shown which were not in the film , and within the film , some scenes just do n't make sense . While the movie is slightly less than 1 hour and a half , I can only think of one truly memorable moment , and that is just before or during the credits!<br /><br / >
0 This is one of those movies you think that the makers would refuse to release it because it is so terrible . Obviously they were thinking that children are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless ads and would think they are entertainment because it is slapstick funny . What is it with the talking car with buttons that say Wendy 's , McDonalds , M&M 's and Skittles ? There was no talking car in the cartoon . ( Dr. ) Claw is supposed to be evil , not handsome and charming . Why is Rupert Everet ' Claw ' anyway ? Were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes ? It looks like they were ( badly ) lampooning Robo Cop , with the turning a man into a crime fighting android thing . I tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if I watch more than 30 minutes of a movie , you do n't get a refund . I 'm sorry I watched more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap . After I was told the no - refund policy , I decided to watch the rest of the hideous garbage called Inspector Gadget .
0 I 'm not quite sure why , but this movie just does n't play the way it should . It should be humerous and fun , but instead is just boring . I think a large part of it is because they way over played the " gadgets . " The old cartoon it is based on is much better.<br /><br />3/10
0 Since I had loved the Inspector Gadget cartoon in the 80 's , I went to see this movie . I wasted my money . The plot was very thin . Also , the movie could not keep me interested for long . I was glad it was over.<br /><br />If you want to see Inspector Gadget , watch the cartoon instead . It was much better than the movie .
0 Luckily I did not pay to see this movie . Also , I can not even reveal any spoilers because I willingly WALKED OUT after forty minutes of the movie . It was that bad . I laughed once , when the Yahoo ! billboard fell on the guy , and the theme song came on . However , that was only because I thought it was making fun of it , but then I realized it was yet ANOTHER product placement . < br /><br />I loved the cartoon . I used to watch it almost religiously . ( although i missed the last episode . I heard that they show Dr. Claw and it was nothing more than a Claw , somebody comment on the show 's page ) The cartoon had Penny and Brain alot more than the movie had , as to that point . I hated the setup of the whole thing , reminiscent of Robocop . Then Broderick screws with the whole feeling of Inspector Gadget . He is not nearly as clumsy as the cartoon was . Another fact is his gadgets actually work to the point I saw , except for the oil slick . He also screwed with the tone of " Wowsers " which used to be in an excited tone . I felt so disappointed that they slaughtered the cartoon so badly . Everybody else felt that way too . Us 14 - 17 year olds remember the cartoon fondly and we loved every minute of it.<br /><br />I went into the movie with an open mind , knowing that they would have screwed with the cartoon . I was taken aback at how retarded the movie was . It relied on sight gags , and stupid dialogue for humor . Disney relies on pain and physical humor to push a kids movie along . Product placement is pointless in this film , and it shows . The wise - cracking car is not that good at cracking wise . The gadgets look nice , but they were almost overly glossy . The cartoon was a better look . The silly scenes were crap . In the 40 - 45 minutes I watched the movie , not one laugh was heard , and they laughed at the Dudley - Do - Right preview . This movie should not be watched by people who want intelligence in their family entertainment . I highly recommend " The Iron Giant , " which was sad , but very very good . This movie is a travesty to the whole family drama.------------1
0 I really wanted to like this movie - the location shots were mostly filmed in Pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful photography . But , even for a filmed cartoon , it was a really badly - made movie . The continuity and pacing were both simply awful . The best bits in the movie are under the ending credits , so it 's ( almost ) worth sticking it out to the end ( though , oddly , it does pick up a little over the last half hour or so).<br /><br />When the best performance in a movie is by Andy Dick , you know there 's got to be a problem ...
0 Why ? ! ! This was an insipid , uninspired and embarrassing film . The embarrassment comes from being from the city where they made it ... Pittsburgh PA ! Why did they let these people do such a BAAAAAD movie there?<br /><br />When this movie was originally to be released ... it was more of a romantic comedy ... and no ROBO - anything . That all got changed along with cuteness courtesy of Disney . WHY ? ? ? ? They did a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character . Seeing Matthew Broderick make fun of his own movies was not fun either . Sheesh ! !
0 After Disney 's witty live - action George of the Jungle , I had high hopes for this flick . Major disappointment . Thread bare plot , bad acting , bad visual effects . This film relied on lame one - liners , idiotic ( and pointless ) product placement , and the lamest most annoying side - kick in that gadget car thing . I took two young kids to see it and they where bored out of their mind . The only laugh received from this movie was bad standby of when needing a laugh show a guy getting it in the groin !
0 OK . I think the TV show is kind of cute and it always has some kind of lesson involved . So , when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie , I decided to tag along . I wish I 'd stayed home and watched the TV show instead.<br /><br />The fact that the humor is silly and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this movie . The plot is next to non - existant , the characters seem to exist in a vacuum , and , worst of all , Gadget does not carry any lesson whatsoever . It appears that Disney took all of the things that make Inspector Gadget work on TV and tossed them all . To be fair , my younger child ( 8 years old ) liked the movie but the older one ( 10 years old ) came away thinking it silly ( he was too old for the youth humor but too young for any of the adult humor).<br /><br />Generally , I like Disney films but this one misses by a mile . It is OK for a very narrow age band ( say 7 to 9 ) but a must miss for everybody else .
0 INSPECTOR GADGET ( 1999 ) * * < br /><br />Starring : Matthew Broderick , Rupert Everett , Joely Fisher , Andy Dick , Dabney Coleman Director : David Kellogg 80 minutes Rated PG < br /><br />By Blake French:<br /><br />Disney 's new film , " Inspector Gadget " is about a cop named John who survives a major accident and is saved by a state of the art experimental operation that turns him into a robotic machine - like agent who has tools and contraptions of all sorts built into his body at his use when he says " Go Go , " only to be called Inspector Gadget!<br /><br />The actual movie 's structure is much like the body formation of Inspector Gadget himself . It is noisy , fragmented , energetic and consist of a bunch of half hearted contraptions thrown together to make something that does n't have much in common with anything else present . The film is basically a series of zany action sequences that are kind of pasted together with characters and an uneven story that only kids between the ages of 6 - 9 would enjoy.<br /><br />The cop who is dramatically reinvented is played by Matthew Broderick , who , until " Inspector Gadget , " was on a success spree with movies like " Election . " His character becomes Inspector Gadget after an encounter with the film 's heavy handed villain named Claw . He is played by Rupert Everett , who has already experienced catastrophe this year with the dreadful " William Shakespeare 's A Midsummer Nights Dream." < br /><br />There is a romantic subplot in this movie as well as ample amounts of scenes involving Inspector Gadget 's wacky body parts and mechanism elements . It has Gadget and Claw drooling over the attractive character Brenda , played by Joely Fisher , for both her looks and her knowledge of a specific invention made by her late father , who was earlier killed by Claw . Competition evolves into fight scenes and a reason for many happenings in the film . Also a major character is the Gadget Mobil , a life like automobile that is devised for Inspector Gadget himself . It is voiced by D.L. Hughly from the sitcom comedy " The Hughly's." < br /><br />"Inspector Gadget " is a movie that I found quite bad . I know , I am not exactly a target audience of the filmmakers , but even my ten year old relative found the film to his disliking . The movie is full of distinct flaws and obvious problems . I never found myself caring about the characters . There is no mood development beyond some neat opening credits , unlike the much worse 1997 film , " Mr. Magoo , " which opened using clips of the original cartoon . Is it too much to ask for that same type of thing in this comedy - which is seldom funny and hardly ever convincing . The overall production design is nothing but a mess of incomplete sight gags and consists of one joke : Inspector Gadget 's bumbling goofiness.<br /><br />In movies like this the audience lusts for boundaries - something to help make out what can happen and what can not . In " Inspector Gadget " there are no such boundaries . This is truthfully nothing more than a party time for the actors , who surly had lots of fun . I am reminded of another lacking comedy released a few years ago called " Blankman " which again , contained lots of props and energy , and the actors certainly had fun time with all the gizmos and props , but it too lacked something needed for every movie : audience participation.<br /><br />A character that I found being left out a lot is Gadgets daughter , who by the end of the movie , I still has not clue of what her name was . She is used only as a plot device - and I question how she was used to further the plot as well . For her presence brings nothing relevant or productive to the film . We never know her reactions to her father 's operation or accidents . Thus , this is someone who could have been completely left out and would have not affected the movie a bit.<br /><br />In closing , I 'd like to state that " Inspector Gadget " is an awful , insufficient excuse for a children 's comedy . And believe it or not , I find myself comparing this film to last years violent and very anti - young audience action picture " Blade . " I am stating once again that I had much rather have a movie where nothing happens than one in which everything happens . " Inspector Gadget " had so much going for it at the same time , it made literally made me dizzy.<br /><br / >
0 Disney 's done it again . The company that made " Mr. Magoo " and " George of the Jungle " has made another movie that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based , and keeps none of the spirit of the original.<br /><br />"Inspector Gadget " was one of my favorite cartoons when I was a young one , and for a movie of it to exist may have been a dream come true back then . Now that that movie does exist , I was severely disappointed , even outraged.<br /><br />First we have the characters.<br /><br />Gadget himself has the gadgets that made him such a fun character in the original cartoon ( with well - done special effects accompanying them ) , and he even has some of the naivete of the original Gadget , but he is now more competent and is expected to solve the crime himself while Penny and Brain just watch.<br /><br />Penny has little to do ; while she played a major role in the cartoon , discovering the crime and halting it , and occasionally getting captured by the MAD agents , now she is simply introduced and then forgotten , although she does at least sneak into Claw 's base.<br /><br />Claw is the movie 's version of Dr. Claw , who was a rather sinister , raspy - voiced man who wore metallic gloves and sat in his chair , his face hidden from view , as he stroked his cat and oversaw various crimes . Now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand , with no mystery behind the character.<br /><br />Brain and Mad Cat exist in the movie , but are rather insignificant to it.<br /><br />Even small parts of the cartoon are n't spared in this butchering . The famous expression " Wowsers ! " was mysteriously changed to " Wowser " , and Gadget 's Gadgetmobile now looks different and talks.<br /><br />There is even product endorsements everywhere . Why is " Yahoo ! " advertised on a sign ? Why does the Gadgetmobile have buttons for M&M 's or Skittles?<br /><br />Fans of the cartoon will hate it , others might will likely find the movie below par , and when all is said and done , this movie is another attempt to make some quick bucks off another old show .
0 In keeping with Disney 's well - known practice of stealing .. I mean .. buying out known properties and bastardizing them , this live - action version of the venerable cartoon classic has got to be one of the worst re - makes in a year of bad re - makes . I grew up on the original cartoon TV series . Any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughs than this entire movie . Not present is Penny 's cool computer book . Also not present is the gag with the self - destructing orders that always ends up detonating on the Chief . New are a smooth talking Gadget convertible ( the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car ) and an element of a typical , unrealistic Hollywood romance . Do n't fill the coffers to pay for Disney executives and even their _ ex_executives - do n't see this movie.<br /><br / >
0 I had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend , and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie ... any movie . And since the only movie we 'd not seen was Inspector Gadget , we decided to go in for that.<br /><br />BIG MISTAKE . This is a movie that might appeal only to kids . Oh , and it 's not like I do n't enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience . But this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention . If you have nothing to do at home , go to sleep . Better than wasting hard - earned cash on this . Go check out the film if you 're a kid or if you 're a parent with a kid :)
0 5 minutes into this movie I was hyperventilating , shaking , and writhing in pain . And not in the good way . The story is about a troupe of idiotic children making prank phone calls to a psycho which is always a good idea . Turns out psychos do n't like prank phone calls because in 2 minutes time he 's at their door killing poor Williams mom and dad . Well skip ahead 15 years and guess what ? Still prank phone calling people . Yep you would of thought that a horrible murder would of deterred them from doing that ever again but no . So after about two hours later and way too many scream ripoffs I realized that this movie gave me nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth and a severe urge to take my own life . This piece of crap is n't even worth laughing at the shoddy production , the " acting " , or Rutger haurs dwindling career . I love crappy horror movies but this is the most unsatisfying piece I 've ever seen . Just do n't .
0 Saw it yesterday night at the Midnight Slam of the Festival des films du Monde in Montreal . What a disappointment . This movie is clearly over rated by IMDb fans . The acting was only but regular . The directing did n't bring anything new or interesting . The plot lacks considerably : the movie is all about those college grads and the game they play making prank calls(7eventy 5ive ) . And on top of that , you can predict the movie 's end in the first five minutes . If you like prank calls and a slasher with an axe that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie , you might like it . If you do n't , this movie is not worth it .
0 The plot of 7EVENTY 5IVE involves college kids who play a cruel phone game that unexpectedly ( to them , if not to fans of horror ) gets them in over their heads . The STORY of 7EVENTY 5IVE , on the other hand , is that of a horror film that had a wee little bit of promise , sadly outweighed by really bad writing.<br /><br />What could have been a fun , if somewhat silly , old - fashioned slasher tale is derailed early on by its filmmakers ' misguided belief that the audience would enjoy watching a bunch of loud , whiny rich kids bitching at each other for most of the film 's running time . With the exception of a police detective played by Rutger Hauer , ( in a minor role that is designed mainly to add the movie 's only star power ) every character on screen is a different breed of young A - hole.<br /><br />Male and female , black and white , straight and gay , an entire ensemble of shallow and shrill college kids carries the bulk of the film 's narrative . Worse , since the tale deals with a PARTY game gone awry , most of the time the scenes are completely filled with these little b*****ds . Because of this , there are few breaks for the viewer , who must put up with the angry sniping of the thinly - drawn protagonists . Even though at least some of these people are supposedly friends , invariably all characters interact in a very hostile manner , long before any genuine conflict has actually arisen . This leads to the worst possible result in a slasher film : The audience , intended to care about the leads , instead not only cheers on the anonymous killer , but wishes that he had arrived to start picking off the vacuous brats far earlier.<br /><br />The real shame of this poor characterization is that otherwise 7EVENTY 5IVE actually DID have some potential . Visually it 's fine . First - time directors Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor know how to build a suspenseful mood . They also manage to deliver on some competent , if sparse , moments of classic 80s - style gore . Surprisingly , the production 's cast is also fairly able . It is n't that the actors are n't capable of expressing realistic human emotion ; it is simply that the screenplay ( co - written by newcomer Vashon Nutt and director Hooks , who fared much better behind the camera than with a keyboard ) is short of such moments.<br /><br />7EVENTY 5IVE can hardly be recommended , as its familiar premise and few thrills ca n't outweigh the bad taste left behind by a story driven by a gaggle of unpleasant characters . In this tepid whodunnit , the real mystery is why anyone should care about a group of young folk who ca n't even manage to like each other .
0 What an utter disappointment ! The score of 6,1 here on IMDb built up some mild expectations but , oh my , was I disappointed . The first thing that bugs me are those braindead , stereotyped university kids . Yes , I know teens can be childish and so on , but why are they in movies always portrayed as complete braindead morons ? There was one character that I thought was alright , but he / she ( not revealing it here ) was killed off way before the end . The other characters was poorly executed and even the supposed hero / heroine just did n't do it for me . On the plus side : The plot is pretty good and the productions values a cut above for these kind of flicks . The acting was generally not very good , Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role . But it all fails with bland and braindead characters . You just stop caring about them after 10 minutes . 4/10 ( and that s being generous ) .
0 When I caught a glimpse of the title I thought are we going to get another try - hard hip slasher , but actually I found " 7eventy 5ive " to be a mildly passable , and almost 80s throwback after a tediously slow mid - section it picks up momentum for the final half - hour leading to it 's outrageously tacky climax and downright cop out ending . It wo n't win awards for originality , because it 's as systematic as you can get and steals its thunder in the way of thrills ( usual cheap jump scares ) , location ( secluded mansion ) and motivation from other films . The gleaming direction is by - the - book and the material is quite hackneyed with poorly realised red herrings within its elaborate plotting and flimsy script . Sometimes laughable , but nonetheless I was entertained mainly due to its brutal and grisly acts of pulpy violence towards some rather obnoxiously annoying college students by a psychotic killer with a battle axe . The performances were n't bad in the shape of a spunky young cast , however the characters they were portraying were n't particularly enticing . An always presentable Rutger Hauer shows up in a short supportive role as a grizzled detective . A slickly made , but a shallow and forgettable addition to the fold .
0 Here we go with other slasher movie , Good looking people and Acting from everyone was really good!<br /><br />Few kids playing pranks phones calls and there parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids ! 20 Years after they are still friends , They go to huge house , have fun , Drugs and Sex ( no nudity ) for least half a hour of the movie ! Again they start making pranks phone call all over again ! and then killer comes back kills them off one by one and killer is in BIG BLACK COAT with axe just like Urban Legend movie,<br /><br />Deaths scene really weird , really odd times too.<br /><br />Nice slasher movie at this part would gave 7/10 but the twist at the end of the movie made the whole movie kinda of pointless < br /><br />The twist killed the movie for me so I going to give it 4/10
0 I 'm sorry to all the fans , but this is a useless movie . The acting is bad , even wooden , it over - hypes the fright - factor early on , and does n't exactly work . I think there was supposed to be a twist at the end , but it just ended up being maddeningly confusing . What the hell ? The dude who was killing everyone was one of the hunted ? Try again.<br /><br />Its hardly original , and it is n't even particularly good as a straight slasher . And that 's saying something.<br /><br />I think whoever did the castings , whoever wrote the script , and whoever thought of the concept should be mercilessly fired and deported.<br /><br />Don't watch this movie . If someone puts this on at a party , throw the disc out the window and put on a good horror movie , like Silence of the Lambs or The Shining .
0 I was attracted to seeing this movie because of this plot and my desire to watch a horror.<br /><br />To my disappointment , this turned into more of a comedy than a horror . The acting , dialog , and flow of the movie was all very poorly done . Much of it did n't make sense . For example , there 's a party of about 30 people and they 're all terrified of one person despite them being at a secret location and are all healthy looking young adults and the guy threatening them sounds haggard . I kept thinking , maybe this was a parody of another movie like Scary Movie , but they were trying too hard to make it look gruesome - emphasis on try.<br /><br />The blood and gore are also poorly done . I 've seen Halloween costumes look more believable than this . A guy with his head cut clean off ... looked clean - missing signs bone , flesh , blood , and even the head . A strong downward strike with an ax on a corpse should lodge itself into something ... seemed like the guy was swinging a bat instead of an ax.<br /><br />Revealing who the main villain was supposed to be a twist , but contradicted other parts in the story . What was going in the guy 's mind to turn out like that ? If there was going to be a twist , you should at least build up to it adding mystery and suspense .
0 This was n't really a very good movie . There were lots of implausible and predictable things that happened during the course of the film ... but I think that most of the reviewers are missing the point of why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience . THIS MOVIE WAS PRODUCED BY MAGIC JOHNSON ! Is n't that enough to inspire us all to check out this film ? A film produced by a former NBA star does n't come along every day , you know . Beautifully stupid kids in a big house getting slashed by an axe wielding psycho . Every clich√© trotted out for us to groan over . Teen sex . And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON ! I ca n't say enough about this movie ! Teen drug use ! College hijinx ! And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON ! Yippeeee !
0 This is the worst adaption of a classic story I have ever seen . They needlessly modernize it and some points are actually just sick.<br /><br />The songs rarely move along the story . They seem to be thrown in at random . The flying scene with Marley is pointless and ludicrous.<br /><br />It 's not only one of the worst movies I 've seen , but it is definitely the worst musical I 've ever seen.<br /><br />It 's probably only considered a classic because " A Christmas Carol " is such a classic story . Just because the original story was a classic does n't mean that some cheap adaption is .
0 I could n't not recommend a Christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel ( trust me , double negatives are required here -- it 's that bad ) . This film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter . The musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good ( " Thank You Very Much " has a decent melody , but the lyrics are stupid beyond words ) . I would gladly bear the chains worn by Scrooge in the film 's bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals again.<br /><br />The only entertaining part of this movie ( completely unintentional by the way ) involves Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley . Dressed in a silly powder white costume , Guinness foppishly prances through his scenes in what was either an attempt to make it appear as though he was floating like a ghost , or to show his utter disdain with having to be in this dreadful movie . Albert Finney , meanwhile , blends the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create his hopelessly loathsome character of Quasimodo / Scrooge . Finney 's Scrooge is so hideous a person , it 's impossible to believe his transformation.<br /><br />Steer clear of this abomination of filmmaking at all costs .
0 now do n't get me wrong , i do enjoy christmas movies . i love its a wonderful life and i really enjoy the versions of a christmas carol with george c. scott and alistair sim . but this particular movie is awful . i think the i love life song the ghost of christmas present sings is especially painful . albert finney sings fairly well in annie . i do n't know what s wrong with him in this movie but it sounds as though someone is trying to sing through a mouthful of dead gerbils . the only thing that saved this movie for us was shutting the sound off and watching the dance numbers accompanied by the south park christmas cd .
0 This is a bigger budgeted film than usual for genre director Honda ( with more evidently elaborate sets ) ¬ñ though the special effects still have that distinctive cheesiness to them ( witness the giant bats and rodents on display ) . It also utilizes a surprising number of American actors : Joseph Cotten playing the visionary scientist looks ill - at - ease and frail ( but , then , his character is supposed to be 204 years old ! ) , an innocuous Richard Jaeckel is the photographer hero while , as chief villains , we get Cesar Romero and Patricia Medina ( both essentially campy ) . As I 've often said , I grew up watching English - language films dubbed in Italian ¬Ö but hearing Hollywood actors in Japanese is another thing entirely ! < br /><br />LATITUDE ZERO feels like a juvenile version of a typical Jules Verne adventure , and is fairly entertaining on that level ; indeed , it 's preferable to Honda 's low - brow variations on the monsters - on - the - rampage formula because of the inherent quaint charm of the set - up in this case . The plot involves the kidnapping of a famous scientist by Romero ¬ñ he was intended to establish himself in the underwater , technologically advanced city devised by Cotten ( to which the world 's foremost minds are being recruited ) . We 're treated to plenty of silly battles between the rival subs , but the most amusing scenes are certainly the raid on Romero 's cave ¬ñ in fact , Cotten doing somersaults and fending off men in rubber suits ( via flames and laser emitted from his glove ! ) must surely count as the nadir of his acting career ; the other elder in the cast , Romero , is more in his element ¬ñ after all , he had been The Joker in the BATMAN TV series and movie of the 1960s ! Cotten has a scantily - clad blonde physician on his team , and is assisted by a hulking Asian ; Romero , on the other hand , is flanked by an Oriental femme fatale ¬ñ who , however , ends up getting a raw deal for her efforts ( the girl 's brain is eventually transplanted into a hybrid of lion and condor ¬Ö which is among the phoniest - looking creatures you ever saw ! ) . Apparently , a 2-disc set of this one from Media Blasters streets on this very day ! !
0 No matter how well meaning his " message " is - this film is a terribly made trainwreck - awful acting , lame camera work - I do not know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is lousy at it . You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention . He is a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer . Some how Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention themselves babble on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is choppy , predictable and sappy .
0 Overrated and only for those people in their 20 's whom wear particularly thick rose tinted glasses , who never actually saw it in the first place because they were to young . Awful animation , dialogue and a tired narrative . A real product of the 80 's , the novel gimmick of a puzzle TOY ( that s right , TOY not the absurd , pretentious and child alienating " collectors action figurine " ) , sold on the back of a poor cartoon and other paraphernalia , only matters to those who bought the TOY when they were " actual " children in the period of ' 84 ' to ' 87 ' . It Has become cult because of those same adults are to immature to let go of their memories . Avoid .
0 Being that I loved the original " Caligula " even with all its flaws , I have to say this remake trailer was abysmal.<br /><br />Listening to Jovovich say in that lazy American accent " Mmm cuhligyooluh ... " makes me feel sick . The set does n't look Roman at all ... it looks like some rich actor 's Hollywood mansion backyard , and the Roman costumes look like cheap crap you buy at a suburban costume shop.<br /><br />That " charming " Adriana Asti looks like a fifty year old Hispanic woman totally terrified out of her mind , as if not knowing it 's a movie trailer.<br /><br />The acting has got to be some of the worst I 've ever seen , with most of the lines I hear being random actors screaming " CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " as loudly and obnoxiously annoyingly as they can.<br /><br />The random sex scenes also filled a good 40 or 50 % of the trailer , and the scenes with notable actors / actresses like Gerard Butler ( who graces the screen in shadows for all of three and a half seconds ) not doing anything but looking uncomfortable or going all - out over the top with their minimal lines , just dragging it down with the ridiculousness of their delivery.<br /><br />Courtney Love 's part consists of her looking like her usual dumpy crack - whore self leaning against a door mumbling about the moon or something . You ca n't tell because she 's either drunk or high or just mumbling idiotically.<br /><br />Karen Black is just annoying ... randomly laughing , and screaming in such a way that irritates you.<br /><br />Helen Mirren ... she was in the original , and her return to " Caligula " consists of ... " CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " I particularly " love " ( and by love , I mean hate ) Ennia 's line , " Caligola ... j00 no maki me * something incoherent * .... * something that sounds like j00nalo * " It 's also insanely arrogant to say Caligula 's four year reign was greater than Jesus 's birth and death.<br /><br />Honestly , this has got to be the worst , most exploitative , self - indulgently arrogant piece of crap labeled as " art " I 've ever seen . Even if Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula , he should n't have shown up or given his name over for this crap - pile , no matter how much they paid him ( unless it was a billion trillion yen ) . Worst trailer ever .
0 I have nothing more to say but it was awful . I can not imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this degrading mess . And if certain actors do n't want people to question their sexuality then perhaps they should refrain from making more of these films . There was at least one seen that left me curious . Just my opinion . SHUDDER to think what was going on that was cut from the film . SHUDDER to wonder what went through the minds of the actors who made this film . Shudder to think about the thought process and voyeurism that went on in the directors mind . Like I stated before its a degrading mess . Its not even funny . As Ebert said of the film Caligula with Malcolm McDowell , Its not a good film , not a good story and its not even good porn . YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
0 This may have been based on historical events , and we know that the makers of this TV docu - drama took liberties to make it more dramatic - I can live with that - but it was just so badly done ! I was amazed in the event of an unfolding mid - air crisis how calm everyone seemed , surely someone would have panicked , and what a smooth flight , no passenger discomfort apparent - come on ! Not sure about the regulations , nowadays some of the airline security stuff seems OTT nonsense , but why take your shoes off before the emergency landing , common sense tells me this is not a good idea ! The shots of this massive airliner coming down on this remote airstrip were unconvincing and fake . In reality it would have been an awesome sight viewed from the ground nearby , in this movie it was out of proportion and looked like the model it probably was . Escape slides appeared at the front and mid emergency doors , yet nobody appeared to exit from the front , even though the drop was much less . The Captain went back into the plane after the landing - why ? this was never explained . We know the emergency landing was due to being out of fuel , but even so there must have been some fuel sloshing around at the bottom of the tanks , and the risk of explosion must have been a very real danger , yet the evacuation seemed almost leisurely , and everyone stands around at the foot of the escape slides instead of getting as far away as possible , as I am sure I would have done . There were just too many inconsistencies , errors and faked action in this . I would have preferred to have seen a representation of the drama in real time , and with realistic motion of the plane portrayed . It had the potential to be quite thrilling , but doubtless due to the budget restrictions failed , and made one feel that a plane losing all engines was no big deal really , and you would safely glide down to a bit of a bumpy landing , but no real danger ! - the reality of course being somewhat different !
0 I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definately rules : This movie is aweful ! From the acting to the non - realistic animation to the countless errors . I was actually hoping that the flaps would have been extended by a stretch of the imagination ( ca n't extend flaps without engines ) . The landing gear can not be lowered unless you have electricity . That tiny little fan that was going was not sufficient by any stretch to lower the landing gear . The one thing I thought was quite peculiar is when they landed , the back wheels touched down and then the nose one broke off , thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air . How did the captain apply left and right brakes to tires that were n't touching the ground ? Did they forget the spoilers ? Word to the director : Find out * all * you can about planes before attempting a " plane " movie . Sorry for the technical rant , but I give this movie 1/10 .
0 I HATE plane crash movies ... ALL of them ! In fact , I hate them all with a passion ! First of all , they are cheap - looking and have no craftsmanship ! Secondly , they insult the airline industry and say to the audience that all planes do is ... FALL OUT OF THE SKY AND CRASH!<br /><br />Why I wince at such a film ? This could happen to any of us and with worser consequences than those suffered by the characters in said movie ... which is the only chilling aspect of an airline disaster yarn such as this . I hate this movie because it 's like all the 50,000,000 stupid - ass airplane chaos movies before it ! Freefall is like all the others : nothing more than boredom before the clich√©d bullshit dramatic scenes take place . < br /><br />First , off we have same cast of retards on this flying death trap : The Cleaver - esquire family of three , the yuppie baastard , and the bitch of a flight attendant complete with a big blond hairdo from 1987 scolding anyone who is the least bit frightened ! < br /><br />My second gripe is this should n't be a full - length movie , but a documentary explaining everything about the Air Canada " Gimbli Glider " incident a.k.a " Freefall " right down to the safety precautions.<br /><br />My third and final gripe is with all airline films of this caliber(with the exception of Fearless ) Why the hell did the male steward instruct the passengers to remove there shoes ? ( I could understand high heels and sharp , loose objects , but c'mon!)Like that 's gon na ' make them any more f#*king safer than they are now ! This plane if they(the passengers ) did n't know any better : knew they were going to crash land . Why would you force 100 injured people down a rubber slide that can cause skin to peel and bleed on impact only to walk in their stocking feet on a debris field ! Does this make any sense to anyone?<br /><br />Fearless and the hit ABC series " Lost " had more depth and realism to air disaster than just " plane malfunctions - people panic - stewards become assholes - plane lands without wheels in a field - people wander without shoes and jackets , etc . The same old crap from Airport 1975 ! Freefall was so typical of a air - crash movie that I almost expect to see either Charlton Heston or Peter Graves burst into the damn passenger cabin at any moment . Could we at least see how these poorly - acted characters go back to normalcy instead of people rejoicing amidst the impending tragedy that is staring in front of them ? Typical moronic Lifetime movie ! Cheap and Stupid ! < br /><br />The director of " Freefall " should stick to cheap made - for - TV movies with white middle - aged women with stupid teenage kids who do drugs and have marital problems . As for suspense ... leave it to the professionals ... you hack ! Why should we the audience sit through over an hour and a half of this Airport wannabe rehash . I hope to god they do n't make plane crash movies like this anymore . If this were like the ABC series " Lost " then it would be something to watch . But this is utter crap and then some . Stop turning every plane disaster movie into " Airport 1975 " ! This is not " Airport " this is cheap pathetic waste of my time . I would not recommend this movie or any made - for - TV air disaster movie to anyone not even my worst enemies .
0 A good cast and they do their best with what they 're given , but the story makes no sense , the characters ' actions are inexplicable , and there are too many moments of unintentional humor , as when a man is killed by being pierced with pieces of a phonograph record or when they get the witch drunk to a hip hop beat and then hit her over the head with a bottle and she grabs her hostage and pouts off . The scene when the two witch and her victim ( played by the same actress ) are in the house together sets up like a 3 Stooges routine , and the plot begs the question : if the witch wants to possess this other woman 's soul , why does n't she just do it instead of leading these people on this elaborate chase ? Not to be missed is Christopher Walkin 's eyeglasses and his automotive explanation of the afterlife ( paraphrased ) : " The ancient Egyptianas - they wee materialists . They expected the body to last through eternity , like a used car that you souped up . But the Druids , they knew you could n't drive in the afterlife . You had to get out and walk . " Huh ? The ending is absolutely indecipherable . Seems like they just ran out of film .
0 This film seems to be completely pointless . There is no reason why anything that happens in it happens , as if it was written by a small child who got bored halfway through and thought " how can I wrap this up ? " . And what were Jared Harris and Christopher Walken thinking ? Did they do it for a bet ? I could n't tell you the plot , I 'm not entirely sure there is one to be quite frank , but if there is it did n't register . Jared and his bird go to Ireland after she falls down the stairs while lashed up , as you do . They go to a house with a very annoying small girl in it , meet Christopher Walken who has dug up some ancient woman preserved in peat . He brings her back to life for no other reason than it continues the story and she shows her gratitude by immediately icing him . From then on it all gets a bit silly . A couple of hours of my life that I 'd like back !
0 Yikes did this movie blow . The characters were weak , the plot weaker . I figured this could n't be too bad because it has Christoper Walken , oops . He must have done this because he was bored and needed the money . The characters were supposed to be Irish but noone had an Irish accent . I am desperately trying to find something nice about this , I ca n't except Walken did a fine job with a wooden character . Find something to read , or watch discovery , do n't ever see this movie .
0 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . However , the little slave girl , Alice and Jared Harris imitating Christopher Walken is what makes this movie entertaining . Alice 's smoking , drinking and uncanny way of showing up when her name is called is strange and interesting . I have to applaud Jared for his Christopher Walken imitation , and Christopher Walken for allowing this to be in the movie .
0 The writer came up with a pretty decent idea for a story , but many flaws in the execution of the plot took so much away from the film as to nearly render it unwatchable . Basic elements such as character development were glossed over , at best . Inconsistencies also reared their ugly heads . A massive mansion in the middle of the rural Irish countryside ? Characters just " showing up " in the gardens during a stormy night ( at very convenient times , I might add ) ? All in all it was n't " bad " . I rated it a 4 , based mostly on the story and talent of Alison Elliott .
0 There 's really not a lot to say about Las Vegas Lady . It 's harmless enough , but it is little more than a dull heist film from the 70s . The movie is neither as clever nor as sexy as it strives to be . The plot is a retread of the tired old casino robbery storyline that 's been done to death . Except in the case of Las Vegas Lady , I think the robbery plot was designed by a 3 year - old . The plan involves three women ¬ñ one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the Circus Cicus building , one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity , and one to stand around exposing her cleavage . That 's pretty much it . Intricate , huh ? Other than Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breasts , the other women involved in the plot are n't particularly memorable . Las Vegas Lady co - stars Stuart Whitman . When not pawing Stevens , his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun fights ever put on film.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie . It does have that 70s feel to it that I always enjoy and some nice shots of Las Vegas circa 1975 . But the movie itself is too dull to rate any higher than a 4/10 ¬ñ and that 's probably overstating it . In the end , Las Vegas Lady is a waste of some perfectly good cleavage .
0 Well , i could nt get into the plot , but that s just me maybe . Listless camera - movements at times , nevertheless this movie has got a charming vintage quality . The acting is genuine at times and entertaining with the occasional chase sequence involving scantily clad ladies , which was nice . The climax is confused and disjointed , but still ... err riveting , thanx to Stella Stevens.<br /><br />The stunts are interesting , specially because of the 70 's las vegas backdrop . There are a few jerky hand - held camera - movements at the end , which keep me guessing , for a while . But i do n't think I ll b chasing the DVD , just yet .
0 Watching beautiful women sneaking around , playing cops and robbers is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures the medium film lets me enjoy . So The House on Carroll Street was not entirely a waste of time , although the story is contrived and the screenplay uninspired and somewhat irritating.<br /><br />There are many allusions to different Hitchcock pictures , not least the choice of Kelly McGillis in the starring role . She is dressed up as Grace Kelly , and she is not far off the mark . Not at all . But her character is not convincing . The way she is introduced to the audience , she should be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life . After all the movie deals with a clearly defined time period , true events and a specific issue . But the story degenerates within the first minutes into a sorry run - off - the - mill crime story with unbelievable coincidences , high predictability and a set of two dimensional characters . This is all the more regrettable , as the performances of the actors are good , as are the photography and the set design.<br /><br />The finale in Central Station , New York is breath taking . It starts in the subterranean section and then moves up to the roof . The movie can be praised for its good use of architecture .
0 a romance without feeling , a drama of issues without point ( or drama ) .... This film is supposed to be all these and fails on each and every account , as if it is n't trying . Or as if the director / editor / scriptwriter team is n't really trying . The actors are able -- they need better support.<br /><br />One element that does n't fail is the score by George Delarue . Beautiful and moving . What a shame it 's attached to this film . In a good film actors ' words and movements and music synchronize and enhance the impact . This editor plastered on music with no regard for dialogue and movement . The love scene is particularly grating in this respect : an insult to the talents of the lead actors.<br /><br />There is another element in the film that works : location photography . Notably one moment in Grand Central Station . I 'd guessed in advance what was going to happen ; but how it was filmed in that setting was breathtaking.<br /><br />Some commentators on this board have pointed out that US assimilation of criminal Nazi scientists actually happened during these years of the MacCarthy scare . The moment the film seems to start looking seriously at American society , it switches into conventional romance ; before any human feelings can move us , it 's away on a ( predictable ) ' thriller ' escapade.<br /><br />Just as the film insults the talents of the actors , it insults the issues it 's pretends ( and fails ) to take up.<br /><br />You are warned .
0 This movie was awful and an insult to the viewer . Stupid script , bad casting , endless boredom.<br /><br />In the usual tradition of Hollywood , the government of the US is shown as always evil . The Communist - sympathizer nitwits in Hollywood , most of whom are as dumb as a box of rocks , love taking the lone nutcase Eugene McCarthy and picturing him as the leader of a vast movement . The truth is that at the time he was considered a fringe character who was exploiting a legitimate concern about the Soviet Communists for political gain.<br /><br />Oh yeah , and the US brought over all those evil Nazis . Like Werner VonBraun , without whom we would have no space program . He actually loved being American and became a great asset to the country.<br /><br />And yet the irony is that the fools in Hollywood , an uneducated lot who live a fantasy existence , still believe that the government should run EVERYTHING and give us all what we want . And yet , this is the same government that they continually portray as a consummate evil in films like this .
0 Oh god , what a horrible , horrible film . Meant to be a comment on the state of society , it 's just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality TV . Interstitials hosted by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most obnoxious part , written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful . Rather , these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting , condescending speech that shoves the " meaning " of the film down the viewer 's throat.<br /><br />Also , a point to would - be filmmakers : Long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art . Neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity.<br /><br />If anyone out there is interested in watching this film , please do n't . Seriously . Please . You have better things to do .
0 This film is so bad - dialogues , story , actors and actresses - everything ! - that it 's hard to imagine that we 'll see a worse movie this year or in the following years . " Love 's Brother " ( set in Australia among Italian immigrants ) has nothing but shallow clich√©s about Italian culture to offer , and it is quite telling that even the Italians from and in Italy speak ENGLISH in the film . The message of the film - ugly people have to marry ugly people , beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - is truly discomforting . Giovanni Ribisi is quite good in films like ' Suburbia ' or ' Lost in Translation ' , but here his pseudo - Italian accent is hard to bear . See this film at your own risk . Trash as trash can !
0 A fashion designer trips over a cat and falls into a pool , hitting her head on something floating on the surface . With rather cheesy effects ( this was a TV movie ) she floats up out of her body . She floats through a tunnel of rings of swirling orange smoke , and black rigid figures tip into her view ( they look like the mannequins in her apartment ) . I almost thought I was watching a Jess Franco movie .... As her friends revive her , a black arm grabs her by the wrist , and she has to struggle to get loose . When she is revived , she remembers everything , and has a nasty bruise on her forearm.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter , she nearly gets hit by an out - of - control car that comes up on the sidewalk behind her . On Halloween , she decides with her boyfriend to go to Mexico for a vacation . When she gets there , she 's surprised to find it 's the Day of the Dead . They 're annoyed by another American tourist who keeps following them , and he almost drowns them.<br /><br />The designer is encouraged to join a group of people who 've had near death experiences . They 've all experienced the tunnel , but not the black figures or the repeated near escapes from death . One of them has , and he 's very anxious . She 's also encouraged to meet with a psychic.<br /><br />A Doctor tells her about people he calls " Walkers " ( the name of the novel this was based on ) . They 're people who supposedly died of one cause that , when examined , prove to have died of another cause . Thus it 's like they continued walking around after dying until they died again , but he blames it on poor record - keeping.<br /><br />I watched this on the 102 minute video , and it felt awfully long . I ca n't imagine that there 's actually a 192 minute version ! Perhaps if it was meant to be watched over two or more nights on TV it would better be watched that way than in one sitting.<br /><br />I've only read one Gary Brandner novel , Floater , and if it is representative of his work , he 's not the most original of writers . Floater had the common plot of : picked on kid kills people in revenge . Even the variation was pretty common : picked on kid dies and kills people years later in revenge from beyond the grave . And in fact it has a point in common with this movie , in that the kid practices astral projection , and when he is drowned he floats up out of his body as here . I do n't know how closely From the Dead of Night follows his novel Walkers . I understand the Howling movies do n't bear much resemblance to his novels.<br /><br />It 's quite a slow movie , and the special effects and cinematography are really held down by the ( presumably ) low budget and made - for - TV shortcomings . There are a lot of easily recognizable character actors in it . It also feels very dated , more early to mid 1980s than 1989 . I found it to be boring . A much better low - budget movie covering similar subject matter that I do n't think has dated as badly is Sole Survivor ( 1983 ) ( arguably the inspiration for the 2000s Final Destination movies ) . It blows From the Dead of Night away .
0 What do you call a horror story without horror and story ? < br /><br />This is the most irritating thing about the film : I get the feeling the writers never really decided what 's actually going on in the film ! It 's a different thing to know it , give hints for the audience and not completely reveal it , but here , you get the feeling the screenwriters do n't know it , characters in the film do not know it and audience sees that no one knows ! ( Remember " Cube " ? Even that film knew more about itself . ) < br /><br />I've consumed a lot of 80 's horror / gore films and this movie certainly has its roots deep in those films . But a lot of important things are missing . We really know nothing about the characters . They keep repeating empty lines over and over again . The story is n't really developing - it never goes anywhere . B - acting is OK in this type of horror films , but there 's not much to act in the script . We do n't care about the characters . There 's nothing to remember about them . There 's not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex . And most importantly - no thrills , no chills.<br /><br />You only get some commonly used elements of the horror film genre . They show the Lordi monsters one by one but their characters do n't really contribute anything for the story.<br /><br />I honestly believe that this amount of story , character development and atmosphere could be achieved with minimal amount of crew and equipment . Oh yeah , film makers used to do that - and more - some 20 years ago ! I felt the shared embarrassment of the audience as the film ended . Too bad really .
0 Lordi was a major hype and revelation in 2007 because they won the Eurovision Song Contest with a ( not - so - heavy ) metal song called " Hard Rock Hallelujah " and appeared on stage dressed like hideous monsters . But , let 's face it , their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents . The Eurovision contest gradually turned into one big political circus over the years and Lordi probably just won because their song finally brought a little change and ¬ñ even more importantly - because their whole act sort of ingeniously spoofed the whole annual event . The absolute last thing Lordi 's first ( and hopefully last ) horror film brings is change and ingenuity . " Dark Floors " , based on an idea of the lead singer and starring the rest of the band in supportive roles , is a truly unimaginative and hopeless accumulation of clich√©s . The immense budget ( " Dark Floors " supposedly is the most expensive Finnish film ever ) definitely assures greatly macabre set pieces and impressive make - up art , but what 's the point where there 's no story that is worth telling ? The film takes is set in a busy hospital where a bunch of people , among them a father and his young daughter with an unidentifiable illness , become trapped in the elevator during a power breakdown . When the doors open again , the floors are empty and it looks as if the hospital lies abandoned since many years already . Trying to reach the exit , the group stumbles upon several morbid and inexplicable obstacles , like eyeless corpses , screaming ghosts and Heavy Metal monsters emerging from the floors . The only three points I 'm handing out to " Dark Floors " are exclusively intended for the scenery and the adequate tension building during the first half of the film . For as long as the sinister events do n't require an explanation , the atmosphere is quite creepy , but as soon as you realize the explanation will a ) be very stupid or b ) never come , the wholesome just collapses like an unstable house of cards . Lordi 's costumes never really were scary to begin with ( except maybe to traditional Eurovision fans ) and , in combination with a story more reminiscent to Asian ghost - horror , they just look downright pathetic and misfit . With all the national myths and truly unique exterior filming locations , I personally always presumed Finland ¬ñ The Land of a Thousand Lakes ¬ñ would be the ideal breeding ground for potentially horrific horror tales , but I guess that 's another disillusion on my account .
0 Just finished watching , ca n't say I was impressed.<br /><br />It starts of quite good , the visual and the atmosphere gives a creepy feeling as this type of movie should . But it all ends when the first lordi monster appears . Not only do you recognize them from the band lordi , but they are seriously malplaced in the movie . Doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are so 80's.<br /><br />As for the storyline , it starts of as similar horror movies , people trapped inside a hell hole . But there is no clear story on why and what is happening . The viewer is thrown some lines on possible reasons , but the lines never meet and end up to anything but a mess.<br /><br />With all the money spent on this film , with an intriguing start and some good effects , I had thought someone would have taken better care of the product . I wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their show costumes could be scary ( except they aren't).<br /><br />So the movie gets cred for the visuals , i guess the money had to go somewhere . But the rest is an embarrassing attempt from a rock band to make their on - stage monster aliases scarier .
0 I love cheesy horror flicks . I do n't care if the acting is sub - par or whether the monsters look corny . I liked this movie except for the bewildered feeling all the way from the beginning of the film to the very end . Look , I do n't need a 10 page dissertation or a sign with big letters explaining a plot to me . But Dark Floors takes the " what is this movie about ? " thing to a whole new ( annoying ) level . What IS this movie about?<br /><br />This is n't exceptionally scary or thrilling but if you have an hour and a half to kill and/or you want to end up feeling frustrated and confused , rent this winner .
0 An interesting idea involving an alternative dimension inside a hospital . It recalled - Stephen Kings " Langoliers " , " Kingdom Hospital " and old twilight zone episodes . Atmospherically strong , the set up was great . There were also some very clever ' time loop ' moments which always have that head - melt appeal . The story had plenty of vague references which led me to believe that all the ensuing weirdness of - time slips / ghosts / a weird bat winged demon and a rather silly heavy metal attired ghoul - thing would be explained . And THAT was were Dark Floors severely let me down . Based on my viewing the movie gives NO EXPLANATION as to what is behind the events . Whilst , some ambiguity is always expected / welcome in these kind of films . Dark floors took it to new heights of vagueness . I do n't expect things wrapped up in a pretty ribbon , but neither should I be left feeling " Huh ? .. is that it ? ... Did I dose off ? Maybe , I hit chapter skip by mistake ? " Dark Floors left me with a deeply unsatisfying suspicion that " It was all a dream " which is a shame because up until the last reel I was very much on board and enjoying the movie .
0 I love horror movies that brings out a real amount of mystery like say " silent hill " ( which i found to be quite good , but still , was missing something ) and movies that keeps you guessing , this i thought was one of those movies . At first the movie starts out with some really good suspense and builds up a good starting point for a good horror scene , but after that it just rolls down the hill and from there it only goes faster and faster down . I mentioned silent hill at first for a reason because i can see a lot of " stolen " themes from that movie in here .. All in all i would say , watch silent hill instead of this one , its better , its more scary , it has a lot more suspense and also the ending is a lot better .. And best of all , you wo nt feel ripped off as i did with this one .. This just seems to be one of those " i like that movie so I 'm gon na re - make it in my own really bad version " kinda movie .. Oh and one more thing ... Lordi .. in a horror movie ... that s like trying to scare a kid with a care bear who has " hug me and i will love you forever " written on the stomach of it ..
0 There are some elements that save this movie from being a total catastrophe , but are overshadowed with bad acting , plot holes , deus ex machina thrown ins , stupid dialogs , weak script , and predictable clich√©s ... <br /><br />What we have here is a horror movie with a storyline that goes nowhere for most of the time . A group of unlikely heroes including a black guy that gets it first ( yeah , that clich√© seems to be still very much alive even in Finland ) , seem to have trouble trying to exit a mysteriously empty hospital . There are shrieking ghosts ( very imaginative ) , zombies ( at one point I thought at least they did n't use zombies , but they came ) , and Finnish glam - rock band with demonic make - up on , getting in their way . There is also some time - shift doodle present , but it adds up nothing to the storyline . Autistic girl and a hobo seem to have some deeper understanding of a situation , but they never spell it out to the viewer , or their confused friends . Their lines consist only of profound life lesson thoughts like : " What happens will happen ... " or " Light ca n't live in the darkness ... " or the ominous " I need a red crayon ... red crayon . " So all this characters ( including worried father and sweet doctor in distress types ) end up doing is running around them dark floors , and from or mistakenly to the demons . Occasionally a ghost or a group of zombies show up , and if it seems a demon keyboardist ca n't spot a group of six people coming towards it , waving a flashlight and conversing , it was just pretending . And apparently this demon can break through walls without much hassle , but opening elevator door is beyond its capabilities.<br /><br />In the end we even get a " it was all a dream " sequence twist . Or maybe it was n't . Oh , boy I wish this movie was , and that kind that makes time seem to move faster so it all plays out in just 10 minutes or so ...
0 I 'm not sure quite why I clicked " contains spoiler " , because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what is supposed to be going on to spoil it.<br /><br />Visually it mostly delivers . Well , apart from some 80 's throwback rubber - mask monsters . I 'll say now that before watching this I had never seen the band Lordi , nor knew anything about them bar that they won Eurovision . Apparently the monsters in this are members of the band , pretty much in their stage personas . Whatever . Anyway , I did n't know this while watching . I just thought the monsters / demons were mostly passable . Just about.<br /><br />I'm almost sure there is a semi - coherent explanation behind what we see on - screen , but it may actually be better not to know it . It probably would actually have been incredibly lame come to think on it . The action keeps it rolling along pretty much well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained , even if half the entertainment factor is joking about wtf is supposed to be happening in this movie exactly.<br /><br />I gave it a four mainly because I got a good laugh out of it , especially out of how it explains pretty much nothing . Must have been the mood I was in , but I found that hella funny for some reason . Then I look up the movie on the internet and find out that NOBODY knows what the hell it 's supposed to be about . That amused me further , and raised my score an extra half point to a 4/10.<br /><br />It 's not scary , or particularly coherent , but it 's pretty nice visually and sonically . Overall , far from essential , but watchable . Do n't expect too much and do n't expect it to make any sense and it might entertain you if you are in the right mood .
0 1st watched 6/18/2009 ¬ñ 2 out of 10 ( Dir- Pete Riski ) : Weird psychotic movie about a girl with autism who is being tested in a hospital , the power flickers , and then all hell breaks loose . I 'm honestly not sure what the intentions were of the filmmakers on this one . What we get for the next 1 hour and a half(at least it was n't longer ) was a twisted horror / twilight zone / zombiefest / ghost movie that really ended up making no sense at all even to the very end . Initially , after the power goes out , everyone is missing in the hospital except for a small group of misfits including the girl and his father . There is the typical annoying character , a creepy old man , and the typical tough guy similar to many scarefests and , of course , the young girl the main character gets attracted to . Random stuff starts happening at various times like ghosts and monsters appearing , a hinting that time has stopped , and dead people as this small group try to escape whatever they 're in . Of course , the autistic girl is the center of everything somehow and I really hate how they used this girl 's affliction and insinuated that she was the cause and to place it in a hospital where people are cared for is really lame . We never really find out the answer to what was going on ¬Ö which is very strange , so please avoid this dog . Unless you want to be creeped out and confused for one hour and a half this is not for you or any moviegoer . What a waste of time ¬Ö really ! !
0 Well how was I suppose to know this was " the " dumb ass promotional " Lordi Motion Picture " ? I mean , I realized this when that " dinosaur " costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his appearance I was humming " Hard Rock Hallelujah " to myself ... even though I hate that song . " Dark Floors " is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being sneaked out of the hospital by her over protective father when they , and the rest of the people in that particular elevator , become momentarily trapped ... When they arrive at their floor it comes as quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around . The hospital is empty ... Except for a variety of monsters that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason ... They run through the hallways and stairwells , encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish , shock - rock costumes ... Nothing really memorable here , except the lousy acting , lack of gore / nudity , and the utterly shameless promotional edge , reminding me very much of " KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park " . Yeah , remember that dud ? Wish I did n't ... I would just recommend avoiding all of these Ghost House films like a fungus and not listen to Lordi since they are a Gwar ripoff band !
0 I think they really let the quality of the DVD production get away from them . I rented this DVD from 2 movie stores and the second time I finally got it to play on the 3rd DVD player I tried.<br /><br />Anyone else have this issue ? It 's really hard to give the film an un - biased review after going through such a hassle to play it . For one , I 've never seen a Finnish horror film before so I was sort of bummed that the movie was done in English . Also since it 's never made clear what is wrong with Sarah , she just came off as retarded and therefore I really just hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrific happenings go away .
0 I initially gained interest in this film after reading a review saying this movie reminded the reviewer of Silent Hill.<br /><br />Being a huge Silent Hill fan , and disappointed with it 's movie debut , I thought I would give this one a chance . Mind , Fearnet only lists this movie as " Dark Floors " , not by it 's full name . So when I saw the name " Mr. Lordi " in the credits I immediately thought of the band ( I had a few friends in college that like them ) but did n't think it was important and quickly pushed the thought aside.<br /><br />The film starts out strong . Despite the fact " creepy little girl " has been done to DEATH , the good use of audio and sense of isolation really started to piece the the story together . The tense atmosphere built rapidly , and every indication pointed to the film being excellent . As monsters are the true stars of horror , I could n't wait to see what was lurking in the halls of the hospital the main characters had found themselves trapped in ... <br /><br />And then the first monster showed up , and I found myself greatly underwhelmed . By the time the second appeared , I boggled at the fact it looked like it had just come from a Megadeth concert , and the silliness turned me off completely.<br /><br />Over the course of the movie the atmosphere did remain intact , and the story left you wondering just what was going on , but the scares were pretty much non - existent . However , I held out hope that the end would make it all worthwhile . Unfortunately that was not to be the case . By the time the movie had reached it 's climax , I was in utter disbelief , and I immediately recognized the big bad in his final reveal ... The lead singer of Lordi ? Seriously ? < br /><br />Was that what the movie all boiled down to ? A bunch of poor souls being chased around a hospital by Lordi band members ? The silly monster design suddenly made sense . If you 're going to be that corny , may as well through the members of Marilyn Manson , or even KISS in there too . Not to mention the fact that I 'm pretty sure I saw the ending in one of Lordi 's music videos a few years ago . They had to go and make an entire movie off of it ? < br /><br />Worst of all , when I found out what really had been going on , all I could manage was a yawn . I 'm not going to " ruin " it for you , but I can safely say it 's probably a plot device you 've seen before . Most likely more then once.<br /><br />So , unless you 're a huge Lordi fan , stay away from this . It 's not scary , it does n't bring anything new to the table ( although it does a decent job of borrowing from other horror movies , mainly Silent Hill ) . And , I ca n't stress this enough , LORDI is the antagonist . LORDI . Talk about a buzzkill . < br /><br />Really , you 'd be better off trying to scare yourself watching Slipknot music videos . In other words , it 's just not possible .
0 This was not the worst movie I 've ever seen , but that 's about as much as can be said about it . It starts off with some good atmosphere ; the hospital is suitably sterile and alienating , the mood is set to " eerie " . And then ... nothing . Well , somethings . Just somethings that clearly do n't fit in ... and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and yet not particularly intimidating critters , and the hospital they 've taken over . I mean , come on , biker duds ? Some band watched a bit too much Gwar.<br /><br />My personal favorite was the head demon , who looks rather a lot like a middle - aged trucker desperately attempting menace , while simultaneously looking like he 'd really like prefer to sag down on an afghan - covered couch , undo his belt , pop a can of cheap beer ( probably Schlitz ) , and watch the game . Honestly , I 've seen far scarier truckers . At truckstops . Drinking coffee . WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo ! ! ! ! Scary!!<br /><br />The other monsters are even more cartoonish , and even less scary . At least , on the DVD , the videos give some explanation of their presence in the hospital ... they apparently just randomly pop up in places , play some bippy " metal " , and cause people to be dead a bit . Barring a few good special effects , and acting that is not entirely terrible given a lack of decent writing , there 's just nothing here . It 's a background - noise movie only .
0 This is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clips / commercials trying to do their first full feature length movie . On one hand the imagery , camera , lighting , CGI and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly " expensive " look and feel . Even the actors show a certain amount of potential - unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plot.<br /><br />In this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at all.<br /><br />So 50 % of the dialog consists of " What the hell was that ? " , " What was that ? " and " What the hell was that ? " . In none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though . In most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that was n't ever explained to them.<br /><br />The only reason why Skye Bennet 's performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl did n't allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with . That way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast could n't even get close to . I mean there 's not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like this:<br /><br />Ben : Is this real , huh ? Emily : Stop it . Ben : A mass psychosis , huh ? Jon : Somebody has to take control of this situation . Ben : This situation ca n't be controlled . Not by you , not by anybody . Emily : Not by you either . Ben : No < br /><br />Got me goosebumps . But not for horror , more for the horrible attempt . In some moments I felt ashamed for the actors to have added this to their vita.<br /><br />2 stars for the excellent technical work .
0 * Sigh * Leave it to us Finns to take a stupid idea , blow it out of proportion and try to market it as cool . Lordi is a mediocre band at best , and a single gimmick will get you only so far.<br /><br />To all you marketing idiots out there : this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that is often encountered when Finland tries to export something.<br /><br />Lordi is n't scary . Lordi is lame . Lordi is OVER.<br /><br />I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic - faced idiocy . Sure , they won the Eurovision.<br /><br />No , wait - they won the Eurovision . That 's it . I rest my case .
0 I have seen some pretty bad movies , and this is right up there . No plot to speak of , it 's like one of those bad coma episodes on a soap - opera . I just wanted to smack that little girl because , well lets just say , she 's real suspicious all the way through the movie . The monsters running around wearing some bling was funny . I also saw a bit of " Silent Hill " in there . And I read that this was done by , and or stared a Finnish metal band , Lordi . So it 's no wonder that it did n't make much sense . It seem to be a vehicle for promoting there band and nothing more . The FX are very good , the look of the movie , the monsters , and even the acting also good . But the story and the telling of it , just are n't there .
0 Going down as the most expensive film in Finnish history , to date , " Dark Floors " is a horror film with an extremely Lynchian narrative that recounts an ever increasingly decrepit series of " Floors " ( ironically enough ) in an abandoned hospital , in which our protagonists are trapped . Lead by an autistic daughter and her father , himself disenchanted with the hospitals apparent lack of medical progress with his daughter , make their way into an elevator debating the issue with one of the hospitals nurses . Accompanied by a security guard , a businessman and a seemingly intoxicated tramp the collective soon find the complex abandoned , but they are not alone . Directed by Finnish- born Pete Riski , more known for his television work , " Dark Floors " is filmed in English , using mainly English actors but has the notable inclusion of Finland 's arguably most famous group " Lordi " ( 2006 Eurovision song contest winners ) as themselves , i.e. in their on stage monstrous costumes , as the films antagonists , yet for all this razzmatazz the production fails where it is needed most , in convincing the audience.<br /><br />Any film that has their lead character use the phrase " it 's too quiet " is already headed down a dubious path , and this Lordi influenced horror does not break that convention . For all the good ideas that are thrown into the mix there are a handful of ripe clich√©s alongside and worst of all , anything that is interestingly original is n't fleshed out enough for it to resonate . The concept of the degrading floors is initially highly ominous and does provide a sense of inevitable doom as the audience is aware those trapped in the hospital must progress ever further down in the mire . However , there is n't enough atmosphere created to scare and intimidate the audiences into the unknowing fear , the viewer is aware the journey will become ever more dangerous , as the levels degenerate from shiny white through to hellish black , but I do n't think the characters are aware enough of this fact for it to be threatening . Also , the entire film taking place in what is essentially its own time bubble is again a very nice touch , a concept not often used in the horror genre , but the characters do n't confront the situation with enough fear and trepidation when they stumble across this fact , they continue about their business far too readily and without enough genuine concern for the idea to mean anything to the audience . These initially good ideas are just left to go to waste , as if the director and/or Mr Lordi ( who had many of the ideas used within the film ) had these thoughts , but could n't agree or decide on how to best use them and as such lose their purpose and point . < br /><br />Yet for all the frustration there are large quantities of comedy , yet not for the reasons the creators would have hoped for . Too much is clich√©d , too much is recycled and too much is just simply ridiculous . While the lead is amicably acted by Noah Huntley , the characters are mere cardboard cut outs that have been pasted into the story from other films . We have a lead man doing everything possible to protect his daughter alongside a clunkily developed love interest . Accompanying the " couple " we have the traditional token black man as a hard - nosed security guard , with the nigh on infinite clip for his sidearm , and a weasely disbelieving businessman only on the look out for himself . Worst of all though , unfortunately , is the introduction of the cast of Lordi as the creatures of the night that torment our wandering band of misfits , but not for them appearing as themselves . What makes a horror film scary to the viewing audience is contextualising the fear . " The Shining " is scary because it 's a member of your own family hounding you , in " Dawn Of The Dead " it 's our fear of each other and the primordial cannibalism and irrational thought patterns the zombies possess , in " Alien " the fear is explained , the creature is rationalised and in " Dark Floors " there is none of that . Perhaps it 's unfair to compare this production to these monoliths of the genre but when you do it shows it pales significantly and that it 's aggressors feel like nothing more than demented Klingons where you can almost see the zip on the costumes they wear , without a build up of any atmosphere " Lordi " just are n't scary.<br /><br />It 's infuriating because we all cheer for the underdog and hope they do well , you want the smaller productions to say that they can create the same quality of film as " Hollywood " churns out , much in the similar way that George A Romero started out , but it does n't always materialise . I enjoyed the film and did n't feel as if I had wasted the ninety minutes I had just sat through , but I felt enjoyment on a completely hollow level as if nothing that had occurred mattered or affected me subconsciously , emotionally or critically . I felt the almost Lynchian narrative was a standout plus point , but it fades out into nothingness . Why did it happen ? What does it mean ? Will they go through this all again ? Without even the slightest insight into what will happen the film is simply puzzling for the sake of trying to be arty . Was the entire sequence of events real or was it merely a dream sequence ? Had the autistic girl watched the Eurovision Song Contest of 2006 and simply had a highly bizarre nightmare given the stress she was under ? Who knows ? And unfortunately I fail to work up the energy to even care . " Dark Floors " is an infuriating experience that while ultimately shallow hallmarks potential and at the very least shows a plethora of creative energies from Mr Lordi , who perhaps should look into working solo to fully develop his ideas . It 's one that fans of the group or the genre should perhaps pursue but will leave you feeling left in the lurch for not having enough light shed on the situation .
0 I rented this because I 'm a bit weary of ' 80s NBC programming and apparently I saved myself a lot of money . I have nothing against any of the actors and for their credit they do a good job but this show is flawed from the premise.<br /><br />We have a character who is unlikable . He 's full of flaws , not enlightened , and a complete jerk on a good day . Yet the reason why anybody should care just is n't there . While creating an American sitcom centered around a complete bullheaded jackass is revolutionary and full of potential , it just is n't met here within this show . Most of the supporting characters are n't fully fleshed characters but rather sad punching bags that want empathy from the audience for being punching bags . As in any sitcom , they are the ones who are made the most normal for the audience to relate to , and in doing this they negate the lead character to such an extent that we see Bittinger being himself and harming people and they just stay there because .... why ? There is no reason . Any normal people would have simply left the abuse . Keeping them there without any real reason -- even the really unbelievable one given by Joanna Cassidy in the very special 2-part abortion episode that has major problems of its own -- is where the show just falls apart . To simply believe that people put up with this guy because we are told he has a heart of gold does not mesh with the reality of the situation . If anything , this is n't even dramedy . This is a badly plotted , conceived , and executed premise that had a few moments but overall met the fate it deserved . Someone had the guts to go out and make a very good idea , but the execution is so haphazard that it just looks like a weirdly scripted version of the Jerry Springer show where someone is abused by this tyrant that we 're supposed to root for because we are told to . A show like this requires a deft touch that the actors here could have provided easily , but somehow are n't able to . And that 's a fatal error that really killed the program.<br /><br />Chalk it up to a show in its infancy . Regardless , the show is worth a watch . But it really screwed up when trying to aim for the stars , and made the whole enterprise not what it could have been .
0 I 've seen this film several times in a variety of short - film festivals and it always causes me the impression that i have seen a movie trailer ! < br /><br />For a school - film is very well produced and directed , but the story ... well it needed something else to be a bigger and interesting film . The character named Tim Watcher needed some in - dept approach . This is something that lacks in some Portuguese short films - the script is always superficial.<br /><br />But still ... i liked this movie ... <br /><br />Parabens ! ( congratulations ! )
0 Unfortunately I have to agree with the critic written by halopes.<br /><br />For a short film the cinematography , costumes , sets , sound , editing and everything else is very , very good . This might seem surprising at first but I was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals , so the quality is to be expected . The problem , as usual , resides in the story itself.<br /><br />Thing is , it 's not really a story . To tell a story ( or in cinema 's case , SHOW a story ) you need plot and conflict . You need things that happen to the protagonist : events . These events happen because the protagonist wants something and , for some reason , he ca n't get it . Tim Watcher has no problems or goals . He 's a kind of supernatural entity who observes mankind . That 's it . So what we have here is pure exposition . Instead of being shown a story , we 're simply learning things about this Tim Watcher individual . Of course , considering the peculiar nature of Tim Watcher and the film 's short duration , it 's hard to give enough background about him so the movie resorts to Voice - Over Narration . In this case it 's used in the worst possible sense which is to give information that otherwise we 'd never glean . In fact , if it was n't for the VO we 'd think the character was just a kooky old man going around looking at things . To make it worse the VO also explains what 's happening on the screen ! The images we 're shown are just decoration for the text we 're listening to.<br /><br />I could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something , but because the images do n't stand on their own it 's impossible to say that . What 's left obviously has value as a measure of the crew 's technical capabilities ( not incredible , but good ) but fails to entertain , amuse , thrill or , at the very least , show a story .
0 As far as I can understand , TIW WATCHER is the first work of a young director . My doubt is if this is the work of a regular guy who happens to love films or if this is the work of a cinema student , since there is a reference to Oporto School of Arts in the final credits.<br /><br />Nevertheless , director Ricardo Pinho demonstrates with this movie a total unawareness of some basic notions about cinema . What is a movie ? How to tell a story ? It does n't matter , for the novice director . One of the first things you learn in school when you 're studying cinema is how to tell a story . You learn that , just like in novels , in movies you should also construct your story in three acts : the introduction , the development and the conclusion . You learn that your story should have a protagonist and an antagonist and that there should be a climax . You learn this is valid for a 3-hour - epic , for the regular movie , for a short film and even , believe it or not , for a 30-second commercial . You also learn there can be levels of subtleness in your approach to the academic structure and that , ultimately , you can even deconstruct it.<br /><br />In rough terms , TIM WATCHER introduces us its main character and then , the movie ends - the whole movie sounds like the introduction of the characters in Jeunet 's AM√âLIE . There are no second or third acts in TIM WATCHER . This is not a parody or an art film , thus you ca n't even try to justify the disrespect for the academic structure . You are expecting to be told a story , and it does n't happen . Worst than that , TIM WATCHER defines itself as a warning ; and one with no real purpose . It does n't make a point , or at least , not a valid one . Its point is childish , with a sense of vengeance . The situations portrayed are utterly simple and its approach is Manichaean.<br /><br />I was expecting a lot more from this short . The movie opens with a rather good - looking credits sequence and you quickly realize you are watching something with better production values than the regular Portuguese short film . I do n't know the budget for this movie , but judging for the thanks - list in the end credits , merit must go to the production team for such good connections in a country where 's difficult to have doors opened to young filmmakers.<br /><br />TIM WATCHER seems to be an exercise in style , color and carefully chosen plans , combined with a fine score . That 's all . There 's nothing else . There 's no plot . And that 's a shame because it feels like a waste of production values . Hardly , you can see in the regular Portuguese short such diversity of locations and so many available extras to enrich a story.<br /><br />As absurd as the comparison may sound , I must refer the BMW shorts as a fine example of how you can tell a good story in a very short film severely conditioned to product placement and over - the - top stylish cinematography .
0 Attack Force has a horrendous title , and can almost certainly be judged by it 's awful cover , because the film is horrible ! A mish - mash of plot lines , a choppy mess , and a horribly stagnated pace , make the film hard to watch start to finish . I managed this and I 'm proud . As a fan of Seagal 's work ( mostly of his old days ) , it 's painful to see him star in such tripe . True Seagal 's last half dozen movies or so , have sucked a lot , but some of them at least had some redeeming features . Attack Force is a mess . From conception to delivery this film has undergone many changes , from an alien plot line , to the current one about a highly addictive super drug , about to be unleashed on the Romanian ( the film has several settings , none of which are Romanian , but all look like Romania because they are in Romania ! ) populace . The film is tacked together with little regard for whatever state the original shooting script was . Plot - holes and loose ends are abound in the film that 's for sure . That 's been a problem in Seagal 's last few films as well , but never has the result been so boring . There 's a whole plot line about the water supply being poisoned with CTX ( that 's the drugs cool name ) that is never resolved ! < br /><br />Of course in recent years the plot 's have n't been the main draw in the Seagal canon so there was a big onus on the other departments , especially the action . Before I regard the action though , all the other departments are poor . The direction is poor , or perhaps better put , made to look poor . Who knows how director Michael Keusch originally intended this film ? Between him finishing his job , the re - shoots by stunt man Tom Delmar , and the editing , a coherent auteur vision is completely lost . The best way to describe the film is that it 's just all over the shop ! The cinematography is dull , nearly inducing sleep , while the droning score ( sounding like it was produced on the cheapest of cheap synthesizers ) does nothing to excite matters . The cast too are poor , unable to salvage anything here . Seagal looks bored beyond recognition , and is dubbed through much of the picture , clearly when plot - points are being changed . He looks tired and overweight , and lethargic , unlike he 's looked in previous pictures too ( remarkable as the aforementioned have been key complaints in Seagal 's recent pictures ) . The only redeemable cast member is Adam Croasdell as one of the villains , doing a slimy Brit routine . He seems to be a throwback to the alien plot line , because he 's playing it inhuman . He seems like a cross between a body snatcher and a vampire ( ditto to the lead villain played by some hot chick who appears on occasion , seemingly waiting for her husband ¬Ö  Dracula).<br /><br />Finally the action . Well it 's poor . Poorly conceived , poorly shot . There 's not much either , and there 's even less featuring Seagal . Stevo does n't really bring out the stunt double here , because there 's so little to do . There 's even a lengthy ( repetitive and boring ) action scene on the hour mark that inter - cuts occasionally with little flashes of Seagal 's stand in because clearly Seagal was n't there while the scene was being shot , and they wanted to have him feature in the action scene . Seagal eventually appears in person to shoot two guys in the head . Seagal has a producers credit here and a script credit , but from what I understand the film has been altered behind his back to the current state it 's in . Seagal will apparently not be working with these people again , or with Castel Studio 's who continue to deliver horrifically sub - Nu - Image ( that 's saying something ) , material.<br /><br />Overall this is one to avoid if you are not a Seagal fan . Seagal fans can also be safe in the knowledge that the big man probably wo n't want to do anything this bad again . Unfortunately his next film which has already been shot , with the same people , promises to be even worse than this . *
0 I 'm a huge Steven Seagal fan . Hell , I probably weigh as much as he does although I do n't have the street cred to sport the frizzy - mullet - ponytail . Having stated my own bias and affection for America 's favorite corpulent stage and screen hero , it is with a heavy heart that I must declare this to be his worst movie ever . I 'm not sure he could make a movie any worse than this.<br /><br />In his defense the major problems with this film seem to occur in post - production . It 's painfully obvious that this movie was supposed to have a different storyline . That results in woeful voiceovers in which Steve 's voice does n't nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice . The editing is pisspoor and overall this starts bad , gets even worse , and by the end you 'll wish you had rewatched The Da Vinci Code instead . Yes , it 's that bad.<br /><br />After this I do n't know what to expect from Steve . My friends still laugh at me for listening to his CDs . Is it time I start checking out some of the Van Damme direct to DVD nutty logs ? If you are tempted to watch this movie , rip your eyeballs out and flush them down the toilet . A lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this .
0 I look around in the video store still in shock how Steven Seagal with his track record of Bad action movies can still have 3 movies hit the shelves in less than a Year . Attack force being the 3rd no less promised the first - time entrance into the Sci Fi Genre for our ever widening Seagal . Visions of bad movie entertainment flashed before my gullible eyes . Sadly this is not the case one bit with no entertainment and a movie as bad as they come.<br /><br />Seagal rebounded a tiny bit with the Trashy - but enjoyable Shadow Man last time we saw him . However Attack force has to be his absolute worst movie ever!Don't argue for out for a Kill , Ticker , or even Black Dawn folks . This is the bottom of the Septic tank here.<br /><br />Anyone who says this is Steven Seagal 's return to form should be forced to write a 100 page essay on the word Taste . < br /><br />Seagal is yet another agent / I'm a supreme bad - ass yet again named Lawson wants revenge for the killing of his Team that leads him to a nefarious plot to distribute a really bad drug to the unsuspecting public . Not to mention the dealers are not from around here.<br /><br />The whole Production from Directing to the acting is poor . Was this movie shot in the Dark?Its got ta be the most poorly lighted movie since Howling 2.The action is terrible and very badly done.<br /><br />The Producers have also unwisely decided to do what the fans hate the most : throw in stunt double after stunt double and horribly dubbed Steven Seagal . Who seems to show little enthusiasm here . Can ya blame him?<br /><br />While it has been said that Attack Force was not the movie Stevie signed on for(originally Harvester)and surely has to be better than Attack force . The post - production tampering has not made it more coherent and made Seagal look worse . I feel bad for Directer Michael Keusch and writer Joe Halpin as they are gon na be judged forever for the ill - advised production re - shoots.<br /><br />So Now This leaves Seagal in the impossible position to come up with something to atone for this mess . But after seeing how bad Attack Force has turned out do we really want him to make another movie ?
0 Okay like most Steven Seagal fans I know I not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but I do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget . The main problem with the copy I watched was the terrible over dubbing I know that in some films this has to be done and I accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away . Also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it . I was truly disappointed with this film and only hope Stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying / renting . The story of this film had me wondering if I was watching a sci - fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on I found it very confusing .
0 How do you spell washed up fat Italian who can barely pull off a martial arts move without needing some heart medication ? In this movie we see Steven Seagal at his lowest level of accomplishment- since his career started it has been a steady decline into pathetic over indulgent behavior that has scuttled his career . In this movie it looks like most of his training consisted of ordering the fetuccini alfredo at his restaurant every day.<br /><br />He is fat , slow and very old looking in this movie , hardly a martial arts action hero , more like a laughing stock clown.<br /><br />It 's time for Steven Seagal to retire- this movie is about 2 hours of reasons why.<br /><br />Plot : fat Italian guy with a big reputation on the force gets wind that a crime group may be playing around with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate warrior response . This pretense , although pathetic and laughable , gives opportunity for some over the top fight scenes that include blasting through walls like a comic book.<br /><br />Did I mention this movie totally sucks and Steven Seagal is a complete joke ? yeah . I did .
0 I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie . He came out with a handful of good movies then descending into poor stories , bad camera work and a walk - thru persona , he nearly lost me . A few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie . Now he 's forgotten again . This film is seriously dark ( on any level you care to name ) . There is a lot of slash & gash going on here with no discernible purpose unless it 's meant as a warning against the military.<br /><br />Seagall may have had a stand - in for many of his scenes as it was often too dark to tell and someone else 's voice was used most of the time . Sadly the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody & then proceeded to raise havoc all over the place . Okay since when do we place an armed guard in the holding room with a prisoner ? Anyway this bad guy was at least colorful , and very focused . There 's lots of gore if you like that king of thing . It looked to me like the bad guys tore the same gash every time . I 'm just glad they did n't suck the blood from their hapless victims . I harken you back to my summary . Basically it is a horror movie disguised as an action film . Dec 6,2006
0 drss1942 really took the words right out of my mouth . I loved Segal 's early films and feel like the only one who is still faithful to him . I just saw this movie ( ok , fell asleep about 90 % through , so I did n't see the end ) . When I woke up and saw I was at the DVD menu , I was thankful I did n't subject myself to any more of that movie and did n't dare find out what happened at the end . There was something strange about the voice of Segal and others . Kinda reminded me of the original Mad Max where the voice were dubbed , but in the same language ( Australlian is English , right ? :) Anyway , if I had 10 thumbs , they 'd all point down right now for this Segal injustice .
0 The DVD was a joke , the audio for the first few minutes was terrible with sound out of sync and Segals voice not even his ! ! ! ! Pathetic ! When the audio sync was better in about 5 minutes the poor plot , lines and actors should get another job because the movie business is not where any of them should be.<br /><br />While Segal had some good movies in the early days the latest ones are a joke and should be a an embarrassment to him and the company that made it.<br /><br />If Segal was the one that handled this he better return to having another party run the show , because he has no talent what so ever in this.<br /><br />This film is a complete embarrassment to all involved in its production and a disgrace to all who viewed it . I turned it off in about 20 minutes.<br /><br />I will be asking for my money back at Block Buster ! Mark from Ontario , Canada
0 I tried restarting the movie twice . I put it in three machines to see what was wrong . Did Steven Seagal 's voice change ? Did he die during filming and the studio have to dub the sound with someone who does n't even resemble him ? Or was the sound on the DVD destroyed ? After about 10 minutes , you finally hear the actor 's real voice . Though throughout most of the film , it sounds like the audio was recorded in a bathroom.<br /><br />I would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to Goodwill , if I owned a copy . I rented it , but I will never do that again . I will check this database before renting any more of his movies , all of which were ( more or less ) good movies . You usually knew what you were getting when you watched a Steven Seagal movie . I guess that is no more .
0 The movie is boring , the characters and scenarios are unrealistic , unbelievable , the action is hilarious . This movie is a big mess . It almost seems like when the action music kicks in , the most impressive stunt is running . Either voice is dubbed over with Mr. McGregor or steven sang too much and it changed his voice . There is way too much dialog in this movie , and extremely bad acting on everyones behalf . The movie is great sleep therapy . The fighting is laughable . The eye shape shift effect on the evil designer drug addict females was decent . The main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed . The main villain was used to explain the story through interrogation , he would just throw random plots in such as ( spoiler ) " CTX ( his designer drug)is going to be in the water supply " which is never addressed in the conclusion or even mentioned again in the movie . This movie is highly recommended to pass .
0 STAR RATING : * * * * * Saturday Night * * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning < br /><br />Marshall Lawson ( Steven Seagal ) is assigned to France on a reconaissance mission along with three new young strike - team recruits after disobeying a direct order from above . However the night before they 're due to strike , they are all found grusomely slaughtered by a killer with seemingly inhuman strength . With the French police dallying around with their own investigation , he goes in search of those responsible himself , only to uncover a corrupt faction of the military dealing in a deadly new drug that alters a person 's DNA and gives them terrifying new strength.<br /><br />Bad cover . Bad title . Bad post - production tampering . And bad trailer . Pretty bad film . But , I 've got to say , I do n't think Attack Force is quite his worst . I know this will make me unpopular with most of the other reviewers here ( perhaps not Steveday ! ) but I think a lot of the criticism has stemmed from all the bad news that went before the film rather than the actual quality of it itself.<br /><br />I must say there was nowhere near as much dubbing or ropey editing as I 'd been lead to believe . The dubbing there was ( which made him sound like Martin Sheen with a groin problem ! ) was pretty awful and quite frequent but not in use for as large a segment of the film as I 'd thought . The plot flowed pretty smoothly as well considering all the messing about with the original finished film called Harvester that went on . Also as another reviewer noted , the film has a nice Gothic look to it , a new touch for a Seagal film.<br /><br />The absolute killer low point , though , was the complete and total lack of any exciting action , with only a few poorly filmed fight scenes for any fun.<br /><br />I have to be honest , though , I would rather watch this again than Flight of Fury , Today You Die or Out for a Kill . * *
0 I feel blessed to own what is known as the worst Steven Seagal movie ever made . I knew I was on to something special when Steven opened his mouth and someone else 's voice came out . By the middle of the film my eyes were beginning to hurt and I was almost falling out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter.<br /><br />Steven is Steven ( with an ever changing voice ) and totally unbelievable in his role ( as always ) . Who the hell lets people with bad nappy - hair pony tail mullets into the Forces anyway ? He also always writes himself into totally unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years his junior . The supporting actors all look like they 've been shot in the dark - btw , did they shoot this movie in the dark with just a penlight torch for lighting ? < br /><br />This is truly abominable in every way possible . Invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it - this one 's truly special .
0 Well let me say that I have always been a Steven seagal fan and his movies are usually great but this just do n't measure up to the rest . This in my opinion is very stupid I did not like it all . The biggest reason I do n't like it is because it is very flawed and to me does not make much sense . The acting is very bad even Steven seagal does not do good acting , The rest of the actors I can see because they just do direct to video movies . It does not follow a straight storyline everything happens at once so that why it does n't make much sense . Ther is barely any action in it at all and in order to make an action movie good you usually need action in it . The special effects are very bad and you can tell are fake . So all in all this has to seagals worst movie of all so if you want to see a Steven seagal movie do n't rent this one just pretend it does not exist . So just avoid this movie.<br /><br />Overall score : * * out of * * * * * * * * * * < br /><br / > * out of * * * * *
0 Okay , first off , Seagal 's voice is dubbed over for like 50 % of the film ... Why ? Because apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions . From the very beginning , you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting , but they make no sense.<br /><br />That said , the story still sucked and does n't make any sense at all . When I got the the end , I was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending did n't even make sense.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague . This movie made me stop watching Seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse .
0 I think its time for Seagal to go quietly into the night . What I have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early 90 's smash hits in comparison.<br /><br />A secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that jacks up a human 's adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something . Somehow Seagal is supposed to stop the infection or its the end of the world ... or something . Seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans , every time I look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well I know Steven 's athsma prevent him from yelling at the top of his lungs but even so why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him ? Usually the films plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time but this was not even close . Like I said , it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and shank stabbing rather than straight up fighting . The problem was it was n't really scary and Seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have speed of light movement yet the 40 year old 280 lb Seagal killed them all singlehandedly ? I guess the lone highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes where the new recruits ask Seagal to come to the strip club with them.<br /><br />2 out of 10
0 What was Steven Seagal thinking ? I mean firstly I love Seagal . I love all his movies up to the mid 2000s . His early stuff is some of the best in the genre . This however does not live up to its excellent name . Attack Force ( with protagonist Marshall Lawson { Seagal } ) would be expected to be a mindless action movie with Seagal in typical one - liner ass kicking form . However , what we get is a crime mystery , bordering on a political thriller with little or no action . Seagal is always in shadows because of his weight . I could not follow this story . There 's people who mutate to superhumans when they take a drug . What happened in this movie . The dubbing of Seagal is a disgrace , a shambles and a shame . Why dub the man ? The story is terrible . This got a 2/10 from me because of the scene where Seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him , and an hilarious fight scene where seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera ! " Revenge is a two way street " seagal says in this movie ... well forget revenge Steven , you need redemption !
0 Steven buddy , you remember when you said this : < br /><br />"Try to find the path of least resistance and use it without harming others . Live with integrity and morality , not only with people but with all beings . " < br /><br />you have not been doing that , you have mortally wounded your fans and their morality with these " films " I would n't even bother if I did n't know you are so much better than this , I 've seen the videos of you teaching , you are so much better than this why why brother why ... <br /><br />steamroller productions has been steamrolled I promise bro i am not afraid of you I will tell you the truth to your face so we can fix it.<br /><br />well I like some others fell asleep 90 % in , but to be fair i was tired and had a large meal just an hour before hand Sensai , what are you doing . 12 million ? really ? do you have any idea what we could have done with $ 12,000,000 It could have been in the theaters and a blockbuster hit , if you wanted we could have donated money from the huge profit to a homeless shelter or something . These post production people are ripping you off man the choreography was non existent , we can do better man , the eye blinking thing was from the men in black movie , i half expected will smith to appear or tommy lee Jones to tell your they were gills not eyelids.<br /><br />Seagal you are an Aikido master , why are you doing this to yourself , to us ? when you came on the scene , you had such a fresh direct style , and it was obvious you are a teacher cause the way your moves were so clear and crisp , watching your first three movies i felt like you were teaching me something , now i feel like you are just being ripped off or something i feel like I need to save you buddy , this time you are the one who was killed and I 'm gon na go and get revenge for you by helping you make the best movie ever . bro i know who you really are , i know the truth about the Nico movie . let 's talk.<br /><br />contact me man i got some fresh ideas I am a nit picker , I swear you will not be disappointed with my attention to detail and we 'll do it for the fans man , your fans deserve better , we 're hanging on , but the strand is about to snap . I swear I will not let your movie out the door with a single mistake in it I 'm still trying to figure out if that was the worst dubbing ever , or you have laryngitis , but i promise you i can do a better impression of your voice than the lame * * * * who did n't even try . I sure hope you kicked him in the nuts as his payment . i can come up with a story and a plot that can be matched to your avenging the death of your student / daughter / wife / dog / house plant niche and I promise you we will bring you back , I promise , also I want to go in the direction , that makes people think , if you let me in i promise we will make a movie that people will walk away and have to have a discussion about it , a serious thought provoking , perception altering experience.<br /><br />Steven Seagal This is my official in writing permission for IMDb to release my contact info to you for the purpose of resurrecting one of the best martial arts heroes I have ever seen also , for the record he s not Italian , he s Irish and Jew so you call it bad acting i call it terrific acting , because you have believed for 20 years that Seagal is Italian :) kinda changes your perception does n't it .
0 Even though the plot was very well detailed , and the story line was understandable the fact that Steven Seagals voice was dubbed with some one else 's through out most of the movie was distressing as you were unsure who was talking . There were many parts where he would start to talk in his deep raspy voice and then the next some one else 's voice was doing the talking for him . I do n't know the reason however if he had difficulty with his voice during production of the movie I think they could have re shot the events that did not contain his own voice when he had recovered . I have rated this movie 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the film . When one pays for a movie whether or not its at the theater or on DVD this movie was not worth the admission price that was charged . I have been a long time follower of Steven Seagal and all his movies that he has done over the past years . To date I think this is one of the worst ones we have seen yet
0 Steven what have you done you have hit an all new low . It is weird since Steven 's last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash . Shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it was n't even funny Steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway . As for the action well let 's just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes . Seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege 1 and 2 and exit wounds . the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it does n't make scenes sometimes . flight of fury better be good what a shame i wasted 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten better luck next time
0 This movie was heavily marred by the presence of Steven Seagal . Or as I should say Steven So - dull ! Like before Seagal is either too good or too stupid to re - dub his own lines , leaving someone to impersonate his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be looped . A few films before this was he has done this too , but I do n't think to this extent ! To be honest the film looks pretty good , the script could use some work but parts of this film looked like a real movie ! Of course , all told , this film is pretty bad.<br /><br />It would have been much better without Seagal who has become a cartoon of himself . Do n't bother . Anything over a buck for this one is too much ! I honestly think this is the last time for me and a Seagal film . What 's taken me so long to realize this ? !
0 This is without a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie Steven Seagal has ever made . And that says a lot . Do n't get fooled by the rating , it 's way too good . This abomination had n't even been worthy of a 0/10 rating , if such a thing existed . < br /><br />- Absolutely no plot < br /><br />- Worst action scenes ever , and there are n't too many of them either < br /><br />- Seagal does n't do anything himself , including the fighting , talking ( lots of dubbing ) , and so on . As always . < br /><br />- Seagal is fat , lazy and could n't care less about this movie . Something which is very obvious all the way through < br /><br />Take all the other garbage DTV movies Seagal has made , multiply them with each other , multiply this with a thousand billions , and all the badness you then get wo n't even describe 1 % of this absolute crapfest .
0 I do n't know what the rest of you guys watch Steven Seagal movies for , but I watch them because , as silly as they are , they 're at least always good for a laugh . Why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing , when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of?<br /><br />Attack Force is by no means a great movie , but I felt it was as worthy a Steven Seagal vehicle as many of his other movies ; in fact I did n't think it was one of his worst by a long - shot . It had , most of the time , a half - way coherent plot line , and it was , most of the time , fundamentally exciting . The ending really sucked , but even that had some enjoyably trashy elements . In the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised , but I actually thought that the acting , characterization ( if I may use such a big word ) and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true Steven Seagal fan would expect . Seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone - faced , no - nonsense man 's man that we 've come to expect , and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well , without ever up - staging him . This , people , is what a Steven Seagal movie does . Deal with it . Or even better : laugh at it.<br /><br />4 out of 10 .
0 I 'm so confused . I 've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years . I 've seen all of his films , and many of those dozens of times . I can only describe this film as " bizarre . " Steven Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film , but I have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines , with a thin , whiny imposter 's voice no less . What I also do n't get is , if they had to dub SOME of his lines , why does his own voice appear on the rest of them ? I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us . But the Seagal in this movie barely exudes a fraction of the same swagger , confidence , bravado , charm , and sex - appeal he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous movies . What I found myself missing most of all was his cocky , self - assured attitude and his bad - ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin . Where is that in - your - face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star ? ? ? I hope that this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so , his lifelong fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all knew and loved is gone .
0 Steven Seagal .... how could you be a part of such an awful film ? I rented this movie because your movies usually have been pretty clean . I have lost a lot of respect for you being in an awful movie such as this one . Very , very poor taste ! I am embarrassed that I even rented this movie . Steven , if you keep acting in movies like this one , I believe that your career is over . My husband and I have enjoyed watching many of your movies because you always can " get the bad guy " with a few hand maneuvers and make it clean ... and also the language is pretty clean in your movies ... but this one is something else . I will think twice before I rent another movie of yours .
0 I 've seen a lot of Seagal movies , and while most are n't great , or even good , this steamy pile lowered the bar for bad movies.<br /><br />The plot : not sure really . Something about a drug that makes you all crazy and strong or something . Who are the good guys and bad guys ? Hard to tell . Most of the movie is cut scenes going back and forth between people in darkly lit rooms complaining about how good Seagals character " Mashall " is.<br /><br />Acting : Blows.<br /><br />Voice Dubbing , , , , , , What was with the horrible voice overdubbing ? ! Could they of found anyone who sounded any less like Seagal ? May as well had Cheech or Chong doing the voice overs , might of at least been entertaining then.<br /><br />This movie is boring , and completely stupid . Avoid it at all costs ! ! ! !
0 I had a feeling that after " Submerged " , this one would n't be any better ... I was right . He must be looking for champagne money , and not care about the final product ... his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him ; the editing is - well - just a grade above amateurish . It 's nothing more than a B or C - grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an " OK " sound designer.<br /><br />Like the previous poster said , the problems seem to appear in post - production ( ... voice dubbing , etc . ) Too bad , cause the plot 's actually OK for a SG flick.<br /><br />I'll never rent another SG flick , unless he emails me asking for forgiveness.<br /><br />Too bad - I miss Kelly LeBrock ... <br /><br />--jimbo
0 I had the misfortune of wasting 10 quid buying SS new movie on DVD : Attack Force . Now i usually can suspend my belief watching films like this . A pinch of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the sofa watching a noisy late evening shoot em up is perfect for a single alpha male like me . I bought this film thinking I 'd see cool martial arts and shoot em up.<br /><br />Did i hell . Segal is old and bloated , the plot was ludicrous even by SS standards and to cap it all off Segal 's acting ( such as it was to start with ) is exceptionally dire . So dire in fact that half of his voice was dubbed over by a man who sounded NOTHING LIKE HIM . Either SS ca nt act no more ( a moot point ) of the crew were so dreadful at their jobs they could n't record the sound properly . The voice would flick back and forth between Mr Whisper Segal and the man who does voice overs for Honda adverts!<br /><br />Plot wise is n't the issue because most action films work along the same premise as this one , nothing new there . The usual mix of characters who will die horribly as cannon fodder and stereotyped bad guys waiting to get blown away.<br /><br />Avoid this film like you would avoid walking in front of a speeding train or a dose of H5N1 avian flu.<br /><br />Utter garbage.<br /><br />1/10<br /><br />This has been a public health warning .
0 I am truly beginning to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how crappy his films could become . This particular movie was a complete and utter waste of time to see . My first complaint was the cover of the DVD where they have doctored his pic and made him look slimmer and younger when in the film he looks like crap . He has his big pot belly and double chin going for him and the most miserable and bored look on his face.<br /><br />The whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and drawn out way too long . The whole film was leading up to the finale where Seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline enhancer . There was way too much useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of Seagals voice even in the middle of a statement . The dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical.<br /><br />The fight scenes in the film were horrible . Half the time when Seagal fought you could not even see what was going on . There would be tight shots of him flapping his arms at the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something . It was reminiscent of the old Kung Fu series on television . They used way too much slow motion for the fight scenes.<br /><br />I believe this is Seagals worst film to date and I am glad I did not purchase this film or I would have been very upset since I am a huge fan of Seagal the Aikidoist . The action star is quickly fading away and seems to be getting worse with every performance .
0 What the F*@ # was this I just watched ? Steven STOP ! ! Please ! This movie is insatiably bad and silly . In a bizarre departure from action and adventure , Mr. Seagal is now fighting ( obviously ) wish - they - were - vampire ' like ' creatures with super human strength . ? OK ? Oh , and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way ? Wow ! Even still in this movie however , to quell Seagals have - to - have - the - last - punch - and - no - one - can - kick - my - a$$ ego , HE is somehow stronger than they are . However all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him . Come on , I can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer , but these are super human strength people . Oh and get this , Seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues , because apparently he and his cohorts in the film think he is Wolverine ! Oh My GO ... And worst than all of that ! Yes , there is a worse than that . He has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face . They obviously sound nothing like him and I believe it may be one of the other actors in the film . It was pure madness . Although I wanted to turn it off I always watch a movie to he end . This is an all time low even for your direct to video movies Steven . Awful ! Awful ! Awful ! Two thumbs down ! Redemeption qualities ? Well I guess so , I will be fair in that aspect . At least some of the special effects were OK , and I like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses . The women all were quite attractive IMO . Still , and I said STILL , it does not make up for the blatant X - Men , Underworld , ( insert your favorite zombie , vampire movie here ) rip off ! The director , writer , producer , ALL should be bansihed & exile from the movie business . I think I feel the way that most people feel about Blood Rayne ( and just about all other Uwe Boll pictures ) about this film . That 's my whole $ 1.00 on this film . View if you dare .
0 A not bad but also not so great heist film . Kirk Douglas is a recently released from prison safe - cracker who , after turning down an offer from the Mob , decides to pull the job himself . He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma . Mayhem ensues . Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with Douglas 's infinitely patient girlfriend ( Florinda Bolkan ) . Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there 's at least one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma . Though an Italian production , most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany . Douglas is fine , not just slumming it in an Giallo quickie . The striking Bolkan gives a terrific performance . The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli , who managed to work with everyone in Italy ( from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone ) .
0 In 1692 Salem , a devious child 's lies about a slave 's involvement in witchcraft sends an entire community into an uproar . Costume drama starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray is n't stuffy , though neither is it a vivid depiction of contagious hysteria . Worked on by three writers ( Walter Ferris , Durward Grimstead , and Bradley King ) , the story elements are rather interesting ( especially coming out of Hollywood in 1937 ) , though to anyone who has since read Arthur Miller 's " The Crucible " , the hoked - up melodrama on display here wo n't be tolerated for very long . Biggest problem with the picture may lie in the casting : Colbert and MacMurray are an ill - matched pair of lovers hindered by the witch - hunt , MacMurray being far too contemporary a presence for these surroundings . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 The only reason I saw " Shakedown " was that it has Erika Eleniak in it . She 's sexy as always , but she plays second fiddle to leading man Wolf Larson . It 's a pity , because she has more action capabilities than she 's allowed to show here . The film largely consists of endless shootouts that quickly become monotonous - especially when most of the time you are seeing the bad guys armed with machine guns constantly missing Larson and him armed only with a revolver ( that NEVER runs out of bullets ) taking them all out rather easily . The earthquake effects are decent , but there is also a lot of blurry motion and poor CGI explosions . As the psychotic " spiritual leader " , Ron Perlman tries , but the pseudo - religious mumbo - jumbo he has to spout is simply boring . Eleniak , Perlman or Larson ( assuming he has any ) completists might want to give this one a look , for others it is barely worth a rental . ( * 1/2 )
0 An average TV movie quality , totally formula story of religious fanatic ( Ron Perlman , who gives good " I 'm not just the President of ' Psychos R Us , ' I 'm also a client . " ) who gets control of a biochemical virus ( think the virus from the movie " The Rock " ) . Too bad for him that he also gets stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and the government agents trying to stop him ( led by the impressively physiqued , mildly entertaining Wolf Larson , backed by Fred Dryer ) along with the standard " in the wrong place at the wrong time " spunky female ( the forever bland Erika Eleniak ) and " lived as a wimp but died as a hero at the last minute " male ( Brandon Karrer ) . Has the standard background story to give sympathy to the religious fanatic ( wife and son killed in a police raid a few years previous ) . < br /><br />Basically a decent rainy day movie.<br /><br />Favorite line , spoken by Ron Perlman after he finds the vial of the virus hidden in Erika Eleniak 's cleavage : " A woman and her mystery." < br /><br />Worth a rent .
0 Mr Perlman gives a standout performance ( as usual ) . Sadly , he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set pieces.<br /><br />Larsen is in " Die Hard " mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles , I 'm sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part.<br /><br />The lovely Erika is very decorative ( even though fully clothed ! ) and shows some signs of " getting " acting at last.<br /><br />SFX are mainly poor CGI and steals from other movies.<br /><br />The shootouts are pitiful - worthy of the A - Team < br /><br />Not even worth seeing for Perlman - AVOID
0 This is one of the worst action films I have ever seen . This is particularly due to much of the factual implausibility ( like an obvious agent posing as a bank loan officer while making obvious that he is speaking to someone through a wire or the scene where the scientists assume it is safe to enter a room in which a virus has been released even though ' it has not found a viable host ' does not mean that it will never find one ) , the cheap sets ( the bank looks like it was poorly constructed to resemble a dungeon ) , and the bad acting . It is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus . However , the head honcho who decides to remove it from a bank security deposit box , does so at the same time a bank heist is going down , at the same FBI agents have been informed of this , and at the same time a terrible earthquake erupts . Needless to say , the aftermath of the quake is messy in more ways than one . However , the results do not make for an enticing action film , but instead , one that has been obviously z - grade junk from the beginning of the film . ( Perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the packaging look to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screen captures from various sequences of the film ) . What the hell Ron Perlman was doing in this , I have no idea . I wonder if he was as embarrassed to be in it as I was to have watched it .
0 Anyone who 's watched a few Lifetime Movie Network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that gets brushed off the planning table . So , when crazed Lara moves into Patti 's home and methodically begins to drive her landlady bonkers , I did n't even blink . When Lara eventually ramps up her activities to threatening poor Patti , and dares her to do anything about it , I just nodded . You see , on Planet LMN , people do n't behave the way they do for any particular reason , they just do it to keep the action going . Only on Planet LMN could someone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house by means of their seductive powers ! ! Poor Patti - she just trusted too much , and Lara went off her medicine , and then there was this big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe full of deadly stuff that ends up injected into someone 's tummy , and a body bag going out the front door . The horror!<br /><br />But take it from me , this Planet LMN product is a classic . You need to watch it once , just for the great laughs you 'll have . On the Improbability Scale , I give this film a 95/100 . Make a big batch of popcorn and get some apple slices , too . You 'll understand later .
0 This Lifetime style movie takes the middle aged divorcee victim who then finally fights back genre to new depths of cartoon - like absurdity.<br /><br />Here the 40 something stay - at - home ex - wife of a successful lawyer protagonist ( daughter away at college ) is starting a new life after her divorce , helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise expansion deal . She has even started up a friendship with her attractive , slightly younger perhaps , landscape architect / gardener ( who 's black ) . But then horror of middle - aged women 's horrors , ANOTHER 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to , starts ' taking over " her life.<br /><br />What this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener , and offer him a glass of wine that * gasp * really belonged to the divorcee ! ! She runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat ! ! And backed up the toilet ! And leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator ! And hangs her pieces of ( African ) artwork in the living room ! ! And so on . Well she may have killed the cat as well . Yeah , ok , the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough , but its more than a little ridiculous , especially as it turns into a campaign . The character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane . ( So why did she rent the room -- and to horror of horrors , a much younger woman?)<br /><br />Supposedly this increasingly arrogant ( natch ) younger woman has a mania for seizing control . And our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil ( and erotically hot looking , of course ) 20 something . But there 's this problem . Anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her POWER -- and just flirts or has sex with some guy , and escapes the consequences . ( Well , there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings . It just is n't * generally * used in quite this sort of way.)<br /><br />The premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her . Of course the 40 something does n't know about these things , and the 20 something has had help . The lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period , with utilities thrown in at the fixed price . Even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending , the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman , supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something . You know , the judge is sympathetic to all the woe - is - me of the sexy sweet young thing . Finally the 40 something 's " heroic " battle back for THE HOUSE then begins . Woopie!!<br /><br />The only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy TRO 's ( or orders of protection ) are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so -- although they are generally only this easy against men . They are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here . Indeed , girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever , but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats , and sometimes without even hearing his side . Even when there is a hearing , it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats ( to prove a negative ) , when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused , rather than the accuser . ( This is one of the only areas of American law where that is true -- and it 's a signal outrage of feminist overreaching , and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller . ) Of course that 's not likely to be the subject of any Lifetime movie in this lifetime.<br /><br />The absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic , and is n't taking her medicine . Even so it makes no sense . She is n't after the successful lawyer ex - husband , though she does con his help ( to the ex wife 's fury ) in her quest . She 's after THE HOUSE ( technically , to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease ) . This second younger woman is after ALL THAT 'S LEFT after the divorce , after affairs with other 20 somethings STOLE her husband ! ! ( The ex - husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling -- does n't matter , he still strayed!!!)<br /><br />The protagonist is good enough looking for her age . But her outlook , attitude and focus is so small minded , frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it 's impossible to care about her . Well , a core group of Lifetime fans care , I guess , judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it . ( I kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal . I could n't resist seeing just how far they 'd take it.)<br /><br / > * * Spoiler * * ( if such a thing is possible with this flick).<br /><br />Well , here 's a clue . The movie ends with the 20 something getting bailed out of jail by promising to " listen to " her 20 something male co - worker and sometimes lover , and " do whatever he says " and " let him take care of her " ( he means get her to keep taking her medicine ) -- and then tricking him and returning to THE HOUSE . There she climbs the stairs with a knife , demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something , who is taking a bath by candlelight , secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life . There 's a struggle -- and the 40 something mom wins -- by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of anti - psychotic medicine she had found . She then begins stroking her , mom like , and the two women have a bonding , female solidarity moment ! ! ! How sweet .
0 There was a reasonably good looking girl starring the film(Zoe Mclellan ) but even her looks could n't stop me from voting it the lowest possible - one.<br /><br />The plot is bad and irrational.<br /><br />What more can I say . The movie sucks .
0 Got into this flick , just as it was beginning , on an afternoon where I was home with a touch of flu - otherwise I 'd have missed it . That probably would have been best.<br /><br />I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - both very good performers - and thought this might be worth a look . It proved to be to some extent , but only because it is one of those stories so awful it fascinates.<br /><br />Zoe McLellan has little to recommend her talents , except for her Jayne Mansfield- or Loni Anderson - like bosom . Unfortunately , her acting prowess - at least here - makes Mansfield and Anderson seem to be Garbo or Davis by comparison.<br /><br />The young nut case 's white rat , the owner 's cat , the young nut case having the owner evicted and restrained in her own home , and a bunch of doophus 's ( including the young nut case ) running around a bio hazard facility , and the absurd conclusion . I kept waiting for at least some scene or plot element to contain at least a modicum of realism , believability or being capable of evoking some empathy / sympathy -- but this proved to be in vain .
0 Do n't get me wrong - I love David Suchet as Poirot . I love the series as well as the movies but enough already re : Death On The Nile . Everyone has done this one ! We know who dies . We know why they die . We know who the killer is . We know how it was done . So I say enough already ! Mr. Suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of Agatha Christie 's novels . I will say that the acting by all the actors was superb . The sets were terrific and very realistic . I especially liked David Soul but I was surprised at how ' awful ' he looked . I hope he does n't look that way in ' real ' life ! I honestly ca n't remember from other movies whether the very end was the same . Somehow I do n't think so . I thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not Ms. Christie wrote it that way . I would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison !
0 As a Hammer completist I was dreading the time when I would have to raise the courage to watch this film and the one following it , Holiday on the Buses . I had seen One the Buses the film and thought it one of the worst films I have ever seen . It was full of all the awful comedy that plagued British TV screens around the early 70's.<br /><br />I am ashamed to say that there were actually parts of this film that I laughed at . I do n't know if it was because I was now familiar with the characters and enjoyed some of the situations , knowing how they would react . I found Blakey particularly funny , although I could swear at no point in the trilogy does he say his catchphrase , " I 'll get you Butler".<br /><br />Having watched Holiday on the Buses the jokes were starting to wear thin and these three films could be compared to an early Hammer trilogy , Dick Barton , in that the second film made is the best ( although this is probably the only way they could be compared).<br /><br />The only people who would want to watch this film are probably fans of the TV series , who will no doubt enjoy this , and Hammer completists like myself . To the completists I would say that this film is n't that bad and I can certainly think of worse Hammer comedies .
0 Watching it now it 's still as skanky and sexist as I remember . comes from a time when girls were " Dolly Birds " and basically men 's playthings . It 's hard to take in that it is from the Hammer studios and the fact it 's available on DVD when good films are not . Our nations shame where the working class are portrayed as work shy layabouts or worse ! Trouble is you ca n't help feeling nostalgic for a Clippie on a bus . Try to hold your stomach contents when you see Olive in a fluffy ? Blue " saucy " nightie or something similar like Shirley Bassey used to wear for a concert in 1972 . Warning this film shows the illegal practice of towing a motorcycle combo by a red double decker bus , which I 've been informed is not a Routemaster but a Bristol.<br /><br />Look just do n't bother watch something decent instead like Porridge or Dad 's Army ... or a fly crawling up a wall .
0 This was n't funny in 1972 . It 's not funny now.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of other people , I 'm not bashing the film because it is incredibly sexist - I quote enjoyed that bit , or rather I enjoyed the reaction it generates in annoying PC people - I 'm bashing it because it is poorly written and acted.<br /><br />The only really memorable character is Blakey , which British people 25 years old will recognise immediately since he was a favourite with impressionists for a long time.<br /><br />Avoid.<br /><br / >
0 Sometimes you need to see a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones . Well , that 's my opinion anyway . This one will always be in the bad movie category , simply because all but Shu Qi 's performance was terrible.<br /><br />Martial Angel tells of Cat ( Shu Qi ) , a professional thief turned straight after leaving her lover , Chi Lam ( Julian Cheung ) , two years before . But her past returns to haunt her as Chi Lam is kidnapped for the ransom of security software belonging to the company Cat works for . In order to rescue him , she calls on her old friends from her orphanage days , six other feisty women , to save the day ... <br /><br />I may have told the synopsis cheesily , but this is a cheesy story . In fact , the whole script and direction lacked any quality at all . Much of the dialogue was meaningless and coupled with a plot that was as thin as rice - paper in water . If I could sum it up , take a bad Jackie Chan movie , remove the comedy , remove the choreography , throw away the budget , and you have Martial Angels : a formulaic piece of work with no imagination at all.<br /><br />Mind you , I do have to give credit where credit 's due , and Shu Qi was probably the only person to emerge unscathed from the terrible action , as it was her performance that shone through . Okay , you ca n't say she was excellent - after all she had absolutely nothing to work with - but she did manage to dig some character out from her role . Other than that , only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin made any other impression - although these were mostly glimmers and very brief.<br /><br />Elsewhere , the film just fell to pieces . Scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and unbelievable , special effects were obviously done on the cheap with no attempt to clean up edges between persons and the mask of the blue screen , poor editing involving numerous discontinuities in fight scenes , camera angles that were elementary and unflattering , and direction I 've seen better from a lost dog.<br /><br />I guess this film was a too many cooks affair . Most probably , the budget was blown away on the over - enthusiasm to have seven babes on the same silver screen . That did n't leave much else.<br /><br />Frankly , the way this film was made was like a cheap porn movie without the porn . Charlie 's Angels , it ai n't . In fact , while sisters can do it for themselves , none of that was really that apparent here.<br /><br />Definitely one to forget .
0 Despite pretty bad reviews , I just had to give this film a go ¬ñ it does , after all , star HK super - babe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all - action cat - burglars . Surely that 's worth checking out ? Well , as babe - fests go , Martial Angels is hard to beat . The eye candy is top quality . Shu Qi looks as fantastic as always , and of the rest of the girls , Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught my roving eye in particular.<br /><br />Unfortunately , if one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits , it is an absolute stinker ! The story is weak , the action shoddy and the special effects downright pathetic . Director Clarence Fok and Producer Wong Jing have given us a photogenic cast and little else.<br /><br />If Shu Qi is the only reason you 're contemplating seeing this one , you would be better off watching Sex and Zen 2 again !
0 Polyester was the very first John Water 's film I saw , and I have to say that it was also the " worst " movie I had seen up to that point.<br /><br />Water 's group of " talent " included several people who I am sure worked for food , and were willing to say the lines Waters wrote . Every thing about the movie is terrible , acting , camera , editing , and the story about a woman played by 300 lb transvestite Divine was purely absurd.<br /><br />That said , I have to recommend this film because it is very funny , and you wo n't believe the crap that happens to poor Francine . Her son huffs solvents and stomps unsuspecting women 's feet at the grocery store . Her daughter is the sluttiest slut in town . Her husband is a cackling A - hole of a pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate poor Francine.<br /><br />Francine 's only friend is played by Edith Massey , possibly the worst actress ever . Edith looks and sounds like she is reading the lines off a cue card and has never seen the script prior to filming.<br /><br />Despite all of Francine 's travails , Waters cooks up a fabulous Hollywood ending and everyone ( who survives ) lives happily ever after .
0 I was really disappointed with this film . The first Waters movie I saw was Serial Mom and I loved it . Then I saw Pecker and I loved it . Then I watched Polyester and really sort of hated it . The only thing I liked about that movie was DIVINE . She / He had a hell of a lot of talent . I was truly surprised . As a whole , I would n't recommend this film ...
0 No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series , of which only 3 have been on so far is awful . The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series . I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous . As a BBC licence payer , after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment . I 'm amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone did n't object to the story lines . These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons , surly they can see it 's lost all direction . It 's a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas!<br /><br />Paul Bentley , West Yorkshire , England .
0 I feel like I 've just watched a snuff film .... a beautifully acted , taut , engrossing and horrible thing ! A two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word , sexual violence and torture , rape , decapitation , incest , corruption , live burial , and abuse , abuse , abuse . No redemption whatsoever . And I WAS entertained . I could n't stop watching . What does this say about me , about the people who make and act in this sort of thing , and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm . And I 'm neither puritanical nor humorless , I do n't try to hide from the existence of darkness , and I definitely have not led a sheltered life , but I am ashamed of myself . AND I 'm sorry to see my British cousins dragging the subject - matter sewers the way my own tribe does . It does n't have to be cozy , but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism ?
0 I absolutely hate this programme , what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ? ? OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure I 'm well out of the room before it comes on . Its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i ca nt stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless . What happened to detective programmes with real mystery ? ? ? I mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago ? ? ? I wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this .
0 This is the story of a young woman seduced and then dumped by her older , married lover after she gets pregnant ; she avenges herself against him , and his entire family , through black magic ¬ó ¬† which , disappointingly , she does n't do herself but has someone else do for her . Good production values for a Thai horror flick . But the bland script never generates suspense , the director approaches the material entirely conventionally , and the final act loses viewer sympathy for the victims by throwing logic to the winds . At one point , a character has a prime opportunity to simply shoot the villainess dead , and instead she gets up and runs away without picking up the gun . Bad writing ¬ó you 're soaking in it ! < br /><br />Some icky gore effects , including a really tasteless late - term - fetus corpse and one guy dying from having hundreds of live eels burst out of his stomach . Only recommended for genre completists who simply have to see every horror film produced in Asia in the last 15 years .
0 Ever heard of a taiwanese horror movie ? Or any taiwanese movie ? Propably for a reason . This one was a really boring one , even though it has black magic including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels.<br /><br />Having read other peoples thoughts , I was looking forward for some violence and gore , but there 's not much at all . Some blood puking and other lame stuff , if you are waiting for graphic gore or any gruesome effects you will be disappointed . They clearly did n't use the eel exploding and other things to their maximum potent.<br /><br />Pretty much nothing good about this movie ; a single character that was n't completely bland and a few OK black magic spells , like the eel one . The plot was confusing and boring . The characters were thin and annoying , including the main character . The horror aspect did n't work at all , the most horrifying thing was an albino girl ( not that scary really ) . This is the worst Asian horror movie I have ever seen .
0 " The Man In The Attic " is a movie set in the 1910s . It is inspired by a true story . Unfortunately , it 's a story that really did n't need to be told.<br /><br />Looking at the box , the people responsible for packaging the movie tried their best to make this film appear steamy and erotic . They use terms such as " illicit passion " , " forbidden affair " , and " unlimited pleasures " . They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris ( little Doogie Howser , M.D. ) holding a gun!<br /><br />The story involves Krista , played by Anne Archer . She is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns his own business . Edward ( Harris ) is an employee of her husband 's company . Krista and Edward end up falling in love with each other.<br /><br />The supposedly " shocking " part of the movie is this : Krista 's husband finds out about the affair and forbids them from ever seeing each other again . So what do they decide to do ? Krista ends up having Edward live up in their attic . Wow ! Krista ends up seeing someone else and Edward gets extremely jealous . So on and so on and so on.<br /><br />"The Man In The Attic " does n't cover any new territory . It 's a Showtime original picture , which explains why the stars are a couple of B - list actors and both appear briefly in the buff.<br /><br / >
0 OK , I am not a professional movie critic but come on ... a true story!!!!<br /><br />They are tunneling under another store to get underneath the bank and stumble across a tomb . At tomb with a passageway which goes directly under the bank.<br /><br />OK , I 'll play along.<br /><br />But then they get into the bank and decide to go to sleep . Yeah ! ! ! I am sure with all the adrenaline pumping through them they are going to just fall asleep . < br /><br />This blows the whole picture ! ! ! ! How lame!!!!!<br /><br />Glad I did n't have to pay to watch this one .
0 Impressed ! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I ever saw ! I did n't like the novel , but this movie made it worse ! Very bad music , even worse actors ( apart from SRK of course , though even he does n't manage to save the movie ) , and not much sense . The director makes it all look very confusing , God knows why ... Maybe it 's because he 's trying to make it all look very surrealistic , and yet credible . Well , he manages neither.<br /><br />Even if you 've got a few hours to loose , do n't watch this movie , please ! ( Saying this for your own welfare ! ) Keep searching , you will find something else to watch !
0 Maya is a woman without any interests . She just dreams her life away and wonders , why she does not feel fulfilled . This could be an interesting topic . That would need a good story , a nice setting and good dialogues . It does n't have any of these . This movie is totally boring . There are only lengths and no climaxes . The only climax is Shahrukh Khan . But although I am a huge fan of his , I could n't stand this movie . Even he ca n't make this movie exiting . The movie is not as bad as " King Uncle " and if you 're an Art - house fan or like it slow , you might maybe like it . It 's not funny , it 's not interesting , it 's not catching . My recommendation : Do n't watch it .
0 I 've been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line was n't good at all . The play of the actors were n't any better.<br /><br />Of course Shahrukh Khan was there yet he was n't enough to make this movie " credible " and interesting.<br /><br />I've read that this movie was based on the novel of Flaubert " Madame Bovary " yet for me I did n't see it matching with the Indian mentality.<br /><br />In general we buy movie to dream and have a good time , not to waste our time and change our mood into worse . I just ca n't understand how it could get such a " high " vote with an average of 6.8/10.<br /><br />So it 's the kind of movie you should run away & ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it ! You will just waste your time unless if you like " dark movie " with " strange and non sense story " .
0 Painful . Painful is the only word to describe this awful rendition of such a fun and interesting Shakespearean play . I gave it a shot but was terribly disappointed and could n't bare to even finish viewing it . To the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this twist of Much Ado was , I pity you and your bored brain . May your pretenses about young viewers be lifted without retribution . Please do not even bother with this gut wrenching , disgusting excuse for a performance of an acclaimed Shakespeare drama . You will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a commode close to the television with which you choose to watch this crap because involuntary defecation will take place .
0 This is a very bland and inert production of one of Shakespeare 's most vibrant plays . I can only guess that the intent was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has not been exposed to Shakespeare before . By doing this , though - by making every line clear and every intent obvious - they have drained the play of life and turned it into a flat caricature . Somehow , it is actually boring - a very hard feat given such wonderful material.<br /><br />The acting is forgettable at best - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro . Others , however , do not fare so well . April Shawnham 's Hero is a pouty , breathless airhead that frequently provokes winces . Jerry Mayer 's Don John is a nonsensical cartoon character on the level of Snidely Whiplash ( though Snidley was much more enjoyable).<br /><br />F. Murray Abraham ( you know , the guy who killed Mozart ? ) is not in this version , unless he was in disguise and had his name removed from the credits.<br /><br />Given that the producer , Joseph Papp , is basically a theater god , this production is not only disappointing but head - scratching as well.<br /><br />Don't bother with this . Watch Branagh 's Much Ado instead - his version is overflowing with vitality and humor , to say nothing of wonderful performances .
0 This is possibly the worst version of the play I have seen - several times on stage apart from the movie.<br /><br />A very nice idea for the set up - the American South can give a credible backdrop for the extreme reaction round Hero 's supposed misdemeanour.<br /><br />But the execution ! Widdoes is a very mannered Beatrice giving a particularly poor performance . Waterston , a fine actor , is not much better as Benedict.<br /><br />The poorest performance is in the role of Don John - it makes Keanu Reeves look good . Perhaps the desire to make it a caricature along the lines of the villain who ties the maiden to the train track fits with the keystone kops capers of Dogberry and his men - but the acting makes you want to cringe.<br /><br />Successful set - ups include the scene where they fool Benedict into believing Beatrice loves him - were the acting competent it would be superb . But the use of the river and the visual humour of Benedict moving closer is well produced.<br /><br />Overall I had to force myself to keep watching but it certainly did n't keep my attention.<br /><br />Very disappointing.<br /><br />With respect to latter comments above I am nearly 40 . I 've been watching stage and screen productions of Shakespeare for over 2 decades . Might I suggest when trying to defend your friends you speak to the piece rather than attack other reviewers when you are so inadequately armed in terms of fact . I can assume though , from your distaste regarding youth , that you are of sufficient age where the mannered acting of bygone days is more to your taste.<br /><br />My personal favourite pairing was Rylance and McTeer on the London stage . Unlike Widdoes , McTeer , a skilled and charismatic performer , can act .
0 I consider Stuart Bliss the worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />The acting was terrible and the plot ludicrous . I get the fact that the main character 's wife leaving him triggered a mental breakdown , but it got so silly and boring , after a while I could have cared less about any of the characters.<br /><br />The movie kept going over and over the same ideas without anything fresh or surprising to add to the plot . The whole thing with the Geiger counter got too much after a while after Stuart started opening up his wall to see what was behind it after the counter indicated something was there.<br /><br />Then there was the repetitive scenes with the flyer , and the confusing ones where he meets himself.<br /><br />I should have guessed that this movie was a flop when I did n't recognize any of the actors . Do yourself a favor when this movie comes up , read a book ! You 'll be better off .
0 I enjoyed the feel of the opening few minutes , but 20-minutes in I was liberally applying the fast - forward button . Far too many shots of Stewart ( Michael Zelniker ) walking from room to room , down hallways , through doors and down the street , and as many shots of him looking pensive and confused . Gave me the impression that the story had originally been meant as a short ( 20 - 30 minutes ) , and then stretched into a feature as a labour of love between director Grieve and star Zelniker ( they co - wrote the screenplay).<br /><br />It might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that I had n't heard said in many other films before , or if the ending was n't - disappointingly - the one I had predicted three minutes into the film ( atypical for an independent / smaller studio film ) . At least its heart was in the right place - it was n't your standard formulaic Hollywood manipulative nonsense .
0 Despite being a 2001 movie , the direction is the kind of 90 's art - house style that was considered " old " and out - of - date a few years ago . The cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch . The script is decent enough , and a few scenes did kind of captivate me ( like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night ) . But the story line with the detective who 's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible . The performance by the actor who plays Selma Blair 's married boyfriend seriously bothered me . I did sit through the whole thing , though , which is rare for the kind of random , what - is - this movie you just find on TV and decide to watch .
0 this movie was clearly done poorly and in a rush . I realize that the funding for any such movie is hard to come by . However if the plot had any kind of original substance someone would have seen that it got the necessary funding , this was not the case and movies like this are not necessary themselves and have no purpose in existing . The plot for this movie has been done and done better i might add , many times before . There is no reason to make a movie that has no chance in competing with any others . i was informed by my computer that i need a minimum of ten lines to submit my comment so the following lines are just bull to fill in space . In my opinion there is no need for anything else to be said about this film . what i 've said is plenty and if you wasted enough time reading this review , than for God 's sake do n't waste more time watching this movie . The only exception to this is if you are the kind of person who likes watching crappy movies that get played on the womens entertainment network at 2:00 a.m. in that case go ahead see what i care .
0 Kill Me Later " has an interesting initial premise : a suicidal woman ( Selma Blair ) on the verge of jumping off the top of an office building is protects a bank robber ( Max Beesley ) who promises to " kill her later." < br /><br />The actual execution of this premise , however , falls flat as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion . Shoddily written characters who exhibit no motive for their behaviors compromise the quality of acting all around . Lack of character depth especially diminishes Selma Blair 's performance , whose character Shawn vacillates from being morose to acting " cool " and ultimately comes across as a confused dolt . This is unfortunate , as under other circumstances Ms. Blair is an appealing and capable actress.<br /><br />Compounding matters for the worse is director Dana Lustig 's insistence on using rapid cuts , incongruous special effects ( e.g. look for an unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase at the end ) , and a hip soundtrack in the hopes of appealing to the short attention spans of the MTV crowd . Certainly Ms. Lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of direction , but in no way does her skill help overcome the film 's inherent problems and thus the movie drags on to the end . Clearly , Lustig has a distinct visual style ; however it is perhaps better suited to music videos than to feature film.<br /><br />The producers ( Ram Bergman & Lustig)can be commended for their ability to realize this film : they were able to scare up $ 1.5 million to finance the film , secure a good cast , and get domestic and foreign distribution . This is no small feat for an independent film . Yet given the quality of the product , the result is a mixed bag .
0 After viewing this film , I felt the compelling need to vent a bit of my frustration . Selma Blair is a fabulous , currently underrated actress and Max Beesley was rather charming in " Kill Me Later " . The story , while not exactly original , certainly showed some promise . None of that mattered though ... at all.<br /><br />I do n't know what her deal is , but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent whatsoever as a director . She slowed footage down , sped footage up , reversed footage , used awkward camera angles , used annoying color filters , made a zillion quick cuts , jumped back and forth in the timeline and topped it all off with an obnoxious " modern " soundtrack of blaring junk . I ca n't remember the last time I saw such an incompetent job of directing a film . Her ego must be huge to toss out the acting and story and put her direction front and center for the audience members to take notice of . It is crammed down their throats.<br /><br />There are a couple of good scenes in " Kill Me Later " which show what could have and should have been . Unfortunately , just when things would start to show promise , Ms. Lustig would dig into her bag of film school tricks and jumble things up again . It 's a shame because Blair and Beesley had good chemistry and you could tell that the film really had a good heart . 3/10
0 I see a lot of people liked this movie . To me this was a movie made right of writing 101 and the person failed the class . From the time Lindsey Price the videographer shows up until the end the movie was very predictable . I kept on watching to see if it was going anywhere.<br /><br />First we have the widowed young father . Clich√© # 1 movies / TV always kill off the the mother parent if the child is a girl , or a brood of boys so the single father can get swoon over his dead wife and seem completely out of his element taking care of the children . Starting from from My 3 Sons to 2 1/2 Dads . These movies are usually dramas and comedies are TV shows.<br /><br />Clich√© # 2 When a pushy woman has a video camera in her hand she will play a big part in the movie . And will always have solutions or even if that person is a airhead < br /><br />Clich√© # 3 If the person in peril is a foreigner they have to be of Latino origin . And they must be illegal . Apparently there are no legal Latino 's and illegal Europeans , unless if there is a IRA element involved.<br /><br />Clich√© # 4 The said Latino must be highly educated in his native country . In this case he was a Profesor who made 200 per month . And the said highly educated Latino must now act like he has n't brain in his head now and lets the air head side kick take over.<br /><br />Clich√© # 5 The crime the person committed really was n't a crime but a accident . But because in this case he has lost all of the sense he had when he crossed the boarder he now acts like a blithering idiot and now has put his own daughter in peril by taking her along on a fruitless quest to the border with the idiot side kick.<br /><br />Clich√© # 6 One never runs over a hoodlum running from a crime , but some poor little cute kid . This is because the parents of the child have to play a big part of the movie , and because the the person who accidentally killed the child can have ridiculous interaction with the parents.<br /><br />Clich√© # 7 Name me one movie in which one cop is not the angry vet and they get paired up with a rookie . Even if they are homicide detectives who have to be the most experienced cops on a police Force . Sev7n and Copy cat and Law and Order come to mind right away . And the vet even though gruff on the outside has a heart of gold.<br /><br />Clich√© # 8 Let 's go and round up some unemployed Soap Stars . Now I like Lindsey Price . But Susan Haskell IMO can not act her way out of a paper bag and when she use to be on One Life To Live as Marty he swayed from right to left every time she opened her mouth . It use to get me sea sick . She might be anchored on land better now , but she still can not act.<br /><br />The movie might have been more insightful if it was n't filled with clich√©s . I do n't think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good . But this was just bad.<br /><br />***SPOILER * * * * Now I am not going to spoil the ending . Oh heck I will because I feel it will be a disservice to humanity to let a person waste time they will never get back looking at this movie . It involves Clich√© # 6 and # 7 . Unless a person has never seen a movie before you had to see what was coming . The father makes even a dumber mistake runs from the cops at the end and gets shot by the angry veteran , who all of a sudden is very upset . You would think she thought the poor guy was innocent all through the movie and she shot him by mistake . When she did n't . Now for the little girl who the dad brought along with him . Guess what happen to her ? Times up , she ends up living with the family whose child was killed by her father ! ! Come on ! You all knew that was going to happen , because she is a replacement child ! ! That is why she did not go and live with the Lindey Price character . < br /><br />This movie was a insult as far as I was concerned . Because there were so many avenues this movie could of explored and went down but it chose to take the clich√© ridden one . The 2 stars are for 2 of the stars , the little girl , who I thought was very good and Lindsey Price who character was annoying but she did what she could with it . My advice is take a vice and squeeze your head with it instead of looking at this dreck
0 Heavy - handed moralism . Writers using characters as mouthpieces to speak for themselves . Predictable , plodding plot points ( say that five times fast ) . A child 's imitation of Britney Spears . This film has all the earmarks of a Lifetime Special reject.<br /><br />I honestly believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo set out to create a thought - provoking , emotional film on a tough subject , exploring the idea that things are not always black and white , that one who is a criminal by definition is not necessarily a bad human being , and that there can be extenuating circumstances , especially when one puts the well - being of a child first . However , their earnestness ends up being channeled into preachy dialogue and trite situations planted to move the plot along . The decent production values and interesting use of documentary - style camera footage are not enough to accomplish their aim when the script and the acting fall flat.<br /><br />Logic is often compromised for the sake of creating tension : Soid first tries to blackmail Pablo into participating in her documentary in exchange for helping them escape , then in the same breath basically tells him not to trust her because she 's not helping them out of altruism . Well , duh . And for a man on the run , Pablo is far too swayed by a temper tantrum . Cristina 's well - being is so important to him that he 's fleeing capture and jail or deportation for her , but he 's willing to risk all that to appease her when she does n't want to go to Mexico . Right . Talk above over - permissive parenting . Third , when Pablo 's employer Charlie gives the phone to Detective Bright , she is remarkably unprofessional , especially given her seniority - did she really think she was persuasive ? Oh , yeah , I would have turned myself in . CCH Pounder 's Detective Wims could wipe the floor with her.<br /><br />To be fair , I 'd like to list the things I liked . Um , I liked the midget . And I liked the fact that the midget was named Sexy . There 's cross - dressing , always a plus ; juvenile cross - dressing , no less ! Harry is infinitely cuter than Cristina . But my favorite moment in the film has to be when Cristina kicks Detective Not - So - Bright . I also find it interesting that , in a heavily minority cast ( which I much appreciate , by the way ) , the black character is the racist one . Too bad it 's just thrown out there and not further explored.<br /><br />There 's a distinctive , unconventional score , but it 's nonetheless generally context - unspecific , not enhancing mood or tension in any scene , except the pathetic , anguished wailing every time the main character is in anguish , as though they think his acting does n't show it enough : ' Just in case you were n't sure , he 's upset , and we have the musical cues to prove it.'<br /><br />Stilted , clich√©d dialogue results in a depressing lack of subtext ; everything has to be spelled out in dialogue , even when the body language had been up ' til then conveying it just fine . For example , every impassioned speech Pablo makes , and Mrs. Knight 's lament that her child wo n't be crawling into bed with them in the morning.<br /><br />'Papi , tell me about Mama again ' - what shameless , blatant exposition introducing the generic dead wife ! ( She 's always the most beautiful woman the widower had ever seen , the kindest he had ever met . Why ca n't we see a man cry over a woman like Shakespeare 's - she may be fat , ugly , obnoxious , but his love for her is deep as oceans ? Now _ there 's _ a story which would move me.)<br /><br />The police always being literally one step behind them gives many scenes the out - of - place feeling of a French farce . Most boring foot chases ever - Bright and Lightning are so out - of - shape and easily - fooled ( he certainly is n't quick as lightning , and she , well , I do n't feel the need to spell things out ) . Some guy dragging along a small child outrunning a bicycle cop , complete with macho biker picking a fight but then being felled by a child ? To quote Margaret Cho , that 's so sad . Would we ever see this on ' Cops ' ? < br /><br />Hackneyed and over - the - top deus ex machina : as an employer , would you really waive checking his green card just because he can quote the author of the inspirational saying on a poster behind your desk?<br /><br />Plus several scenes , including the above , threaten to devolve into porn : ' Well , I 'll do this favor for you , as long as you do something for me ... ' I can almost hear the bowm - chicka - bowm - bowm.<br /><br />When the parents view the footage shot of Pablo 's remorse , the grieving mom 's freak - out is the most real the movie feels . Unfortunately , this is diminished by the fact that she looks completely swayed by his emotional speech right up until she goes ballistic . A more ambivalent look would be more convincing here.<br /><br />I'm in constant awe of the stupidity of the main character doing things for the sake of plot : holding up a convenience store without a mask , visiting the dead girl 's grave . And why does n't the mother recognize his face from when she saw him before he drove off ? ! ' You seem awfully familiar ... '<br /><br />What is the purpose of that wholly unnecessary , somewhat gratuitous scene with Soid and the artificially - enhanced bartender ? Character development ? Tch . Too little , too late.<br /><br />Speaking of unnecessary traits that never went anywhere , Detective Lightning 's saying skeptical Detective Bright must be a Scorpio shows how little he really knows about the occult . And I do n't think that believing in fate quite qualifies as voodoo mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />At the end , when Bright holds Pablo as he dies - wait , why does she care now ? Her character is as inconsistent as Soid 's . What , she has to shoot him just because she said ' Stop , or I 'll shoot ' ? ( She 's cared _ so_much _ about her integrity thus far . ) He was unarmed . There was no need for lethal force . What 's wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him?<br /><br />Finally , Cristina 's childlike acceptance of her mother 's death giving Dr. Knight peace over his daughter 's death - so forced . And the contrivance of the family whose child was killed becoming Cristina 's new family ... It angers me that she could be a ' replacement ' for their little girl . It 's also unrealistic that a white couple would take in the Latino daughter of the man who killed their own daughter . I 'm not saying there are n't generous , loving people who would do that . I 'm just saying that the characters here are never developed far enough for me to believe that _ they _ would do that.<br /><br />I find it offensive that another IMDb reviewer said that of course as a woman she was moved by the sappy scenes . I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that do n't wax sentimental in a manufactured manner.<br /><br />Co - writer , co - director , co - star Nebot said himself he wore too many hats during this production . Too many cooks may spoil the broth , but one cook alone just might end up making an after - school special.<br /><br />In conclusion , this film 's title has less to do with the story and more to do with the feeling of regret , helplessness , and loss accompanying the revelation that you will never see your money again .
0 This film has an interesting plot , but the acting is quite bad and the script is poor . I was very disappointed . The moral dilemma faced by the main character is an intriguing one , but due to poor writing and casting this potentially winning premise is plundered . 2 of the 4 other people in the theater left after about 45 minutes and the other 2 were laughing at how bad the film was . I stuck it out to the end , but I must admit I played Blackjack on my cell phone to make the last 30 minutes bearable .
0 It makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like the Royal Shakespeare Company . This movie is jaw dropping in how appalling it is . Turning the DVD player off was not a sufficient course of action . I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them around the face . I will never get that time back . Never . How is it possible to create such a banal , boring and soulless film ? I could not think of a course of action that would relieve the tedium . Writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a disgraceful piece of cinema . What more can you say than reiterate how truly awful the acting is . Please avoid .
0 Being a Film studies graduate I would like to think that I have seen a diverse range of films , some good and some bad , but I would have to say that ' Summer rain ' is by far the worse film I have ever seen ! I chose the film in the hope that it was going to be a great British classic such as ' Secrets and Lies ' or ' Lockstock ' but oh no this was so bad that my flat mates and I ended up laughing and cringing at the ridiculous acting and cheesy script ( reminded me of a bad ' theatre in education ' school production ) . The main characters Michelle and Gary began to annoy us from the start . ' Michelle ' the main character who lives with her two friends has the type of face that you would never get tired of slapping and Gary was so wet ( he kept breaking down in tears every 5 minutes ) that by the end of the film I really did n't give a damn about either of them . All I could think was ' I paid ¬£ 3 for this pile ' . I have never written a review before but after watching this film it has spurred me on to warn people of this disastrous production . So please avoid at all costs . Thanks for reading .
0 Well ....... in contrast to other comments previously written I have to say that the only good thing about this film is the fact that one guy in it looked a bit like Jason Donavon which reminded me of my youth . I have no idea how it won any awards , and although I 'm sure a great deal of effort went into making it it was all fruitless as the final outcome is one which screams of early 90 's foreign soap operas . The plot was non - existent , the cinematography was hopeless and the acting was on par with an a - level performance . It was unfortunately long and the sub - plots were incredibly unrealistic .... for example .... if your best friend slept with your ex - boyfriend of 6 years after only 2 weeks of being broken up you would not all remain the best of friends . It was all fantasy . That 's all ! Oh yeah , and the weird 90 's house / soft core indie was mind numbing !
0 I 'll give credit where credit is due , and say that Linda Fiorentino gives a good performance as a hard - drinking actress who does what she wants . She 's brash , sassy , hard - edged , and very sexy ; she is much better than this film deserves.<br /><br />But that is IT . This dull suspense film is a fragmented mess , attempting at once to be a stalker thriller , a murder thriller , a tale of loyalty and betrayal , and a steamy erotic thriller . The film , my friends , is n't thrilling in the slightest.<br /><br />For instance , who thought of casting C. Thomas Howell as a desirable leading man ? He is not ugly , but for crying out loud , it looks as though Fiorentino 's tough - cookie goddess is getting it on with a kindergarten teacher . Howell has neither the authority or screen presence to fill the leading man role.<br /><br />The script is by far the worst aspect of the film . There is no tension as Fiorentino 's character gets eerie phone calls , there is no mystery concerning her guilt in the murders that are the focus of the film , there is no sense of liberation as Fiorentino gets wimpy Howell to lose his inhibitions.<br /><br />Look for interesting but poorly - done cameos by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes , and one really , really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino . Besides that , my first impulse would be to put this sorry piece of trash down and go rent something else .
0 Perhaps not my genre but plot was horrible as was acting by Nancy Allen and Linda Farentino . C. Thomas also seemed uncomfortable in role of being seduced here ( while on marijuana ? why did this need to be included ? this weakened plot considerably ) . Also Farentino 's charac . would have been better had she had more respect for a relationship . Would does movie try to say ? not much .
0 A bondage , humiliation , S&M show , and not much else . The plot is flat , really just a banal setup for the stylishly depraved set - pieces . The host of the aforementioned show , a silly little man who spouts drivel while prancing around the stage in dresses , was almost as painfully distracting as the attempts at artful editing . The dream - like ending felt tacked on . To the film 's credit though , Aya Sugimoto was fairly convincing as the tortured lead . Flower and Snake has been compared with Eyes Wide Shut but aside from some minor surface similarities , Kubrick 's is easily the more layered , artistic , and atmospheric picture .
0 when you get to the scenes that involve Albert Brooks without his shirt ... try not to gag on a fur ball.<br /><br />I like Albert Brooks . I 've seen most , if not all of his movies but it was the first time seeing this one . Modern Romance is an interesting take on the subject of love . There are few movies that handle the desperation of love as well or as overtly as Modern Romance , although 1979 's Chilly Scenes of Winter comes very close . They both essentially deal with obsessed men that are too psychologically attracted / obsessed to their respective women.<br /><br />Where - as Chilly Scenes of Winter borders on the subject stalking , this movie has a more grounded foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship .. and out of the relationship .. and back in it again.<br /><br />And because it 's a movie that was released in 1981 , it is of its time in terms of styles and such . That 's the main reason I like this movie . My basic rule when it comes to movies is " If it sucks at least it may have some historic relevance " , you know time capsule stuff.<br /><br />Which leads me to the horrific scenes of Albert Brooks sans shirt.<br /><br />The man is hair . Very hair . Like he 's wearing a black curly fur sweater - hairy . And what 's worse is he almost looks burn victim - hairy . It 's not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on . Back in the early 80 's hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking . But in 2009 the sight of something like this is just plain revolting . Sorry , Albert ! I wish at some point someone said " hey let 's try this scene but with you wearing a simple t - shirt , I mean you might scare people " . It 's just really bad and I feel sorry for the poor pretty actress that had to deal with Albert Brooks naked body on top of hers . She was probably pulling out his hairs from her teeth for days after that.<br /><br />Anyway , it 's an OK movie . It could have been better if I had n't see Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because that will forever taint my viewing of this movie .
0 This is a depressingly shallow , naive and mostly unfunny look at a wildly improbable relationship between Brooks ' psychotic film editor and Harold , his vapid girlfriend . The two have ZERO chemistry together - primarily because Harold is incapable of doing anything besides looking pretty at this stage of her career ; but also because Brooks ' character is neither interesting nor likeable . There are 15 static , excruciating minutes at the beginning where Brooks , having just broke up with Harold , stumbles about his apartment in a depressed , drugged out state - unbearable.<br /><br />Sappily and unimaginatively bookended by Joe Cocker 's " You Are So Beautiful " , there simply is not enough material here for a feature film . There is hardly anything going on on the periphery of their relationship to give the appearance that these people exist in a real world . I 'm sure Brooks ' intention was to shine a white hot spotlight on the affair and , in a way , deconstruct it ; but if you 're going to do that the writing and acting needs to be far far better than what it is here .
0 Having read the other comments on this film , I would like to share my own view that this is one tough movie to see unless you are a total Brooksophile . I am not.<br /><br />When looked at by a purely objective observer , the film is an unbalanced narrative that presents us with more undistilled neuroses than are capable of being absorbed in one sitting . It is quite difficult to watch . The Brooks character ( Robert Cole ) is so unsympathetic and unpleasant that it is hard to relate to him --- let alone root for him as he stumbles from one dysfunctional self - absorbed situation to the next . And he should NEVER do a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context . No man could have that much exposed foliage and be supposed to turn on a babe like Kathryn Harrold----unless , of course , he is Albert Brooks in an Albert Brooks - controlled production.<br /><br />"Modern Romance " has its amusing moments-----but they are fragmentary and infrequent . More often than not , I felt as if I were on a confined journey with a thoroughly dislikable person and wishing that it would end already . It confirms the problems that can develop when too much control of a film is placed in only one person --- someone who lacks the self - discipline to be able to step back from it and see what is clearly happening.<br /><br />As most people probably know , James L. Brooks , who played the director in this film , is in fact what he portrayed . Six years later , he cast Albert Brooks in the very successful " Broadcast News . " James showed us how Albert can shape a credible and entertaining comic performance . Albert allowed us to see James ( generally not cast as an actor ) do a rare comic turn in a surprisingly effective manner.<br /><br />Fans of " Modern Romance " will by now have moved on to the next laudatory comment about it . To you I say-----there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a film intended as an entertainment .
0 When I saw the previews for this movie , I did n't expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie . But wow , this movie was absolutely awful . And that 's being generous.<br /><br />First of all , the casting for the movie was terrible . You feel no sympathy ( or for that matter any morbid feeling ) for the characters . The acting was so terrible that I was just simply waiting and hoping for the God - awful thing to end.<br /><br />Secondly , there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever . Can somebody please explain to me why the girlish - looking boy starts screaming " PANCAKES ! ! ! " at the top of his lungs while going into Jackie Chan moves I 've never seen before , and even further biting the guy who has the virus ? Why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus - infected guy , and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him ? I was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that I literally said out loud , " Where the hell did that come from?" < br /><br />I just simply could n't believe what I had seen . I really thought I had seen some bad movies , but I have to say that Cabin Fever tops them all . This movie made me want to puke and then puke again . Then blow my brains out.<br /><br />Please , save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive . Watching grass grow , perhaps , is a proper alternative .
0 OK let 's get right to the point . We have five recent college grads ( must have majored in the F word ) going out on a weekend camping trip . They run into someone who is in need of help , but instead of trying to assist him , they decide to set him on fire instead . Nice bunch of people . Next some of them start go get sick - must be something in the water at the cabin they are staying at . However the neighbors seem to be OK . Oh well , when things start getting really bad , they lock up one their companions instead of getting help ( try the neighbor by the way ) . Some locals do n't take a liking to them . They chase one on a high speed romp through the woods for many miles , until the truck breaks down . Somehow ten minutes later he shows up at the cabin ( how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery ) . Another of the brain surgeon type at the cabin realizes something is amiss so he hides out in a cave to let this blow over . He then decides the next day to return to the cabin believing it must be some type of shrine . He is giddy with relief that he survived ( he must have thought it was a 24 hour bug ) . Unfortuneatley he is met by some not so friendly police officers . Another couple decide to have sex while the flesh eating bug is working its magic , and then the women realizes she needs to shave her legs ( taking a lot of the diseased skin with shaving cream ) . Anyway you get the idea . Nothing makes sense here . These are five people I would not want to be friends with . I was rooting for the flesh eating bacteria . Other characters were introduced who were also somewhat amusing but utterly unlikeable as well . Ninety minutes of good life wasted here .
0 Anyone who has read my review for Uwe Boll 's " Alone In The Dark " will remember that I compared the unenviable task of sitting through that piece of human waste to having each and every hair on your arm pulled out . Well , take that analogy a step further with this irredeemable gutter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without novacaine . Do that , and you 'll have a general idea of what Eli Roth 's " Cabin Fever " is all about.<br /><br />I never believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonizing dreck that Uwe Boll cranks out as the " worst film ever made . " But , in all honesty , I have to say " Cabin Fever " comes very close . This is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release . For somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as Eli Roth does , he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie I think I have ever seen in my entire life . How do you screw up a story like this ? Think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters , without the bad writing , and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy . A movie dealing with a grotesque flesh - eating virus could and should have been so much better than what Roth dished out for us here . This script failed on so many levels with me . And , while I do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses , I do know that he fumbled the ball big time on an idea that could very well have redefined the horror genre.<br /><br />To say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words . A generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects ca n't even save it , and that is one element I normally go for . There really was nothing about " Cabin Fever " that I could easily recommend to anybody . When three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through , you know the movie is sinking fast . My best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before purchasing . One viewing was more than enough for me to know that I will most likely never bother with it again .
0 I wasted 5.75 to see this crappy movie so I just want to know a few things:<br /><br />What was the point of the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie , the disease had nothing to do with being split in half.<br /><br />What was the point of dragging Karen into the shed , she already totally infected her room , they could have just locked her in there where she would have been safer.<br /><br />Why would the Hermit be running around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his relative , the hog lady , to take him to the hospital?<br /><br />Why did n't any of the characters bother to walk into town to get help when things started getting bad , are they all really that lazy?<br /><br />Even if Paul was threatened by the guy w/ the shotgun for peeping on his wife , Paul could have just sent Jeff or Bert back to the house to ask for help . the girl he loves is deteriorating.<br /><br />What was the point of the box?<br /><br />Why did Jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected , if he was that big of a jerk to leave in the first place would n't he have just gone back home?<br /><br />If the police went to all the trouble of gathering up the kids and burning them on the fire pit , why did they throw Paul halfway into the river , it was n't even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated.<br /><br />Who makes lemonade out of river water , that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it . Why could n't the two kids have just use the tap water , it was contaminated too , so the stupid ending would still work .
0 I do n't really know whether Cabin Fever is supposed to be a joke or a film ... But as far as I know , it 's much closer to being a joke than anything else . A few years ago , the community of horror film makers decided to take a new step and make fun of the genre , thus giving birth to the Scream series . A list was given in Scream , of all the stupid things horror film characters will do that are predictable , and the characters in Scream ended up doing exactly the same things , which added a lot of humor and irony to this analysis of the genre , and led to hope that horror films from now on would show a bit different , either full of irony towards the genre , self - derision towards the film itself , or at least different in their dramatic process than all the " old " films that responded to the same tired criteria . In seeing " Cabin Fever " , alas , many will see how unoriginal , serious , pretentious , boring and even not scary some supposedly " scary " films are now , even a few years later . First of all , this film lacks originality in a way few others do . It has been said several times , how little imagination horror directors have today , remaking remakes of foreign sequels , but setting the film in a cabin in the woods just does n't seem to be an " hommage " to anything , it seems to be , simply , a ripoff . Whoever wishes to be surprised by other factors of the film 's story wo n't be : once again , we are dealing with a film whose characters are all in their early twenties , who wo n't think rationally when placed in front of a problem , will rather argue for hours and pick up fights than try to think and do something about it . Not much excitement there either . For the umpteenth time in a horror film , they are tempted to kiss , make love and just basically have fun , all sorts of things that do n't really make them any different than any other horror film victims seen previously . Secondly , this film is unimaginatively serious . Every situation the characters are in , every dialog , every situation in the film is treated with such seriousness that any viewer with a little sense of derision will be relieved when some characters finally end up dying . Nothing in the way the film is directed , written or acted shows any sign of humor or sarcasm , which is quite amazing considering the film is about an invisible - never - heard - of - before - flesh - eating - virus ( no laughs please ) . I wo n't even bring up the acting , since there are no actors in this film . The cast was most certainly hired for being friends or neighbors with the director . Thirdly , and this will strike whoever has seen a " good " horror film before , the screenplay is absolutely empty . Nothing really happens , some actions are repeated several times ( " let 's try to get help ! " ) , nothing makes sense , either in the facts , the psychology of the characters , or even the hilariously lame last sequence of the film , which is probably supposed to be funny according to the director and screenwriters . In the end I will only remark that a horror film is supposed to have something scary in it . Gallons of fake blood , whether they are being vomited , squirted from severed limbs or simply dripping from wounds , never were enough to scare an audience . Such major features as screenplay , ideas , and even cruelty are requested for whoever claims to have shot something scary . If I was n't considering it to be a total failure , I would agree to reckon that the film has one talent : it is filthy disgusting to watch . Yet being grossed - out and being scared are two very different feelings , let it be known.<br /><br />I would like to encourage anyone a tad curious or interested in seeing this film to check older major horror films first , why not from the 60s , the 70s , the 80s , films made by Wes Craven , Dario Argento , Sam Raimi , Stanley Kubrick , David Lynch , Roger Corman , William Lustig , John Carpenter ... it might not only give a good definition of what is scary , or self - derisory horror , but also convince viewers that " new " is n't necessarily " better " . A good example related to the film is the few tracks composer Angelo Badalamenti provided for this film , even although they are unmistakably close to his previous compositions , they are below anything he has ever done before .
0 Okay I had heard little about this film , so when it came on the movie channels on TV , I wanted to watch it , being a horror aficionado . I think I can do a collective " huh ? " for everyone who watched it.<br /><br />I decided to move on with my life , but at a party with my closest friends , we saw it was coming on and some of us having seen it already decided we could laugh our way through it , both of us proclaiming " this is the dumbest thing I 've ever seen " . It was n't scary ; Ill give it to Roth ( who I think is a young hack ) ; characters do change throughout the film , ala " Cube".<br /><br />HOWEVER despite your typical " rats in a cage " scenario- who will turn on who , etc . , it was pretty average horror.<br /><br />A few points : 1 . ) What was with that kid ? I 'm not even talking about him being weird and biting people . I 'm talking about the whole " slow motion karate kicking " , what was that ? 2 . ) Okay I know Rider 's character liked Jordan Ladd 's , but as a young woman , I was appalled that he just went ahead and molested her in her sleep . Uh , that s illegal.<br /><br />3 . ) Roth was in the movie just so Roth could be in the movie . Talk about pointlessly writing yourself in ! 4 . ) What was with the deputy ? 5 . ) So she was just instantly pulled apart by the dog ? And there was little to no blood left ? Just a scrap of her jeans ? Anyway we were LAUGHING our asses off , and I love laughing during horror movies ( Return of the Living Dead 2 , Evil Dead ) , but I do n't know if we were supposed to be laughing here ...
0 * * SPOILERS BELOW!!!**<br /><br />Cabin Fever has my nod for WORST film of the year ... that I 've seen that is . This movie is straight GARBAGE ! There is so much wrong with the film you ca n't help but be amazed at how bad it really is . This movie had so much potential to be good , but ultimately made nothing of it . The characters were as dumb as one can be ; for the entire movie you 're just asking yourself " why would you do that ? " or " what 's your point in doing this?" ... this is how illogical and stupid the characters are . We get NO background into them , so naturally you really do n't give a rats as$ about their fate ... you could only laugh at their stupidity . < br /><br />- The ' slut ' ( Marcy ) for instance ... was she that horny that she had to sleep with Paul ( Rider Strong ) ? There was no point in that .... its almost as if the filmmakers needed a excuse to give her the virus so voila ! UGH . < br /><br />- Would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from the faucet of a cabin WITHOUT looking at it first?<br /><br />- Why did n't Bert just shoot the sick guy from the start ? Movie would 've been over that way .... besides , they ended up killing him anyway.<br /><br />- Why did it take them so long to finally decide to leave the cabin , even if they had to walk ? ' No , I 'll just wait until 2 of my friends are infected ( one a blink away from death ) to finally opt to walk outta there.<br /><br />- What was exactly the reasoning behind Paul 's attempt to fish out the body of the Hermit , only to fall in the contaminated reservoir and get infected with the virus ? Pure STUPIDITY!<br /><br />I swear , common sense was not a friend , much less an aquaintance to these idiots . I do n't think there has ever been a worse ending to a movie . In the beginning the kids ask the hick store cashier what the rifle was for , and he replied that ' its for the niggers ' . In the end of the film , 3 young Blacks ( dressed in baggy clothes , one of them in a du - rag no less ) go into the store .... come to find out that the cashier was cleaning it for them to be used for hunting . THEN , he proceeds to give them all pounds and handshakes and joke around with them as if they 're his homeboys.<br /><br />Okay , WHAT THE HELL WAS THE POINT OF THAT ? ! ? ! ? ! ? How tasteless can one be , what were the filmmakers THINKING putting that in the movie ? I as a Black man was of course offended by the initial ' Nigger ' comment . It was a tasteless , pointless remark . My question to the filmmakers : what was the point of the ending with the Black kids ? Was that to force me to forget about the initial racist comment made earlier ? To smooth things over with Black viewers , by making a joke out of it ? Well , I for one , did NOT find that pathetic attempt at humor funny in the least bit . The whole movie was a joke .... a PATHETIC attempt at filmmaking that should n't be given the time of day . Peter Jackson really thought this film was that good ? What film was HE looking at ? < br /><br />ZERO * out of * * * * stars .... if I could give it a lower rating I would . Please , fellow IMDb'ers , do n't waste 1 1/2 hours of your precious life watching this abomination of a ' movie ' . This is one of the worst movies I 've EVER seen .
0 I 've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on DVD without reading any reviews about it . So , after 15 minutes of watching I 've noticed that something is wrong with this movie ; it 's TERRIBLE ! I mean , in the trailers it looked scary and serious!<br /><br />I think that Eli Roth ( Mr. Director ) thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid , the movie would be funny ... (So stupid , it 's funny ... ? WRONG ! ) He should watch and learn from better horror - comedies such as:"Fright Night " , " The Lost Boys " and " The Return Of the Living Dead " ! Those are funny!<br /><br />"Cabin Fever " is THE reason why I registered to www . IMDb.com so I can release my thoughts of discontent about it.<br /><br />I've decided to watch the movie a second time > AAARGH ! < and make notes for my partial " review " to show how foolish the movie is . " Resident Evil " ( horror ) or " Dude , Where 's My Car ? " ( comedy ) I can watch over and over again and still enjoy ! But this ... !<br /><br />How bad can a script and a director be ? ? ? This bad . Here are the awful scenes in chronological order:<br /><br />In the early scenes we see Henry , who does n't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead - glazed stare is dead!<br /><br />The movie does n't explain anything about the blonde long - haired kid who like to bite people.<br /><br />And my answer to Marcy 's unanswered question ( " What 's wrong with the woods ? " ) is " nothing " . The script has that bearded guy warn them about the woods just for " suspense".<br /><br />Then the " smartest " of the 5-pack , Bert , almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire . He meets now - infected Henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the " F - word " . Bert starts to freak out because Henry looks awfully ill . Bert:"Don't make me shoot you ! " ( he forgets to add : " ... with my BB gun!")<br /><br />Bert heads back to the cabin but how about that ? He meets Marcy and Jeff who were having sex , but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk ! Marcy wisely takes out the unguarded campfire Bert had started earlier ( A moment of clarity for a change ? ) Bert does n't mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gun.<br /><br />Later , as the Five Estupidos sit around their campfire , another weirdo shows up with his dog . ( Maybe that 's what the warning about the woods is all about ? It 's filled with weirdos ... and their dogs ! ? ) They let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with cannabis . ( Their brains are completely intoxicated ! No wonder why they are all so DUMB ! ) This is the last time we 'll see this forgettable character ... alive!<br /><br />Henry shows up at their cabin , ( NOTE : He was lying all the time a few yards from their cabin ! ! ! ) looking worse , almost like a zombie , covered in goo ! He says he needs a doctor . But the Young Einsteins refuse to help the poor sucker . He gets into their unlocked truck which of course also has its key in the ignition . Henry almost seems smart enough to drive the Hell away from there but instead starts puking blood all over the dashboard , seats and windows . The Fantastic Five come out running , armed with : a BB Gun , a knife , a baseball bat ( * huh ? Ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods ? ? ? ) , a poker , and a ( insecticide ? ) spray - can , ready to combat the single , unarmed and terribly sick man . ( clever script ! ) Bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his BB Gun , which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth . " What else am I supposed to do ? " Bert yells in his defense . Jeff and Paul try to knock Henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the truck 's windows instead . Henry walks up to the dumb girls who say : " He 's coming towards us ! " ( Thanks for the info , dumb broads , I can see that ! But I do n't think he wants to do you any harm ! ) Marcy sprays in his eyes , making Henry yelp ! And our " hero " Paul touches Henry 's arm with a burning log from the campfire , which they recklessly left burning while they were INSIDE the cabin ! ( Where has all that wisdom gone ? I guess the cannabis had started to take its toll!:- ) Henry turns into The Human Torch and runs away , screaming.<br /><br />The following day , Bert and Jeff head out for a mechanic . And Marcy decides to " go for help " all by herself , in the woods , as Paul stays behind with Karen ... Doesn't that sound idiotic ? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already " going for help"!<br /><br />I skip my comments now to how we suddenly see Marcy in a CANOE rowing over a huge and winding river ! How did she get a canoe ? Does she even know where she 's going ! ? Anyway , she goes to the riverbank and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and , like in most horror movies , walks inside the cabin saying:"Hello ? Is anyone there ? " Bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her ( and me at first ) . And along comes Jeff , as well . How did THEY get here ! ? Did they swim across the river ? ? ? Do you see how brainless the script is!?<br /><br />Deputy Winston meets Paul at the cabin . He somehow does n't notice the blood on their truck . This happens around 35 minutes of viewing and I have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the DVD out . ( Before I take my own eyes out! ... Now , THAT 's funny!)<br /><br />If you liked this movie , do yourself a favor and watch " Fright Night " , " The Lost Boys " , or " The Return of The Living Dead " . Then you 'll see they are MORE entertaining than this ... thing . Even the " Toxic Avenger part 2 " , which is also a lousy film , is way MORE funnier than " Cabin Fever " .
0 Liongate has yet to prove itself . Every single movie from lionsgate has been abysmal . i 've tried and tried to give them more opportunities and they just keep slapping me over and over again . And Cabin Fever is definitely no exception.<br /><br />I could n't even pay attention to most of this movie it was so frustrating and bad.<br /><br />here 's the plot . Guy cuts up dead dog for some reason . Gets infected by random virus , transfers it to kids at a camp , kids start to get infected and die , town finds out about it and rather than help them , kills them . then the water is infected and everyone dies . the end.<br /><br />Seriously , that 's the whole movie.<br /><br />all the characters are completely retarded , you do n't care for any of them , and the one kid should have stuck with boy meets world . Me and my friend found that talking about how fat and bitchy our one classmate was to be far more enjoyable than paying attention to this movie . We did manage to make it all the way to the end while screaming bulls$@t , because this film will make you do that.<br /><br />and i 'm still confused by the random slow motion karate moves of the one random kid and how apparently everybody out in the country is completely retarded and hickish . And again , why did this dog attack the girl ? why did the kid the hicks were trying to kill sit in a chair waiting for them to kill him ? that was part of the two of their 's plan ? wow . best plan ever . i can not believe this movie got a theatrical release . i could barely stomach the DVD , let alone have to sit in a theater not moving for an hour and a half . It was n't scary , or funny , or cool , or anything . it 's just a waste of 90 minutes that you could be using to ... i do n't know , plant a tree or something . it 's more productive than this piece of garbage . The acting , special effects , and script are a joke . do n't ever pick this up.<br /><br />Cabin fever gets one nasty leg shaving scene , out of 10
0 This is probably one of the worst films i have ever seen . The events in it are completely random and make little or no sense . The fact that there is a sequel is so sickening i may come down with a case of cabin fever ( I'M SO SORRY ) . I describe it as bug being smooshed to a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together . e.g Kevin the pancake loving karate kid is just freakishly weird on its own , then there 's the cop who is slightly weird and perverted , then the drug addict , then there 's the fact that they attack some random guy who clearly needs help . then all of a sudden the main character is having sex with his friends girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane going down . then at the end some good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on Kevin the karate kid . Its actually pretty despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film . There is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love Eli Roth , even that did not make me like this film . Hate is a strong word but seeing as it is the only word i am permitted to use it will have to do . BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 ! ! ! ! !
0 Truly one of the most dire films I 've ever sat through . I 've never actually taken the time to write one of these but felt compelled to after witnessing this affront to film - making and feel somewhat aggrieved to be wasting my time on such a piece of turd to be honest . There were so many parts that infuriated me with their complete randomness and lack of sense ( e.g. when would the police force ever shoot people with infectious diseases ? When would hospitals ever through out such people for lack of a cure ? Why was the guy who spotted him spying on his wife wandering around outside in his dressing gown whilst carrying a gun as she rolled around on the bed ? ) . Also , the characterisation - as we 've almost come to expect in such films - was awful ( e.g. the way the blonde guy - I do n't remember his frickin name and do n't give a toss anyway - completely turned against his girlfriend and ran off to leave her ) and I ended up wanting them all to meet grisly ends ! The production was horribly disjointed and the cinematography nothing to write home about .
0 The premise of Cabin Fever starts like it MIGHT have something to offer . A group of college teens after finals ( in the fall ? ) goes to a resort cabin in the woods where one by one they are attacked by an unseen flesh eating virus.<br /><br />Unfortunately , the first paragraph is where any remote elements of film quality stop . Cabin Fever is little more than college kids looking for sex , booze , talking non - stop about nothing , and seeing how many F - bombs they can get into 1:40 minutes or however long this mess is.<br /><br />The kids act and react stupidly to everything around them . One of them for instance discovers that the skin virus has infected her legs , so what does she do ? She keeps shaving her legs failing to take proper medical attention for her wounds . The scene is little more than a gross out . In another scene , Rider Strong from " Boy Meets World " gets bitten on the hand by some kid who only says " Pancakes " and likes to do karate kicks on those who sit next to him . If you can figure out the reason for why the " Pancakes " kid was included , I 'd love to know . Anyway , Rider pets a wild dog and goes off to wash his bitten hand in a most likely contaminated creek . Another kid likes to drop F - bombs in reacting to everything around him and shoot squirrels . Why ? Your guess is as good as mine!<br /><br />Rider Strong is the ONLY kid with any recognition in this movie . He tries to calm people down in - between the yelling and screaming and F * * * Y * * ! bombs that people are throwing around . When the kids are n't yelling , they are having or talking about sex or talking nonsense to the other adult characters who are EVEN MORE ( if that is possible)idiotic than the kids ! The idiot cop with an IQ of 60 at best may be one of the WORST acting jobs I have ever seen in a movie . You talk about people not playing with a full deck , this dork does n't even know how to find the cards ! LOL ! I was like , " Will you PLEASE shut up already ? ! " He makes the kid actors look like geniuses ! The only part that I sort of liked was Rider 's scary story ( although gory ) about the deranged bowling alley guy . In interviews , Rider said that he had a great deal of respect for director Eli Roth . But the problem is that Mr. Roth appears to be going for little more than shock and gore . There are far too many bad things about this movie for Mr. Roth to get any credit . I wish I could agree with Rider and find something likable about this movie . Maybe the fall scenery in the beginning ? Actually , Rider Strong JUST saves this movie from being a 1 ! Hopefully , he was compensated for this junk !
0 I had heard some bad things about Cabin Fever almost as much as I heard the cultish hype . As it turns out , the first film from the new impresario Eli Roth , it 's just a so - so effort with the IQ points dropping as the film progresses . There are worse movies out there , and surely more gory ones ( while I 'm not sure how the hype - meter got so high on the blood - count for Hostel , there is a good amount for genre fans here ) . The premise is n't necessarily bad either though : kids go to a cabin for a week of partying , only to come across a very sick man , covered in blood , whom in a panic they set on fire . He winds up dead in the water that feeds the reservoir , and soon the characters all succumb to the flesh - eating virus one way or another . The characters , either the lead college kids ( including Rider Strong as the hero and James DiBello as the goofy side - bar ) or the supporting ' village ' folks are archetypal to the point of inertia , if not painfully so . < br /><br />As they meet their fates , the townspeople get pretty weird , and it just seems to be non - sensibly thrown together without the many laughs ; ' Pancakes kid ' comes out of nowhere , and maybe might have been funnier in another movie or by itself , but in the context of the rest of the movie , it just does n't work . There 's also a young police character who is even dumber and less convincing than the others . And the family that goes after DiBello following an incident has some possibilities that are n't realized . But all the while , Roth pumps up his script with common sense out the window and sudden scares and frights with people hacking up blood on one another and a killer dog rambling around . Which is n't all for not either . Now , unlike lesser Troma horror movies or even lesser ones of the 70s or 80s- to which I 'm sure Roth is a die - hard fan- he does n't make it unwatchable . It 's also smart to not have any explanation for where the virus comes from . < br /><br />But unlike those films too , he also does n't really have a fine idea of what makes for great campy - horror times . His film tries for that , of course , and only once or twice does he make it a goofy , bloody time ( I did like the random bunny Strong sees while on the gurney ) . It 's not even very poorly shot a lot of the time ( albeit with its own contrived style - choices ala red tint on the lens or that story with the bowling - alley worker ) . It simply contains a lot of illogical scenarios and choices made ( shave your legs with a deadly virus , uh - huh ) , and it aims for fairly typical ground . If that 's your cup of tea , more power to you . But at the end I found it to be actually un - exceptional genre territory that does n't offend audience sensibilities ala Saw , but does n't swing for the fence either as a clever B - movie . Roth also has the temerity to end the movie on a true note of ' what - the - hell ' as the Santa Claus bearded convenience store clerk from earlier in the film serves a bunch of black people . It could work if he followed up on it with something better , or if he dropped it altogether . Same could be said for a lot of the movie . C-
0 Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth . Roth and Randy Pearlstein co wrote the script from a story by Roth.this a zombie film , which owes a lot to George Romero and his earlier " living dead movies",and to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot to mention Sam Ramie 's " Evil Dead".there is nothing original here , and the story is not compelling.the acting is about par with this genre , it 's just that the story fails.we have pretty much seen this movie before and better made.having said that , after having achieved commercial , if not artistic success from this movie , Roth decided he was a director and came out with the abysmally atrocious , mean spirited , pointless(though much more ambitious)crap fest Hostel . Roth should have quit while he was behind . Cabin Fever is not a good film , however compared to Hostel it is a work of art . I hope somebody ( preferably a psychiatrist)convinces this guy that film - making is the wrong career choice.as for Cabin fever , a weak 3/10 for not being as abysmal as Hostel .
0 The first five minutes of this movie showed potential . After that , it went straight from something possibly decent to some sort of illegitimate comedy . The best part is that I could n't stop thinking of Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern . I would recommend watching this movie for the sheer fact of learning how not to make a movie . There are so many scenes in this movie that makes one just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped caring at some point . The thing that amazes me most about this movie is that it grossed $ 22 million in the box office and only cost about $ 1.5 million to make . Congrats to Lion 's Gate for being able to pull that one off .
0 There 's a major difference between releasing an original , intense , edge - of - your - seat , scary , gore - fest , and doing like filmmaker Eli Roth and his team have done with " Cabin Fever " and simply acted like it . The film follows five college graduates into a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after the other succumbs to this mysterious , fast - acting , flesh - eating disease . It 's not long before the friends turn on one another , and can barely stand the sight of one another , much less want to be in the same vicinity as them . As gross as it all sounds , there 's a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked , in the hands of a less cocky filmmaker . Unfortunately what we end up with is poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting , a hackneyed script so profanity - laden as to leave the viewer tuning out the dialogue , and several incomprehensible subplots that motivate little more than ( in one instance ) an on - screen appearance by director Roth . This is sloppy film - making in several ways ! Avoid this time devourer .
0 This film is about a group of five friends who rent a cabin in the woods . One of the friends catches a horrifying flesh - eating virus . Suddenly , the friends turn on one another in a desperate attempt to keep from contracting the disease themselves.<br /><br />"Cabin Fever " is a horrible film . For one , it tries to be many genres at once . Is it supposed to be a homage , a slasher , a black comedy , or a scary movie with unintentional comedy ? Nobody can tell . There 's a serious scene at first and a second alter , it turns funny . When the film tries to be funny , the humor is quite bland , excluding the ending . I liked the ending a lot.<br /><br />But apart from the ending , I was pretty disappointed and disgusted . The violence is cringe - worthy , more looking away from the screen than being scared . The tone changes within each scene , sometimes funny , sometimes scary , and sometimes quite random . In fact , you see a girl doing karate in slo - motion . What are we supposed to get from that ? This same girl would bite one of the characters . Was that supposed to be funny ? I do n't know.<br /><br />Some of the performances were decent , and many were quite amateurish . I did n't care for most of the characters . I liked the plot but the execution was done horribly . As a horror film , I did n't know what it was trying to be . I did n't find it funny , tense , nor scary . By the end , you 're left indifferent , thinking , " What have I just been through ? " Unfortunately , you 'll never know the answer to that question .
0 Sure I 've seen bad movies in my life , but this one was so bad that I actually became angry in the theater . I wanted my money back . I wrote to the director asking him to refund my movie ticket , of course I did n't receive a refund ( or even a reply ) but it 's the point that matters . On a scale of 1 - 10 I give this movie a -42 . Why did the " Jeep " ( Chevy Blazer ? ? ) stop running from being hit with a bat ? Why did they hit the " Jeep"(Chevy Blazer ? ? ? ? ? ) with the bat in the first place instead of cracking the bum 's skull ? The plot was thin , the movie filled with obvious clich√©s , and certain parts of it just did n't make any sense .
0 no redeeming qualities can possibly be expressed . i wish i could get my time back . nice skull face broad really smiles , bright at the camera when the disease has already wreaked enough havoc on the ill informed script . i was ( ( spoiler ) ) happy to see all the characters dead or severely incapacitated by the end , especially the party poopers that drink the tainted juice on their way to the alleged sunset . Eli Roth does shine for moments of maybe ten , putting forth the theory on how well weed smokes in the woods when others really fiend on top of beer consumption . overall , i found most of it pointless , though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity , happy to witness the demise of cast , in a way though , wishing that journey never happened ( probably should 've been getting laid instead of watching TBS late night , ugh ) .
0 From the opening dialog and scenes , I knew I knew I was in for a train wreck . Did n't want to look , but could n't turn away . If it were n't for the meer eye candy of this film , I would have given one star . The fact that the interaction between characters and relationship behavior were so far fetched , added by poor direction and horrible story make this movie nothing more than a low - budget disaster . Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good film . But this movie fails so horribly there was no chance to rebound.<br /><br />If you were stuck out in the woods , your childhood best friend dying from an unknown disease , other friends dying around you , stranded in a strange place , what would you do?<br /><br />A. ) Run away from everyone and try your luck on your own . B. ) Have sex with your friends girlfriend . C. ) Take a hot bath to relax your sorrows to include shaving your legs . D. ) Bash in the head your childhood best friend and life - long crush with a shovel . E. ) All of the above.<br /><br />According to Eli Roth , none of these answers are that far fetched . In fact , all are plausible and well represented in Cabin Fever . The total lack of reality and illogical attempt at explaining what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film in the bonehead bin at your local rental store . Stay away . Stay far away .
0 Columbo movies have been going downhill for years , this year it may have reached the bottom . Peter Falk gives the same uninspired performance and comes over as creepy in this movie . As is usual in this series , crime scene protocols are unheard of so plausibility is always lacking . Brenda Vaccaro chews the scenery and pulls pantomime faces and Andrew Stephens is a pretty unconvincing lady 's man . ( His faint , though , was a hoot!)The script was by the numbers and its delivery patronising . They should never have brought Columbo into the nineties , just left us all with one or two happy memories of clever plots , better scripts and sharp characterisations .
0 Well , finally got to see the remake last night in London , unintentionally hilarious , sexless and devoid of any real humour . I do n't really know where to start , whilst I was entertained by this strange homage , it did n't really move me . The acting is screamingly hammy , there is no original music , the costumes are far too ' Disney ' there is a ridiculous ' six months later ' insert after the burning of Nic Cage ( which did n't come soon enough for my liking ) The bit with Cage in the bear suit had the audience suppressing mirth as did the comedy punching out of various ' baddies ' on the island . It 's such a weird remake that I ca nt quite believe I saw it , it reminded me of something that The Comic Strip presents would have done in the eighties , a bit like their Hollywood interpretation of the Miner 's Strike , very strange !
0 OK , so I am an original Wicker Man fan and I usually do n't like British films remade by Americans , so why oh why did I put myself through the most painful cinema experiences ever ? I am not a Nicolas Cage fan and I had some kind of moment of madness perhaps ? The film was appalling ! The bit at the beginning with the crash / fire had no relevance to the film at all and the female cop knew where Edward was going , so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the mainland , well it would n't have happened as the whole thing would have been investigated . The history behind the wicker man was n't really explored - and I guess being set in America did n't really help the whole pagan theme . This film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense . I must say that the best bit was right at the end , when Nicolas Cage goes up in flames ! I am in such desperate need to see the original again now , in order to cleanse my disappointed soul . I really ca n't stress how disappointing this film is , please do n't see it if you:<br /><br />A ) Do n't like American re - makes of British Films B ) Are a fan of the original C ) Hate Nicolas Cage
0 If Edward Woodward was the the flicks watching this film then that 's what he would scream out in horror . < br /><br />I'm sorry folks but enough 's enough . We had Get Carter , The Italian Job , Alfie and now this . What 's the similarities ? No . It 's not exactly a coincidence that three of the originals star Maurice Micklewhite and the other stars another great British actor . The main common ingredient in those originals IS the britishness of the films . They were n't made to impress Hollywood . They were quirky English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that just can not be replicated in the USA . The word is CULT and what better way to destroy a cult film than to bastardise it with a remake or even a sequel . < br /><br />Wicker 06 had a tough task before it even hit the road . Wicker 73 is even more enigmatic that other said cult films ; it defies genre , intelligent scripts , A - grade actors , the music score , set - pieces that defy description and all the stories surrounding the film.<br /><br />So here comes a remake . Do n't worry . No originals were harmed in the making of this remake . Some major aspects of the story needed to be reworked for the modern USA - communications , paganism , virgins . But that 's just about the whole premise . So we give the cop a Nam style trauma past complete with shock music flashbacks for the cheap scares . Then with no mobile phone mast on the island that sorts the communication out - but in the real world this would n't happen . Cops just do n't go missing . Give him a blood link for motivation rather than the clash of beliefs and you have the remake . Wafer thin though , is n't it?<br /><br />It 's just that it was all laid on with a trowel . The name alterations were simply hammy , almost Carry On , there was no sense of community on the island , no centre of town to catch your bearings , just a few houses dotted about a forest and that was it . Willow was just annoying by not giving out any info at all and Cage was useless to let her get away with it . When he went into the well you just knew he would get locked it . The screenplay was signposted all the way to the end - and you just wanted it to hurry up and end . The epilogue was absolutely hilarious and did n't know when to stop . < br /><br />That ending is probably the best way to summarise the difference between the two . One ends in the most beautiful sunset after the most horrific day . The other ends with a post - production explain - it - all - to - the - thickies type conclusion.<br /><br />I loved the original but went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to see the film . I left thankful in the knowledge that this film will probably end up beneath a highway somewhere only this time mercifully forgotten forever .
0 Sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness . I remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re - release of The Excorcist ¬Ö  really nervous laughter . It punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of Satan coming out of a 12 year old girl . In the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic The Wicker Man however , it made me think that this new Wickerman is about as scary as the South Park character , Scuzzlebut , the friendly forest monster with TV 's Patrick Duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who 's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets.<br /><br />3 years ago a friend of mine in Hollywood told me that he heard that Nicolas Cage was going to do a remake of the film . I started laughing and my friend ( Keith ) got mad at me touting Nicolas Cage as a great actor . I just did n't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers I was right . Gone is the realness , the outstanding original music , the originality , the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue . Instead we have horror movie clich√©s , affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart . Like many of the countless Hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground " playing Wickerman".<br /><br />The original film takes place on a remote Scottish Isle where a Scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named Rowan Morrison . In the new spin a California cop ( Cage ) is lured to an island of the coast of Washington state by his ex - girlfriend to find her missing daughter . She sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago . The crash still haunts him in part because the girl 's body was never found . Yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north , alone , to help his ex - girlfriend find her daughter . He arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of Wiccans , many of whom seem like they did n't get call backs for roles in The Village . And like The Village it is n't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here . Not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison.<br /><br />I think that the opportunity in Hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry . I think someone like Nicolas Cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks . We needed a bad re - make of the Wickerman like we needed yet another ' 9 - 11 ' movie . I 'm starting to wonder if Nicolas changed his surname from Coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so .
0 Waitress : Honey , here 's them eggs you ordered . Honey , like bee , get it ? That 's called pointless foreshadowing.<br /><br />Edward Basket : Huh ? ( On the road ) Basket : Here 's your doll back , little girl . You really should n't be so careless with your belongings.<br /><br />Little girl : Yeah , whatever.<br /><br />Crash ! Boom ! Whoosh !

I think something bad is about to happen . EEEEE !
0 I 'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this . I could n't believe the other reviews and I thought it should n't be bad to watch it at least once ... but trust me , it is.<br /><br />I have n't seen the old movie .. but why would they want to remake a movie like this . The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic . This film does n't fall under any of those and just remains dumb . I just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point , but it never does . < br /><br />So this movie is a big no no for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans . You could probably for it show up on television .
0 It 's unfortunate that you ca n't go any lower than one star . Prior to watching The Wicker Man , I had considered Aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually merit negative stars . In all fairness , The Wicker Man does n't detract from the enjoyment of an earlier film , but the fact remains that my cumulative movie enjoyment has been reduced by seeing it.<br /><br />There is a cheap trick all too often used in Hollywood when the producers are too stingy to hire good writers or in too much of a hurry to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion : slap in a shocker ending and hope that the public will mistake it for something artistic or meaningful . It is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case manages only to splatter embarrassment on a fine actor and ridicule upon the producers . Even more so in that the " carefully crafted " ( or however they put it ) conclusion did n't seem to follow logically from the plot ( which naturally I ca n't elaborate on without introducing spoilers ) , and instead negates what merit the plot had up to that point.<br /><br />It is a film that might logically appeal to psychopaths , pedophiles , and possibly die - hard Nicholas Cage fans , but only to a few of the mainstream audience . If you really want something along these lines , I heartily recommend M. Night Shyamalan 's The Village instead . Lacking some kind of memory - erasing pill , I suppose I need to watch something better to force it from my mind , say , Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or Pee - wee 's Big Adventure ?
0 First this movie was not that bad . It was entertaining ... at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons . I have never seen the original so ca n't compare the two.<br /><br />This movie reminded me of that weird Christopher Reeve movie Village of the Damned . THe two movies have different plots , but that creepy disgusted feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both.<br /><br />The wicker man is suppose to be a mystery / thriller / men please do n't anger the women movie . I do n't know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little off.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage , his glorious bad self goes to a secluded Island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long lost fianc√©e who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow islanders . < br /><br />Cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi uncharted island leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone who is located in the real world . Stupid.<br /><br />Things get weirder when the large Amish - esquire women who populate the island snarl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl . His fianc√©e is no help who seems to be elusive and weary the whole time . Cage stays on the Island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the islands sick harvest festival.<br /><br />In this movie males do not fare so well . A sick twisted display of feminism ? < br /><br />I found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit . I think there were too many potholes in this movie . I find the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining , but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird . While most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of sexism . I would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were reversed . This movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice . It is NOT a thriller it should be categorized as just strange .
0 A trooper is on the side of the road making sure every1 is obeying the speed limit ( doing his job ) ; he then pulls over a woman who appears she is a mother ( there is a child in the back seat ) ; he then is telling her what is wrong and BAM ... they get killed . Okay , this is the start of what i personally thought would have been a good movie . When I was watching this movie in the theatre I was with some friends . This was our first night out after the summer so we wanted to go and see a good movie . We all decided to see a suspense / thriller that looked good to everyone in the group ... this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life . Not only did I waste $ 7.oo on a movie ticket , but I had to sit through torture for the brain . This movie started off with mystery and suspense and I seriously thought " this ca nt be bad" ... I was so wrong . The whole problem with this movie is that it makes no sense ; even if you can get passed the bad acting , the " not so scary " storyline , and the over all horrible mess this movie was , you will still be puzzled . It 's not because you 're not smart enough to understand it , it 's because no human with a brain could comprehend what this stupid movie is about . Right now you may be thinking " Oh man ! I have to watch this movie just to see if it 's as bad as this person says it is " . GET THAT THOUGHT OUT OF YOUR HEAD RIGHT NOW ! ! ! I 'm trying to save you the trouble of watching this movie by telling you that it is so bad that there is no point in even considering seeing it . Please people do n't make the same mistake i did thinking that this movie has potential ... it does n't . I give this movie 1 out of 10 ( if I could give a zero I would ) , and I do not recommend anyone to ever see this movie , you 'll be saving yourself many sleepless nights trying to think w.t.f . that freaking movie is about .
0 This movie is suppose to be a mysterious , serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl . However , 30 minutes into the movie , it turns into a funny , unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes . I ca n't imagine anyone not laughing when Cage randomly Karate kicks that blonde girl or when he " bear " punches that old lady . The lines , characters , and acting are all poorly done from the get - go . I 've always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor , but he has made some terrible movies this year ; this being by far the worst one ( yet ... ).<br /><br />I would n't recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense story - gripping thriller . If you really want to enjoy this story , go rent the original . However , if you intend on watching it , get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously ; that 's the only way you enjoy this film .
0 great mystery , but the film goes down hill from there . The beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer , Edward . He is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills . A mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter . So Ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman . They do n't like outsiders . A lot of filler is with Ed shown looking around town for the girl . That made the movie too long . It finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for Edward.<br /><br />Overall , not a well written story and too long . < br /><br />FINAL VERDICT : I would skip this .
0 The Wicker Man , starring Nicolas Cage , is by no means a good movie , but I ca n't really say it 's one I regret watching . I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie , like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where Cage is looking for the girl , has a hallucination , followed by another hallucination , followed by a dream sequence- with a hallucination , etc . , but it 's just not worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this . Instead , here 's five reasons why you SHOULD watch The Wicker Man , even though it 's bad : < br /><br />5 . It 's hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it , the only problem is in its cheesy , unintentionally funny execution . If nothing else , this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film , or even read the short story on which it is based.<br /><br />4 . For a cheesy horror / thriller , it is really aesthetically pleasing . It 's pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets , so we get to see some very great scenery . There are also many nicely composed shots . It is a very good looking movie.<br /><br />3 . Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a force of nature . Whether you 're a fan of his or not , it seems as if it 's impossible for Cage to play a " normal guy " . There is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays , and personally , I am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does . Whether Nicolas Cage is great or terrible , he always brings his unique energy into play , and he is never boring to watch . He is terrible in The Wicker Man , but in the most wonderful kind of way.<br /><br />2 . A student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie , as it seems to be the strongest anti - feminist movie ever made . " See ? " you could write , " this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society ! " Also , the similarities between this " Summersisle " society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting.<br /><br />1 . If you 're reading this , there 's probably a good chance you may have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular : a collection of " highlights " from the movie , including Cage running around in a bear suit , and of course , the infamous " AAGHH ! ! THE BEES ! ! MY EYES ! ! ! " line . These scenes are hilarious out of context , and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the film 's entirety.<br /><br />I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about 5 dollars ... when you work that out , it 's about a dollar per reason . It 's a pretty good deal.<br /><br />NOTE : The Unrated version of the movie is the best to watch , and it 's better to watch the Theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue , which features a cameo from James Franco .
0 Where oh where to begin in describing the comprehensive wretchedness of Neil LaBute 's latest attempt at film making ? < br /><br />There are many kinds of film fans out there , but by far the most annoying and shallow is Mr. Intriguing . You know Mr. Intriguing , do n't you ? < br /><br />He 's the fellow that no matter how stupid , lame , and incomprehensibly dull a film is , he says " Gee , I do n't know why everyone hated it , I found it intriguing . " He 's the kind of guy who finds the scent of dog poop intriguing . Especially when he smears it in the shape of a Hitler mustache on his upper lip and marches about the house ranting about the brilliance of science fiction that features thinly veiled references to Greek mythology . He 's also the guy this version of The Wicker Man was made for . No one else could stand it .
0 I watched this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well , I found it strange and completely pointless ... so I decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it . Wow . what a difference . The original one was way better . I 'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement , it 's existence did have a purpose . It was really the Christian public expressing their fear of paganism . If you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but I do n't want to go into details , just , simply put , if you were disappointed and you 'd like to know what it SHOULD look like , feel free to watch the 70s version , a little dated , but A lot better .
0 And I thought The Beach was bad , with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time , Nicolas Cage . Do n't blame him for the awful script , if any one can make any sense of what the hell was the point of that movie , give your self a pat on the back . Its a cross between The Village and a crappier script . Its starts off kinda catching your eye , and then as it goes further into the plot , it just makes no sense , and do n't get me started about the ending ! ! ! ! What was that ? The only thing that makes this movie exist is Nicolas Cage usual great humor , and his ability to be funny in the weirdest situations . If you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch , save yourself five bucks and just go back home and turn put some thing on fire and when some ones asks you why , just say the stupidest thing that comes into your mind , and there you go !
0 I 'd like to start off by saying that I am NOT an anime fan ( with a few notable exceptions ) , and I generally have a low opinion of so - called otakus , as they are so in love with their particular brand of cartooning that they label every movie starring spiky - haired , big - eyed characters as a work of art without even considering other more vital factors , such as the plot . And no anime movie better represents this division between otakus and people with actual taste than this elegant piece of trash , Fatal Fury : the Motion Picture.<br /><br / > As seen through the glassy , witless eyes of an otaku , there 's little to find fault with in Fatal Fury-- there 's plenty of quirky Japanese - y humor , one - on - one duels , some " dramatic " moments , and everything is beautifully drawn . But everyone else will be turned off by the cliched , predictable plot with cliched , predictable characters , culminating in a cliched , predictable ending . The love scenes are hilariously overblown-- the scene in which Sulia " heals " Terry is obviously intended to be a tender moment , but it 's virtually impossible to not be thrown into spirals of giddy laughter by the sheer ludicrousness of it . And of course , Fatal Fury is not without the obligatory cartoon T&A-- this is supplied gratuitously by the huge - breasted Mai Shiranui . And since Fatal Fury IS based off the video game series of the same name ( oh boy ) , we 're treated to numerous pointless cameo appearances by popular characters with little or no relevance to the plot whatsoever ( they go through all the trouble of introducing Kim early on , only for him to disappear from the movie totally after that point ) . This mess of a movie reaches its climax with the unintentionally farcical final battle , in which all the main characters engage the all - powerful main villain in one - on - one combat in turn . That 's some thing that 's always amused me ... even when battles in animes AREN'T taking place in a tournament , they always happen as if they were , regardless of the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever!<br /><br / > Otakus always rave about how anime movies should be treated as MOVIES as opposed to merely cartoons , and a disturbing portion of those same people love Fatal Fury . So would Fatal Fury have been good if it was n't an anime ? The answer is an emphatic " no"-- all of this movie 's charm , what little of it there is , resides in the actual drawings . Had Fatal Fury not been an anime , it would have been worthy of an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 , if the show was still on the air . That 's the key-- this is nothing more than a laughably bad B - movie in the guise of an anime epic . If you 're a fan of movies so bad that they 're actually entertaining , consider renting Fatal Fury ( or catch it on the Sci - Fi channel ) , as it is definitely one of those . If you 're an otaku , please WAKE UP and realize that a good 90 % of the stuff you 're watching is garbage . As for everyone else , buy a Dreamcast and Fatal Fury : Mark of the Wolves , but do n't even consider seeing this movie .

0 A mummy narrates vignettes about men , women , and the sex between them . Huh ? At the beginning , the mummy randomly asks the viewer , " Imagine having sex with this girl . Imagine having sex with this boy " about 37 times , while flashing pictures of half naked mod youths . Later , said mods boys pelt mod girls with ... vegetables ? If you ignore ( or fast forward ) through the mummy 's rambling , the shorts are n't bad in their own right . I found a few of them rather funny . My personal favorite is one where the sexually - confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard sits on the bed . This is one , well , bizarre movie .
0 The film had some likable aspects . Perhaps too many for my taste . It felt as though the writer / director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of ALL of its characters . Not once , a few times ... but all of the time . < br /><br />This is the job of television , not cinema . < br /><br />The location of the train station was well chosen and I enjoyed Sascha Horler 's performance as the pregnant friend . < br /><br />I felt as though Justine Clarke 's performance was wan . Her reactions to things felt forced , as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist 's expressions . I also ca n't believe that a director can make the wonderful Daniela Farinacci into an unbelievable presence . < br /><br />I can not understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences . This is a lazy device , especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and/or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest . < br /><br />That said , there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the Australian heat and local attitude with originality . It does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine . Especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity , infusing it with passion and hand - crafted charm . < br /><br />I am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked . " Who knows if there 's a god ? Like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do " or whatever the line was . < br /><br />Perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife " I 'm giving up smoking . " < br /><br />An anti - smoking commercial ? A TAC ad with some tasteful animation ? I had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark -- it was all too much .
0 Something I really love about this woman 's short films was the elusiveness of theme -- especially in " Living with Happiness . " This film has some nice beginnings -- unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment , but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue , patchy performances and very television coverage.<br /><br />It 's once again charming television and very ordinary cinema . The ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial . But the sentiment is good so we ca n't complain too much.<br /><br />I really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who does n't demand so much boring clarity .
0 This is , ostensibly , a movie about multiple grief . As such , it ought to move viewers and make them empathetic with the plight of the main characters . However , its irritatingly postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible . The camera continually switches from one scene to another , from one personal crisis to the next , creating a choppy , disjointed effect . Most characters appear to live aimless , unstructured lives , held together by their professional commitments . ( It also stretches credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a likely death sentence , would cheerfully indulge in a sex romp with a woman he has just met ) . The storyline ( if there is a storyline ) is difficult to follow . In sum , the overall effect is rather disappointing . In spite of all that , the acting is generally good and some of the scenes are quite powerful .
0 I found this movie boring , monotonous and quite uninteresting with a hurried , shallow " upbeat " ending that did n't ring true to the overall story . Following these characters through a weekend of awful events , unfriendly attitudes and bad news just is n't my idea of a watchable , interesting movie and I got very tired of its " one note " theme and could n't wait for it to end -- in fact I almost stopped about halfway through . The whole movie just seemed pointless and wandering , and the characters were for the most part depressing and unpleasant , though the acting was good . A small movie with small ambitions and small appeal -- sorry , but it just did n't make it with me , and I love good , small films ! This one just did n't jell , though I kept watching it hoping and trusting that it would . I was disappointed , especially after two local reviewers put it on their " Year 's 10 Best " list . I 'd strongly recommend watching " The House of Sand " instead -- now there 's a good , small film !
0 Bruce Lee was a great martial artist , but this film still is probably one of the worst films ever made . It has Bruce Lee die as the result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a ninja knife to the back of the neck but it does n't explain how he came to be on a helicopter since the prior scene has him near but not on the helicopter which is already 200 feet in the air . It just gets downright absurd from then , like something out of a cheap comic book . Maybe the idea is n't so rotten but it is n't done with any degree of artistry from a film making point of view . There are dozens of such martial arts bombers out there , usually all made in Hong Kong . I think that Jean Claude van Dam improved the genre with adding plausible stories in his films and having film makers who know how to use the camera . Even Steven Seagal 's films are way better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk movies made during the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong . ' Game of Death II ' falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion , despite Bruce Lee being in it .
0 This is even worse than the original Game of Death . A jumbled , incoherent storyline leads to " Billy Lo " falling from a helicopter to the ground below , killing him , as we 're left to follow his younger brother , Bobby Lo . So not only do we start out following some Bruce Lee clone , the film kills that one off and has us follow another one thirty minutes into the story . The main reason to watch this one is when Bobby Lo fights a lion , which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume . Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain , who is usually pretty awesome but his screen time is significantly small . Mainly watched this and the original Game of Death because they 're a part of the Bruce Lee boxed set . It 's no wonder they 're included with Lee 's finished works . No one would buy them otherwise .
0 There are so many stupid moments in ' Tower of Death'/'Game of Death 2 ' that you really wonder if it 's a spoof . At times , it felt like I was watching a sequel to Kung Pow rather than a Bruce Lee film.<br /><br />To be honest , this film has bugger all to do with ' Game of Death ' . If anything , it 's more a sequel / remake of ' Enter the Dragon ' , incorporating many elements of that film - particularly the actual footage . Bruce Lee 's character Billy Lo ( apparently ) investigates the sudden death of his friend and encounters a piece of film that was left with the man 's daughter . When the body is stolen during the funeral ( ! ) , Billy is also killed and it 's up to his wayward brother to avenge both men 's deaths.<br /><br />Tong Long stars as brother Bobby Lo and does n't really have the sort of charisma to carry the film . His fighting abilities are very good however . Bruce Lee obviously turns up thanks to ( no longer ) deleted footage simply to cash - in on the legacy . Saying that , on the whole , the footage is actually edited - in better than in ' Game of Death ' but it does n't stop the film from being a mess.<br /><br />OK , so the fights are actually very entertaining ( dare I say mind - blowing ) and make the film at least watchable . But there are so many daft elements to this film that it really tests your patience . First off , there 's the supposed villain who lives on his palatial estate ... or is that mental institution ? Seriously , the nutter eats raw venison , drinks deer 's blood , carries a monkey on his shoulder and owns some peacocks and lions ( ? ! ) . This attempt to make him look tough and intelligent just makes you feel sorry for him - you half expect someone to escort him back to his room.<br /><br />In fact , this middle section is awful and when the scene involving a naked hooker and a lion suit arrived I turned it off . However , I did finish the film and was kind of glad I did because the fight scene towards the end ( much like ' GOD ' ) was the whole reason for watching . While the story is an embarrassment , the action is very good and contains excellent choreography.<br /><br />But even the finale disappoints if the premise was anything to go by . What we were told was that the ' Tower of Death ' was a pagoda that was upside down and underground . This sounded great , like a twist on Bruce Lee 's original idea with different styles of fighting on each level . Could this be the ' Game of Death ' that was originally planned ? No ! The film should have been named " Generator Room of Death " because that s as far as the tower goes . Of yes , there were indeed one or two ' different ' styles ... there were foil clad grunts , leopard - skinned henchman and stupid monk . It 's as though Enter the Dragon had never been made , with the plot being a poor imitation.<br /><br />Worth watching once for the fast paced fight scenes , but so stupid sometimes that it hurts . If this was intended , then fine . Thumbs up , however , for recreating that projector room scene from ' Enter The Dragon ' .
0 This is high grade cheese fare of B movie kung fu flicks . Bruce " wannabe " Lee is played by Bruce Li ... I think . Of course , let 's show quick clips of Bruce and do closeups of his eyes and if you quint at the right angle during a certain time of the day during the winter solstice , it kind of looks like Bruce . You 'll laugh in awe at how the film splicing is n't very good , but some cool deleted scenes from Enter the Dragon are thrown in the mix . According to the movie , Bruce Lee was killed by a dart while hanging from a helicopter . Of course , they think this can excuse Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce even though his character is supposed to be Bruce 's brother ( who for some reason still mimes Bruce 's gestures and fighting style - very POORLY ) . See Bruce go one - on - one with the cowardly lion . The props department stopped by Kay - Bee , you see . Bruce also finds nothing wrong with savagely beating up a crippled man . Towards the end , the director decided " let 's throw a flashback " for a scene just shown 3 minutes ago ! ! They must 've thought that only one - celled organisms with attention deficit disorder could fully understand this film.<br /><br / >
0 In this ' sequel ' Bruce is still called Billy Lo ( get it ? Bruce= Billy , Lo= Lee . No ? ) But apart from that , that 's all it has in common with the other movie . Billy does n't seem to be an actor anymore . He seems to be in another country . He 's more like a spy . He 's the only cast member to return and sadly , they kill him off to make way for a new character , his brother , Bobby . Sadly , when Bruce dies , the movie pretty much dies with him . This was extremely poorly made . It seemed like they were writing the script as they were filming . The footage works for a while ( it 's not too obvious at first ) but soon Bruce is always shown in the dark all the time ( he kicks out a light at one stage for no other apparent reason to hide the fact that it 's not Bruce playing the part ) . Sadly when he dies the movie changes . I ca n't help but wonder if they were filming as they were writing and may well have planned to keep Bruce alive , but later decided to kill him off because it would not have been plausible as Bobby does not appear until Billy is dead . It 's hard to change the lead character halfway in the movie and Bruce is a hard act to follow so it 's hard to now accept Bobby as the star . Bruce is never seen again in this movie . I think they should have made this sequel without Bruce he has a lame role in this movie . People hoping to see a new Bruce Lee movie will be disappointed to see that although he 's given the top billing , he only has a featuring role . Even the worst movies have at least one memorable bit . If there was one bit about this movie people seem to talk about , it 's the scene where Billy fights in a plant nursery . Ironically it does n't even use Bruce Lee footage . Mind you , they did it more convincingly in No Retreat No Surrender . Not one of the other actors here ever made anything else memorable . Bruce 's girlfriend ( Colleen Camp ) is never mentioned . My advice is to turn it off as soon as Bruce is finished writing his letter to his brother . Nothing else in the movie is worth watching . I found it really sad to see Bruce die . I do n't see how a small budgeted movie like this could get enough money to use footage from Enter The Dragon . This was a cheap way of trying to cash in on Bruce 's name . Oddly this and the original are credited in Bruce 's filmography . Thankfully so far , no one has tried anything like this again . 1981 was the year of Bruce 's last movie appearance . It was a sad way to end it , but thankfully this is proof that Bruce 's movie career should be left alone .
0 A handful of critics have awarded this film with positive comments . I do n't wish to argue with their opinion , but I strongly disagree . When I first watched this film I was mildly impressed . But after comparing it with other films , particularly with the late master , Bruce Lee I quickly changed my mind . In fact , if it was n't for the title of the film , I would never have bought it . Game of Death 2 does n't relate to the original Game of Death , ( except it shares one character , Billy Lo.)<br /><br />I was stunned to see how similar Game of Death 2 was compared to Enter the Dragon . The plots have striking similarities : Both Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo are on a mission to avenge a relative . The two locations are similar , in which they both are very isolated and are surrounded by thousands of Blackbelts . There is an element of prostitution in both films ( women are sent two the guests rooms in both films . ) Both Han ( Enter the Dragon ) and Lewis 's henchman have a hand missing . Their is an underground drug operation in Enter the Dragon , believe it or not , there is one in Game of Death 2 . Han has a pet cat in Enter the Dragon , the director has used his imagination and awarded Lewis with a pet monkey ! The list continues . < br /><br />Regarding other aspects of the film , such as the script and the acting , I felt it was very poor . It seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to star in the film and prayed they could act . < br /><br />On a positive scale , I can not deny that the choreography is impressive . Although the fighting sequences have strong elements of acrobatics in them , they are none the less skillfully performed . However , as the plot is insufficient , i could n't relate to the characters , therefore the fighting sequences were more exhibitions rather than having a meaning to the film . < br /><br />In conclusion I would say this film is recommendable to any martial - arts fans , but for those who enjoy a solid action film , with a good storyline and strong characters , I seriously would n't recommend this film . My opinions towards this film may seem very bias and one - sided , but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in the martial arts cinema , particularly after his masterpiece : Enter the Dragon , this film failed to rise to these standards . If anything they imitated a truly brilliant martial - arts film , in hope of achieving the same level of fame . < br /><br />In reference to my evaluation , awarding this film a very harsh 1 out of 10 , the film is barley watchable , and must be thankful that it had the fighting sequences it did .
0 Once again I took a chance and rented this bag of crap . Billed as a horror flick , there was n't one scene , not one , that was even remotely scarey . NOT ONE ! ! Sure there was some nudity , but all the lesbian action got a little old . I guess maybe that was suppose to be this movie 's saving grace ? And Dan , what an annoying ass bag ! ! Right from the beginning I knew I was in for it when good ol' Dan first spoke . And he was suppose to be intimidating ? What a laugh ! ! All in all , this movie is dreadfully awful ! How in the hell do movies like this get made ? If you want a movie with a few thrills in it , do n't rent this one . This movie is about as thrilling as the Teletubbies .
0 Wow ... where to begin ... picked this up at Big Lots for only $ 2.99 . That 's three bucks I 'll never see again ... ever ... and for what ? I 'll tell ya . An hour and fifteen minutes of boring , boring , boring chat and college angst that seemed more suitable for a Lifetime movie than the horror flick advertised on the box . ( May the marketing droids who designed it burn in Hell for all eternity ) . Follow that up with a little bit of cheap gore ( not even good gore mind you ... ) and a plot twist at the end that comes out of nowhere , and makes no sense . Awful , awful , awful ... <br /><br />Was there any redeeming qualities ? Well , on the Joe Bob Briggs scale , there WERE six breasts involved , but that 's hardly worth my long lost three bucks . Without those , this coulda been on Sci - Fi at , say , two or three in the morning ... <br /><br />Bmoviefreak
0 I probably give this more credit than it deserves because it 's Halloween , I was just at " Knott 's Scary Farm " and I was in a mood to watch a really cheesy Halloween movie.<br /><br />Oh , and it only cost me one dollar.<br /><br />Usually I 'll ffwd through a movie like this to get to " the good stuff , " but I resisted the urge here and I 'm still not sure why . It was obvious from the opening shots this was n't a " real " movie , not even a B - movie . It 's more in the category of the DeCoteau " horror " movies like " The Brotherhood " that are shot on film - look video for about 50 cents ( in fact , I was half afraid any minute one of his beefy college boys would stagger out rubbing himself in his underpants or something ) . There were no cutaway shots ( too expensive to do multiple camera setups ) and flat lighting but ... it 's hard to pinpoint . There 's something refreshing about watching a director with no money pull off a half - decent movie . The fact that he 's doing even a half - decent job is commendable , and this movie has it 's share of merits -- the acting is n't bad , the photography is pretty good ( if too bright to be scary ) , there are some surprises , and the whole thing is sort of ... different somehow.<br /><br />A bunch of college kids are ( for some unknown reason ) stuck in the warehouse where they are decorating the annual haunted house . A creepy old man gives them a satanic book and they accidentally summon up the powers of hell . This results in the costumed people in the haunted house becoming who they are made up to be , and causing a lot of mayhem and human suffering . Along the way we are treated to an oddly complex and thoughtful lesbian relationship subplot -- it 's interesting that this couple seems to be the most well - rounded in the movie . Yes , there 's a sex scene but it is n't salacious -- or at least no more so than you 'd find in any legit movie about lesbians that shows them having sex . It 's rather unusual for a horror film to take the time and effort to do this without resorting to cheap exploitation . < br /><br />The other thing about this that held my interest was how it was clearly trying to emulate the " stupid kids have sex and get killed " vibe of the 80 's slashers . It 's hard to take that on because there are so many of those films that already exist , the genre has been done to death . I 'm not sure if it 's good or bad that these filmmakers simply tried to make another entry in that genre , without irony , as if it was still a LIVING genre , but I appreciated the attempt.<br /><br />Which is why I sat through it ; sometimes you just want to watch a mindless , no - budget , " A - for - effort " horror film . There really was too much set up , not enough gore , endless plot - holes , dead - ends and clich√©s and the unfortunate overall feel of a movie that simply did not have enough money behind it to be the film the producers envisioned ... but at the very least the haunted house scenes were pretty cool . I 'd pay to go to that haunted house if it existed , and did n't mind paying a dollar to see it on DVD even if I 'll never watch this again.<br /><br />Oh , and * * possible spoiler * * , but there was great , brief business with the vampire girl in the coffin : " I used to be claustrophobic . But I 've changed . " Ha ha , good one .
0 This movie proves that you ca n't judge a movie by the awesome artwork on the DVD cover . It also goes to show that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it ( or get it for someone at Christmas ) . The beginning of this movie actually looks somewhat promising . Well , until you meet the characters . Pumpkin Jack ( the old guy from down the street ) brings the college co - eds a book full of witch 's spells that he leaves at their annual haunted house ( where the movie takes place ) . After that there is some drinking , fighting , and soft core porn . Then the action of the movie finally takes place after over an hour.<br /><br />Overall , Hallow 's End was predictable , unsuspensful , and reminiscent of a soft - core porn . This movie is probably best viewed with a group of friends who have nothing better to do , as it is a good movie to make fun of . And for first - time viewers , it is really fun making predictions of the order of people who die .
0 * WARNING . THERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS AHEAD , IF YOU CARE.*<br /><br />Okay , the basic premise of this homegrown Texas film is : College kids + spookhouse + evil magic book = scary stuff . In practice , it equals a lot of time looking at the time to see how much longer this movie is going to drag on . A bunch of frat boys , along with assorted girlfriends & volunteers , is setting up a charity haunted house . The project is being presided over by a thoroughly repellent character , whose main purpose seems to be verbally & physically assaulting as many cast members as possible . I had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity : he 's nothing but rude and abusive to everyone , including his girlfriend and his buddy . Regardless , the kids are visited by local character & annual pumpkin - carving champion " Pumpkin Jack " , an elderly coot who is described as the " Santa Claus of Halloween " , and who drops off a load of props for the house , including an ominous book that figured prominently in the irritatingly strobe - flashed prologue(where a gaggle of robed cultists get turned into stir - fry ) . Needless to say , some damn fool starts messing with the book , and eventually most of the costumed monsters turn into real ones , and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive . There 's some good stuff in this film , but not much : everything is shot well , and the makeup effects are decent . On the other hand , the performers either underact , or overact drastically ; much of the plot makes little sense outside of a " this happens so that can happen " series ; there is hardly any musical score to speak of , just snatches of songs throughout the film ; and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere . That last problem is the most telling : two - thirds of the 90 minute running time is used to repeatedly set up the characters . Tom is a nice guy dating Heidi the control freak , but he used to date Jill , who is now dating Dan the jerk , but she 's started a relationship Kira the girl who wears too many shawls / capes . Dan is a really big jerk , Gary likes to play jokes , and Steve & Lily like to have a lot of sex . Stuff that could have easily been dealt with in 20 minutes or so drags on and on , to the point where the lesbian " sex " scene(calm down , it 's pretty tame ) left me looking for the fast forward button . That leaves us with half an hour of lo - calorie scares , a klunky ending and a deep - seated dislike of ol' Pumpkin Jack , who I blame for the whole mess . Unless you can get this on some sort of deep - discount rental(and really have seen everything else in the store ) , put it back on the shelf and keep looking .
0 Horror movies can be a lot of fun with low budgets , bad acting , and a bit of panache . I think the film is just missing panache , because , one thuddingly dull scene after another , people make laughably harmless claw - handed grabs at the air . If it were n't so boring , it might be funny.<br /><br />A horror film can go a long way with a tired concept like " college kids in a haunted house , " in much the same way the Evil Dead movies had a lot of fun with a similar standard plotline . Hallow 's End , unfortunately , does n't go a long way . Actually , it does n't go anywhere . It spends the better part of an hour setting up faceless and anonymous characters with what seem like endless interpersonal drama . I have nothing against character development , not even in a horror movie , but these are strictly one - dimensional characters ( the alpha - male , the milquetoast , the ... um ... throwaway characters that exist mostly for sex scenes . ) Spending forty - plus bloodless , droning minutes with them was more horrific than when the bloodshed started.<br /><br />Well , implied bloodshed anyway . When the college kids turn into whatever they dressed as for their haunted house ( one 's a vampire , one 's wearing O.R. scrubs and some white pancake ) they look pretty much the way they did in their amateur haunted house costumes ; The Dead Hate The Living , using a similar theme , is a masterwork in comparison . There is n't really any gore to speak of , nor are there any real scares.<br /><br />I've thought about this one from almost every approach . If it was supposed to be a tight , suspenseful horror movie ( which would explain why things moved so slowly ) , the pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would invalidate it . If it was supposed to be a genuine blood & guts horror movie ( which would explain the schlock ) ... where 's the blood and guts ? And the anticlimax is one of the unexciting endings to a movie I 've ever seen . It 's the kind of movie that , though it does n't have a narrator through the film , is bookended by voice - overs because all of the meaningless dialogue just was n't enough.<br /><br />This was a hard one ... coming out of it , I wonder if I 've just sat through a christian horror film . Maybe the " I know hell exists " of the opening was n't meant that way , but there are some hints ( or misdirection-- I 'm not sure which ) . For all the profanity in the film , a line like " gosh - darnit " comes off a little absurd , and so does most of the crucifix worshipping , god - fearing , and satan - dreading , especially after some lecherous T&A sex scenes ( one heterosexual , one lesbian).<br /><br />If it a christian company ( Highland Myst 's logo even has a bit of a crucifix resemblance ) , then this film weighs in heavily for the atheist camp . An omnipotent being ca n't be this bad a filmmaker.<br /><br / >
0 * * * One Out of Ten Stars * * * < br /><br />Because if it was , it gets an F. Holy Mother Mary of God was this bad . I mean , I gave it every reasonable accommodation considering it was a straight to video film , but it let me down at every turn . Like so many other B movies , the basic storyline was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources , but the execution was ridiculous . It 's a shame they attached the good name of Halloween to this fiasco.<br /><br />The basic premise surrounds some frat douche bags hosting their annual Halloween haunted house fund raiser , when a satanic spell book shows up out of nowhere and hurls the frat boys into a living hell . Well that 's the idea anyway , but instead most of the film is devoted to displaying these frat boy 's relationship escapades , abound with an outrageous lesbian subplot . Very little of the actual story is devoted to Halloween or the mysterious spell book . It actually makes me mad that the film makers thought they could get away with making such dribble . < br /><br />The film is essentially about frat boy relationships . This IS NOT what the movie is billed as . I 'm tempted to track down the producers and at the very least threaten them with bodily harm . The acting is about as bad as it gets , it 's atrocious ! The script is unintentionally funny . The cinematography is just plain lazy . The whole film is amateur night . This movie actually makes the SyFy channel movie productions look like masterpieces.<br /><br />The last half hour of the film felt like the film makers realized they were n't producing a soap opera and had to throw in some sort of horror sequences . The evil spell book finally comes into play and turns everyone in the haunted house into the character their dressed up as . I almost feel like crying as I write this review . Wow ! I mean wow ! This thing was an undecipherable chopped up disaster .
0 Ya I rented it , so shoot me!<br /><br />A decent premise sets up an otherwise awkward story with no real payoff , but at least it 's shot well . Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of a fake haunted house with real danger inside . In most cases this should be a slam dunk , but this little stinker derails quite quickly . The cinematography is above average and the acting is mediocre at best , but the story and writing is just plain awful . Slower scenes drag on forever and the scares are too few and far in between with no real climax to the film . An eerie mood is set at the beginning but loses it 's luster before any type of horror transpires , and I found myself bored to death and making another sandwich ... The cover art is appealing and I suppose it 's worth a rental if you 're looking for mindless low budget dreck , but if you enjoy a good story and eventful ending , reach for something else .
0 SUcks . That 's all I got to say about this sorry excuse for a film . Sucks . Sucks . Sucks . I mean , what the hell were they thinking ? The idiots involved should never be allowed to make another films . The acting was so bad that it even failed to entertain on a bad level . The attempt at a " lesbian scene " was sad . I felt so bad for the ladies involved . This movie sucks ! Sucks ! Sucks!<br /><br />I heard rumors of a sequel.<br /><br />God < br /><br />Help < br /><br />Us < br /><br />All
0 A low budget effort from Texas that 's at least filmed well , but that is little consolation . Bad acting , or , should I say , bad over - acting , a pretty limp story line that 's nothing new , bad special effects , bad , bad , bad . Seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for Halloween , which is done every year , but this year things are different . Has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spots , of which there are a lot . Putrid , puerile , definitely avoidable , at all costs .
0 What can I say ? I think I have to write " Spoiler alert " and then " reveal " they used the F - word a LOT in this movie - like in every two sentences . I did not like this movie at all - too much hints on sexual perversions , sidesteps and cheating . And that swearing was totally out the window . I gave this movie " 3 " and two of those points are for Mira Sorvino 's sexy movements on the dance floor .
0 I had to walk out of the theater . After an hour , all I was seeing was people cheating on wives , schtupping like dogs in a rut , and using the f - word like a diabetic using Equal.<br /><br />No thanks.<br /><br />It was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot . Any one of the characters could have been quite interesting if they were given more to do than fornicate , talk about it , and swear at each other.<br /><br />The few times that it looked as if there were about to be some sort of character development , all that happened was another sex scene . Plot development in the 1st hour can be summarized as 1)several murders occur , 2 ) Vinnie sees murder scene 3 ) Vinnie stares moodily across Atlantic / East / Hudson River 4 ) Vinnie cheats on wife , and 5 ) Joey ( most sympathetic character in the show ) gets kicked out of his parents ' house . More than that , I did n't wait to see.<br /><br />The photography and the interplay between the characters were superb , but THERE WAS NOTHING for them to DO . The flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting another hour for SOMETHING to happen.<br /><br />Sorry , Spike . Take some lessons from Notting Hill , or Shawshank Redemption . Either one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships .
0 This was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies I 've seen in a very long time . I 've never liked Spike Lee , but thought I 'd give this one a try : bad mistake . The movie is supposed to show how the Son of Sam real life murders affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977 ; what it really did was center around the most boring characters that I doubt anyone cared for as far as their drug problems , marriage problems , and so on , etc . The scenes that depict the murders are just that , and nothing more ; a shooting and then it 's back to Saturday Night Fever ! What 's even more ridiculous is Spike Lee 's choice to show up as a reporter in the movie : Spike , trust me , you 're no Hitchcock , stay out of the movies , it makes them even worse off . The most silly scene had to be the dog speaking in a goofy voice , which was depicted in a scene before it where it was supposed to have been shot ? ? ? Spike , what were you thinking when you made this film ? Not thinking at all is my guess . People who think they 'll see a crime drama , take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser . You 're better off watching Jerry Springer in this case ! Waste of film , I gave it a 1 out of 10 : awful dud .
0 The film is a collection of cliche 's on just about anything out there . It has no focus whatsoever , no goals , no real message . Symbolism is pushed over the top and stereotyping is abundant and outrageous . This movie ca n't resist the temptation of making drama where non exists . Every small exchange of words turns immediately into a lengthy , unjustified dialog that is so typical of an acting class rehearsal . Where there is no substance to this exchange , the actors ( regardless of how good they are normally ) ca n't help but compensate with exaggerated emotion , aka " raising the stakes " . Over acting , to put it simply . The directing is of no help here . Nothing can save this non - story . It is forced , faked and boring to tears . Inaccuracies in portaraying punk rock with The Who , piercings and flashy 90 's outfits . Characters wander without a role , detail and motive . Locations are arbitrary . This is Boogie Nights cum The Good Fellas cum Saturday Night Fever , with meaning and art ripped out.<br /><br />Good DP . I 'll give it that.<br /><br />Some films have flaws . This film is Lee 's flaw . He sold out , like the rest of them . Became irrelevant . He has nothing of interest to say anymore.<br /><br />I have no desire to see anything again from this guy ( whom I 'll refrain from naming from now on ) .
0 " Why?" < br /><br />That simple question had to be on the lips of every single New Yorker during the 12 months of terror that David Berkowitz created in 1976 - 77 . That same one word will surely become the same perplexing question 22 summers later as people exit theaters exhibiting the trite and exploitative " Summer of Sam".<br /><br />Director Spike Lee attempts to weave the story of a pack of misguided thugs searching for the celebrated psychopath -- who paralyzed New York City for over a year -- with a stark and graphical depiction of the killings , the demons inside Berkowitz 's head and the frustration of a futile NYPD manhunt . He presents an ensemble of despicable losers who hear their own " barking dogs " as they live lives devoid of love , honor and humanity -- no different than Berkowitz . Lee browbeats the audience in nearly every frame with " not one of us are what we seem to be " . Often a critic of the white establishment , Lee perpetuates the stereotype by including a scene where Mira Sorvino , playing a newlywed with a cheating husband ( John Leguizamo ) , hopes to have oral sex with a black man " in the back of a big black Cadillac " . An Italian Mafioso tells a black detective that the famous Willie Mays ' over - the - back center field catch was " lucky " . Lee even makes sure to deliver the racist musings of one middle aged black woman who declares " I 'm happy it 's a white man killing all these white people because if it were a black man killing all these white people - there would be the biggest race riot in NYC history." < br /><br />Other than an outstanding opening pan shot of an arrival at a disco ( reminiscent of shots from Martin Scorcese 's " Goodfellas " or Orson Welles ' " The Third Man " ) , this film has no soul , purpose or passion . He parades characters on the screen bereft of human decency . Although we learn nothing about the true victims of this horrible spree , Spike Lee seems to be saying New York City got what it deserved during that frightening , boiling summer over two decades ago.<br /><br />"How could anyone wreak such havoc on his beloved city ? " " How could someone show such hatred toward his fellow man?" < br /><br />Are these appropriate questions for Berkowitz or Lee?<br /><br />You decide .
0 I wish Spike Lee had chosen a different title for his film . " Summer Of Sam " conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer , David Berkowitz . It 's not . It 's a gritty , earthy portrait of NYC street life during the hot summer of ' 77 when Berkowitz terrorized that city.<br /><br />The film follows several young fictional characters in an Italian - American neighborhood , and their reactions to the Son of Sam threat . There 's Vinny and his wife Dionna ; there 's Richie and Ruby , and several other characters.<br /><br />The problem is that these characters are not likable . They are routinely annoying , and at times unbearable . Lee then belabors their high energy , chaotic lives , which are filled with anger , lust , and general turmoil . There are at least two protracted fight scenes between Vinny and his wife , redundant disco dance scenes , countless gabfests ... Over and over I kept wondering : where 's the film editor?<br /><br />Meanwhile , with all that bulk , the film passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread arising from the Son of Sam menace , which is too much in the background . Lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace , that arising from neighborhood vigilante groups.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly good . That , combined with 70 's disco music , and lavish attention to costumes and production design , make you really feel like you are in an Italian - American neighborhood in NYC in 1977.<br /><br />The film 's atmospheric authenticity , however , is not nearly enough to offset a rambling , overblown script about the lives of grossly irritating people .
0 This movie is bad news and I 'm really surprised at the level of big name talent who would ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk as this . I imagine there were a few strangled agents sprawled across Hollywood Blvd . as a result of this fiasco . What really gets you is that it could have been good . The directors star appeal and the subject matter was sufficient fodder to spark interest and ticket sales , but this is a flop . The multiple story lines all go from bad to silly by the pictures end , and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten . What Spike is able to achieve is revenge against any Italians who may have beat him up when he was a kid or insulted him , as the movie does quite a number on perpetuating outdated and probably offensive Italian stereotypes . As with any Spike Lee film there is some really thought provoking and magical camerawork . He does have the gift of grabbing your psyche and transporting you into his vision if only for a few memorable scenes . But the question remains ... can you endure the other 2 hours of head scratching and clock watching as you wonder and wait for the ending that has to be there somewhere .
0 Good actors and good performances ca n't mask a pointless script , bad dialogue , and patterns of behavior spiraling into nothing you 'd care about . The most interesting character is David Berkowitz . No character development - no growth , no interest , just some suffering for no particular reason , teaching us nothing and not even bothering to entertain .
0 This long winded film turns out to be less about Berkowitz and his effect on NYC , but more about painting caricatures of a certain group of Italian - Americans , known locally as " Guidos . " The problem is that " Guidos " are uninteresting , no matter what kind of story or setting they are immersed in . They are already living caricatures , so Lee only amplifies them , rather than simply portraying them.<br /><br />When someone has a caricature done of themselves , they do n't go home and say , " Hey , let 's make the ears and nose even bigger ! " That 's what Lee has done in this film . The most interesting characters in the film are the two ( Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito ) who wish to escape the " Guido " lifestyle . Top it off with an uninteresting storyline for the characters , particularly John Leguizamo 's , and you get a nice film to fall asleep by . Especially considering it 's lengthy run time.<br /><br />One more strike against it : For someone proclaiming to be a Yankees fan , and has grown up in New York , Spike Lee should know how to spell Phil Rizzuto , which is spelled incorrectly in the closing credits .
0 I 'm afraid that I have to disagree with the majority . I found Spike Lee 's latest a wee bit boring ! Although he was trying something different , i.e. not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer , I do n't think it worked too well.<br /><br />There 's really a bit too much going on - Vinny ( John Leguizamo ) and Dionna 's ( Mira Sorvino ) relationship , Ritchie 's ( Adrien Brody ) lifestyle and then the local mafia types . The story is good , but at the end that s all you have - 2 or 3 stories . With such a provocative killer could Mr Lee not have put more into that side of the film ? > < br /><br />There are some good points though . All scenes with the ' Son of Sam ' killer David Berkowitz look very nice ( colour saturation etc ... )and the acting is pretty good throughout.<br /><br />Overall I felt that the different stories would of worked well on their own or else without the killings . It just was n't strong enough in the end.<br /><br / >
0 Before I give Spike Lee 's mess of a film SUMMER OF SAM a well - deserved thrashing , I would like to make one thing clear . I do not revile this film simply for its abundance of sleazy and unpleasant images . What makes this film so unwatchable is the fact that Lee seems to believe that SUMMER OF SAM should be taken seriously as a socially enlightening drama . The crime caper films of Quentin Tarantino , for example , are filled with violence , profanity , and other sleaze , but are nonetheless highly watchable because Tarantino does not attempt to pass these films off as socially redeeming works of art . He knows that such films are for entertainment value only . On the other hand , serious dramas such as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and SCHINDLER 'S LIST are often unpleasant to watch , but the unpleasantness serves to develop the film 's plot and characters , with the end goal of getting the audience emotionally involved with the story and characters onscreen . SUMMER OF SAM , unfortunately , merely wallows in its own sensationalism and sleaze , while believing that it is serving as social commentary , much like other trash epics .<br /><br />SUMMER OF SAM does not serve as a serious drama because its characters are merely cardboard - cutout stereotypes . Its plot purports to show the emotional impact of the hysteria over the Son of Sam murders on the residents of the predominately Italian - American north Bronx neighborhood where the murders ocurred . However , instead of of presenting the locals as a diverse mix of personalities , Lee simply wheels out every negative Italian stereotype imaginable . The men are ignorant , lazy , oversexed goombahs . The women are split between weak , complacent " good girls " ( Mira Sorvino 's Dionna ) and promiscuous " bad girls " ( Jennifer Esposito 's Ruby ) . Lee seems to vindictively wants to " payback " Hollywood for their years of negative African - American stereotyping by wheeling out stereotypes of his own , and few critics seem to care . If Martin Scorsese , for example , presented residents of an African - American neighborhood as a bunch of Amos ' n Andy and Aunt Jemima stereotypes , critics would rightfully condemn such blatant stereotyping . More importantly , one - dimensional , stereotypical characters undermine any film that attempts to be a serious social commentary.<br /><br />Without exception , the cast of SUMMER OF SAM is excellent . However , the acting , for the most part , is uninspired . The cast is either just going through the motions , or they have little to work with scriptwise . Additionally , there is notable miscasting . Comedian John Leguizamo is very talented , but his Vinny character seems to be a stale , comedic impersonation of John Travolta 's Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER . And Michael Badalucco , a perennial " nice guy " actor , is badly miscast as serial killer David Berkowitz , coming across as funny rather than frightening . The only performance worth paying attention to is Adrien Brody as the troubled , but sincere , neighborhood misfit Ritchie . The Brody performance and the typically stylish Lee cinematography are this film 's only virtues.<br /><br />*1/2 out of * * * *
0 I have always liked Spike Lee 's movies , but this one was a total waste of 2 1/2 hours . I expected more about Son of Sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the 1977 serial killings . The talking dog was laughable ( you know you 're in trouble when all the movie patrons burst into laughter inappropriately ) . The whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very interesting . The sex scenes were totally irrelevent to the plot . I 'm not opposed to sex in movies , but it should have some point ( unless it 's a XXX movie ) . All in all , we were very disappointed at this Spike Lee effort ! !
0 I went to this movie expecting a concise movie relating the effect the Son of Sam had on the society . I did n't expect Spike Lee to force - feed me more garbage on racial tension , mob - justice , or the inability of the common citizen to make a choice under pressure by peers . Lee has presented an extreme opinion.<br /><br />The entire movie could have been more effective if in a 90-min format with more focus , less tangential sub - plots.<br /><br />Don't even bother renting the video unless you passionately enjoy Spike Lee ; in such a case , the theatre is worth it . This is not an escapist movie .
0 Spike lee has to be one of the most over rated directors I have ever seen . He is the critic 's darling because he supposedly makes films with a " message " or he is just so bohemian in his approach that it makes critics that are waterlogged from formula Hollywood films eat his stuff up just for being different.<br /><br />Summer Of Sam does not even do that well . The cinematography and editing style is Oliver Stone , and so is the narrative . The plot is a lot like " Do The Right thing " . The portrayal of " Guidos " or for the PC set Italian - Americans ( of which I happen to be one ) is straight out of Eddie Murphy 's Raw . Only Eddie Murphy 's impression of a macho Italian guy picking a fight with a much taller African - American is much , MUCH more believable than the cartoonish , broad Italian caricatures shown here ( the John Leguizamo character being a possible exception).<br /><br />Is there anybody who saw this movie that could not figure out how it was going to end up ? As soon as Richie came into the film I could already see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach , I could already see him being accused of being the killer . This character had the most integrity in the whole film so , of course , Lee is going to show what happens to people that stand out in a crowd ( what a white bearded clique!)<br /><br />Someone please , please give Spike Lee a lifetime pass to all the Basketball games he wants . So , maybe he will be enjoying himself too much to pick up a film camera for a long time and we wo n't have to be subjected to his self important drivel and furthermore I wo n't have to see critics ( some of them whom I respect ) ohhhh and ahhhh to an Emperor with no clothes .
0 John Leguizemo , a wonderful comic actor , is a New York Latino , able to get inside a myriad of characters , both male and female , to show the bizarre foibles of an ethnic group trying to cope in an alien culture . He is not , however , Italian . He does n't look , think or behave Italian ... Especially Sicilian or Calabrese , immigrant groups who live in Bensonhurst or Bayridge Brooklyn . Every scene in which he interacts with his " Gumbas " rings false , as though he 'd wandered in from a college production of " West Side Story " while the other guys were doing a low - rent " Mean Streets " . That 's only one problem with this ill - conceived , mean - spirited flick . Spike blew this one big time . Btw , CBGBOMFUG means " Country , Bluegrass , Blues and Other Music For Uplifting Gourmets [ or possibly Gourmands ] Ask Hilly Crystal who founded the club . < br /><br / >
0 Spike Lee has been in a decline since his early successes and this mess does nothing to help . I looked at my watch frequently hoping the movie would end or get to the point . Lee 's first movie with an all - white cast is a major disappointment.<br /><br />What 's the point ? That Italians swear and like funky sex , but not with their wives ? If I wanted to see Scorsese , I 'd go to a Scorsese movie . The incredibly lame Godfather character only adds to the stereotype.<br /><br />I've admired several of Lee 's films , especially " Do the Right Thing " . This movie is a waste of time .
0 After seeing the trailer for this movie and finding out Spike Lee was directing , I was excited to hear about this event . I was n't alive at the time , I did n't live in New York , so I expected more of a history lesson than anything . What I got was some interesting acting , a lot of sex , and about 30 minutes worth of film that actually had anything to do with the Son of Sam . I guess the film was n't about the Son of Sam , but it was a peek into the summer of ' 77 . Label me disappointed.<br /><br / >
0 It 's difficult to put into words the almost seething hatred I have of this film . But I 'll try:<br /><br />Every other word was an expletive , the sex scenes were uncomfortable , drugs were rampant and stereotyping was beyond the norm , if not offensive to Italian - Americans.<br /><br />I'm not saying the acting was terrible , because Leguizamo , Sorvino , Brody , Espisito et . al , performed well . But ... almost every character in the film I despised . Not since The Bonfire of the Vanities have I disliked every character on screen .
0 Fox 's " The True Story Of Jesse James " ( 1957 ) is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 Tyrone Power / Henry Fonda classic " Jesse James " . I 'm not sure where the fault lies but the casting in this version of the two central characters , the uneven direction of Nicholas Ray and the ham - fisted screenplay must surely have something to do with it.<br /><br />In the late thirties and forties Tyrone Power was Fox 's top leading man but in the fifties his star began to wane and studio head Darryl Zanuck started to groom newcomer Robert Wagner to take his place . This was a major error on Zanuck 's part as Wagner proved to be a less than a suitable replacement . With the possible exceptions of " Broken Lance " ( 1954 ) and " Between Heaven & Hell " ( 1956 ) it is hard to think of Wagner distinguishing himself in anything ! Also , Jeffrey Hunter was nothing more than a Fox contract player before being assigned to play Frank James to Wagner 's Jesse in " The True Story Of Jesse James " . Borrowed from the studio the previous year this actor 's one distinguishing mark was his excellent and revealing performance in John Ford 's classic " The Searchers " . But his playing here , along with Wagner as the second half of the James Brothers , is nothing short of boring . Neither player bring any personality or colour to their respective roles . They totally miss the mark , lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by Power and Fonda in the original . The movie is also marred by too many flashbacks and with the all over the place screenplay Wagner , as the Robin Hood of the American west , comes across as a charmless introverted twit that you can feel no empathy for whatsoever . The supporting cast are hardly worth mentioning but it is a shame to see such a great actress as Agnes Moorhead barely getting a look in as Ma James.<br /><br />The best aspects of this uninvolving so - so western is the wonderful Cinemascope / Colour cinematography by the great Joe McDonald and the excellent music score by the underrated and little known composer Leigh Harline !
0 That word ' True ' in this film 's title got my alarm bells ringing . They rang louder when a title card referred to America 's Civil War as the ' War Between the States ' ( the circumlocution preferred by die - hard southerners ) . Jesse James -- thief , slave - holder and murderer -- is described as a quiet , gentle farm boy.<br /><br />How dishonest is this movie ? There is NO mention of slavery , far less of the documented fact that Jesse James 's poor widdered mother owned slaves before the war , and that Jesse and his brother Frank actively fought to preserve slavery . According to this movie , all those Civil War soldiers were really fighting to decide whether Missouri is a northern state or a southern state ... that 's ALL . ( Missouri : It 's a candy mint ! It 's a breath mint ! ) Black people are entirely absent from this movie , except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars , one of whom wears a " HELP THE POOR " sign that 's very implausibly typeset instead of handwritten . ( Some shots of 19th - century newspapers are inaccurate too , with 20th - century type fonts.)<br /><br />This film has a weird flashback structure . There 's some very impressive stunt riding ( and some fine work by stunt horses ) , and one excellent montage . I savoured one line of dialogue : ' Some of those boys will never taste beans again . ' The movie gets a few facts straight : Agnes Moorehead , as Jesse 's mother , conceals her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of Pinkerton ( here called ' Remington ' ) in which Jesse James 's real - life mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm . Some errors here are pardonable : during his bushwhacking days , the real Jesse James accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger , but Robert Wagner ( in the title role here ) does not have a stumpfinger . I 've seen a photo of Jesse James 's real wife ; if she had looked half as glamorous as Hope Lange looks in this movie , Jesse James might have stayed home more.<br /><br />There 's plenty of revisionism here , and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles . But many of this movie 's errors were avoidable . Jesse James 's mentor William Quantrill is mentioned several times , but all the actors mispronounce his name . We see Jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate two - storey house ( where he will soon die ) after paying a rent of $ 18 . Actually , Jesse James 's last residence ( at 1318 Lafayette Street , St Joseph , Missouri ) was a simple one - storey cottage , renting for $ 14 . There was no upper storey ... so , when Jesse James is killed , his wife could not come running from upstairs as Hope Lange does here . ( She was actually in the kitchen.)<br /><br />One continuity error : Robert Wagner ( with no stunt double ) does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back ... but when he gets up , the rope binding his wrists has vanished.<br /><br />The screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates . Following the Northfield robbery attempt , Jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday . The actual Northfield bank raid by the James Gang ( 7 September , 1876 ) was two days AFTER Jesse James 's birthday . ( Maybe he meant next year 's birthday . ) Later , we see Jesse and his wife moving into their St Joseph home on a fine summer day , while Jesse tells her what he plans to do when Christmas Eve arrives ... but in real life , Mr and Mrs Jesse James moved into that house on 24 December , 1881 ... so this scene should * BE * on Christmas Eve ! These errors were entirely avoidable.<br /><br />Some of the fictionalisations here do n't make sense . According to this movie , the Northfield bank raid failed because one ( fictional ) henchman was late in cutting the telegraph wires . If this had actually happened , it would indeed have hampered the James Gang 's getaway ... but it would n't have affected the robbery itself , which failed for other reasons.<br /><br />There are good performances here by Jeffrey Hunter ( as Frank James ) , Moorehead , Alan Hale Jnr ( as Cole Younger ) and by stage actress Marian Seldes in a rare screen role . I was disappointed by Robert Wagner , normally an under - rated actor . Elsewhere , Wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes , villains and morally ambiguous characters . Here , he ca n't seem to decide whether to depict Jesse James as a goodie or a baddie ... so he does n't much bother . John Carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptises Jesse and his wife at their wedding . In fact , Jesse James was baptised in childhood by his uncle , a Methodist minister ... but perhaps this second baptism is a topping - up.<br /><br />Jesse James was no Robin Hood . ( I doubt that Robin Hood was Robin Hood either , but that 's another story . ) There is not one single documented instance of Jesse James ever sharing his loot with anyone beyond his own family . After some of his hold - ups , he did n't even split the swag with the rest of his gang . In this movie , Jesse gets gunned down right after he vows to give up his bandit ways forever . In reality , the night before his death , Jesse James and the Ford brothers stole horses that Jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the Platte City bank . As preparation for most of his robberies , Jesse James stole horses from local farmers ... the same poor folk who ( in the inaccurate legends ) were supposedly the beneficiaries of his largesse . I cringed at one scene here , in which the fictional Jesse James is so gol - durn refined that he disapproves of an oil painting which tastefully depicts nudes.<br /><br />'The True ( not much ! ) Story of Jesse James ' is wilfully dishonest about a thieving murderer , and likewise dishonest about the Civil War . For the very impressive stunt work , one good montage and a few fine acting turns , I 'll rate this obscenely dishonest movie 2 points out of 10 .
0 I could n't believe my eyes when I watched Nuremberg yesterday on Dutch television . It starts very slowly , the backgrounds of the Nuremberg trials become clear step by step , the Germans have a funny English accent , but then , suddenly , in the last few minutes of the first part of the series , the audience gets to see the most shocking , horrific footage I have ever seen.<br /><br />It is important that people get to see such footage ( although I absolutely do n't agree with people stating that there is no minimum age at which children can be exposed to this kind of material ) , but in this film it was completely ridiculous . It was purely meant to improve the impact of an ordinary TV series . It was meant to shock the audience which is very cheap and unbelievably easy . In stead of trying to move us with well - done scenes , inspiring dialogue or interesting viewpoint 's , the audience is being tortured with horrible images of skin - and - bones camp inmates . It does n't show any respect for the victims of the holocaust.<br /><br />I'm very angry .
0 Apparently most viewer knows nothing about the history of Europe , including Germany , Hungary and the whole Central and Eastern Europe as well as the Hitler and Stalin Era . Nuremberg ( and a lot of forgotten trials all over Europe ) was a revenge and injustice of the winners . What do you think , why were not any American , British , French or Soviet defendants after the WWII ? There were no American , British etc . war crimes ? There were no Hiroshima , no Nagasaki , no Tokyo , no Dresden , no Hamburg , no Berlin , no Katyn and so on ? The Germans had war crimes too , but in Nuremberg the justice was not a real consideration . The main point was : Vae victis ! Germany must perish ! ( That was also a book title in America , 1941.)<br /><br />This film is an awful , ignoble American brainwashing instrument , full of error , lie , propaganda , prejudice and injustice . And first of all : full of hypocrisy . But not surprisingly ... Why was n't enough the Nuremberg process itself ? This film is a nightmare . Total darkness after 60 years ! This darkness ( and hate and narcissism and lack of self - criticism ) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea , Vietnam , Cambodia , Serbia , Iraq and so forth . And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo , America ! Very clever . Even Stalin would become envious of it ...
0 An accurate review of nuremburg must consider the door to history inadvertently opened with the movie " valkyrie " ( Tom Cruise ) . " Valkyrie " ( 2008 ) at long last tells the world there was a German resistance during world war two professionally organised with bureaucrats , military generals , soldiers and civilians who tried to over throw the Nazi political regime , install a new chancellor , obtain peace and close the concentration camps . However , these unknown absolute heroes received no help at all from the allies who helped the French resistance just next door . History writers have used an institutionalised agenda ever since to conceal an allied evil which cost many tens of millions of lives with everyone conditioned to believe a deception that the German people completely supported the Nazis and consequently deserved the 24 hour bombing genocide and " unconditional surrender " that was imposed on the Germans . < br /><br />The German enigma codes were broken by English scientists in 1943 so much of what the Germans were doing was known . During 1943 the Germans developed new jet fighters and jet bombers by companies including Arado , Heinkel and Messerschmitt . However , even if the Nazis were eliminated and the German resistance succeeded the allies would n't allow any democracy in the world to have jet fighters , jet bombers , high speed submarines , ballistic missiles and radio guided missiles without the USA having them first ! This is where the institutionalised agenda is relevant . Consequently , the German resistance got no help at all from the allies although they always had crucial intelligence to eliminate Adolf Hitler . The 20 July 1944 coup is proof there were significant efforts by the Germans to obtain peace . Instead , the Germans got ultimatums of " unconditional surrender " and 24 hour saturation bombing in an agenda to avoid peace . The allies wanted to steal the world 's greatest technology and scientists from the Germans and contain complete ownership through an " unconditional surrender . " It was a premeditated allied agenda to allow the war to perpetuate and keep the Nazis in power to justify the 24 hour bombing but it took one year after d - day before allied armies advanced into Germany to steal the world 's greatest technology and scientists at the barrel of a gun . However , tens of millions of people had died since the allies abandoned the German resistance for their own greed . < br /><br />The allies imposed " unconditional surrender " on the Germans as a pretext to complete ownership and control of German property and government and it was done without using the German resistance to over throw the Nazis . The allies wanted to steal the world 's greatest technology and scientists from the Germans to achieve world technological supremacy . Consequently , everything else took second place to the evil allied agenda which killed millions of German people in the 24 hour bombing ; the concentration camps stayed open ; the war was prolonged and led to the " cold war " with weapons based on German industrial achievements , technology , and scientists taken from the Germans in world war two.<br /><br />The 1946 Nuremburg war crimes trials were a public relations deception and mass murder perpetrated by the allies as retrospective justice to the Nazis . It was a smoke screen to hide the evil and greedy allied agenda for world technological supremacy rather than help the German resistance overthrow the nazi political regime.<br /><br />Tens of millions of people died because the allies abandoned the German resistance to an agenda but they inflicted retribution against the German chiefs of staff anyway whom paid with their lives at Nuremburg war crimes or not although the allies had perpetrated genocide to achieve world technological supremacy .
0 This movie was disappointing . It was incomplete and dull . While Alec Baldwin tried to portray himself as the Perfect fair and just prosecutor ( not to mention executive producer ) , the movie never showed any of the defense counsels or tried to challenge the audience with an actual meaningful debate on the subject of how a country could be led down such a terrible path.<br /><br />Sure , nobody wants to defend the Nazi 's point of view , but THAT WAS THE POINT of the Nuremberg Trails ! Four hours of simply bashing on the Nazi 's .... c'mon ! That s been done already!<br /><br />I really think Alec Baldwin should just stick to being Kim Bassinger 's husband.<br /><br />Right after the movie ended , TNT showed the 1959 movie , Trail at Nuremberg . That movie is FAR superior .
0 American movies about war and Nazis simply can not be good . They can not refrain from becoming idiot and following an agenda . All Nazis are bad , crazy , too proud , and Americans are so modest yet so capable and sensible and human . Come on , stop this bullshit . The main character says something like " by this trial , we have to make aggressive war a crime " . Is America a peaceful nation with its world # 1 $ 420 billion " defense " budget ( # 2 China with just $ 51b ) ? Is it simply spent in this without any ... ROI ? Why portray America as a peaceful nation when it is n't ? I deeply dislike movies with an agenda - they throw art to hell and try to persuade us into believing something . Hollywood should put a label on movies , just as record companies have that " parental advisory " label . We should have a " bullshit advisory " , " propaganda advisory " or a " politically correct advisory " label on some movies . This is one of them .
0 Anyone who saw the original 1970 movie knows how an excellent cast , script , and director can put together a comedy masterpiece . By the same token , it 's easy to see how the opposite of that can create another insipid Hollywood bore - a - thon ! This movie was pathetic ! Had it not been for John Cleese ( a comic genius ) , I would have walked out about 15 minutes into this dreadful waste of celluloid.<br /><br />Neil Simon would n't write another screenplay for this version ( he said that he could n't improve on the first ) , and I 'm surprised that after this cinematic fiasco he would n't sue for defamation of humor!<br /><br />Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did such a wonderful job in the original , what were the producers thinking about when they cast this one ? How could the director and editor look at these scenes and think any of them were funny ? I do n't know , but one thing I do know --- it 's no surprise why foreign and independent movies are becoming more and more popular .......
0 Unfortunately , this movie is so bad . The original Out of Towners was manic and very funny , of course they used the script written by Neil Simon . For some reason Neil Simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again . Even the audience I was with never laughed . The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e. The couple having sex in the park . They announce it is a lighting ceremony for New York , well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging Goldie & Steve do a bit of slap stick . The whole movie winds up being like this ... a joke is set up and given away . Why is n't Goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie . You will also notice every close up of Goldie ( they use a very intense soft lens ) . I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis , that 's if you want to laugh .
0 In an apparent attempt to avoid remaking the original movie an excellent cast that should have made this inherently funny , classic Neil Simon material better than the original failed on every level.<br /><br />The chemistry between Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin that was magic in ` Housesitter ' was nonexistent in this effort .
0 Granted , this seems like a good idea . Steve Martin , Goldie Hawn , and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy . Where can you go wrong ? Watch the movie , and you 'll find out.<br /><br />In truth , Martin , the lead , is mis - cast . He 's not doing the great slapstick he 's known for , from movies like " The Jerk " , but instead plays a sort of in - between character that does n't work . Hawn , with no one to play off of , is terrible . Cleese is the only even partially funny member.<br /><br />To top it off , the plot is pretty stupid . I ca n't say how much of it may have been changed , but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense . They blunder through New York , not doing anything right , and unfortuneatly , nothing funny . Not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable , it seems to give the message that people who do n't live in New York are n't very bright , a theme repeated throughout the movie.<br /><br />In summation , instead of seeing this , go rent the original " Odd Couple " again .
0 Within 15 minutes , my whole family was rooting for Goldie Hawn 's character to die , or at least for Steve Martin 's character to leave her . At 40 minutes , we turned it off . There are only a couple of movies a year we try that turn out so annoying that we ca n't even stomach it long enough for the story to get established.<br /><br />Normally I like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn , and I remember enjoying the Neil Simon original . So I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman . Combine the director of " What s The Worst That Can Happen " and the writer of " Miss Congeniality 2 " , and I guess this is what we end up with .
0 One would think ( as I did ) , that with Steve Martin , Goldie Hawn , and John Cleese , a movie should be , at the very least , decent . These stars ( especially Martin and Cleese ) have produced some of the funniest works of comedy of all time.<br /><br />Well , apparently I was grossly mistaken -- this is single - handedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen . It boggles my mind how one joke after the other can be so profoundly unfunny . It pained me to watch these talented actors execute one of the most positively lame scripts I have had the misfortune to come across . Based solely on the big names , I remained hopeful for a long time through the duration of the film , but it consistently failed to provide any entertainment whatsoever.<br /><br />Normally , both with movies and in life , I try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations . But with this film , it 's hard not to let loose . I can count on one hand , perhaps even two or three fingers , major Hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this . This is easily one of the worst comedies ever made.<br /><br />I tried to enjoy this --- I really did . But The Out - of - Towners ultimately fails miserably . If you really want time - efficient entertainment , just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush it down the toilet . Just please do n't watch this movie .
0 This film so NOT funny - such a waste of great stars , who seem to be caught up so in their own stardom that they forget . Only shining moments belong to John Cleese as the hotel manager who likes to dress up - you almost fall out of your chair with helpless laughter when he dances to Donna Summer 's " Bad Girls " while wearing high heels , a mink coat and a dainty hat . The rest : FORGET IT !
0 Someone should tell Goldie Hawn that her career as a teen - age gamin ended thirty years ago . < br /><br />This is one of the worst films released in years , an unequivocal disaster in which the two leads give themselves over to a frenetic exposition of their trademark tics in an effort to make up for a bad script and bad directing . This thing should have been smothered at birth.<br /><br />I hope John Cleese got paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster . He is the only performer who came through this stinking mess more or less unscathed , his only fault being a failure to realize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture .
0 We all know what 's like when we have a bad day at the office , right ? Well , this Neil Simon comedy looks at what it 's like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office . Sometimes , it 's just not worth going , know what I mean ? And , sometimes , it 's just not worth doing something when it 's already been done before , in 1970 , with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and much better also.<br /><br />It 's not that Steve Martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec ; quite to the contrary , on both counts . And , it 's not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept either ; her work has been consistently good , if not great , ever since I first saw her in TV 's Rowan and Martin 's Laugh - In of the 1960s.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that it 's not about the hapless couple at all : it 's really about New York and why everybody should come to New York to live and love their lives away in married bliss ¬ñ sort of ¬ñ in the greatest city in the world . That 's if you 're a New Yorker ... <br /><br />Look , the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere , and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment . This 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess . For example , not content with the star appeal of the main players , there is a cameo ( relatively long also ) from Rudy Giuliani , then mayor of New York , as we all know . What ¬ñ Giuliani bucking for President even then ? Worse ¬ñ a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of New York.<br /><br />And then we have John Cleese , reprising his role as Basil Fawlty ¬ñ but this time , as a prancing cross - dresser also ¬ñ once again browbeating hotel staff , sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is , in this role . And , in the process , doing great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers , arguably the best British comedy series , bar none ... <br /><br />Why was this 1999 movie made ? In the 1970s , New York was a dying city , in many ways . It was almost literally bankrupt . So , when made in 1970 , that was the city you saw : grim , dark , moody , unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke ( as it was then , polluted and all ) . By 1999 , things had gotten better : glitz was back , New York was thriving , it was the Big Apple , ready for you to bite into , if you had the moxie ... <br /><br />So , naturally , the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the American dream of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . Hence , this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged . As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy , this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great Jack Lemmon . If you 've seen the latter , then definitely do n't bother with this one .
0 It 's terrific when a funny movie does n't make smile you . What a pity ! ! This film is very boring and so long . It 's simply painfull . The story is staggering without goal and no fun.<br /><br />You feel better when it 's finished .
0 When I saw previews of this movie I thought that it may be dumb , but it will at least be funny . Well I was wrong . Even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re - evaluating their life , the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible . The first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny . But by the end , I could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next.<br /><br />Throughout the movie I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre , which is still more than I can say for the movie itself .
0 Largely dense road movie with some comic relief provided by the excellent John Cleese ( although he is really sending up his performance in Fawlty Towers ) . Seems to flip from over the top slapstick to slushy sentimentality at the drop of a hat , and the worst part of the film is that Martin and Hawn have to " find themselves " , who they are , etc . See it at your peril .
0 Evil Aliens owes a huge debt to Peter Jacksons early films Bad Taste and Braindead . I must confess to never enjoying those films particularly and i say the same about this . Jake West is a director who clearly lacks inspiration of his own and chooses to steal from those whom he looks up to . I lost count of the amount of times a major Hollywood film was quoted most notably James Camerons Aliens . The amount of blood and gore on show here is n't funny either , the latter end of the film becomes tired and dragged out . Maybe it would have worked better as a short film . The actors a poor , the direction is weak and the plot is non existent . I can see what the director was trying to do , the homage he was trying to pay , but others have done the same thing a lot better than presented here . 4/10
