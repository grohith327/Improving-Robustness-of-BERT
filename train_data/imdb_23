0 Someone , some day , should do a study of architecture as it figures in horror films ; of all those explorations of weirdly laid out mansions , searches for secret passageways and crypts , trackings of monsters through air ducts , and so forth . Offhand I can recall only a few films in which architecture played a major role throughout--"Demon Seed , " " Cube , " the remake of " Thirteen Ghosts "-- but it 's at the heart of every story about a spooky house or church or crypt ; it 's all about the character and the affect of spaces , passages , and walls . So I was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central . The idea is this : An architect has built -- actually , rebuilt -- for himself a huge and rambling house ; his wife has just left him , mainly because of his own self - centeredness , but also , it is intimated , because she ca n't get used to the place since he remodeled it . Living in unaccustomed solitude ( real this time , rather than virtual ) , he comes to suspect that somebody else -- a stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappeared -- is living into the house with him ; only the place is big enough so that he never sees him.<br /><br />This is a good start for a melodrama , whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these : After searching the house for the intruder a few times without success , the architect resorts to his blueprints to undertake more systematic searches , trying in various ways to surprise , intercept , or ambush the intruder , maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure . Meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect did n't foresee or does n't remember . The movie would turn into a cat - and - mouse game , a hunt , a battle ; and finally , in trying to trap the intruder , the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation , in some way he did n't expect . Then he would be forced to think himself out of it -- and maybe at the same time out of his own self - imposed isolation -- and in a final twist would nail , and maybe even kill , the * * * * er.<br /><br />Nothing like this happens in this movie ; the house is just a house , the architect is just a guy , and his nemesis is of an unknown character , if he exists at all . Here is what does happen in the movie : Once the intruder is installed in the house -- if he is -- the architect begins hearing noises , but when he goes to investigate finds nothing . He calls the police , they think he 's slightly nuts ; he persuades his estranged wife to spend the night , she thinks he 's more nuts . At last , more or less accidentally , he runs into the intruder ( does n't get a good look , but figures , who else could it be ?-- not a hard question , in a story with , to that point , fewer than three principal characters ) , whereupon he locks the doors , lowers the grills on the windows , throws away the key ( I do n't know why he thought this necessary ) , and leaves his victim to starve . I missed why this was a given : the doors and walls are made of steel ? In any event , the architect takes to sleeping in his car . And since the idea of the movie has languished undeveloped and can not now be developed further , something else must be devised to take its place . And this is it : The architect -- are you ready ?-- moves into the house of the man who ( presumably ) moved into his , and lives there in the same way . How is this possible ? It is not , but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so : The architect has drawn a picture of the man who came to his door ; and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him ; and while sitting in his car , he throws the picture into the street ; and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like Martin , their neighbor ; whereupon the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the way.<br /><br />If this sequence seems to verge on the implausible , what ensues plunges right in . The architect takes up residence with Martin 's wheelchair - ridden wife , unbeknownst to her ; so stealthy in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his hostess that he 's able always to leave a room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around . Throughout this section the movie is clever in one way , making ( or leaving it to the viewer to make ) the point that his life with this stranger , who does n't know he 's there , is in essence the same life he lived with his wife , as a virtual recluse with her as a convenient buffer . But at the same time , his inability to live in the world makes his transformation into Raffles the cat - burglar entirely incredible . Not to go into the series of twists at the end -- including another murder achieved by locking someone in behind another invincible door -- this one in front of a landing so flimsy that it collapses under the weight of a wheelchair ; two nice people who take murder in stride ; and ( before the story started ) the unnoticed construction of a tunnel under several houses .... To the final , long - anticipated twist , the movie adds another , to make it even more offensive , and then ... ends.<br /><br />Here is a story that depends on the development of two things -- the idea of the stranger in the house , and the character of the man whose house it is -- and fumbles both . The first fumble makes it boring ; the second made me angry , as it pushed its main character farther and farther along a more and more zigzaggy path , and never offered any explanation for the character who most required one : Martin the tunnel - builder and sneak - tenant . The story should be redone by someone , some day .
0 For the first time in years , I 've felt the need to log into IMDb today to cleanse myself of this movie by writing a review , because it was just such a let - down to watch . The plot sounded awesome when I read it , I expected a minimal mystery thriller , a claustrophobic phantom hunt . Unfortunately , it all gets watered down so bad by a mundane , tiring love story and too many contrived and teeth - gnashingly stupid " no - one - says - things - like - this - except - in - bad - movies "- dialogs that it 's just agonizing.<br /><br />Here 's a quick run down of the worst offenses of this piece of film : < br /><br />- The script relies so heavily on coincidences and the inexplicable and inexcusable stupidity of the main characters that it 's just laughable . No , actually , it 's angering . And lazy.<br /><br />- Related to that : Cheap thrills . A long parade " just in time " moments.<br /><br />- The main characters . Alright , it seems that the screenwriter has never experienced actual human beings in real life , but instead has gained all his knowledge from bad movies . Thus , his characters are boring , lifeless second generation clich√©s . They are mere plot - devices , place - holders without the slightest bit of personality . They are " man and woman in break - up who still love each other " . Never seen that one before except in 100,000 movies and it 's not getting any more realistic or enjoyable . Think of the blandest two - dimensional Hollywood fare and you 've got it . There is not one character in this movie that is even remotely fresh , charming , or interesting.<br /><br />- The far - fetched , vague resolution that 's swaying very bad and needs just one nudge to topple , though the word " resolution " might be ill - fitting here , because the movie is a swampy mess that is n't going anywhere anyway . By the time you 're through , though , you do n't care anymore . The last third of the movie I just fast - forwarded , because it was just so unbearable to watch.<br /><br />Okay , that 's it . Whatever redeeming features this movie has , it all gets buried under incompetence . Do n't watch this turd .
0 Certainly not horrible , but definitely not good.<br /><br />Cry , The Beloved Country ( 1995 ) was directed by Darrell Roodt and written for the screen by Ronald Harwood ( Adapted from the 1946 novel by Alan Paton ) . Starring James Earl Jones and Richard Harris.<br /><br />The film is about pre - Apartheid South Africa , and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining . The pious but naive preacher Stephen Kumalo ( James Earl Jones ) receives a letter from Johannesburg saying that he must come immediately ; he later finds that his son has killed a man . The rich farmer / landowner James Jarvis ( Richard Harris ) finds that his son , a fighter for black rights , was the one killed by Kumalo 's son . In this they connect.<br /><br />I can not compare it to the 1951 film of the same name , for I have not seen it . Or the 1974 musical titled Lost in the Stars for I have also not seen it ; both look better than this one . But Cry Freedom , on the other hand , I have seen ; it has a much more urgent air to it , like it actually is trying to say something where the film Cry , The Beloved Country seems to have no idea where it is going . Very " Wishy - washy " . I refuse to compare the film to the novel ( except that I did enjoy the novel more than I enjoyed the film ) because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means.<br /><br />Frankly , this movie blew . Well , I guess it was n't that bad , --Five - out - of - ten , -- but it was n't that good either . Both of the leads , both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances I have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history ( but that can be blamed on he screenwriter , Ronald Harwood , who is also oddly off is game with this film , having also written the sublime The Pianist , and Being Julia ) . Among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time ; there is little , if any , tension with any moment of the film , racially or suspensefully . The music does n't help . The painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film . One upside is the cinematography , with many rather good or great shots , but unfortunately , this does not help the film too much.<br /><br />The last , striking words of Alan Paton 's novel are displayed in the last moments of the film . It is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown . I do n't know what Nelson Mandela might have seen in this film.<br /><br />Thanks for your time .
0 wow ... this has got to be the DUMBEST movie I 've ever seen . We watched it in english class ... and this movie made ABSOLUTELY no sense . I would never , EVER watch this movie again ... and my sympathy to those who have ever PAID to see it .
0 It happened with Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005 , it happened with The Lost Boys in 2008 and now it 's happened with another classic from the 80 's Wargames ... :( Why , oh why , oh why wo n't Hollywood ever learn ? Leave them alone ... ! They ca n't be remade ... ! They suck .... ! We all hate them .... !.<br /><br />Those of you who have n't seen the original 1983 version with Matthew Broderick & Ally Sheedy , go rent / buy it now .... ! ! The hardware may look dated , the special effects are not new millennium but it still beats this rubbish hands down .... <br /><br />For those of us who lived through the 80 's when hacking was sexy , the Internet was something mysterious and your disks came as a 8 " floppy variety , well we now possess the wisdom to avoid this film like a Thermonuclear War ! < br /><br />Never before has " a nice game of chess " seemed the better option ....
0 I see a lot of movies . Saw the original wargames years ago and loved it . Computers where still " a big mystery " for the most of us and the movie was convincing , in it 's own way.<br /><br />This one , however , looks like a low budget Wednesday night special . Total crap , from start to finish.<br /><br />The plot is so weak , you wo n't believe it until you see the movie ( which I would not recommend in the first place ) . I can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie . But hey , with that script I would 've been surprised if ANYONE could do a good job acting . Lots of clich√© scenes . CGI looks like it 's taken out of the ' 86 version.<br /><br />Bah , no , I 'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this . Do NOT watch this movie.<br /><br />Life 's to short to waste it on watching crappy movies .
0 I ca n't say that Wargames : The Dead Code is the worst movie I 've ever seen , as it had one or two decent moments , but I can easily say it 's the most transparent movie I 've ever seen . Not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it 10 + minutes in advance . There was no subtlety to anything the movie did , no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes . Every spoken or typed line 's intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to " get into " the movie.<br /><br />I found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line , and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience , far more often than I found myself enjoying the movie .
0 Some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen , and I understand where they 're coming from , but I really have seen worse.<br /><br />That being said , the movies that I can recall ( ie the ones I have n't blocked out ) that were worse than this , were so bad that they physically pained every sense that was involved with watching the movie . The movies that are worse than War Games 2 are the ones that make you want to gouge out your eyes , or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulness.<br /><br />War Games : The Dead Code is n't that bad , but it comes pretty close . Yes I was a fan of the original , but no I was n't expecting miracles from this one . Let 's face it the original was n't really that great of a movie in the first place , it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek - appeal to it.<br /><br />That 's all I was hoping for , something bad , but that might have tugged at my geek - strings . Was that too much to ask for ? Is it really not possible to do better than the original War Games , even for a straight to video release ? Well apparently that was too much to ask for . Stay away from this movie . At first it 's just bad , like " Oh yeah , this is bad , but I 'm kind of enjoying it , maybe the end will be good like in the original . " And then it just gets worse and worse , and by the end , trust me , you will wish you had not seen this movie .
0 This is loosely based on the ideas of the original 80 's hit . It 's set in the modern day as we see a base in Afghanistan get destroyed by a UAV right at the start.<br /><br />And that 's exactly where the movie jumps the shark . UAV 's are n't armed . They could be but I do n't think it 's ever been tried for real . We get to see the computer that has masterminded this operation , called R.I.P.L.E.Y. We are introduced to " hacker " Will Farmer ( he 's good at chemistry & electronics which does n't make him a computer hacker ) & his love interest , Annie ) & Will 's 1st attempt at hacking is not only a complete failure his IP address is also logged and Annie guessed who it was . We also meet Wills mom who works for a chemical company.<br /><br />Wills taking money from his neighbours bank account ( Mr Massude ) is n't a hack ( he helped him set up the account ) , we then get a nod back to the original movie where they decide against playing Global Thermonuclear War & they play The Dead Code . The trace the RIPLEY office are running is NOT on Will but on Massude 's pc so all the evidence they were gathering was useless against Will.<br /><br />Exactly why RIPLEY shut Will 's machine down is n't explained ( he 's only playing an online game ? ) & also why it felt the need to have to shut down all the electricity in the entire block he lived in as well . Why a counter terrorism agency would see this as a viable target is extremely questionable . As for RIPLEY activating his mobile phone ? I think not , it was n't connected to the pc and the message would n't play unless he actually answered the phone so there 's more bad " hacking " science there too.<br /><br />RIPLEY agents arrive at Massude 's home , take him away & Will is given a envelope which turns out to contain a lot of money . Will searching for the licence plate of the car that took Massude is n't a " hack " as you never see him break into the DMV computer . The RIPLEY agents who grab Dennis in the airport as he 's looking for Will have no authority to arrest or detain him . Will 's mother had n't " been stealing chemicals & Bio agents " either . And even if she did they had no right to arrest or detain Dennis . Patriot Act or not.<br /><br />I do n't know why Will was worried about being arrested for any crime in Canada as its a totally different country with different laws to the US.<br /><br />The computer has gone rogue and all the action its taken against Will , his mother & Dennis was n't sanctioned by a Government agency . The phone phreak we see Will do is the 1st show of any hacking skill in the movie , we also get a hack into RIPLEY which seemed too easy for such a powerful system.<br /><br />The " guy " who ran into Annie at the airport & was also watching them in the street was nothing to do with RIPLEY & the laughable notion that RIPLEY could track a cellphone whilst underground was as stupid as the idea that a computer reads lips.<br /><br />Another reference to the original movie when they mention Stephen Falken as the designer of the system RIPLEY replaced , the Joshua Project . We discover that the " guy " who ran into Annie is Falken ( not played by the original actor sadly ) who faked his own death.<br /><br />We also get to see WOPR as " what 's going to help " them beat RIPLEY and they kept the same voice used back then . Falken & WOPR are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all ( the same explosion should kill Will , Annie & the Russian . It 's also unlikely they 'd create a self - contained computer system that has the ability to nuke or drop chemical weapons on the country it operates out of.<br /><br />The whole " Decontamination " plot & idea are totally unbelievable . Those kinds of orders would have to go through the President or Joint Chiefs Of Staff . So yet another laughable & unbelievable idea.<br /><br />The IP hacks against RIPLEY are n't done by Will , he just contacts one of his friends who suggests & implements the idea . It 's excessively laughable that Will would get a login just from increasing RIPLEY 's operating temperature . Having Joshua as a backdoor into RIPLEY ( especially after it had been blown to bits ) is an incredible cop - out and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done with.<br /><br />There is an awful good where RIPLEY is playing Dead Code and we see a countdown ( saying 17 minutes ) then RIPLEY says " Decontamination in 30 minutes " , how crap is that when they ca n't even keep up with their own timer ? RIPLEY 's attack mission against Philadelphia is halted ( far too easily in my opinion ) and it decides to attack Joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a Philly to Washington where RIPLEY is stationed . The idea of the Nuclear exchange to make RIPLEY realise what she 's doing wo n't work ( surely she 'd already know if she had Joshua insider her as he 'd already learnt this lesson in the original movie ? ) is yet another nod back to the original movie.<br /><br />Their cop - out at having RIPLEY repeat Joshua 's exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up with.<br /><br />If you want to point fingers for bad & stolen ideas the men to blame are Randall Badat & Rob Kerchner . This is an awful movie and is best avoided .
0 I think this could 've been a decent movie , and some of its parts are OK ... but in whole it 's a B movie . Same about the plot , parts are OK but it has several holes and oddities that does n't quite add up . Acting is mostly OK , I 've seen worse of this too . : ) < br /><br />The beginning sets the level , with cars driving in the desert , making " cool " but totally unnecessary jumps through some small dunes ( In slow motion ! Cool ! ) , like the drivers had never seen sand before ... It gets slightly better from there , but not much.<br /><br />If you 're gon na rent this , get another one too and use this one as a warm - up . Keep expectations low and it might work for you .
0 Like many others have commented before me here , I have to say that this movie is bad , but not the worst I 've seen . There will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment , because I hate spoilers.<br /><br />I got a feeling I was watching an episode of a TV show or something , where they had gotten a hold of some extra $ $ $ to spend on CGI ( I 've seen worse of those ) ... All in all , it is quite an insult to the viewer , at least if you have ANY knowledge about computers and/or technology at all . There are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable , and I found myself just begging for it all to end - fast - halfway through . In addition , there are countless " easy way out " scenarios , which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being ... <br /><br />This movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old " Wargames " , and I think it 's a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel.<br /><br />Two stars from me , because of one thing and one thing only : the actors ' performances are n't half - bad , considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with . Still , they should never have signed on to this movie . Not really a career - move , but I guess we all have bills to pay.<br /><br />To those of you who gave this movie top score ... you have to be on the studio 's payroll or something , that 's my only explanation.<br /><br />To all who have n't seen this one : by all means , watch it and make up your own mind . But lower your expectations to the floor ( and then some ) .
0 Thank God I watched this at a friend 's place and did not pay for it . The plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a TV show . If you have any knowledge of computers or electronics , watch out . You will feel feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence . < br /><br />Also , actress turned Much Music VJ Amanda Walsh displays the worst acting I have ever seen , excluding porn . She 's lucky that Matt Lanter is actually decent . He 's the one that carries the movie . < br /><br />I hate that I wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie ! It 's a shame that they got to call it a sequel , because I was a fan of the original , which was actually pretty good .
0 I 'll try to use words to describe this on .... < br /><br />I saw the original , which was good in its own way , but back then I should have feared a sequel.<br /><br />And I was ' afraid ' when I picked this one up , but now that I 've seen it , I have to say , it 's even worse then I thought . Why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin . < br /><br />Let 's start with the actors;they are n't all that good , but it has to be said , some make heads turn by being just plain awful . But what can an actor do with a script like this one . It 's trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed , any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that has n't been done before , fails miserably . In a futile attempt to get it up - to - date , they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole ' big - brother ' theme , but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end . An attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the ' 83 original , but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad . In conclusion , if you have nothing , and I mean nothing , to do ... go watch it , or play Frisbee ... with the DVD .... by yourself . It 'll offer you the same amount of fun .. I promise
0 I thought this was a sequel of some sorts , and it is meant to be to the original from 1983 . But a sequel is not taking the original plot and destroying it.<br /><br />I actually had very little expectations to this movie , but I just wasted 95 minutes of life . No suspense - I actually feel clairvoyant , poor acting , and so filled with technical errors , so I as a computer geek just could n't believe it . They have tried to make it a mix between a generic war movie and 24 hours . But this is not even worthy of a low budget TV movie.<br /><br />Do not see this movie , this is a complete waste of time . Instead get the original . The theme is still valid . Do n't let to much power into a machine . And the acting and plot is far more exiting and compelling .
0 I really did n't have high expectations and I must admit that I was n't disappointed . This movie is so terrible that I felt obligated to register an account here at IMDb just to warn others not to waste their time . The storyline is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the movie " can it get any worse ? " YES , it can ! somehow they manage to make it worst by every minute and you end up thinking " I want my 1 hour 35 minutes back ! " . Somebody got to pay for this ! < br /><br />I dare you to find a movie which is worst that this ... <br /><br />I really did n't have high expectations and I must admit that I was n't disappointed .

0 This movie is mostly chase scenes and special effects . It is very weak on plot . Most of the computer talk was just mumbo - jumbo . I watched this because I was a big fan of the original War Games movie which was based mostly on computer fact and real computer terminology . This movie had none of that . Most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic of real computers and networks , but just lame . It is like it was written by somebody who has no comprehension of real computers.<br /><br />The ripley game was lame and was essentially just an arcade game . No real hacking , so what was the point ? Movie was boring . Lame sequel .
0 You have to understand , when Wargames was released in 1983 , it created a generation of wannabe computer hackers . The idea that a teenager could do anything of far reaching proportions , let alone deter a world war was novel and thrilling . Real computers were beginning to show up in people 's homes , and for the first time , society was becoming interconnected in a way that made the movie 's premise excitingly prescient . Granted , a talking computer that balanced it 's free time between chess and global thermonuclear war was a bit far fetched , but the brilliant commentary on nuclear proliferation and the cold war made up for it . I 've probably even heard of the hackers that this movie was actually based on.<br /><br />Fast forward 25 years , and we have a horrible mutant of a thing that I loathe to call a " sequel " , called Wargames : The Dead Code . I 'll just dig right in . First of all , the plot hinges on a government operated gambling site where folks who win the games automatically become terror suspects . You 're probably very confused right now . The idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the sub - game within the web site called " The Dead Code " where they pilot a plane over a city , spraying it with bioweapons . At some point in the game , you have to choose between " sarin gas " and " anthrax " , and if you choose " sarin " , then you 're automatically confirmed as a bioterrorism weapons expert and your family is taken into custody and interrogated . In the movie , this actually happens . However , since the payment for the game was made from a bank account that was suspicious , it obviously all makes sense.<br /><br />Second , the avatar of the AI in this straight - to - DVD bomb is an annoying flash animation that keeps repeating the pop - up - ad - esquire sound bite " play with me baby " . Because apparently in the future , advanced AI loses interest in intellectual pursuits like chess , and gets into porn.<br /><br />Third , the motivation for these " hackers " is profit and women , as opposed to pure curiosity as in the original movie . For some reason , recent hacker movies feel the need to portray all young adults as average surfer dude kind of people who are just like everyone else . That may work for your average sitcom , but c'mon , you do n't learn how to take over government computers by doing your hair , playing sports , and shopping at the mall , folks . The one novel thing I noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a Matt Damon movie , and then later there is the phrase , " Good Hunting , Will " . I swear , they named the main character Will just for that phrase so they could send a high five to Mr. Damon . This Will kid is n't bad , but he was certainly was n't like any obsessive hacker I 've ever met . I ca n't fully state how annoyed I am that this movie shares the same name as the original , because it has absolutely nothing in common with it except ¬Ö  Professor Falken and Joshua ( WOPR ) make a reappearance in this movie , as a limp old man who apparently is dying of boredom , and a dilapidated old tic - tac - toe machine with a higher pitched voice . After some prodding , Joshua ( the AI ) has what appears to be sex with the new AI with the porn voice , a bunch of board games flash on the big screens , and the whole " The only way to win , is not to play " revelation is supposed to be the crowning moment . Except that those of us who saw the original , you know , those who would want to see this in the first place have already been there and done that . A recycled ending for a movie made from last month 's compost.<br /><br />The new movie was directed by a guy who 's done 90210 , and written by guys who do B movies . The original was directed by a guy who 's been keeping himself busy with " Heroes " , so you see the quality difference there . There was talk of a real remake , but I hope they do n't destroy this classic all over again . I swear , if I have to , I 'll visit every gambling web site until I find the one that 's run by a psychotic government computer . The saving grace is that I was able to stream this on Netflix , so at least the only energy I expended watching this disaster was for breathing , clicking , and indigestion .
0 This is the worst , and I mean THE worst computers based movie I have ever seen . The whole plot is totally unconvincing and full of stupidity . < br /><br />I mean ... <br /><br />The guy in this movie can actually speak with computer as a real person . Now you probably think this must be some super cool high - tech computer , well , it is , but he does it also with other very poor and weak computer which does not even have graphic interface.<br /><br />and the main idea how to overload the " super " computer by connecting to it via computer game on the net is really stupid . My mobile phone will shut the lighting down to preserve the energy but apparently this genius computer ca nt decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to load computer games.<br /><br />there are also some other bad things about it but I just do n't have time for this.<br /><br />I just ca nt believe someone could actually record movie stupid as this
0 No wonder this was released straight to DVD here in Australia , no redeeming features what so ever . The dialog was hokey , the acting , awful and the script sucked ! ! Whoever thought it would be a good idea to do a sequel or follow up to the far superior John Badham film , Wargames from the 80s , well they must of been on something cause it was a bad idea ! ! Amanda Walsh was good in it as the eye candy / love interest , while Matt Lanter was good as the other main lead- that is about it . I would not recommend Wargames : The Dead Code to anyone , check out Hackers or the original Wargames film- both are better than this piece of crap ! !
0 Just plain good old stupid . < br /><br />I mean really stupid , not the good stupid like Killer Tomatoes , or Ed Wood movies , this is probably the most stupid movie I ever have seen . To give this movie an golden Turkey is an insult to turkeys . To call this movie dumb is offensive even to dumb people.<br /><br />If this is the future of American cinema and art we are better off to really start world war 3 and 4 at the same time and let the cockroaches run the show after . < br /><br />Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult to my single braincell off .... <br /><br />This is a really good movie if you are suicidal .
0 This is one of the worse movies that I have ever seen in my entire life . I wish I could travel back in time and do the following:<br /><br />1 ) Find out where the " movie " " War Games- The Dead Code " was filmed 2 ) Watch the original WAR GAMES with my current computer knowledge AND the eyes of a 1983 preteen . 3 ) Break into the pentagon computer in the 80 's with the knowledge and perspective learned and remembered . 4 ) Reprogram the WHOPPER to NUKE the location of THE DEAD CODE minutes prior to its first day of filming 5 ) Come back to the present , have a beer and get Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to " flash " my memory blank of the whole event , especially my original viewing of " The Dead Code " 6 ) Have another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7 ) Be happy until the next bad remake of a GOOD 80 's movie.<br /><br />8 ) Did I forget the have Jar Jar killed . I am not sure if I would have to travel into the future for that . Maybe I need access to a wormhole .
0 After Highlander 2 ( which I am still in denial about ) , I thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad . I was wrong . I loved the original Wargames , however , this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie . The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked . Whoever wrote this movie knew NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS except how to use a word processor . I doubt he or she even watched the original movie . The acting is n't even convincing . Please save yourselves , under no circumstances watch this movie . I do n't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you ca n't turn the TV off . THIS MOVIE WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE .
0 I wondered why John Wood was not playing Dr. Falken until I watched the film . BAD plot , bad science , bad acting and overall a bad film . Please do n't watch this film . Rent the original " War Games " if you are feeling nostalgic.<br /><br />I did n't like the bending of the plot to beat - the - terrorist - threat idea either . In the first film W.O.P.R was built because Russia had 1000s of warheads pointed at the U.S.A. In this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorist in training before they are a threat . Politics aside , one of the good thing about the first film was the highlighting that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of the pointlessness of war in the end . No such insight is offered in this film .
0 I ca n't believe I watched this expecting more . It starts out OK . This movie pushes the limits of reality way to far ! ! At least the first one was somewhat realistic . It rips off the first movie and even mentions the Joshua Project . Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie . It does have one good message in it though , WATCH OUT FOR BIG BROTHER ! ! ! The movie just makes it seem like Big Brother is way bigger than he actually is in reality . That was very aggravating . Even the make - up on the actors was completely bad . Some of the acting is pretty good . Some of the acting is really bad though . The script was OK at some points and completely messed up at other parts . This movie plays on convenience about every five minutes . Like I said , I ca n't believe I watched it expecting more . I think I am gon na pop in the original to get back to earth ... Q
0 A below average looking video game is turned into some sort of conspiracy to have the next terrorist discovered in the USA backyard . Welcome to the lunacy of cheaply made direct to video movies . Its full of no - name actors and actresses with little valuable plot.<br /><br />Anyway , this strange game goes on and our " hero " bets real money and does good at it . It is sort of like gambling , except the gambling part is gone and it sucks . Instead its an online game with little real value and you get authorities on your tail if you do good.<br /><br />What makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs battle it out somehow and all is saved in the end . I will leave the viewer to see how it all comes to fruition.<br /><br />Overall , not even worth a $ 1 rental . Borrow it , please . " D- "
0 If you thought that the original from 83 was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece . How could it be worse more you ask ? Well ... at least in the first one you had Ally Sheedy jogging in a sports bra . Other than updated graphics , modern day themes ( such as terrorists ) , modern weapons and a sexy new voice for Ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story . Anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story was going . And for anyone that did n't see the first one ... well consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once . Maybe in another 23 years Hollywood will try again .
0 Will Farmer ( Lanter ) plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack , and Ripley , the super government computer , designed to profile potential terrorists , tracks him because Will borrowed ( by hacking ) some money from his next door neighbor 's bank account to pay for a class trip to play chess in Philadelphia . The next door neighbor whose computer Will was fixing , has relatives in the mid - east who thru their bank send money to the neighbor 's bank , and Ripley sees a terrorist connection . Ripley has the power to call up missile strikes . Oh , oh!<br /><br />This version of War Games has a much faster pace and more aggressiveness than the War Games movie in the early 1980s . Well , the electronic industry has so much more to work with these days . Makes sense . So the movie dazzles us with fantastic CGI on computer screens , and once Joshua , the forerunner to Ripley , is found operational , we are left with watching computer against computer and the humans are cringing , hoping , praying ¬Ö .sort of , oh - oh - ing , OMG - ing , and more cringing hoping things will go their way . In other words we are now experiencing a made - for - TV type movie , and it 's Oh Hum Time . Go back to the 1980s and watch the original War Games movie . It 's much better . < br /><br />But , we really have to ask ourselves : are we making computers too intelligent where one day , in time , they will rule us ? Hmmm ¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö .. < br /><br />Violence : Yes . Sex : No . Nudity : No . Language : No .
0 I did n't enjoy this film . I thought the acting was n't very good and the story was boring . A 20year old computer saving the day ? I thought that this was just slightly far fetched , even for a film . I could n't figure out why they could n't just turn it off , why not take a sledgehammer to it.<br /><br />Its a shame , but after the original film from the 80s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered . This film could have been a 21st century version of the old film , it was n't . If that is what you want to watch , do not watch this film ! < br /><br />Even if the old computer had n't have turned up to save day , this would still , in my opinion , be a very very cheesy flick ..
0 Let 's face it-- if you rented a STDVD sequel of a forgotten 80 's gem , and expected it to be better than the aforementioned , then you are an idiot . Wargames : The Dead Code joins the long running list of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market has filled so easily . Movies like this do n't need spoilers , because YOU already know them.<br /><br />The " plot " for this " film " , is as follows : Nerd meets girl ; girl likes nerd ; nerd likes girl ; nerd gets accidentally involved with Top Secret Government computer ; nerd and girl go to another country ; nerd and girl end up being persecuted by Government suits in the other country ; nerd and girl meet some important old guy that dies at key point in the " film " ; nerd and girl are captured ; the Top Secret Government computer gets crazy ; nerd is hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer ; nerd beats Top Secret Computer by using the same old Top Secret Computer from the first Wargames " film " ; nerd saves the day ; nerd gets laid . < br /><br />The end.<br /><br />The acting , script , effects , score , and cinematography are what you would expect-- B - grade . Some familiar faces are in here , and unless you are a mega fan of Colm Feore , then you should avoid this one . Granted , the movie wo n't make you insane enough to eat your own toes by seeing it , so if you like cheap looking STDVD sequels , then you are right at home.<br /><br />Sadly , Mathew Broderick was too involved with some " masterpiece " , that he could n't even do a five second cameo in this one . But can you blame him ?
0 I do n't know what else to say about this horrible movie that has n't already been said . Honestly I have only myself to be angry with . I should have know better when I saw the title of this movie that it would be a horrible piece of crap , but I loved War Games so I indulged my whim . I will live to regret that decision the rest of my life . From the very start when the government people explained that their super computer could determine who a terrorist was just by how well they played a video game I knew I was in for a ride though the land - that - good - writing - forgot . The list of very , very , very bad plot lines , dialog , and acting is so long I would crash IMDb if I tried to post it . To those people who said that they have seen worst movies than this one please tell me . I am actually curious to see something that could top this steaming pile of horse dung .
0 I suppose many people comment / review their first movie on IMDb because the movie was spectacular or horrible -- I 'm writing due to the latter.<br /><br />I was excited for the sequel to " Wargames " .. I thought the original was quite good considering its time period and content , I felt it was worth watching more than once . This being 2008 , I had high hopes for what they would do with this film . Computers , Gaming , Terror , Military over - zealousness have all grown so much since the time of the first film , and " Wargames : The Dead Code " had an opportunity to bring it all into a great flick.<br /><br />The movie failed on pretty much every level , but I particularly blame the writers and anyone who had any input regarding the realism of gaming aspects . " The Dead Code " was a 1990 's air flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms . Meanwhile , Will Farmer is button mashing about 7,000 commands -- none of which are impacting what is happening on the screen . Until finally he " wins " by clicking a box on the screen with his mouse that release gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people ( nobody is near the gas ) . Because he beat 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes , this tells RIPLEY ( the real life war machine ) that he is a high level terror threat.<br /><br />Even though any 5 - 16 year old could complete this same task - The government believes he is a lethal threat to humanity . They say things like " He has expert knowledge of bio - terror " ... He displayed less knowledge than someone who read the first 3 paragraphs of the Wiki entry on Bio - Terror . So then a movie - long chase scene with about .01 % of the budget and excitement of any of the Bourne titles ensues . They have about 1000 opportunities to catch him and clear up the entire matter .. sometimes they are mad they barely miss him .. but other times they masterfully create opportunities just let him go intentionally to follow him.<br /><br />Ugh ... I would write more .. but I already wasted 1.5 hours watching this , I would rather watch the Broderick and Joshua play tic - tac - toe for 1.5 hours .
0 The only reason to see this movie is for a brilliant performance by Thom - Adcox Hernandez who is underused in the movie within the movie . As usual Tom Villard is good , too . Otherwise it 's c**p . The possesor does n't even exist how does he magically change the letters on the theatre marquee to spell out " The Possessor " ? Lame .
0 A bunch of kids set up a theatre to have an all - night horror movie marathon . However , as the night goes on , there 's somebody among them killing them off one by one . Who is it ... and why ? I saw this in a theatre way back in 1991 . I was looking forward to it -- but boy ! It did not work at all . The premise is a good one , they have a very appealing young cast and some pros like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but it does n't work . The story stops making sense halfway through ( that could be because of some huge editing before the film was released ) , the killings are relatively bloodless ( how this got an R rating is beyond me ) and the unmasking of the killer at the end was boring and stupid.<br /><br />It 's really too bad -- this movie had potential . With a better script this could have become a great horror film . As it stands though it 's mostly forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassed by it ( I heard Stone wo n't talk about this one ) . I give it a 3 and that 's just for the cast .
0 When I saw the commercial for this , I was all about seeing it . Now , forgive me , but it 's been so long since I 've seen it that I do n't recall how it went . Suffice it to say , the movie I saw bore no resemblance to the " movie " they sold me on.<br /><br />I was bored , annoyed , and incredibly disappointed by this movie . And if it was n't bad enough , they had to sink it even further with that awful reggae music . Not exactly mood - setting music for a horror movie , eh mon ? I guess if you never saw the commercial ( or trailer , I suppose ) you may think this is some hot stuff . For my money , the commercial was way better .
0 * * SPOILERS * * I rented " Tesis " ( or " Thesis " in English ) on the strength of director Alejandro Amenabar 's later effort " The Others " . Based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was , I assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and I was in the mood for some good horror . Instead I wound up with the most tedious , preposterous excuse for a lame - brained slasher movie I 've seen since the German film " Anatomie " ( which this one kinda reminded me of).<br /><br />The plot has potential but it 's thrown away within the first 20 minutes . It revolves around innocent - n - pretty psychology student Angela 's ( Ana Torrent - a Jessica Harper deadringer ) thesis on the subject of violence in films . Through some far - fetched circumstances too dumb to go into here , she winds up in possession of a ' snuff ' tape on which two men torture , mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera . Angela , and her horror - buff friend Chema ( Fele Martinez ) are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who 's responsible for it.<br /><br />This leads to ... well , nothing.<br /><br />They never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl 's killers ( since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events , even when their own lives at risk ) and the mystery itself is as limp as Graham Norton in a room full of bunny girls . There is only one proper ' clue ' ( the type of camera the killers used is discovered ) and that 's a ) a really weak one and b ) wheeled out in the first 20 minutes . The rest of the so - called ' unravelling ' just occurs through blind luck , increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a SLEW of awful , transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time.<br /><br />Seriously - Amenabar might know his stuff about ghost stories but he 's clearly never read a detective book in his life . The key to a good whodunnit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence , before moving in for the final twist . In " Tesis " , * POTENTIAL SPOILER AHEAD * the killer 's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur ' detectives ' almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas , throws his hands up and says " OK , ya got me , it was him after all " ! As for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes - no such luck . You 're watching the wrong movie if that 's what you 're after.<br /><br />The only thing that drags " Tesis " down further from just being a dumb , badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous , muddled - up ' point ' about violence in films . I have no idea what stance it 's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided , confused psychobabble , in between the rest of the gibberish , and say " look at me ! I 'm political ! " . The final scenes , in which the " point " of the movie is supposedly hammered home , are so utterly absurd and puerile , one ca n't help but wonder if Amenabar feels embarrassed now when he watches this . If he does n't , he certainly should . This is total ' amateur night at the slasher house ' stuff.<br /><br />Overall I ca n't believe I wasted two whole hours ( it felt like at least six ) on this , just hoping something might happen . The urban legend of ' snuff films ' ( and that is basically all they are , despite the way this film tries to suggest they 're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world ! ) is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films ( " Videodrome " anyone ? ) but it 's so easy to step over the line into childlike ' would n't it be cool if ! ' territory with it ( ie : " My Little Eye " ) ... " Tesis " hits an all - time low for the ' snuff movie ' genre . On every level , this one is better left dead and buried . I 'll award it a 1 out of 10 , for some nice lighting , but that 's all it 's getting .
0 Best of the Best 4 , is better than 3 , but just barely . Basically , I say this because part 4 does n't contradict parts 1/2 ( like 3 does ) , ( ie . their is no reference to Tommy Lee having siblings).<br /><br />Anyway , I liked the Russian plot line of the story , and especially Sven Ole - Thorsen 's bit part as Boris . Aside from that though and a few fighting scenes , the movie is nothing special . The limited budget is also very noticeable ( especially in the airplane blow - up scene).<br /><br />Also , part 4 does not really have a moral or say anything like part 3 did , there are a couple of more better known actors ( Hudson , Thorsen ) in part 4 , but alas nothing like the beginning of the series ( and even these characters have very small roles).<br /><br />Alas , it seems Best of the Best is the Rhee show , and to be truthful , he can not carry a movie.<br /><br />Saw on tape , Rating:4
0 believe it or not , this movie is worse than number three.it's slower , the acting is worse , and the story is very weak.there is n't a lot of good to say about this movie.even the fight scenes are more dull than number three , and i would have thought that impossible.this is a very slow 90 minutes.painful,in fact.i stuck it through , hoping it would get better.if you really want to see this movie , you should try to find a cheap rental of it.it is hard to find(for purchase , that is)and probably for good reason.like number three , this movie has nothing to do with the first two.it is the same in name only.anyway,the most i can give Best of the Best : Without Warning is 2/10
0 I am a fan of the previous Best of the Best films . But this one was awful . No wonder I had such a hard time finding it . I tried 4 video rental stores , until I found one with a copy of this movie . The acting was terrible , the plot was a joke , and the action was bad as well.<br /><br />I really miss Alex Grady , Travis Brigley , and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this film had with the first 2 movies.<br /><br />John
0 A text prologue warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our house , but I think the more apt word is " entropy . " Good grief , what slobs these two babes are!<br /><br />George ( Seymour Cassell ) is alone in his San Francisco office and his monstrously expensive home in Tiburon while his wife and child are away in San Diego . Two girls ( Sondra Locke as Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna ) knock on his door , asking directions . Well , it 's raining , and they 're shivering like two drenched pitiful kittens , and they 're not sure of the address they 're looking for , and , what with one thing and another , George invites them to come in and partake of his pizza by the fire . All three of them wind up in George 's bath tub and there follows about five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure , triple exposure , quadruple exposure , and dodekakuple exposure . They spend the night in a threesome and the next morning the girls fix him breakfast . But something has gotten slightly cockeyed because Georgie 's guests gobble everything down with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup all over the linen and -- " You eat like ANIMALS ! " , George exclaims and tells them to get out . In his dreams . < br /><br />Now , do n't get me wrong . Sondra Locke is an extraordinary looking young blond with cobalt - blue eyes and Colleen Camp bounces around like a superball . You got ta say , they breed 'em mighty cute down there in Shelbyville , Tennessee , where Locke comes from , and they breed 'em with bodacious tushes too , as we ca n't help but note after the first five or ten minutes.<br /><br />But when the girls go berserk , so does the movie . The film is thereafter bathed in a garish green light . The pair put on ghoulish makeup and make gargoyle faces at themselves in the mirrors . They brain a delivery boy and then drown him to make sure . They cuss up a storm and smash windows and furniture . They have one of those scenes in which two people sit across the table from one another , licking food and then jumping each other 's bones . < br /><br />And Georgie ? They first render Georgie unconscious with mace ( which contains nothing that you ca n't find in that little red bottle of McIlheny 's Tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet ) , tie him up , pour flour and milk all over him , subject him to a psychotic trial , put him through one of those Tolstoy - type semi - executions , slap him around , dress up in outlandish costumes , then prance out on him and his virtually destroyed upper - middle - class home , and are dispatched by a delivery van ex machina.<br /><br />As for the acting , it 's as if someone had told Georgie , " First act polite to these girls , then act panicked after you 're tied up . " And to the girls : " First act shy , unwilling to impose on anyone , then act crazy . " And that 's it . < br /><br />The photography and location work are straight out of a 1970s porn movie . I 'm not sure that suggests a total lack of skill . It takes effort and talent to turn San Francisco ugly . The score gives us two Leitmotivs . Georgie 's is some pop tune with lyrics about " being free " and " giving in . " Jackson and Donna 's is a catchy rinky - tink thing called " My Good Old Dad . " < br /><br />I approve of the moral lesson behind the story , though . There are some things you should simply not give in to , even though they might look like a lot of fun at first . All very educational .
0 So this guy named George is sitting home alone on his birthday when two women show up . George 's wife is at a hospital taking care of their son so when the wife is away George gets in the bubble bath and makes love to both of the girls . It is n't that great of a scene because it really does n't show anything . After that the birthday boy wakes up the next morning and the girls are still at his house . They make him a nice breakfast but George is n't hungry . George is n't very happy and he tries to ditch them but when he gets home the girls are still at his house . The girls have had enough with old George and no longer want to cook for them . They both turn out to be major psychopaths and use George in their little crazy game . I liked that the girls just did what they wanted and messed up George 's house . George was n't really that great to his two guests . When George said he was a married man , he really did n't seem to mean it . George looked like Tom Tucker on Family Guy . I was for the two girls the whole time .
0 This is an atrocious movie . Two demented young women seduce and torture a middle aged man . There 's not much to give away in regards to a plot or a " spoiler " . I would only comment that the ending is nearly the most preposterous part of the flick . Much of the film involves Locke and Camp cackling obnoxiously , all the while grinning psychotically at the camera . Add to this a soundtrack that repeats again and again , including a vaudevillian song about " dear old dad " that suggests an incestuous quality the viewer never really sees . The music is annoying at first , then ends up subjecting the viewer to a torture worse than that depicted on the screen . The theme here is of youth run amok , understandable as a reaction to the ' 60s , but done with little imagination or style . Avoid it !
0 I guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story .... It 's about two young girls who molest a grown man for 48hrs . ; I do n't see where the terror comes into play here .... There are some " weird ' and " surreal " sequences in the movie . And the two girls ( Sandra Locke and ... ah ... oh well ) play the roll of two psycho - man haters to the hilt ... they do a pretty good job ( although some of it is just a tad over the top ) . The movie 's not good , and it 's not horrible ; it 's just really really dated ! I mean this thing is dripping with the 70 's .... It 's not really bad if you like that sort of thing ... you know ... that thang ?
0 This 1977 cult movie has two crazed lesbians ( Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp ) appearing at the home of wealthy socialite Doctor George Manning ( Seymour Cassel ) , in hope of help in locating a residence they ca n't seem to find . But these two have other plans in mind , when they find out George 's wife is out of town , they end up taking control of the residence , tying up the George , killing a delivery boy while destroying the place all in one evening . Bizarre and disturbing movie , but the two get there just reward in the same bizarre way as the movie ends . Most will either dislike it right off or get caught up in this ludicrous movie after about 30 minutes into it . Either way some even consider this a cult classic.<br /><br />Larry Dodson
0 There is a lot of talk of torture these days . That 's all this movie is . It 's about a good person who makes a bad decision . Because of his kindness , he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women . From then on its a just - for - kicks assault on him . I do n't know at what point you do something about it . There is a wife and child out there somewhere ; he has great feelings of guilt and fear . But there should have been some times when he could have acted . The movie seems to be somebody 's joke . I suppose in the wake of the Manson murders , we had a bit of a fixation on the likes of these two . Nevertheless , why would someone make a film like this ? What appeals does it have except for sadism . The conclusion is totally unsatisfying , but that could have been remedied with an obvious plot twist . Oh , well . Another hour and a half of my life .
0 I 've been trying to track down this film just by googling bad phrases about " teenagers seduce and kill man in his house " and such . I think I first saw parts of this film when I was about 10 years old when it was running on cable . It made quite an impression ! It 's the kind of film that kids know they should n't be watching , and switch the channel when their parents come in . When I saw who the cast was , I could n't believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie . Then again , if you like to see men who cheat on their wives get murdered , then this is an interesting film . Also , if I recall , there 's some pretty interesting pseudo - lesbian moments . Probably the dumbest ending of all time , but still ... memorable .
0 Way back when I was renting videos for free I picked this one up . OOPS The things I wanted to mention outside the summary already given were these . 1 : Someone who had a lot to do with making this movie had a strange and sick fascination for food , it was gross and unecessary . 2 : There is some kind of a soundtrack in the background of the film that seems to be there the entire time and by the way I felt for days after viewing this trash I figure they had something subliminal going on in the track . Either that or it was just traumatisingly bad or both . Many times throughout the movie you can tell the writer and director did not have much experience or talent . And do n't even ask about the acting .
0 This utterly dull , senseless , pointless , spiritless , and dumb movie is n't the final proof that the world can forget about Danny Boyle and his post-"Trainspotting " movies : " The Beach " already took care of that . What this low - budget oddity does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs , booze , ego , self - delusion , bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once - promising director 's quick demise.<br /><br />The premise is absurd : two losers ( Ecclestone and some bimbo Jenna G - a rapper , likely ) meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with fervour more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit - making duo - which they become . A friend of theirs - an even bigger illiterate loser - becomes their manager by smashing a store window and stealing a video - camera by which he films them in " action " , and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage . Now , I know that the UK in recent years has put out incredible junk , but this is ridiculous ; the music makes Oasis seem like The Beatles . During the studio recordings , the duo - Strumpet - change lyrics in every take and Ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it , and quite absurdly they do take it . Not only is the music total and utter trash , but its " performers " are anti - social ; these NEWCOMERS are supposed to be calling the shots . It 's just too dumb . It 's plain awful.<br /><br />The dialog is unfunny and goes nowhere , and this rags - to - bitches story has no point and makes no sense . It often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs . Danny Boyle is a complete idiot . This little piece of trash is so bad it 's embarrassing to watch . Ecclestone 's I.Q. also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense . Whoever financed this ¬£ 1000 joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their own underwear on street corners .
0 Story of a good - for - nothing poet and a sidekick singer who puts his words to music . Director Danny Boyle has lost none of his predilection for raking in the gutter of humanity for characters but he has lost , in this film , the edge for creating inspiring and funny films . Strumpet is painful to watch and barely justified by the fact that it was made for TV .
0 The plot of this film is not strong at all , lots of holes . If you approach it as a car movie its not bad , lots of great cars in this one . The reason I like it is because I am from the area where this was filmed . I get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and seeing how the town has changed since 89 . Its an interesting historical piece for us locals . Seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it . It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on VHS . Had to get a copy from Japan on Ebay I find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town . I did n't know the director was from St . Cloud .
0 Wow ! I remember so many awful films that loosely revolved around high school from the early 1980s . They usually had someincredibly strained plot and lots of 27 year old actors pretending to be students . As I watched this film I felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s . However , then I find out that this film was made in 1989 ? Say what ! Well , the nostalgia factor ends right there , this is just bad . The plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools . Which is odd , in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant . In fact , the main character lives in a mansion . Makes you wonder how they can not find money to keep this school alive , have they never heard of property taxes . Oh , but here is the kicker . The school board says that they will keep the school alive , if the students can raise $ 200,000 . So the seniors go about doing this . Hmmm , you raise $ 200,000 but instead of saving that for college , you put it towards saving the high school that you are a Senior in ? And why exactly would they close an overpopulated school before the year is out ? And ... ahh forget it , this film was stupid and made in 1989 ! ?
0 This film has been receiving a lot of play lately during the day on either HBO or Cinemax . The reason is that they are assuming people would be interested in comparing it to the Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks caper of the same name . The only reason to see it is for the attractive Matt Lattanzi . Yum ! Although I must say Matt was more than a little long in the tooth to be playing a high schooler . If he were a woman , they 'd have had him playing the MOTHER of a high schooler ! ( Is is just me , or is his daughter starting to look like Shelley Duvall ? ) Oh yeah , the plot -- who cares ? Typical teen highjinx played by adults .
0 [ * * * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * * * ] This movie 's reputation precedes it , so it was with anticipation that I sat down to watch it in letterbox on TCM . What a major disappointment.<br /><br />The cast is superb and the production values are first - rate , but the characters are without depth , the plot is thin , and the whole thing goes on too long . For a movie that deals with alcoholism , family divisions , unfaithfulness , gambling , and sexual repression , the movie is curiously flat , prosaic , lifeless , and cliche - ridden . One example is the portrayal of Frank Hirsch 's unfaithfuness : his rather heavy - handed request to his wife to " go upstairs and relax a bit " followed by her predictable pleading of a headache , leads - even more predictably - to his evening liaison with his secretary ( " hey Nancy , I 've got the blues tonight . Let 's go for a drive " ) , all according to well - worn formula . We do n't feel these are real people , but cardboard cutouts acting in a marionette play . Also , the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never really explored or explained . Dave 's infatuation with the on - again / off - again Gwen is inexplicable in light of her fatuous inability to defecate or get off the pot . His subsequent marriage of desperation to the Shirley Maclaine / Ginny character is , from the moment of its being presented to this viewer , anyway , obviously doomed to fail , and it was clear - by the conventions of this type of soap opera - that it could only be resolved by someone being killed . The moment the jealous lover started running around with the gun I started a bet with myself as to who - Dave or Ginny - would get killed . The whole thing was phony with a capital ' P ' . < br /><br />Having said that , Maclaine 's performance and that of Dean Martin are the standouts here . But on the whole I find the movie 's interest to be purely that of a period piece of Hollywood history .
0 But I doubt many were running to see this movie . Or " Some Came Running Out Of The Cinema " . Okay , that 's a bit harsh.<br /><br />The film starts in an unintentionally comical way : Frankie - boy comes back to his hometown after many years ( this already smells of clich√©s ) and the whole town is shaken by his arrival : he is talked about , everyone wants to talk to him , and every woman he meets flirts with him like there 's no tomorrow - even his niece hints that she would gladly have dropped her date to chat with Frankie - boy a little longer ! Even his pretty niece wants a piece of him ! Sounds like one of those laughable " Mike Hammer " episodes where EVERY single female wants Stacey Keach . And , like Stacey Keach , Frankie - boy is anything but a good - looking woman 's wet dream . In real life , someone like Sinatra ( without the fame ) would n't get within 100 m of someone as beautiful as MacLaine . But in this Hollywood movie it 's the other way around : MacLaine is absolutely nuts about Frankie - boy , but HE could n't care less ! Sinatra plays his " cool " shtick much too often in his movies , and it is rarely credible . Dean Martin is kind of miscast ; he is n't miscast as a card - player , but rather because of the accent which simply does n't suit him . MacLaine is charming as ever , but she plays a caricature - and this reliance on caricatures is one of the basic problems with the film . The main characters are all some sort of stereotypes out of bad or seen - it - all - before movies and cheap novels ; Frankie is the " cool cat " who comes back to town to get all the women , and he could n't care less about his writing ( which , predictably , eventually garners recognition ) ; Martin is a sleazy but friendly card - player ; MacLaine is the dumb , but very likable bimbo ; Frankie 's blond love - interest is a snotty literary expert ; Frankie 's brother is the successful guy who married into his wife 's business and has a lousy marriage ; and so on . Clich√©s.<br /><br />The story contains a couple of coincidences which are a little too far - fetched for my taste : Frankie just happens to bump into his niece in a locale ; his niece just happens to be meters away from her daddy when the latter kisses his secretary for the FIRST time ; and then there is the awful , stupid ending.<br /><br />In it , a drunk guy bent on killing Frankie - boy somehow manages to find him in a carnival of all places ! The place is utterly crowded , with the typical noise and chaos - plus it 's happening in the evening - and yet the guy somehow finds Frankie ( in spite of being drunk as a doorknob ) and shoots at him . But guess who he kills ? MacLaine . She jumps in front of the bullet to save Frankie : a clich√© which comic - book writers might cringe at . This utterly pathetic , over - dramatic , and annoying ending certainly can not please any , even semi - intelligent , viewer . And this happens on the same day that MacLaine and Sinatra got married ! The writer of this nonsense seems to have read crappy dime novels his whole life - how else is the writing of this movie to be explained ? There is even a card game in which a brawl ensues with Frankie & Martin vs. some clich√© caricatures out of the writer 's " vivid " imagination . ( It was like a damn Western suddenly . ) Another dumb thing is the way Sinatra was crazy about the boring snotty - nosed bimbo and pretty much ignored MacLaine . As the movie progresses we find out that Sinatra finds MacLaine to be too dumb for him , just as the blond bimbo finds Sinatra to be too low - class for her . There is a certain snobbism and disdain to be detected in the script regarding MacLaine . MacLaine is treated as worthless by everyone , while the blond bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellectual ; the ironic truth is that the latter 's character comes off as rather dumb and not at all as intellectual ; her behaviour , comments , and opinions are mostly clich√©d , silly , confused , pretentious , and primitive . At least MacLaine 's character KNOWS that she ( MacLaine ) is dumb . There is another irony that I did n't fail to notice : Sinatra had trouble finding an ending for his latest story - much like the writer of this movie , and that 's why he came up with the corny , crappy finale.<br /><br />The film basically has a solid cast , and the photography is nice , but the script , though sometimes okay , relies to heavily on silly nonsense instead of on reality - based characters and events.<br /><br />If you 're interested in reading my " biographies " of Shirley MacLaine and other Hollywood intellectuals , contact me by e - mail .
0 Poor performances by Sinatra , Martin and Hyer . Grossly underdeveloped supporting characters . Annoying talky with no real plot . Ending leaves you flatter than a pancake , with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels ( that is , if you even cared about these wooden characters ) . MacLaine is the only real asset . That penultimate sequence in which the " Chicago hood " searches for the Sinatra character is laughable . The music in that sequence also is poor . And in the final scene when Martin 's character removes his hat for the woman he called a " pig , " almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen .
0 Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time ; Meet Me in St Louis , The Bad and the Beautiful . I awaited this movie with great interest . But what a disappointment . < br /><br />Some Came Running is scene after scene of go - nowhere fatalism . Sinatra is a sad sack , returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships , a disappointing floozy hanging on him , living in disappointing digs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project . The movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens . The sequence is intended to be tension - filled but Minelli is no Hitchcock ; he gets so distracted by pretty colors , he does n't notice the scene is a wheezing clich√© and the characters are so thinly - drawn and poorly developed we do n't particularly care that they get shot . ( especially MacClane ) But that 's the only real cinematography in the project . Otherwise we look at constipated characters standing around bars & living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours . Hell IS other people , apparently.<br /><br />There is nothing going on in this movie . The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after WW2 is handled more deftly in ' The Best Years of Our Lives . ' And either of two Inge products , ' Splendor in the Grass ' and ' Picnic ' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead - end town , with much more poignance .
0 Frank Sinatra plays a no - goodnik ex - soldier and frustrated writer , hard - living and hard - drinking , who returns to his Midwestern hometown and reunites with his estranged brother ( Arthur Kennedy ) , now the town big - shot with a disinterested wife and headstrong daughter . Frank gets involved with gambler Dean Martin , uneducated flooze Shirley MacLaine , and has some run - ins with the law , but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman . Over - simplified drama verging on soap opera , with a role for MacLaine that is by turns overly ' colorful ' and embarrassingly sentimental ( her drunken belting on " After You 've Gone " is however the film 's highlight , and is expertly handled ) . Director Vincente Minnelli oversees it in straight - forward fashion , but he 's in surprisingly glum spirits and most of the big scenes are flat or dense . The picture looks incredibly handsome in widescreen , with a nice eye for detail and composition , but the story and these characters are stuck in the dregs . * * from * * * *
0 OK , I have watched the original French version . But I ca n't imagine this being better with subtitles.<br /><br />All I have to say that this is the most boring movie I have seen in a long time . There are almost no redeeming qualities to this film . That 's why I ca n't understand all the positive reviews . It might be realistic in a sense but some real stories are best left untold.<br /><br />I usually like slow paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie . Tarkovsky 's Solaris is extremely slow paced but it allows introspection and sets the mood of the film for example . But in this case , the movie is just filed with mindless dialog that manage to tell us little about the characters . None of which I could identify with or care for . In a lot of the scenes I found myself thinking : " When are they going to shut up " ? The acting was pretty bad . Not in an overacting obvious kind of way . But It seems none of the actors cared about their characters and they all looked like they wanted to be elsewhere in most of the scenes . This might be due to the uninspired dialog they were given . Also the whole flow of the movie felt quite mechanical . Going from one scene to the next . It seems this movie was just written ( badly ) but never directed.<br /><br />This is one of the few films that I can say generated no emotional response from any of the scenes . No suspense , no fear , no anticipation , no sorrow , no introspection , no intellectual stimulation , no interest what so ever.<br /><br />A perfect example of what I call an anti - movie .
0 Please , spare me of these movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified . Couple that with a vacuous script with an intense desire to be a Farrelly or a Coen brother , plus the lives of yet ANOTHER group of supposedly high school age people acting out their Dawson Creek - brand teen angst complete with a GenXYZ soundtrack that woefully tries to make the movie " feel " cool and , we have intensely and painfully inept satire.<br /><br />This is n't even watered - down ' Ferris Bueller' ... I'd rather watch a traffic light change.<br /><br />Only one scene stands out as anywhere near worth the price of admission : when the Betty Masked girls meet a Richard Nixon Masked friend . It 's a surreal moment . Priceless even.<br /><br />But for the rest of it , I 'd rather have a toothache . At least I can apply some Benzocaine(tm ) to stop the pain .
0 I tried to watch this movie three separate times . The night I rented it . Got through about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if I had a night 's rest . Watched 15 more the next day , almost vomited at how stupid it was ... It was n't even funny stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just crap with a capital S ( if you know what I mean in the censored world we live in ) . And finally on the third day I watched over an hour of the dumb thing and I did n't enjoy one single moment ! Not even one . How did this script get greenlighted . Oh boy!<br /><br />G < br /><br />1/10 - the one is for cheerleaders ... they deserve at least something for all their hardwork .
0 I ca n't believe it that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life . i laughed a couple of times . ( probably because of how stupid it was ) If someone paid me to see that movie again i would n't . the plot was so horrible , it made no sense , and the acting was so bad that i could n't even tell if they were trying . that movie was terrible rating : F
0 I wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV . I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40 . I regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when I could of saw something better . The beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches . They exaggerated the way love works in reality . All of the girls were stereo types . The boyfriend was too stupid for his own age . The passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs . The bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies . Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks . Hey why did n't they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead ? It might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie . This movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed . This movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive Christian people nuts . Hey I even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but I but there was never any . So I rate this movie b which stands for low budgeted and 1 out of ten stars .
0 Sugar & Spice is one of the worst movies of 2001 . The film tries to cross Heathers and Bring It On and fails . When I saw last January I was so disgusted by the film that I walked and talked on my cell phone to my girlfriend for the last half hour of the movie . I 've heard that the DVD has a director 's cut maybe I 'll check it out , but this PG-13 trash movie is s * * * and the worst kind of s***. Maybe if the film had some T&A that would 've have made it okay . But the gags are lame and the acting is horrible . Worse than a Troma film .
0 The storyplot was okay by itself , but the film felt very bubbly and fake . It also had the worst ending . They were probably going for a surprise ending , but all it did was leave me the question of what the whole point of the story was . All other teen movies are better than this one .
0 This movie looked like it was going to be really funny . I was very excited to see it but was very disappointed . It was very unrealistic . The plot was also pretty weak . I was expecting it to be really funny but the jokes were n't even that good . I was also really disappointed with the ending . I would not recommend this movie to anyone .
0 I always get frustrated by films that were obviously written by one gender . Especially when they obviously do n't do enough research to find out when something not only does n't ring true , but rings blatently false.<br /><br />The scene I am remembering is the one in the bathroom where Jack tells his football teammates that he got Diane pregnant . In no way , shape , or form would a guy ever cheer another guy getting a girl pregnant in high school . They might cheer about the guy having sex with the hot cheerleader , but I can also guarantee that the first the football team heard about it would not be at a urinal.<br /><br />It was obvious that this film did n't take itself so seriously , and it was n't hideously bad , but come on !
0 Ah yes , the VS series , MVC2 being the pinnacle . It 's been said before , this is what you get when half of the crew fell asleep on the job , unfortunately the gameplay half did . Do n't get me wrong , this is fun , but you get tired of mashing buttons . As for the plot summary , AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA ... There is no plot . Beat that guy at the end and win ! Eh , who plays this by their self anyway ?
0 I 'm not going to criticize the movie . There is n't that much to talk about . It has good animal actions scenes which were probably pretty astonishing at the time . Clyde Beatty is n't exactly a matin√©e idol . He 's a little slight and not particularly good looking . But that 's OK . He 's the man in that lion cage . We know that when he ca n't take the time away from his lions to tend to his girlfriend , he will end up on an island with her and have to save the day . Someone said earlier that it is a history lesson . The scenes at the circus are of another day , especially the kids who hang around . I did n't realize that even back in the thirties , they sailed on three masted schooners . It looked like something out of 1860 . I guess that 's the stock footage they had . No wonder the thing got wrecked . They 're always talking about fixing her up . There 's even a dirigible . It tells us a little about male female relationships at the time , a kind of giggly silliness . But if you do n't take it too seriously , you can have fun watching it .
0 The only reason I watched this film was because I had recently read Robert Hough 's less than perfect , but interesting , fictionalised account of the life of Big Cat trainer Mabel Stark . Beaty appears as a character in the book , in a less than flattering light.<br /><br />I had n't realised until checking the movie out later on the IMDb that it was originally a serial . Whoever edited the original running time of 233 minutes down to the 68 minuted version available on DVD has done a hell of a good job . The shortened version plays just as well as any B movie of the period despite the many ' duh - what ? ' moments . For instance are we really expected to believe our hero dug that twenty foot deep tiger trap in a morning without even getting his jodhpurs dirty ? Looking over the chapter titles I see that number five is titled " Gorilla Warfare " and number eleven is called " The Gorilla " . There were no gorillas at all in the movie . I guess that 's where some of the cuts were made.<br /><br />Historicaly interesting .
0 Also known in a different form as " House of Exorcism , " this messy < br /><br />little film takes itself so seriously as to kill any entertainment value < br /><br />whatsoever.<br /><br />The spare plot involves European tourist Elke Sommer who has a < br /><br />chance run in with Telly Savalas , who looks just like the devil she < br /><br />saw on a fresco in the square . Sommer is given a ride to a < br /><br />mysterious house in the country , where Savalas happens to be < br /><br />butler . There , she is mistaken for a long dead woman , and the real < br /><br />soap opera theatrics begin . The house 's blind matriarch's < br /><br />husband had an affair with the dead woman , who was the < br /><br />matriarch 's son 's fiancee . The couple who gave Sommer the ride?<br /><br />Well , the woman is giving the chauffeur , uh , " back seat driving < br /><br />lessons , " and the husband knows and does not care . Eventually,<br /><br />most of the cast is killed , Sommer is drugged and raped,<br /><br />escapes , and the viewer is taken to a climax on board an empty < br /><br />airplane ... which must have resembled the empty theaters this < br /><br />thing played in.<br /><br />The alternate version of this , " House of Exorcism , " has scenes < br /><br />added involving a priest.<br /><br />The VHS copy of this , from Elite Entertainment , is crystal clear and < br /><br />letterboxed . There are " extras " after the end credits ; deleted sex < br /><br />and gore scenes.<br /><br />Mario Bava 's direction is fast and furious , but his screenplay is < br /><br />awful . There are half baked ideas , abandoned plotlines , and < br /><br />stunning conveniences that do nothing more than propel this thing < br /><br />in some sort of forward direction . You have life like dummies for < br /><br />practice funerals , the blind matriarch does not act all that blind,<br /><br />and Savalas is given the same lollipops he had in " Kojak , " ( who < br /><br />haunts ya , baby?).<br /><br />The project seems like they had two name stars , then wrote the < br /><br />script quickly , something that happens in Hollywood on a daily < br /><br />occurrence now . Savalas looks completely lost , delivering his < br /><br />lines haltingly , and wishing his character had not died in " The Dirty < br /><br />Dozen . " Sommer runs around and screams and gasps a lot , but < br /><br />her character is a blank , I use the term " character " loosely . The < br /><br />only thing we know about her is her name.<br /><br />This is a real weird film , and your reaction to it might depend on < br /><br />how heavily you are into Eurohorror , and Kojak . I for one cannot < br /><br />recomment " Lisa and the Devil." < br /><br />This is unrated , and including all the extras at the end of the VHS < br /><br />copy , contains strong physical violence , sexual violence , strong < br /><br />gore , strong female nudity , male nudity , sexual content , and adult < br /><br />situations
0 This movie was bizarre , completely inexplicable , and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a big empty house . I really love the opening stuff with Lisa wandering about lost in a gorgeous city . I want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic European locale , though maybe not in a low budget horror flick . Definitely get the ending where there are the strangely non - sexual sex scenes that were cut out ( in my DVD copy anyway ) . Do n't attempt to understand it , just go along and watch out for the weird bits ... which is everything . Do n't watch this if you actually want plot or characterization or anything at all to make sense . Pretty beautiful , though you may just give up on this and decide to watch an actual horror movie , like say , Dead Alive .
0 This is the page for " House of Exorcism " , but most people have confused this film with the Mario Bava masterpiece , " Lisa & the Devil " , which explains the ridiculously high rating for this , " House of exorcism . " When " Lisa & the Devil " was shown at film festivals in the early 70 's , it was a critical success . Audiences responded well to that gorgeous , Gothic horror film . Unfortunately it was a bit ahead of it 's time , and was considered too unusual , and not commercial enough for mass consumption . No distributor would buy it . So producer Alfredo Leone decided to edit ' Lisa ' , seemingly with a chainsaw , by removing just about half of the original film , and adding new scenes , which he filmed two years after the original product ! It is important to note that Bava had little to do with these new , hideous additions , so technically " House of Exorcism " is not a Bava film . The original product is a slow , dreamy , classy production . A few minutes into the film , the viewer is jarred out of this dream world , as suddenly we see Lisa , ( two years older , and with a very different haircut ) , begin to writhe on the ground , making guttural sounds and croaking epitaphs like " suck my co@k " , etc . Subtle , huh ? And the film continues like this , jumping back and forth between a beautiful , visual film , and a grade Z " Exorcist " rip - off . Leone was trying to incorporate these shock scenes , while keeping some semblance of a story intact . He failed miserably . When the choice was made to basically destroy " Lisa and the devil " , Bava himself refused , saying that his film was too beautiful to cut . He was right , and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and flushed down the toilet . It was many years before the original " Lisa and the Devil " was seen again , re - surfacing on late night television . I had seen " lisa " long before i saw this new version , and it was downright disturbing to witness one of my favorite films " vandalised " in this way . Worth seeing only for curiosity sake . Otherwise avoid this insidious disaster like the plague .
0 This movie is really bad . The acting is plain awful except Michael Ironside . I do n't get the story . Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two Mc - gangs . He comes to a town and suddenly he is choosened to fight against the bad people who wants indian - land . At the cover it said he was a indian himself that returned too his home - town , I did n't hear that in the movie , if so it was n't clear.<br /><br />Richard Grieco was one hell of a bad actor . Stiff and ugly . He said his lines like it too . And we would n't talk about Sean Young , she hasn ' been any of my favourite actors but in this movie she plays a indian women who falls in love with Bolt ( Grieco ) . She is awful.<br /><br />When I rented it I choosed between this and Subterfuge with Amanda Pays . I choosed this one because of Michael Ironside was in the cast . Maybe I should have taken Subterfuge.<br /><br />Don't see this unless you think Richard Grieco looks tough on a motorbike with sunglasses.<br /><br />I will soon uptade the cast - list because I have it at home . I wrote it down after I seen the movie .
0 I thought the movie was a poor documentary . Nothing of substance was discussed . It seemed to cheapen the ideas and did not provide anything new . The film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science . Most scientists appeared " stereotyped " and sometimes weird . A woman said that her awards did n't matter a whole lot , only children that were helped . She said that after a 10 minute scene where she explained all her awards . Playing " humble scientist " , are we ? " I have equations dancing in my head , " another said . I do n't see how that explains anything to us . It has n't covered significant effects of science on our culture . Politics of science were barely touched.<br /><br />Not a bad flick for a 10 - 14 year - olds . Other than that , I felt it was boring and unrevealing.<br /><br />4/10
0 When I look for new cars , I expect not to be shown boats . When I drink fountain Coke , I should expect that the drink contains Coke . When I watch a movie that embellishes itself with the name of en excellent scientist , I expect that it is in some way relevant to that person or their work . This could have been people discussing my grannys ' diary . The material covered is relevant only in that they vaguely tirade science . I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it , & the second time I stopped watching it.<br /><br />I love science & documentaries . I would rather watch them over the latest blockbuster . However this falls far short of providing anything worth your time ¬ñ Avoid at all costs .
0 you have a strong stomach . Holden was actually 55 years old at filming but looked near 70 and he only lived another 8 years . At one point Holden said , " I am over twice your age . " Okay , try triple grandpa ! The " old enough to be your father " theme they were shooting for did n't work . Granted senior citizens sometimes wind up with legal teens . More power to them , but that does n't mean I want to watch it . It 's not a matter of judgment but the digestive track . I like my food where it belongs . Lenz is fun to watch and the 70s cars , clothes , furniture , etc . make it worth it if it comes on cable late at night and you want to watch something to wind down for bed . It would have been nice to see the blonde friend of Lenz , the one who hocked her guitar , get more scenes . Pleasingly spacey ... Who was this chick ? I 'm going to try and find out .
0 Trifling romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood about the loving relationship which grows between a comely hippie ( Kay Lenz ) and a Los Angeles real estate agent in his golden years ( William Holden , surprisingly affable within this highly - concocted arrangement ) . The script is slight but not without some thoughtful passages ; still , the scenario is such a middle - aged clich√© by now that most of the picture comes off as puerile . It may have worked much better with different leads : Holden and Lenz do n't match up well ( her stature is so slight he seems to tower over her ) , making their intimate scenes less stirring than simply uncomfortable . Dated , blurry - romantic , and mostly unmemorable . * * from * * * *
0 This is a terrible film , and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotion . The characters are uninflected , obviously drawn , predictable and the story line is obvious and typical Hollywood wish fulfillment.<br /><br />William Holden ( so sad to see him in this role ) was 55 when this film was made , but he 's playing someone in his early 40s and looks like he 's in his 60s . Kay Lenz was 20 and was scripted to find him irresistibly attractive . I think the dog they found by the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection.<br /><br />Holden 's character -- the same age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this film , ( not ) coincidentally -- is placed with obvious trappings of 60s pre - hippie cool : the bachelor pad , the swinging hi - fi , the lunches at Yamashiro . But the film is ridiculously uncool , a clanging claptrap of old fogies desperately wishing that the free spirits they saw on Sunset and in Laurel Canyon would find them and their big honkin ' cars sexy.<br /><br />Ugh . Youth culture was never that desperate . And I shudder to think that Bill Holden was so desperate for youth that he took this embarrassing part .
0 The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood , whose work I admire immensely . The leads had absolutely no chemistry . Not for a second could I believe that there was anything deeper than lust between them . The story just did n't ring true . Add to that stilted conversation , tons of stereotypes , and an incredibly slow plot that basically leads nowhere , and you 've got yourself a real stinker . Kay Lenz 's nude scenes might be worthwhile for those seeking some salacious fare , but otherwise this is a colossal waste of time . My thoughts as I watched the movie was that itwould have been better titled " Cheesy . "
0 This ludicrous film offers the standard 1970 's " hippie mentality " in a nut shell and bores us in the process . Its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young , innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups . A naive young hippy played by the waif - like ( Kay Lenz ) hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys , and then one day she meets the ridiculous ( Holden ) , already in old age , hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor , and she decides that she is in " love " with him . If you think that is superficial , the whole film encapsulates such scenes . She keeps saying how much she " loves " him and she only met him , it wears thin and really quick . I could n't help but laugh throughout the film . Its obvious she 's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place . A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex , I had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit . A corny offering of music from the 70 's is also spread through the film . Avoid this if you can . Grade D.
0 One star for the " plot " . One star for the acting . One star for the dubbing into squeaky - voiced American . Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow , with their propensity for taking all their clothes off . And ten out of ten for the divine Emmanuelle B√©art , two years before she made ' Manon des sources ' . B√©art also undresses a couple of times , but even fully - clothed her presence is enough to make this film eminently watchable . Watch out for the scene where she tells her friend about the three " first times " for a girl . It 's corny , but still far more erotic than the rather laughably choreographed " love scenes " featuring Broeke , Granzow and Patrick Bauchau . Incidentally , the cinematography is not great ; the stills for the closing credits are a better indication of what David Hamilton is capable of .
0 This film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control . It 's exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures . For once Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots . However , what I found hard to take about the film was that although Anja Sch√ºte was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are . This whole Lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy . The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is . Come on , sex is a nice past time- between consenting adults . Another thing I found odd was that neither Beart nor Sch√ºte have a nude scene in the film , well , not a proper one at least .
0 This is complete and absolute garbage , a fine example of what a BAD movie is like , this ca n't be appealing to anyone , not even b - movie fans . Do not , I repeat , DO NOT waste precious time of your life on this piece of trash . Bad acting , bad directing , horrible ( but I mean really horrible ) script , and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment ( of any form ) is . I bought the DVD for 3 dollars , I swear I could almost pay someone to take it . Burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me . I like b - movies , the killer toys , the weird lagoon monsters , but this is nowhere near . You know those movies that are so bad they are funny ? Not even . Just plain old pathetic .
0 In theory , films should be a form of entertainment . While this excludes documentaries and other experimental forms of film - making ; most movies , specially genre films , must not only tell it 's story or message , they must entertain their target audience in some way . All this just to say that in my opinion a bad movie is not a movie with low production values or low - budget , a bad movie is one that is boring.<br /><br />"Hellborn " or " Asylum of the Damned " as is known in the U.S. , is a bad movie simply because it is just not involving , and irremediably boring and tiresome . While it has a very good premise , it is just poorly developed and the mediocre acting does n't make things better . On another hands the film probably could had been a fine or even classic B - movie , but here it is just a bad attempt at film - making.<br /><br />Director Philip J. Jones tells the tale of James Bishop ( Matt Stasi ) , a young psychiatry resident , who just got his dream job at St. Andrew Mental Hospital ; but the old asylum seems to hide a secret . After the mysterious death of some patients and the constant rumors of satanic practices , James decides to find out what is going on ; only to find the incredulity of his boss , Dr. McCort ( Bruce Payne ) , who believes that Bishop is going as insane as his patients.<br /><br />While the premise is quite interesting , the execution of the film leaves a lot to be desired . In an attempt of making a supernatural psychological thriller , Jones goes for the easy way out and makes a movie filled with every clich√© of the genre . Of course , there are lots of great movies that are also filled with clich√©s ; but in " Hellborn " every single one is wasted and turned into a cheap jump scare to keep things moving , resulting in a boring and predictable storyline.<br /><br />The acting is quite mediocre for the most part , with one big exception : Bruce Payne gives a top - notch performance that makes the movie look unworthy of such good acting . Matt Stasi is very weak as the lead character and the rest of the cast make forgettable performances.<br /><br />Despite all this flaws , one thing has to be written about " Hellborn " ; it has a visual look very good for the budget and very similar to modern day big - budget Hollywod " horror " productions . Also , the make - up and prosthetics are done very nicely and the designs for the main antagonist are quite good . Sadly , the rest of the Special Effects are awful and outdated , making a huge contrast with the make - up & prosthetics.<br /><br />"Hellborn " is a movie with a few good things outnumbered by its serious flaws with terrible results . Hardcore horror or b - movie fans may be interested by its premise but it is a boring and tiresome experience . 3/10
0 I 've seen some very terrible horror movies in my time , and while this is n't the worst of the bunch , it 's certainly in the lower half . The script starts off OK . A young doctor goes to a hospital as an intern , hoping it will vault him to a better job for him and his future wife . Cute huh ? The movie then heads straight into the toilet when you realize that something is killing patients . Turns out that there 's a demon on the basement that 's harvesting people 's souls . It 's the job of the 1 doctor , 1 nurse , and 1 security guard in the entire hospital staff to drag this mental patient downstairs , do a ritual that pretty much just involves cutting the tongue out , and then allowing the haunted house prop of a demon to come out and steal his soul through the magic of cheesy special effects . At this point the movie gets so ridiculously stupid , I was begging for it to be over . There was still an hour to go . It looked like a half an hour " Tales From the Crypt " episode that somehow got stretched into an hour and a half crap - fest . From Tiny Lister doing his best John Coffey ( The Green Mile ) impersonation to Tracy Scoggins playing the stereotypical frigid Nurse Ratchet , this movie fails in every possible level . I gave this 2 stars for only TWO reason . 1 ) His fianc√© is pretty hot , she eased the pain a little towards the end and 2 ) The movie actually looks OK , a lot better than the current trend of horror movies being made with wal - mart quality home cameras.<br /><br />In the end , avoid this turd even if you have the Blockbuster movie pass ( which I do , and I still felt cheated ) . As a bonus drinking game , you and your buddies take a shot every time Matt Stasi ( Dr. James Bishop ) shakes his head while talking . You 'll be drunk 15 minutes into the movie .
0 The cast although nothing special , all do an OK job , the story seems like a good idea , the script is bearable and the end has quite a good twist ; so what 's wrong with it?<br /><br />For a start the special effects are really bad ( if this was made in the 60 's ) it might look OK but in 2003 there is just no excuse for visuals as poor as this . It makes me laugh that the DVD cover claims very proudly ' from the special effects creator of Jeepers Creepers'.<br /><br />Secondly the direction is weak , this film just does not capture the essence of the story , A doctor feeding the hospital inmates souls to the Devil ( or demon type creature ) should be tense or frightening ; it simply isn't.<br /><br />All in all this is a pretty poor film , and although bearable and at times mildly entertaining , it is still probably best left alone.<br /><br />A rather sad 4/10
0 Hellborn starts as a young psychiatric doctor named James Bishop ( Matt Stasi ) takes up his residency at St. Andrews insane asylum , or ' mental illness facility ' as they like to call it there . With nearly 600 patients Bishop meets his boss Dr. McCort ( Bruce Payne ) & is put to work , he gets ward ' A ' where some seriously deranged & dangerous patients are held . If that was n't bad enough during his first round of visits Bishop finds a dead body & has threatening sounding graffiti messages sprayed over his room . Bishop starts to hear stories from the patients about sinister goings - on at the asylum & soon finds out for himself the stories have more than a hint of truth about them ... <br /><br />Known as Asylum of the Damned in the US this supernatural horror film was directed by Philip J. Jones & I sort of liked it but in the end there were too many unsatisfying elements for me to totally enjoy it . The script by Matt McCombs takes itself pretty seriously & I quite liked the basic idea behind & some of it 's ideas but there are a few things which work against it . For a start the film is just too slow , the story is pretty good & does n't give itself away too early but it takes an absolute age for it to get going & I was rapidly losing interest with each passing minute . I also thought the so - called twist ending was far too predictable & the ending itself far too bland & forgettable . It 's a shame because I liked the story , the character 's , the setting & some of the ideas but it 's simply too slow & frankly dull to keep one entertained over it 's 90 minute duration . It 's one of those films which I would like to recommend but in all honesty I can't.<br /><br />Director Jones does a good job , this is actually a well lit & quite atmospheric film . I would n't say there 's anything scary here . I 'm not sure if Hellborn was shot in a real insane asylum but if it was n't they did a great job on the sets & the film looks pretty good overall . Unfortunately there is a real lack of gore or action , there are two hand - print shaped wounds & a severed tongue & that 's it , absolutely nothing else in terms of blood or gore which has to go down as a disappointment . Depending on who you believe & which review you read the special effects are either the worst ever or very good , well as a devoted watcher of low budget horror I was very impressed with the effects especially the demon thing which looks mightily impressive & is a man in a suit type effect rather than a terrible CGI computer graphic although it 's an impressive suit . It all depends on your expectations I suppose.<br /><br />Technically the film is good , it looks nice enough & the lack of CGI computer effects is something I welcome . The acting is n't great though , it certainly could have been better.<br /><br />Hellborn is a film that disappointed me , there were some good stuff about it but at the same time some terrible stuff which unfortunately outweighs the good . I sort of liked parts of it but as a whole 90 minute viewing experience I 'd find it totally impossible to recommend to anyone .
0 Because others have gone to the trouble of summarizing the plot , I 'd like to mention a few points about this film . There may be spoilers here ; I do n't care enough to filter them out.<br /><br />- Given the film 's low budget , the creature design was quite good . It 's actually nice to see a direct - to - video horror film that 's not slathered with awful CGI . Unfortunately the digital film quality 's quite grainy in places , and it 's most noticeable in the well - lit white halls of the asylum.<br /><br />- Ridiculous lighting design plagues parts of this film , to say nothing of the variations in the passage of time . I understand the director might have been trying to simulate dementia , but in order for this to be effective consistent time flow needed to be established . As - is , it merely seems amateurish.<br /><br />- Plot twists were numerous but consistently predictable . I neither had a doubt in my mind of the identity of the robed cultists , nor of the fact that some kind of lame evil - trumps - good development would surface at the end.<br /><br />- This may seem like quibbling , but characters in this film reliably fail to employ any kind of common sense . First of all , regulatory commissions would be all over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths cardiac arrest - induced . Why would the head psychiatrist also be capable of performing autopsies ? Why was n't a plot point made of these impressive qualifications , or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion ? What 's the background ? What 's supposed to make us care about anyone in this ? And just as importantly , who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place , see everything that was so frighteningly wrong with it , and then conclude that it was still a fine place to pursue a residency ? This film did n't even respect its characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />Bottom line : See The Wicker Man instead .
0 If I have to give this movie a score on a linear scale , then I have to give it a low score 3/10.<br /><br />But it was entertaining , and there are several good things to say about the movie.<br /><br />The psychiatrist candidate James Bishop is assigned to St. Andrews Hospital for his resident , and is exited and eager to " change the world".<br /><br />From the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital is hiding an evil truth , but James thinks he can make a difference and does n't recognise this evil . < br /><br />The story builds fairly well , you know all the time that there is a truth in what the patients are telling about some resident evil , and wonder when and how James will discover this . Also when the break comes , James is in a way hunted by the evil , and you feel some suspense until " the fight " is over.<br /><br />Add an innocent beautiful girlfriend that arrives at the worst possible time and other standard horror elements , and you get the picture.<br /><br />The character buildup is actually fairly good , you are introduced to most of the people that gets killed , some of them you " get to know".<br /><br />The film sets an unpleasant scene , this is also done fairly well . There are mysteries that are unveiled - in an acceptable way.<br /><br />The main character , James is very believable - the story about an eager student starting to work is good in this setting.<br /><br />What kills this movie is : * Stupid special effects - a modern version of " Plan 9 from outer space "- type bad ( the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow ) * Some bad acting ( or probably very few takes when filming ) - The main characters sometimes acts badly , and somtimes good . * The sound is at times very cheap.<br /><br />I kept thinking " I could make a movie like this with my home video camera " throughout the film .
0 I was fooled to rent this movie by its impressive cover . Alas . It is easily one of the worst movies ever made . Judging by the acting of the film characters , it 's more a comedy than a horror film . No surprise why no one else has written comments on the imdb . Avoid it .
0 Do n't even waste your time , let alone pay rental for this piece of dreck ! How it got made is beyond me . ( I do n't know why there 's a minimum of 10 lines ... I 've already summarized this trashy movie , but , oh well ... ) The acting was awful , like they all needed lessons . The plot was weak , the ending ... Feh ! I think the cinematography was the only thing that did n't totally suck ... well , maybe the sound was minimalistically OK . The one good thing is , if they could make this movie , even make some money with it , there may be hope for any screenwriter with a REAL idea . So , you - all take heart ! I guess the same holds true of actors ... if these people actually got paid , then you can , too !
0 James Bishop ( Matt Stasi ) goes to a ` mental illness facility ' for a medical residence assignment with Dr. McCort ( Bruce Paynes ) . There , he realizes that many interns are being killed by ` The Ripper ' , who takes their souls to the devil , in a cult promoted by Dr. McCort . This story is so absurd and imbecile that it is impossible to write a summary . The dialogs are so ridiculous , specially when the character of Helen , the blonde fianc√© of James Bishop arrives in the asylum , that it is almost unbelievable that a writer has had the courage to include them in a screenplay . And what about the return of James to the hospital to bring the files of the dead patients ? And the cast , composed of ham actors and actresses ? Honestly , I do not know what or who is the worst in this film : the screenplay , the director or the cast . The correct answer certainly is all of them . I saw this flick on cable television , and I am astonished how can a producer spend money in such a garbage . This horror movie becomes very funny considering the absurd of the plot . My vote is three.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : ` Dem√¥nio ' ( ` Devil ' )
0 I just watched this movie . In one word : sucky ! The story is bad , the acting is , if possible , even worse . The movie has one or two nice moments , but that s it and having those two small good moments , does n't make up for anything in between , before or after those moments . A montrocity of a movie , not even worth watching on tv ...
0 This movie seemed like it was going to be better than it ended up being . The cinematography is good , the acting seemed solid , the dialogue was n't too stiff ... but then about twenty minutes in there 's this long scene with a Doctor who you know is actually a patient at the asylum pretending to be a Doctor - and it just goes south from there.<br /><br />On top of that , the demon is about the silliest looking hellspawn since the Godzilla - looking thing in Curse of the Demon . There 's also some odd demon worshippers who wear masks that look like the exploding teens from the beginning of Logan 's Run.<br /><br />In the end , the cinematography could n't save this movie . Despite some pretty solid performances by the actors , the story just does n't go anywhere . I think " Hellbored " would have been a better title for this .
0 If there was some weird inversed Oscar Academy awards festival this flick would win it all . It has all the gods , excellent plot , extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar . Well , this could be the scenario if the world was inversed , but it 's not . Instead it 's the worst horror flick ever made , not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia , but also extremely low on special effects . For example the devil costume ( which by the way is a must - see ) , is something of the most hilarious I 've ever seen . Whenever I saw that red - black so called monster on screen I could n't hold my laugh back . And to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyor - belt.<br /><br />Do not do the same mistake as I did . Checking IMDB seeing that the movie was released in 2003 , had less than five votes and thinking : -"Well , it 's worth a shot , ca n't be that bad".<br /><br />Yes it could.<br /><br />I'm not even going to waste more words on this movie .
0 This had to be one of the most god awful wrestlemanias ever and is only saved by 2 matches . The hardcore match between Edge and Mick Foley , also Vince Mcmahon against Shaun Michaels . The main event between Cena and Triple H was a complete washout and to be honest I nearly fell asleep it was so actionless , the casket match was not worthy of having the Undertaker appear in it and the match between the Boogie Man and Booker T was a complete joke . If you are really a big fan of the WWE and have missed the early days of the WWF and the Wrestlemanias 17 and 19 you 'll probably love this . But I found that this Wrestlemania left a lot to be desired .
0 Pretty crazy whodunit featuring an all black cast trying to figure out who murdered the philandering trumpet player who was just about to go to Hollywood to Make It Big . Was it his wife ? His Girlfriend ? His Would - Be - Girlfriend ? Her Father ? His Butler ? The newspaper guy ? Who knows ? And who cares ? The result of this is just a little underwhelming , and the actors here do n't really get me in a mood to care one way or another finding out . Why snake venom as a weapon ? Who knows ? Who cares ? The music in this is alright , but there 's little of it , and most of it is pretty " let 's get this over with " This is n't worthy of your time . There are better all - black casted movies out there .
0 Beautifully photographed and ably acted , generally , but the writing is very slipshod . There are scenes of such unbelievability that there is no joy in the watching . The fact that the young lover has a twin brother , for instance , is so contrived that I groaned out loud . And the " emotion - light bulb connection " seems gimmicky , too.<br /><br />I do n't know , though . If you have a few glasses of wine and feel like relaxing with something pretty to look at with a few flaccid comedic scenes , this is a pretty good movie . No major effort on the part of the viewer required . But Italian film , especially Italian comedy , is usually much , much better than this .
0 In modern day Eastern Europe life is hard and for young women prostitution is one of the only career options and one taken , reluctantly , by Melania . She attracts the attentions of an American , Seymour , who becomes obsessed with her , paying more and more money for time with her until he eventually wants to buy her outright . She has two pimps with differring emotional attachments to her and she is generally passed around like some piece of baggage with no feelings of her own . However , we are in " modern art - house cinema " territory , so conventions like narrative structure , lighting the subject so it can be seen , camera techniques that add to rather than distract from the action and a vaguely consistent plot can all be abandoned . Much of the time I had no idea what was supposed to be happening and very rarely did I care . People began leaving the screening almost before the last latecomers had arrived and I do n't think I 've ever seen so many people walk out.<br /><br />Images are important to the director - characters slowly emerge from or disappear into a dark screen , we get long lingering shots of nothing in particular and one sex scene takes place in infra - red . In fact for such an unconventional film the sex scenes were remarkably ordinary ; missionary positions between naked people in bed abounded and there were no drugs or related weirdness . But perhaps these days being ordinary is unconventional.<br /><br />On the whole , almost entirely without merit.<br /><br / >
0 As a veteran of many , many pretentious French films I thought I 'd taken the worst the industry had to offer and was able to stomach anything . But not this . Pointless , relentless , violent , unpleasant , meaningless ... The film has nothing to offer and is random hatred and aggression dressed up as pretentious art . Avoid at all costs .
0 There is no way to avoid a comparison between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas , so let 's get that part out of the way . First of all , let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an underrated and unappreciated film . Cat was ... well , just awful.<br /><br />Jim Carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian , and fearlessly commits to over the top , outrageous characters . Mike Myers fell back on his old bag of tricks.<br /><br />Why , why , why Mike Myers ? ? The kids could care less , and the Austin Powers demographic is n't going to spy this film . So , what was the studio thinking?<br /><br />The Cat was also apparently related to Linda Richmond . Can we talk ? Why a New York Accent ? Not entirely consistent with anything Dr. Seuss has ever written . Myers was even allowed to sneak in his Scottish shtick . I wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said " as long as you do n't say fahklempt ' , you can keep the accents . " Meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort , either with the costume , make - up , or dialogue.<br /><br />The jokes , what few there were , were crude and age inappropriate . When Myers picks up a garden hoe and delivers to the camera : " dirty ho " , everything but the rim shot was missing , and even that would n't have helped.<br /><br />The same folks who created ' Whoville ' , clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in ' Cat ' . The sets and props were very appealing , giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing , direction , and Myers.<br /><br />There was some fun to be had with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston . Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a Dr. Seuss classic , and stayed true to the genre.<br /><br />Call the SPCA . This Cat should be neutered and never be allowed to reproduce again . Please , please , no sequel .
0 Another of my delves into the bargain bin , this movie gave me exactly what I expected - a load of trashy horror complete with screaming ladies.<br /><br />It all started so well - I liked the little intro with the " newsreel " about the young couple being exposed to a nuclear blast , and was totally absorbed right up until the first person caught fire ... <br /><br />From then onwards the film descended into outright silliness , and at times became almost embarrassing to watch . When the heroine turned out to have been afflicted with the same condition as the main character ( the ability to light one 's own farts without the aid of a match ) it seemed almost as if someone had thrown the idea in at the last moment ( " that 'll be good ! " you can almost hear them say ... ) As for the almost psychic link between the main character and the nuclear power plant , well ... <br /><br />The movie came across as cheap tat - if you pay more than ¬£ 1.50 for it you 've been done .
0 This a fascinatingly awful movie . It make so little sense that it starts to make a kind of weird internal logic of its own . Well , it would if it did n't keep darting off up side - alleys until eventually floundering under the weight of its own indecisiveness . The movie ca n't make up its mind whether it is a straight forward ' Man Turns Into Monster ' flick ( like all those 1950s ' THE INCREDIBLE insert verb ING MAN ' movies ) , or a ghastly big business conspiracy theory movie , or a mystical afterlife contact story , or ... or what ? Take your pick . It 's just a mess . Grotesquely over the top and firing off in all directions , leaving loose ends flapping all over the place . It was as if Tobe Hooper had been taking David Lynch pills . Unfortunately he did n't take enough .
0 how can a director that makes such great films as poltergeist and the texas chainsaw massacre make such rubbish as this ? i got this film off a friend and he did nt want it back its so bad . how this can be classed as horror i will never know.<br /><br />2/10
0 Poor Tobe Hopper . He directed an all time horror classic " Texas Chaimsaw Massacre " . Since then everything he 's done has been horrible . This is probably the worst ... and that 's saying a lot . It 's about a man ( Brad Dourif ) who has the ability to make things ( and people ) catch fire ... or something like that . Hardly an original idea ( anyone remember " Firestarter " ? ) It 's a real mess ... literally EVERYTHING is done wrong ! Pathetic acting ( even Dourif ! ) , asinine script , loust production values , crappy special effects ... everything is BAD ! ! ! ! ! A must miss ... not even good for laughs .
0 Jeux d'enfants or how the film was wrongly translated into English Love me if You Dare is a film made by stupid people and about stupid people . I just do n't know how I could expect something worth a look from a film with such plot : Two stupid ignorant kids make a bet that each of them will do something ( certainly extremely idiotic ) to prove to each other ( wtf ? ) that they are " cool dudes " . I know that i exaggerated some aspects but that is what the entire film is about . They grow older ... and instead of realizing that they are just a couple of alienated weirdos continue to perform their crazy things , thinking that they are great people.<br /><br />One could expect such a film from Hollywood , but France ? It is even more offensive to watch the film from the country which created Amelie a couple of years ago , which , btw , the film tries to look like but is far , extremely far away from.<br /><br />Avoid . Avoid . Avoid .
0 I really disliked this movie .... mainly because of the main characters ! They are both immature , selfish , and self - centered people . They hurt EVERYBODY around them playing their silly game . The visual effects were good but what good are they if there are no characters that you connect with or a story line that is interesting . Am I supposed to be happy when these two psycho people FINALLY consummate their love for each other ? < br /><br />After watching this movie I was thinking " This is supposed be the # 1 smash from France?" ........ <br /><br />*spoiler * < br /><br />As for the end : GOOD RIDDANCE ! They both deserve each other ! < br /><br / >
0 Who could possibly sympathize with these two obnoxious protagonists ? What 's intended to be a light , frothy comedy about neighbor children who ca n't give up their childhood game of dare even as they age well into adulhood , comes off more as an exercise in cruelty and petulant self - indulgence . As children , the pair are unbearably precocious ; as adults they 're intolerably immature . It 's a bad combination .
0 This movie is just boring.<br /><br />It tries to copy some effects borrowed to a creative director like Jeunet in " Am√©lie Poulain " , but it is too much . The dialogs are pretty bad , some of the worst I have ever heard , Guillaume Canet is not convincing ( I have almost never found him very convincing ) , his father in the movie plays very badly , the story is dumb , the ending is ... stupid.<br /><br />I think I have not dislike a movie so much since " le pacte des loups " ( brotherhood of the wolf ) from Christophe Gans ( and I watch / see about 80 - 100 movies a year ) , but at least that movie had some action and lots of good actors.<br /><br />I had never commented here ( only rated ) , and when I saw the rating and the comments , I thought I had to write something down.<br /><br />I guess we wo n't have problems to sell the DVD we were offered : not such a bad movie in our ( large ) collection ! ! ! < br /><br />I am open minded ( I watch SF , westerns , drama , comedies , silents , horror , fantasy ... movies ! ) , but this movie was so boring that I felt like I had lost one hour and a half .
0 Ummm , please forgive me , but were n't more than half the characters missing ? In the original novel , Valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then attempting several times to escape . He breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by the police inspector Javert . Along the way there are MANY characters that were n't in this version . Some worth mentioning would be Fantine , Cosette , M & Mme . Thenardier , Eponine , Marius , Gavroche , and Enjolras . The only character with the same name is Javert . I was confused and frustrated throughout the whole movie , trying to see how it was in any way connected to Victor Hugo 's epic novel .
0 An innocent man ( Steve Guttenberg ) has a one - night stand with his boss 's wife ( Isabelle Huppert ) . She spots a woman ( Elizabeth McGovern ) being attacked outside but she ca n't call the cops because it would blow her marriage to Gutenberg 's boss ( Paul Shenar ) . So Guttenberg , honest citizen that he is , when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed nearby only half an hour later , comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack , merely intending to pass on the information given to him by Huppert . Well -- never bear false witness against thy neighbor , as they say.<br /><br />This simple attempt to help the police nab a murderer turns rapidly twisted . When he meets the first near - victim , McGovern , she immediately twigs to what happened , but agrees to keep quiet for the moment . But then Guttenberg finds himself in court , supposed to identify the heavy ( Greenquist ) and we discover through cross - examination that he is NEAR - SIGHTED and ca n't identify objects at a distance , let alone faces . ( Not that it matters because , after all , he never saw the creep in the first place . ) The plot gets practically labyrinthine . Guttenberg winds up the chief suspect when Huppert is murdered too.<br /><br />He barely escapes arrest and holes up with the now - sympathetic McGovern . Guttenberg and McGovern hatch a plan to trap the murderer . She will serve as bait . They 'll follow the flagitious creep into one of his seedy haunt and McGovern will act like the doxy that the murderer is attracted to , just to get him to try to kill her . But everything will be okay , see , because not only will Guttenberg keep a close watch on her , and not only will he alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive , but she will keep a can of mace handy -- just in case.<br /><br />I ask you , the alert viewer , does this scenario unfold as planned ? Elizabeth McGovern has a quirkily interesting bone structure . She seems all mandible and tiny mouth at times , but she 's vibrant . Steve Guttenberg has hair on his brawn and that 's about it . Otherwise he 's as helpless as the character he plays . If Isabelle Huppert can act , it is n't evident in this film . The killer is so formed and so groomed that he looks like he 's wearing one of those masks of deformity in that Twilight Zone episode about greedy heirs.<br /><br />Didn't the director , Curtis Hanson , go on to make " L.A. Confidential " ? That was a nicely done piece of work . Here , everything seems clumsy and contrived , down to the small bit parts . Just before the inevitable violent climax , a uniformed police officer is introduced to delay McGovern 's rescue , and the scene is embarrassing to watch . Dick Olsen has a bit part as a late shopper . He 's a neat guy and always reliable . Paul Shenar as the cuckolded hubby has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he does a fine job too.<br /><br />That louche joint where McGovern attracts the attention of the murderer , where she plays pool with a couple of hairy apes , was shot at a bar in Carolina Beach , in North Carolina , not far from where I lived . The way the interior is set up , it 's clear that this is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive . Actually it appears rather more elegant on screen than it did in reality.<br /><br />Overall , this is Hitchcock territory and it brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story .
0 A pretty obvious thriller - by - numbers , in which the only possible twist turns out to be a hiding to nothing . I was watching principally for the English - language performance by Isabelle Huppert . It was n't great , but then it was a strange role . I would n't be surprised if half her contribution turned out to have been left on the cutting - room floor along with several last minute script re - writes.<br /><br />The acting is the least appealing thing about this film . Steve Guttenburg looks like he 's trying to flesh out his role with the charm that everyone 's told him he has . There 's a sensationally stupid sequence in which it 's suggested that his sexual prowess will be able to help treat PTSD . It 's an uninteresting performance . Elizabeth McGovern is more of a draw with genuine charm and character but it 's small consolation . 3/10
0 This is , without doubt , one of the worst films I 've ever seen ... <br /><br />The plot is so full of holes , the story is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and the actors sound like were reading directly from the manuscript for the first time . Worst of all is Steve Guttenberg . He plays his character like he was in " Police Academy " - the same foolish womanizer - and that 's not suited for a leading man in what should have been a thriller.<br /><br />It 's really hard to believe that Hanson would make " L.A. Confidential " ten years later ... <br /><br />Avoid this like the plague ...
0 This program is really overrated . A detective like Danny Pino 's hot - headed character would have been transferred to the " rubber gun squad " years ago . The whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007 . Every Vietnam veteran character they 've ever had has turned out to be the killer , unless it was another Vietnam veteran . There has only been one black murderer , and he was put up to it by his white boss . The only Hispanic killer was a " race traitor " who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that ( naturally ) two rich white kids committed . What a bunch of propaganda . Hey , screenwriters : minorities and poor people commit murder too . Only on this show are most murderers upper - class whites.<br /><br />What 's more , the arrests of people in their 70s , 80s , and 90s for crimes they committed 50 - 60 years ago are a joke . No real - life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick . The state would be doing their families and insurance companies a favor . The prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they wo n't serve a day . The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex - Nazis , whose high - profile convictions boost DA 's careers .
0 I hate this programme : not only is the very concept ludicrous , but it tries so hard to be feasible ( something that was left out of similar " I confess " ending programmes like , Muder : She Wrote).<br /><br />Sigh . Why is it that the writers ca n't ever be intelligent enough in this programme to come up with evidence that would stick and win a decision in court?<br /><br />Come on : after X - amount of years of the cases being unsolved , why must EVERY SUSPECT , EVERY EPISODE * CONFESS * ( damn it ! ) to a murder which would otherwise go unsolved?<br /><br />I bet all police wish that criminals were this good sportsmen : " Aw , shucks , officer , you 're a bright one - I guess if you 've uncovered enough to convince yourself I did it , I may as well admit to it and make it easier for you in court . What can I say ? It 's a fair cop." < br /><br />Absolute dog s**t and an insult to those of us with with enough brains to even have heard of I.Q.
0 The first time I watched Cold Case was after it had run for about a year on Danish television . At the time it came to the TV it nearly drowned in 4 or 5 other American crime shows aired roughly the same time.<br /><br />I saw it and I was bored to death . The substandard actors with the self righteous faces and morals were a pain in the behind . The entire premise that so much money was given a team of investigators to solve murders dating back 10 - 20 - 30 or even 60 years seems so unlikely.<br /><br />The time is also a factor as they only have 50 - 60 min to tell the story which means that they get a break through just in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members , if they are still alive . This combined with the " personal " problems and relations of the investigators which there HAS to be time for leaves the show a complete lackluster.<br /><br />I give it a 2-star rating because of the music i the end which is really the only reason for watching it .... which you then of course wo n't do as that is TOO lame a reason for watching this crap .
0 This movie is one of the most wildly distorted portrayals of history . Horribly inaccurate , this movie does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch , British , Chinese , American and indigenous enslaved laborers that the sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death . The bridge was to be built " over the bodies of the white man " as stated by the head Japanese engineer . It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by the Japanese captors is the source of a movie , where the bridge itself , is n't even close to accurate to the actual bridge . The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete , not wood . What of the survivors who are still alive today ? They hate the movie and all that it is supposed to represent . Their friends were starved , tortured , and murdered by cruel sadists . Those that did n't die of dysantry , starvation , or disease are deeply hurt by the movie that makes such light of their dark times .
0 A response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed : One person suggested that the closing and destruction of the Ocean View Amusement Park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods . This is simply not true . Prior to the construction of Interstate 64 , which bypasses the Ocean View area , the primary route for traffic went through the heart of Ocean View . Once the interstate was completed , Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime . This led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park , which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg . Meanwhile , in the past few years , the City of Norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought - after location for construction of high - end housing.<br /><br />It has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film " Rollercoaster " . This is also untrue . Footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film , but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to " Death of Ocean View Park".<br /><br />As to the film itself , the storyline of a " supernatural " force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly , but somewhat typical for B - grade movies of the time . With the cast involved , there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors . I do n't believe this film was intended to be another " Citizen Kane " ; I believe Playboy was experimenting with a new non - nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into ( apparently not ! ) . A strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table , but proved unmanageable in execution . The roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway ; " let 's come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise!".<br /><br />For the casual movie viewer , this would be a " see once and forget about it " film ( except for Diana Canova fans ) ; but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park , this movie is like a " walk down memory lane " for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown Norfolk , the first " Harborfest " , and Old Dominion University . Even a limited release of this film on DVD would be welcome .
0 It 's obvious that the people who made ' Dead At The Box Office ' love B - movie horror . Overt references to the genre are peppered throughout , from stock characters ( the authority figure who does n't believe the monstrous invasion is really happening ) to Kevin Smith style discussions to reenacting Duane Jones ' last moments from ' Night of the Living Dead ' not once but twice.<br /><br />Unfortunately it takes more than love to make a good movie.<br /><br />The staging and shot choice are unexciting and unimaginative . While a common admonition in film school is to avoid ' Mastershot Theatre , ' telling the story completely in a wide master shot , here we find the obverse as in several sequences it 's hard to figure out the spatial relationships between characters as the story is told in a series of medium shots with no establishing shot to tie it together . Editing is drab and basic and at times there are unmotivated cuts . The lighting is flat and sometimes muddy , making the scenes in the darkened theatre hard to make out ( was there lighting , or was this shot with available light only ? ) . Some shots are out of focus . The dialogue is trite , and the performances , for the most part , one - note ( Isaiah Robinson shows some energy and screen presence as Curtis , and the fellow playing the projectionist has some pleasantly dickish line readings ; Michael Allen Williams as the theater manager and Casey Kirkpatrick as enthusiastic film geek Eric have some nice moments ) . The premise is silly , even for a B horror flick ( Also , it 's too bad Dr Eisner was unaware of Project Paperclip - he could 've saved himself a lot of trouble ! ) . The ' zombies ' are non - threatening , and their makeup is unconvincing ( although the chunky zombie trying to get a gumball out of the machine raised a smile ) . For a zombie fan film , there is very little blood or violence , although what there is , is handled pretty well . The incidental music , while stylistically uneven , is kind of nice at times , and there are some good foley effects . The ' Time Warp ' parody was a fun listen , although the images going along with it were less fun to watch . Unfortunately , the looped dialogue sounds flat . Was this shot non - sync ( doubtful , it looks like video through and through ) ? I watched the special introduction by Troma Films ' Lloyd Kaufman before the main feature - although it consisted essentially of Kaufman plugging his own stuff and admitting that he had n't seen the movie while someone mugged in a Toxie mask , its production and entertainment values were higher than ' Dead ... ' itself ( quick aside to whoever put the DVD together - the countdown on film leader beeps only on the flash - frame 2 , not on every number plus one more after ) . For that matter , the vampire film theatregoers are seen watching early in ' Dead ... ' looked a lot more entertaining than this . Recommendation to avoid , unless you know someone involved in the production or are an ardent Lloyd Kaufman completist ( he plays ' Kaufman the Minion ' in the film - within - a - film).<br /><br />(Full disclosure : my girlfriend is an extra in this movie . I swear this did not color my review . )
0 30 seconds into the opening credits , I had this feeling that this was going to be a bad movie , but I did n't know just how bad . Then the actor playing the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and I decide that in order to survive this movie , we 'll have to turn the volume down , make up our own dialogue and double the speed on the DVD . But that did n't help . About half way through we turned it off . Now , I 've lived through some very bad movies before , both with and without the aide of " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " and " Svengoolie , " but there are just some movies which I doubt even the Bots can save . The biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that the people hypnotized into believing they 're zombies had rotting green skin . I guess they were all hypnotized into death , then hypnotized into rotting themselves . Stick to the real B - movie cult classics like " Plan Nine From Outer Space . "
0 When the employees of a theater find an old reel of film , they decide to show it at the midnight screening of Night of the Living Dead , assuming it 's an old preview reel . Unfortunately , it 's actually an old Nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of mindless shuffling zombies.<br /><br />I ca n't understand the hate for this movie . It is a low budget independent production with a lot of camp , but it does n't deserve a " 1.1 " here on IMDb . It is just so much fun . It is obvious that the filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror movies , and they have created an entertaining tribute to them sprinkled with references and homages to a variety of them . It has the feel of such things as Night of the Living Dead ( in many ways , very similar ) , Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness , and various others.<br /><br />I liked the explanation of how the zombies , though really just hypnotized into thinking they are zombies , actually come to have the physical attributes of the living dead - unbelievable , perhaps , but I appreciate the effort by the writers to explain it . The gore effects were decent for the budget , the acting was all right , and the story was entertaining.<br /><br />I liked it .
0 This was n't what i wanted to see . I bought this on DVD and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a moment.<br /><br />Heres what i did n't like:<br /><br />1 They were shooting at the father < br /><br />2 The tribes was really annoying < br /><br />3 the dinosaurs ( mostly)looked to faked < br /><br />4 The bad scientist well he was annoying < br /><br />5 The picture quality on the DVD was really bad < br /><br />What i DID like : < br /><br />1 The music by Jerry Goldsmith . This music is really great . I have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie . Sadly the sound quality is not good , but its OK for its time.<br /><br />2 The first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire a sort of awe.<br /><br />3 Baby is kinda cute when he is in the water and is playing < br /><br />4 That funny scene with the tent . < br /><br />5 The children who sees this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses .
0 ... and I actually gave it a ZERO on my personal 1 - 10 scale . I have been attending movies since 1952 and have seen well over 1000 in the theater ( I do n't rate movies that I see only on TV ) . This is the ONLY movie I have ever rated ZERO.<br /><br />My wife and I took our four children ( then aged 15 , 11 , 8 and 6 ) and even the kids thought it was terrible . In fact , it was my daughter ( now 26 ) who alerted me to this site ( amazed that the movie was getting an overall rating of 4+).<br /><br />The animation of the dinosaurs looked amateurish at the time ( and is even worse in retrospect ) , the acting ( particularly by Sean Young ) is atrocious and the story line is simply silly.<br /><br / >
0 I saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the makings of a family joke . If the ranking had a zero , this movie would get it . The dinosaurs were awful . The storyline was ridiculous . The acting really does n't qualify to be called acting . The only reason I even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family still talks about how BAD it really was .
0 Okay , if you have a couple hours to waste , or if you just really hate your life , I would say watch this movie . If anything it 's good for a few laughs . Not only do you have obese , topless natives , but also special effects so bad they are probably outlawed in most states . Seriuosly , the rating of ' PG ' is pretty humorous too , once you see the Native Porn Extravaganza . I would n't give this movie to my retarded nephew . You could n't even show this to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention . The plot is sketchy , and clich√© , and dumb , and stupid . The acting is horrible , and the ending is so painful to watch I actually began pouring salt into my eye just to take my mind off of the idiocy filling my TV screen .
0 For those who are too young to know this or for those who have forgotten , the Disney company went almost down the tubes by the end of the 1980s . People were NOT seeing their movies anymore and the company was not producing the usual wholesome material .... at least no what people expected . A major problem : profanity.<br /><br />Yes , the idiots running the Disney movies during that decade would produce films with swear words - including the Lord 's name in vain , if you can believe that - interspersed in these " family films . " In fact that happens twice here in the first 20 minutes ! < br /><br />This movie , in addition to the language problems , has a nasty tone to it , too , which made it unlikeable almost right from the beginning . Thankfully , Disney woke up and has produced a lot of great material since these decadent ' 80s movies . ( " Touchstone " is Disney , just under another name . )
0 I do n't think this movie was rated correctly . I took my copy and blacked out the PG rating and wrote down R. I would NOT recommend this for anyone under 17 or 18 , whatever the R limit is.<br /><br />Why ? It contains a scene in the jungle with several topless Indian women . I do n't know about you , but that 's not something for little children to be watching . True , it might be the traditional " clothing style " of the African ( ? ) Indians , but ... I think partial nudity should give a movie an R rating.<br /><br />I have n't seen the movie recently , but I guess otherwise , it was alright .
0 A really bad sequel . Part 1 had a lot of funny moments - part 2 is just bad ( in a boring way ) and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fans.<br /><br />Shame on you , Otto Waalkes!<br /><br />The only slightly amusing moment in the film is Helge Schneider who apparently seems to be pis*ed about the other characters . It 's quite easy to identify with him ... <br /><br />The screenplay is sloppy / non - existent . The director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately . The acting is worse than a 2nd grade school play . < br /><br />Technically the movie is awful as well , but who can blame the cinematographer / sound guys who had to work with such an untalented director ?
0 I agree with most of the other guys . A waste of photons and valuable time.<br /><br />Nearly no joke is worth the paper is was written on . The only highlight from my pov is Olli Dittrich as Pinocchio . ( " Egal , ich muss eh Waldsterben " ) This reminds of old times with RTL Samstag Nacht . It is hard to describe the performances of the actors , since most of them do n't even seem to have a good time during production and just " do their thing " . Camera is OK , plot is laughable , I think you would be ashamed even if you discuss this with lots of beers.<br /><br />Apart from this I yawned all the time , wondered about how a script like this could even be considered for production and waited for the end.<br /><br />My 9 year old son was pleased , but then he is pleased by so little at this age : -)<br /><br />Anyway , a 1 point rating here nearly is 1 point too much ...
0 Despite what a lot of other people thought about the first movie , I really liked it . This one however . How to sum it up in one word ? : This movie is ( and here comes the word ) : CRAP!<br /><br />But let 's look at it part by part : Here is the plot : Finally the old queen has been removed from her castle , but her successor : Snow white has problems of another sort : The Court - Jester , Father of her son , has gone astray , as the super , Spliss , goes to the extreme , to battle his gray hair and sells the royal offspring for some blond and full hair . In her desperation Snow white seeks the help of Bubi ( Otto Walkees),who must first find his other six dwarf companions and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name of Rumpelstiltskin.<br /><br />The whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend , where the writers were very drunk but were just under pressure from the studio to write the screenplay . < br /><br />Yes , there are some good jokes . Even for fans of the first part , or for fans of any of the other actors , it 's really not worth buying the the DVD . Believe me . < br /><br />The only thing , that at least kind of saves the movie from complete oblivion , are the performances of some of the actors . That 's why I gave the move 3/10 . Sadly , the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them combined can make up for the bad story.<br /><br />For example , at one point , they even cross over in our reality , and sadly .. they do n't do anything funny while being here . < br /><br />Still , a lot of great actors in this movie : Otto Waalkes , Ralf Schmitz , Martin Schneider , Nina Hagen , Cosma Shiva Hagen , ( Especially funny ) : R√ºdiger Hoffmann as the mirror , Helge Schneider and many more but sadly all these comedians are n't able to bring this really bad script to life . < br /><br />Maybe it is a treat for some hardcore fans but for regular movie goers or by now DVD Renters or buyers it 's not worth the money . < br /><br />I even regret renting the movie .
0 There are a lot of highly talented filmmakers / actors in Germany now . None of them are associated with this " movie".<br /><br />Why in the world do producers actually invest money in something like this this ? You could have made 10 good films with the budget of this garbage ! It 's not entertaining to have seven grown men running around as dwarfs , pretending to be funny . What IS funny though is that the film 's producer ( who happens to be the oldest guy of the bunch ) is playing the YOUNGEST dwarf.<br /><br />The film is filled with moments that scream for captions saying " You 're supposed to laugh now ! " . It 's hard to believe that this crap 's supposed to be a comedy.<br /><br />Many people actually stood up and left the cinema 30 minutes into the movie . I should have done the same instead of wasting my time ... <br /><br />Pain !
0 I 've seen the first of the dwarf - Movies and sometimes I had little fun watching it . There are many famous TV / Comedyactors appearing in the first part and presented , in fantasy costumes , typical little episodes of their Stand - Up - Program and exactly that is the problem the second movie has to struggle with . Everything was already there .... nothing new to obtain . You 're familiar with most of the often boring and dumb " jokes " and you always feel like their goal was to put in every Comedylooser of the last decade who wants to get back on stage . There 's nothing important about the story : typical fairy - tale story of Rumpelstiltskin , without any importance . I expected something like that but that 's nothing I could complain about . I 'm actually complaining about the lazy story writers who had an entire background story ; their only business was to get many jokes and parodies inside but they did n't get it anyway . This crap is except the great appearance of Helge Schneider a total waste of time and money.(if you do n't like him then remove 2 points of my evaluation ) If you like to save your money and get bad jokes then watch the crap that 's broad casted every Friday evening on SAT1 or RTL for free . I 'm sure you will recognize some " laugthers " I saw last night in cinema .
0 I guess I have still enough brain left to NOT find this movie funny . -Great comedians - but a very poor movie ! The " best " performance still did NINA HAGEN < br /><br />TRIVIA : Did you realize that it the " real world " scenes ( in Hamburg ) the cars are almost ONLY new BMWs ? ? < br /><br />I guess I have still enough brain left to NOT find this movie funny . -Great comedians - but a very poor movie ! The " best " performance still did NINA HAGEN < br /><br />TRIVIA : Did you realize that it the " real world " scenes ( in Hamburg ) the cars are almost ONLY new BMWs ? ?
0 WARNING ! Do n't even consider watching this film in any form . It 's not even worth downloading from the internet . Every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid . The so - called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a film . They could n't tell a good joke to save their lives . It 's an insult to any human being . If you 're looking for a fun - filled movie - go look somewhere else.<br /><br />Let 's hope this Mr. Unterwaldt ( the " Jr. " being a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy ) dies a slow / painful death and NEVER makes a film again.<br /><br />In fact , it 's even a waste of time to WRITE ANYTHING about this crap , that 's why I 'll stop right now and rather watch a good film .
0 Otto Preminger directs this light as a feather story . Bohemian Jean Seberg and her equally bohemian widower father David Niven holiday in the South of France with nutty Myl√®ne Demongeot . Things are fine until family friend Deborah Kerr shows up . Nivens , a degenerate womanizer , finds the conquest of Kerr too hard to resist . That 's fine with Seberg , as long as Niven loves her and leaves her ( as he 's done with all the women in his past ... including Demongeot ) . When it appears as though she 's becoming second banana in Niven 's life , Seberg exact revenge on Kerr . Preminger tells the story in flashbacks from Seberg 's perspective and cleverly combines black and white with sunnier color scenes . The cinematography by Georges P√©rinal is stunning . The film features some of Preminger 's least heavy - handed direction , although he rarely allows any close - ups , which makes it difficult to make out what the actors are really feeling . Arthur Laurents wrote the script and it 's full of acidic dialog and funny scenes ( mostly involving bird - brained Demongeot ) . Seberg acquits herself fairly well , but Niven is at his least appealing ... and he shows no chemistry with either Seberg or Kerr . Preminger really mis - steps with that casting . It 's a role that seems tailor made for someone closer to Charles Boyer . With Geoffrey Horne as Seberg 's would - be suitor and Martita Hunt as his daffy mother . Juliette Gr√©co , playing herself , sings the title song in a Paris nightclub . The great titles are by Preminger regular Saul Bass .
0 The over - heated plot of " Bonjour tristesse " is taken from a juvenile first novel by Francoise Sagan , which became a best - seller , though God knows why . For teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step - parent it may have a certain appeal . Do n't be taken in by the fact that David Niven plays the playboy father and Deborah Kerr the step - mother - in- prospect . Unfortunately , too much rests on the frail shoulders of Jean Seberg . She 's beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager . The problem is that she can strike poses but she ca n't act . Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Otto Preminger 's St. Joan -- Seberg 's first film -- knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film . This movie , also by Preminger , fulfills the " promise " of the first . It was her second movie ; she was now 20 . What was Preminger thinking ? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Seberg 's lack of acting capacity ? Not a chance ? Seberg 's character is at the center of the story and , pretty though she is , convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old , she ca n't meet the emotional demands of the role . I do n't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures . But anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check . In spite of Niven and Kerr , this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting lessons .
0 Bonjour Tristesse covers similar ground as ' The Member of the Wedding . ' to wit , a possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship from forming between a beloved family member and an interloper . While critics love ' Member of the Wedding , ' I find Julie Harris to be a jumbo - drag and an adenoidal , scenery - chomping thespian in everything she 's been in . This portrays irritating , rich idiots as in Last Year at Marienbad , but this time it 's a travelogue.<br /><br />In this Preminger movie sequences develop , but characters do not . For the first 30 minutes he 's content to blur the father - daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven , making uncomfortable sexual readings possible . Once the conflict is introduced , Seberg ca n't deliver the depth the part requires . Kerr pulls rank and turns the film into ' Endless Love . ' Seberg 's vacuous narration , is like something out of Strange Interlude - it is not good . I really wish someone other than Niven was in his role . He spends so much time normalizing orthodox British behavior in all his movies , he never gets around to the character.<br /><br />In the most memorable sequence , an evening out dancing becomes a free - for - all in a harbor . Bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise , ' The Conformist . ' Kerr is on board to clasp her hands and portray another major pain ( as in Black Narcissus , Night of the Iguana , King and I , Heaven Knows Mr. Allyson , Tea and Sympathy , etc . etc . ) . Really , Kerr was a horrible actress . I wish every movie with her could end with a fatal car crash , or even better , start with one.<br /><br />People uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this .
0 This is shallow hedonism and/or social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about a jealous young woman 's scheme to drive apart her father and his fianc√©e . Is it incest or just a view through the eyes of a daughter with an Electra complex ? Who cares ? All of the characters , except for Anne ( Deborah Kerr ) are vacuous and vile . Seberg is poor ( I agree with the " boys with breasts " comment of an earlier review ) . The plot plodded . This predictable material was sufficient for about 30 minutes of film that unfortunately was stretched over an hour and a half ! If you want to see great gowns and jewels on the Riviera , I recommend " To Catch a Thief " - in which you will get the added bonuses of an entertaining story and likable characters . < br /><br />I like for films to entertain me . I personally do n't really care where a film is set . Whatever the time or place , I want a good story - comedy or drama . I also want to see some enjoyable characters . It does n't hurt if I can relate to them . Poor Deborah Kerr gives a typically good performance , and so does David Niven in a despicable role.<br /><br />The " 2 " rating is solely for Kerr and Niven , and for the cinematography - the rich color scenes and the murky , foreboding black and white scenes . Unfortunately , all the great cinematography in the world can not salvage a poor story with un - enjoyable characters . A sow 's ear is still a sow 's ear . Consequently watching this mess was a serious waste of my time .
0 Jean Seberg had not one iota of acting talent . Like all her films , ' Bonjour tristesse ' suffers not at all from her looks ( though she is perhaps the first of those modern women whom Tom Wolfe gleefully , accurately describes as " boys with breasts " : publicists , of course , use the word " gamine " ) but suffers grievously from Seberg 's dull , monotonous , killing voice . In all her films when had to play anger , Seberg played it with grossly audible , distracting , gasping panting between her monotonously droned verbalizations . Oy.<br /><br />Preminger 's adaptation of Fran√ßoise Sagan 's breathlessly juvenile , fantasy soap opera plot is noteworthy only for his lush cinematography - but then that 's difficult to funk on the photogenic French Riviera , and perhaps for his apt , but certainly not groundbreaking , employment of black & white for the present day scenes from which Seberg 's monotone narration delivers us to the flashed - back - to color past.<br /><br />Juliette Gr√©co has a brief moment , as a nightclub chanteuse in the black & white spotlight , delivering in smoky Dietrichesque voice the bleak existentialist lyric of the title song . This moment is nowadays , in retrospect , more than a wee bit dr√¥le . Except , of course , if you 're French - particularly if you 're a French " 68-er " longing for the glorious days of the barricades roundabout the Sorbonne - and your kids riot to retain the lifelong sinecures which have blighted and emasculated France 's economy : then you still believe in Sartre and Foucault and all such arcane , irrelevant theorists.<br /><br />David Niven has the hardest role , having to play with sufficient gusto an aging hedonist who 's yet to grasp that life is n't all about Sagan 's teenybopper notions of a hip , cool , swingin ' , " mon copain ! " Papa . Deborah Kerr delivers her usual , consummately professional presence , convincingly playing the woman who suffers undeservedly Seberg 's spiteful teenaged snot - nose jealousy ( fulfilling Sagan 's shallow teen fantasy of the Classical theme of " there can be only one Queen Bee in the hive " ) ; in fact , to Kerr belongs this film 's sole great and memorable on - screen moment.<br /><br />The dialogue is unnatural - I agree with an earlier reviewer who said that it sounds to be " badly translated " from French ; combine the unnatural scripting with Seberg 's incomparably dull , unendurable monotone and you can save that Valium for another night . Atop all that the ineptly synched post - production voice dubbing is , almost throughout , obvious and thus much more than irksome : this is especially true of the dubbing for Myl√®ne Demongeot because it spoils her otherwise very pleasing dumb blonde performance.<br /><br />Hunky Geoffrey Horne gets the short end of the stick here - a very good looking young man who also suffered from a less - than - lovely , uncinematic voice which , when paired with Seberg 's drone , yields unconvincing scenes of puppy love . ( Horne was , shall we say , merely adequate in ' Bridge On the River Kwai , ' perhaps because his end was held up by those great cinema pros William Holden and Jack Hawkins instead of being unsupported by the regrettably ungifted Seberg).<br /><br />In sum ' Bonjour tristesse ' is pretty to look at but it 's shallow , immature soap : thin gruel with suds .
0 In one respect , it 's like ' The Wizard of Oz , ' with Paris in black - and - white and the Riviera in color . But it 's supposedly about possessive love , destructiveness and moral decadence , while actually being about designer gowns , shots of the Riveria , lots of big expensive cars , and music - and dancing interludes that suggest Vincente Minnelli on one of his off - days . Watchable , but a remarkable example of desperate , dark plot material and glitzy style heading in opposite directions . ( Was this the model for ' The Talented Mister Ripley ? Does anyone sense an affinity between Jean Seberg and Matt Damon ? )
0 Greenaway 's films pose as clever , erudite and innovative . Yet his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the World War 1 era of film - making : the frame composition , use of mid - shot , the static camera . It may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new . Perhaps like that other " innovator " , TS Eliot , he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could.<br /><br />Yet Greenaway 's biggest failing is that he can not write . His dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician , Brecht . Where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor , which is poised and logical , so the joke is dead before it 's delivered . The result is tedium : if it 's not funny , it has failed : ask a stand - up comedian to justify their act if the audience does n't respond . Perhaps the well - read director could learn something from Freud on humor.<br /><br />Finally , like Woody Allen , Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones . They speak the lines with a bored , smug air like narcissistic adolescents.<br /><br />This film , despite its design and lighting , is meretricious .
0 This is a baffling film . < br /><br />The beauty in sexual relations between men and women is shown degraded by a set of men and women who can only be described as a collection of oddballs and misfits.<br /><br />Greenaway acknowledges his inspiration to Fellini 's film " 8 1/2 " but whereas Fellini is a titan of world cinema , Greenaway is not.<br /><br />He has none of the maestro 's lightness of touch nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a deftness of clarity.<br /><br />He is pretentious , the film being divided into chapters with a written introduction to each , as if the viewer has to be guided into the film except that the written notices only stay on screen for a few seconds , not long enough to be read by the audience with the result that they are mostly ignored.<br /><br />As for the women , only two can be described as lookers , Palmira , played by Polly Walker and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal . The rest ooze with ordinariness . Both the women and the men retreat from the harsh light of reality into the dim shades of fantasy.<br /><br />Greenaway obviously wants to make the point that sexual fantasy does not lead to happiness . The women themselves are depressing since they render their services in exchange for money . Relations between men and women are debased into a commercial transaction.<br /><br />There is no sense of joy or happiness or love in the film , indeed there are several scenes that are deeply unpleasant : < br /><br />The suggestion of an incestuous relationship between father and son , Philip and Storey Emmental played respectively by John Standing and Matthew Delamere . The callous disregard of both men that Giaconda is carrying their child , she in fact , gets pregnant twice , the first foetus being aborted and the second time , she is sent away to a destination chosen by the men from a flight book . Both men having sex with a woman who has no legs , ( the half woman in the title ) . The beastiality that exists between Beryl , played by Amanda Plummer , with a pig named Hortense . Father and son sharing women between them . Women enjoying being beaten sexually . The father sleeping with the corpse of his dead wife.<br /><br />Mercifully , none of these scenes are shown sexually , only hinted at.<br /><br />The hinted degradation of women is such that there can not be any wonder that the film was booed at when it was first premiered at Cannes . What is more extraordinary is that the actresses in the film lined up to defend it , showing yet again that there is no limit to the naivety of women and that women will fool themselves into being exploited by men.<br /><br />Greenaway 's directorial style is pretentious , it is a triumph of style over substance , a depiction of Film as Art accompanied by the abandonment of common sense.<br /><br />Greenaway tries to attain the sublimity of surrealism but only succeeds in showing the banality of human relationships .
0 Writer / Director Peter Greenaway cements his title as the High Lord of Art House Pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious self - indulgence , 8 ¬Ω Women . The film follows a wealthy Englishman and his son on their mutual quest for sexual satisfaction , as they lure and blackmail women ( guess how many ) into joining their personal collection of concubines.<br /><br />Think of any possible way that this premise could be offensive , and chances are Greenaway 's done it . The female characters are little more than a catalogue of fetishes for the two protagonists to partake of . There 's the Kabuki - obsessed Mio , the ever - pregnant Giaconda and Beryl , who 's got a thing for farm animals . Giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair , she 's the " half woman , " get it ? Greenaway vehemently denies all accusations of misogyny , but if this is n't it , then what is?<br /><br />The film goes on to eroticize anything and everything having to do with Japan , a continuation of themes from his snore - worthy ( but less sexist ) 1996 film , The Pillow Book . But where the The Pillow Book was erotic and graceful , 8 ¬Ω Women just gets horny and exploitative . Greenaway 's work is tasteless and arrogant in its fetishism , and the only person likely to enjoy watching it is the auteur himself .
0 I do nt know about you , but I 've always felt drawn to ' ART ' cinema . The first ' art ' film I managed to get a hold of was Peter Greenaway 's " The Cook , The Thief , His Wife and Her Lover " , which blew my mind and creative spiret into overdrive . The film was the ultimate paradox , both beautiful and grotesque ... this is what ' art cinema ' was about , exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral to the screen with purpose . Life , real life , can be like living in a madhouse , and art expressed shows it for what it is . I love movies of all types , but especially those that both entertain and have something to say , whether I agree with it 's stance or no ... <br /><br />"8 1/2 WOMEN " , is a dry , clinical ' comedy ' where a father and son gather a harem to fufill their many sexual fantasies . There is only a very brief allusion to Fellini in the film , unlike what the previews have suggested . The main focus of the film falls on the ' close ' relationship between father and son , brought together after the mothers ' death . In the early scenes of the film the fathers ' sadness is believable , you can feel his pain . What happens afterwards is plain by Greenaway standards , the gathering of the harem , observations on love and death , and flesh displayed for the sake of flesh ... One could argue this , but I feel the movie to be shallow and pointless . And the idea that this could be a comedy is perplexing to me . The acting for the most part if fine, ... especially good are Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer(though poor Mandy should put her clothes back on ) What the film lacks is a compelling story , and the usual Greenaway touches of excess that made his other films so wonderful to watch . < br /><br />While filled with moments of insight , and the occasional taboo , " 8 1/2 Women " is too cut and paste to be considered art , too bland to considered ' funny ' , and simply too dull to be considered worthwhile.<br /><br />Save your money ... I can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid.<br /><br />4 out of 10
0 Stilted , stagy , strange and opaque , if visually striking ... a wannabe - erotic fantasy . Really boring , way too much male nudity ( including father - son incest ) , and just a sort of shameless pointlessness . I will confess , however , that certain passages of dialogue , taken on their own terms , do have a lulling , haunting quality .
0 I am giving this pretentious piece of garbage a 1 simply because i do n't believe there is a worse movie in the world.<br /><br />I hate this movie , i hate the acting , dialog , setting , writing and directing . I hope everyone that was involved in this movie burns and rots in the darkest circle of hell.<br /><br />Damn this disgusting waste of time.<br /><br />I pray every day that this movie is just a figment of my imagination . i pray that i dreamt the movie , and that i will never have to see it at < br /><br />my local video store again.<br /><br />BURN IN HELL
0 To overcome the death of his wife , an old man does what anyone in his position would naturally do ( at least in a Peter Greenaway movie ) : he and his son populate their home with eight and a half ( one has no legs ) women and embark on a sexual odyssey . This being a Greenaway film , there is lots of pretentious and uninteresting blabbering and of course there is unnecessary male nudity . In fact the father and son share a bed sleeping in the nude . Gross . Besides , who wants to see an old guy full frontal ? For those who are not into the homo - erotic scene , one of the women likes to do the nasty with horses . There is no story - just a random collection of dull scenes .
0 To borrow from Dorothy Parker : This is not a film to be tossed aside < br /><br />lightly . It should be thrown with great force.<br /><br />This is an excruciating mess . And I 'm a Greenaway fan.<br /><br />MIND - NUMBINGLY AWFUL < br /><br />"The Mummy Returns " has much more artistic merit
0 Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying deliberately to disgust his viewers . This film opens with incest -- and purposeless , meaningless , casual incest at that . That 's Greenaway 's big problem . He prefers parlor tricks to shock over actually doing anything meaningful . Technical skill is n't enough . He 's just a bit perverse for the sake of perversity .
0 This movie was awful in the worst way : you just did n't care . You did n't care what happened in the plot ; you did n't care about the characters . Everyone was devoid of heart . I ended up walking out about an 45 minutes into it because I simply did n't want to subject my mind to it any more . There is far too much sex in the film . Sex can be okay ; it can even make the movie ( hence Karma Sutra ) but the intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy . It was just ugly . Do n't see this film .
0 I am sorry to say that it was one of the worst films I 've ever seen . Although visually fascinating ( e.g. the use of colour was absolutely stunning ) , it was pretty boring and disturbing ( see the father / son incest).<br /><br />What 's more , music is totally absent , and if you think of those wonderful soundtracks by Michael Nyman ( who wrote the soundtracks for most of Greenaway 's films ) then you can imagine what a difference it makes.<br /><br / >
0 somewhere i 'd read that this film is supposed to be a comedy . after seeing it , i 'd call it anything but . the point of this movie eludes me . the dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd , many of the sets seemed to be afterthoughts , and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content , there 's nothing erotic about this film ... all leaving me to wonder just what the heck this thing is about ! the title premise could have been the basis for a fun ( if politically incorrect ) comedy . instead , we 're treated to cheap , amateurish , unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for its own sake . if i want that , i 'll go buy a grace jones cd .
0 Movies have put me to sleep before , but no movie has ever done that twice , so it took me three sittings actually to finish it . The dialog was bad . Women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures . And two of the supposedly Japanese women looked Chinese , had Chinese names and spoke with clearly Chinese accents . I 'm still trying to figure out why the Emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other . 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a tough choice : Do I give this movie a rating of one ? or two?<br /><br />Movies have put me to sleep before , but no movie has ever done that twice , so it took me three sittings actually to finish it .

0 La Chute de la Maison Usher , or The Fall of the House of Usher as it 's know amongst English audiences , starts with Allan ( Charles Lamy ) heading for the Castle of his good friend Sir Roderick Usher ( Jean Debucourt ) who sent him a letter saying that his wife Madeleine is ill . Once there Allan finds Madeleine very sick & her husband Roderick determined & almost obsessed to paint her portrait . As Roderick paints Madeleine becomes weaker & weaker almost as if the picture is draining the life out of her , Allan tries to help his friend but tragedy soon strikes ... <br /><br />This French production was co - written , produced & directed by Jean Epstein & was the second of two filmed The Fall of the House of Usher adaptations during 1928 , honestly I do n't know the original novel was published in 1839 , I mean you wait 89 years for a filmed adaptation & two come along at the same time ! Anyway , I feel that I have a bit of a problem here as I have read plenty of positive comments about La Chute de la Maison Usher & maybe I 'm not the right sort of person to write a comment on it but I have to say that it simply did n't do anything for me . I did n't like it , obviously the first thing to say is that this is a silent film & therefore it relies on imagery but even so I thought the story was weak , I thought as a whole the film was boring & dull even though it only lasts for about an hour & it really did n't do anything for me at all . La Chute de la Maison Usher was made almost 80 years ago & that is literally a lifetime , the world , cinema & tastes have moved on a lot since then & I found no enjoyment in this film . I feel this film has dated badly & probably was n't that good to start with anyway . I never felt for any of the character 's , I never cared about anything that was happening & I found it all rather tedious to sit through , I 'm sorry if I 've offended any silent film fans out there but that 's the way I felt.<br /><br />Director Epstein does an OK job , a lot of people ramble on about the imagery in La Chute de la Maison Usher & I will freely admit it definitely has it 's moments but I thought they were few & far between . Shots of people 's mouths moving & not actually hearing what they say just seemed weird to me , I did n't like the music & the version I saw kept the original French language insert cards which were narrated by guy with the most awful sounding thick French accent which was also off putting . Based on the story by Edgar Allen Poe I doubt this has much resemblance to it apart from one or two basic elements , stick with the fantastic Roger Corman House of Usher starring Vincent Price.<br /><br />Technically the film was OK considering when it was made . You simply can not tell about the acting as no one ever speaks although the film is full of unnatural exaggerated movements to try & suggest emotions or reflect what 's happening which works to an extent but after a while just looks a bit daft.<br /><br />La Chute de la Maison Usher will appeal to those who crave a bygone era , who live in caves or who are stuck in the past , for me I like my films to have a story , not to bore me & to have sound & I 'm sorry if that last statement makes me sound like an uneducated idiot but that 's how I feel . The world has moved on since 1928 & for the better .
0 This flick reminds me some really bad science - fiction movies from 50 's and 60's . It is not scary or interesting , but it 's dull , cheesy and stupid . Special effects are laughable , all actors are ludicrous and the ending is simply awful . Don't waste your money , rent or buy something better . I give it 3.5 out of 10 ( I found this turkey quite amusing because of its stupidity ) .
0 " Plants are the most cunning and vicious of all life forms " , informs one dopey would - be victim in " The Seedpeople " , a silly , flaccid remake of " Invasion of the Bodysnatchers " , " Day of the Triffids " , and about a thousand udder moovies . And why are seeds moore dangerous than plants , one might ask ? Because , according to the same dolt , " seeds can chase us " . Yes , I can remember one horrifying incident when the MooCow was just a calf , being chased all the way home from school by ravenous dandylion seed ... Yeah , right . Unfortunately , the " monsters " in this seedy little turkey kind of look like shaggy little muppets , some of which roll around like evil tumbleweeds , others which sail about on strings . There 's not even the tiniest inkling of terror or suspense to be found here . For reasons left unexplained , the seed monsters are knocked out by 50 volt ultra - violet lights , even though they can walk about in the daylight , which has about 1,000,000,000,000 times more uv energy . As you can see , not much thought was put into this cow flop . The MooCow says go weed yer garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here . : = 8P
0 While most of the movie is very amateurish , the Kosher slaughter scene is played up , but not untrue . Kosher law says that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches it 's skin . The Kosher slaughter scene is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one , or has seen the Peta film showing a Kosher slaughter , in which the animals throat is cut , and the esophagus cut out while it is still alive , conscious , and obviously suffering . We must remember that history is written by the victors . Is one even Allowed to even THINK that maybe the Nazis were right??<br /><br />Doesn't it say anything that the Nazis had outlawed this vicious religious slaughter , and the Jews are still practicing it even today ?
0 I would perhaps give 6 or 7 to this propaganda film because it shows when and how a propaganda film becomes successful . If there are people who watch this piece and think that " well then Jews must have done something to be treated the way they were treated in WW2 " , then the movie is very cleverly made to conceal ' why 's and ' how 's as well as mix correct and false observations on how a people live . What more can a propaganda movie aim for ? The part in which an American movie about the Rothschild family is included is re - used very shrewdly here , for instance . The question of why the Jew keeps his wealth away from the officer is never asked . No one mentions the system of taxation within that particular social strata.<br /><br />Besides , the level of excitement ( or , the level of disgust ) in the movie increases slowly and the solution - like end of the movie suits the aim and the musts of doing propaganda . The audience would leave in joy and gratefulness to the times that are coming up ... well done.<br /><br />In the movie , there is a kind of simplicity that addresses the most basic emotional perception of the audience . The movie is kind of history today , so no need to fuss much about it actually . However , in this simplicity of words of ethnic degradation , a careful watcher can find relevance to today 's cultural hatred , violence , decivilization as well as the problems of integration . Overall , fine trash .
0 The Eternal Jew ( Der Ewige Jude ) does not have what we today would call the markings of a scholarly document : rather than naming experts or sources to support what it says , it simply says , without opposition , what it wants us to believe ( one will concede that American newsreels of that period were also much less regulated than would seem ethical to a modern audience , often inserting dramatized scenes and passing them off as actual news footage ) . Add to this directed propaganda the fact that filmmaker Hippler was " preaching to the converted , " not so much asking gentile Europeans to hate the Jews as validating the feelings so many of them must have held already , in order to have allowed the holocaust that followed . The weakest link in the film 's logic shows in its " rat " analogy , wherein it goes on to explain the behavior of rats , and then adds something to the effect of " Well , Jewish people are like that too . " Similarly it characterizes Jewish people as ugly by showing ugly Jewish people in comparison to attractive gentiles ; the accompanying leap of faith is that ugly is bad . The film appears to contradict itself a few times , for example by attacking Western painters who portrayed Old Testament characters as light - skinned Europeans ; thereby the text admits that so - called " Hebrew " ethnicity is in fact an ingrained aspect of Christian culture . It also shows ghetto Jews willingly living in roach - infested filth , despite the supposed treasure they 've hoarded , and then flip - flops by saying that these same undesirables live in wealth and luxury as soon as they leave the ghetto . Incidentally , who would n't ? The use of scenes from a well - known American film , House of Rothschild , shows an equally blurry deployment of logic . First the film is denounced as having been made by Jews ; then it is apparently used by Hippler to verify the deceptiveness of Jews ( the aforementioned pretense of poverty by ghetto Jews , shown as a means of avoiding taxation , although the Rothschild character 's " spin " is that Jews are taxed excessively ) ; finally the Rothschild film is once again execrated for implying that the famed banking family invented the checking account . This apparent indecisiveness in whether the American footage is shown positively or negatively might become clearer with repeated viewings , but at first sight it makes for some murky moviewatching . For all of Eternal Jew 's imperfections , I was at first surprised that the IMDb viewer rating for this film is as high as it is , just shy of a " 5 " to date . I 'd say the reason is that EJ 's documentary value has exceeded its original purpose , offering us , unintentionally , a look into the lives of European Jews as they would not be seen a few years hence . Needless to say the film 's very badness also provides an historical insight into bad , or simply evil , filmmaking as a propagandist 's tool . About this time I should expect director Hippler to flip - flop once again , springing forward to say " That 's what I meant to do all along ! " The scenes depicting animal slaughter are particularly gruesome , and show same as decidedly inhumane , contrary to the intent of Kosher law to prevent animal suffering . I would like for someone who has seen the film , and has some knowledge of these procedures , to comment on whether the portrayal is accurate .
0 That shall be a documentary ? I saw it ( which is forbidden in Germany ) and I have to say , that it was the worst documentary I 've ever seen . It is nothing but one big lie from the beginning to the end . Who can doubt after this trash that all Jews were supposed to be killed in the concentration camps ?
0 1940 . - A visit to the Lodz ghetto in Nazi - occupied Poland , recorded by a German cameramen with the naive co - operation of the Jewish community , is combined with archival footage , clips from international newsreels , and excerpts from related cultural films to portray the World 's Jews as swindlers and parasites . This ' documentary ' interprets Jewish life from the viewpoint of traditional anti - Semitism and Nazi ideology . A candid , cinematically - unique expression of racial hatred . I personally find this film frightening and highly offensive . One can only hope that such pictures as this will never reach the screen again .
0 This film is justly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced . The insistent equation of Jews with disease is simply < br /><br />pathological , and even worse it almost becomes believable for brief seconds < br /><br />through its sheer repetition . The fact that something this crude works , even < br /><br />briefly , is an object lesson in itself . You have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this , and I would n't recommend trying unless you have a good reason .
0 Having seen " Triumph of the Will , " I can only say this movie is ghastly , even measured against the historically low " standards " of the time . Naturally it 's all totally fabricated and prejudicial . This is what one would expect of 1930 's German propaganda . Unfortunately , the quality of the presentation , itself , is hackneyed and cheap . It 's also so blatantly ridiculous that even contemporary Germans must 've left the theater holding their noses . In a genre renowned for its base appeal , lack of originality and unapologetic wrong - headedness , this film does n't even qualify as " bad . " It would have to improve significantly to attain that status !
0 Interesting ? Hardly . The ' scientific evidence ' the movie provides for its point ( which is basicly that Jews are a cancer ) is so stupid and lame , it 's almost laughable ( if we did n't know what happened in that era).<br /><br />Important ? Nah . I ca n't imagine Germans ( even at that horrid time ) would like or believe this movie . Compare it to Riefenstahl 's Triumf des Willens . Now that was I movie I was impressed with . This is just silly garbage.<br /><br />'Best ' part is a scene from M ( one of my all - time favorites ) where ( the jew , as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us ) Lorre plays a child - molester and murderer . In the eyes of these film - makers , only a depraved mind can do so . Uh - huh . Did n't know M was Hitler 's favorite movie , right?<br /><br />No , it 's just plain STUPID . Even for it 's nazi - propaganda genre . 2/10 .
0 This Book - based movie is truly awful , and a big disappointment . We 've been waiting for this move over a month . Many film reviewer were hopeful for it . Also in newspapers and TV , it made big sense . When 29th April comes , many people regretfully noticed that movie is really awful . Why ? First of all story was so monotone . It has been many indefinite scenes , sometimes it 's hard to realize what 's going on . The actresses , out of Hulya Avsar , were n't harmonized with their roles , especially Vildan Atasever . She acts better in comedy films , In this movie , a kind of drama , she could n't disposed of her previous role . And finally Movie is too short , just 66 minutes .
0 How cynical are the writers , to pander so . I may be an American citizen , but I do n't need to see other Americans pat each other on the back for an hour and half in order to enjoy a film . I 'm astonished that so few have commented on how utterly jingoistic , sentimental and trite the dialogue in this film really is . The historical inaccuracies of the film are not as gross and offensive as in " U-571 " ( which changes British submariners to American ones ) but you still walk away feeling a little slimy . Really , the Germans in this film do nothing but admire the Americans between battle scenes ! How sad , unnecessary ! I 'd just like to say to the writers : it 's obvious to many of us that you ca n't capture real people , with real problems , under real pressure , and that you 've taken some very well tested shortcuts . Lucky for you there will always be nationalist nutjobs to appreciate your sugar - coated tripe .
0 I usually read reviews before I watch a movie . Guess what , I did n't do that before watching TLB , and I have to say I was very surprised to see the above average rating at IMDb . I found it to have a total lack of story . You just get dropped into it ( and , sadly , not in the way Saving Private Ryan dropped us into the movie ) , and it also has a sudden end , which was very unsatisfying for me.<br /><br />I have to admit , the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me , especially with the low budget in mind . But prepare yourself to have a laugh ... Some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are Olympic gymnasts . A mid - air corkscrew or somersault during WW I is a bit too much for me , especially when it 's performed countless times during the movie ... <br /><br />But the parts that really got me laughing until I almost cried were the scenes containing close combat . The screaming and shouting German voices ... unbelievably funny . It seems as if they are spoken by one single actor / voice performer , because they all sound exactly the same , and it just sounds like a ' typical ' German voice.<br /><br />I would absolutely NOT recommend this movie to anyone , except to people who just want to have some laughs because of the sad and corny quality of it .
0 I want to say the acting is bad , but I think it was the directing that made it so . I never thought much of Highlander ( same director ) but that one could be blamed on the 80s.<br /><br />This one however , has no excuses . People get shot while exiting trenches with a man in front of him ! ? Those kind of mistakes , along with an unclear time line , weird battle tactics , sub - par cutting and poor visual effects , makes this one a sub - par film over all.<br /><br />Then like so many other have commented , all this American bullshit . The German general being practically scared of his captured American private . Be prepared to swallow a lot of it , although in small doses.<br /><br />To sum it up , a not horrible but still definitely sub - par war movie in all aspects .
0 When this movie was first shown on television I had high hopes that we would finally have a decent movie about World War I as experienced by American soldiers . Unfortunately this is not it.<br /><br />It should have been a good movie about WWI . Even though it was made for television it is obvious that a real effort was made to use appropriate equipment and props . But the writing and directing are badly lacking , even though the makers of this movie obviously borrowed freely from quite a few well made war movies . War movie clich√©s abound such as the arrogant general who apparently does not care a flip about the lives of his men . When will Hollywood realize that , even though there have been plenty of bad generals , most combat unit generals have seen plenty of combat themselves and are not naive about what the average grunt experiences ? The first part of this movie appeared to be " Paths of Glory " with American uniforms . Except that " Paths of Glory " was emotionally gripping . Later on there was Chamberlain 's charge ( except uphill ) from " Gettysburg " and even the capture of the American soldier by a ring of enemy soldiers from " The Thin Red Line " . But in " The Thin Red Line " the soldier was alone when captured . In this movie a ring forms around the new prisoner in the middle of a battle.<br /><br />If this movie used a military adviser they ignored him . Even though the actors ( and I never could forget they were actors while watching ) mouthed military tactics I did n't see very much of it . The American soldiers would stand up to be shot while the Germans attacked . And the infamous Storm Troopers , who were apparently blind , appeared to use no tactics whatsoever in their attack . In the real war , the tactics were what made storm troopers so effective . But the silliest scene was the attack of the German Flamethrowers . In this scene the German flamethrower operators walked in a broad line towards the defending Americans . If that had been real they would never have gotten close enough to use their flamethrowers before they had all been dropped by the defender 's bullets.<br /><br />Okay , so most war movies are unrealistic when it comes to the tactics shown . But it is still disappointing . But what really turned me off to this flick was the typical anti - war anti - military angle that movie makers seem to think is important . True , war is hell . But most American soldiers , even though they grumble and gripe , tend to believe in what they are doing and can be rather gung - ho about it . My Grandfather served in World War I. And even though he died four years before I was born I have been told how proud he was of his service .
0 After watching this movie I was honestly disappointed - not because of the actors , story or directing - I was disappointed by this film advertisements.<br /><br />The trailers were suggesting that the battalion " have chosen the third way out " other than surrender or die ( Polish infos were even misguiding that they had the choice between being killed by own artillery or German guns , they even translated the title wrong as " misplaced battalion " ) . This have tickled the right spot and I bought the movie.<br /><br />The disappointment started when I realized that the third way is to just sit down and count dead bodies followed by sitting down and counting dead bodies ... Then I began to think " hey , this story ca n't be that simple ... I bet this clever officer will find some cunning way to save what left of his troops " . Well , he did n't , they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen . And so was I.<br /><br />The story was based on real events of World War I , so the writers could n't make much use of their imagination , but even thought I found this movie really unchallenging and even a little bit boring . And as I wrote in the first place - it is n't fault of actors , writers or director - their marketing people have raised my expectations high above the level that this movie could cope with .
0 My God , what an incredible movie it is ! Reminded me so much of the similar scene in Mel Gibson 's movie " We were Soldiers " when " the Company is not lost , they 're just cut off " And the other scene in Pearl Harbour when the British officer says to Ben Affleck " If all Americans are like you , then God help the nation that goes to war with America!<br /><br />Put all 3 movies together and you would have enough BULLSHIT to fertilise the entire Sahara Desert.<br /><br />The story of the cut - off Battalion may be real enough but the movie could have done without all that American preachy jingoistic propaganda attached to it . There were audible groans in the cinema during the above - mentioned scene in Pearl Harbour ( no kidding either ) The Lost Battalion however is really in a class of its own ¬Ö .<br /><br />"Americans think they are unbeatable ¬Ö inspired bravery ¬Ö . " I actually cringed and damn near puked at all the swill being spewed out throughout this diarrhoeic disaster ( the movie that is ) < br /><br />The fighting scenes were well made ( 3 stars for that ) but if the script is manure , then wrapped even in brightly coloured ribbons , it is still manure . The writer , James Carabatsos , also wrote those other screamers ¬Ö Hamburger Hill , No Mercy , Heartbreak Ridge . Someone , please shoot him before he writes any more such garbage.<br /><br />The Director , Russell Mulcahy is an Australian too . God , the shame ! ! !
0 1 ) I am not weapon expert , but even i can see difference between U.S. army riffles in WWI and WWII . In movie we can see privates , armed with " M1 Garand " ( invented in year 1932 ! ) , not authentic " 1903 Springfield " ( aka " Silent Death " ) , who privates use until WWII . Difference - M1 can load 1,5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire rate ! M1 was semi - automatic , Springfield requires reloading after every shot . Little difference ? ! 2 ) German army uniforms has borrowed from 1940 Year too . Especially - helmets . German helmets until end of WWI have significant pike on top , we can not see even one in movie . And if we make little additional search in archives - how much truthful is this " True Story " ? I am surprised , how much " truthful " can be film directors in a pursuit of cheap propagation .
0 This movie has the made for TV stink all over it . Though , it started out with great intentions , featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes . The film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue , and rushed TV sappy melodramatic acting . The characters were so sappy that at times I thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo , and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another . The Germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch . The only thing that the German officers talked about was how wonderful the Americans are . Please take my word for this . I am a huge fan of the war genre , and this movie is crap . Nevertheless , this DVD does have an excellent extra feature , covering letters from the WWI front lines , thus making this rental not a total waste of my time .
0 I ended up watching this movie before even going through any of the reviews , on the request of a female . Just out of curiosity , I thought , let me find out if there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie . I am quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this website that makes me conclude that it 's a scam.<br /><br />As far as my opinion goes , I have to ask,"are these filmmakers retarded or do they assume that the viewers are retarded ? " The movie is atrocious on so many levels and I 'm not even talking about the story or presentation.<br /><br />So , these bunch of guys plus one girl ( the lead actress ) form a Music band ; guessing from the constant presence of guitars it is supposed to be a ROCK band . Hell , when did dancers started becoming the part of a Rock band ? ? ? Anyway , let me accept it as the - Bollywood - version - of - a- Rock - band , but amusingly enough all the scores which actually had these two guitarists doing all kinds of cool " ROCK GESTURES " and I am assuming they were playing the instruments , the sound of the guitar was completely missing ! ! ! I simply ca n't comprehend the magnitude of stupidity here .... <br /><br />I am just going to conclude here because it is absolutely not worth pointing out any further flaws in the movie . Bollywood directors seem to have no shame anymore ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0 The movie is plain bad . Simply awful . The string of bad movies from Bollywood has no end ! They must be running out of excuses for making such awful movies ( or not).<br /><br />The problem seems to be with mainly the directors . This movie has 2 good actors who have proved in the past that the have the ability to deliver great performance ... but they were directed so poorly . The poor script did not help either.<br /><br />This movie has plenty of ridiculous moments and very bad editing in the first half . For instance : < br /><br />After his 1st big concert , Ajay Devgan , meets up with Om Puri ( from whom he ran away some 30 years ago and talked to again ) and all Om Puri finds to say is to beware of his friendship with Salman ! ! ! What a load of crap . Seriously . Not to mention the baaad soundtrack . Whatever happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy?<br /><br />Ajay Devgun is total miscast for portraying a rockstar.<br /><br />Only saving grace are the good performances in the second half . Ajay shines as his character shows his dark side . So does Salman as the drug addict . < br /><br />Watch it maybe only for the last half hour .
0 I just wondering what is the purpose of making movies like this ? the profit ? and to whom they are referring what intelligence must use your brain to watch something like this crap ? This movie is watchable by under 3 years old children if you are adults do n't try to watch it . That s the reason i think Hollywood started to use cartoons in movies with actors like this you must forget the art of cinema , be sure that you ll have tons of pop corn to consume for time to pass till this movie ends also get many cola 's hamburgers your laptop your cellphone this movie can be used easily in a restaurant but for sure not in a theater , my dog who is always next to my family when watching a movie left the building . The sure thing is that this movie is referring to people with no demands from the cinema art . The only thing that this movie can be used is for watching it when making the supermarket shopping list . I am giving 2 stars for supporting the India 's cinema efforts but for nothing more or less ..
0 The film was written 10 years back and a different director was planning it with SRK and Aamir in lead roles < br /><br />The film finally was made now with Vipul Shah directing it And Ajay and Salman starring together after a decade HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM(1999)<br /><br />The movie however falls short due to it 's 90 's handling and worst it 's loopholes < br /><br />The film tries to pack in too many commercial ingredients and we also hav the love triangle < br /><br />Everything is predictable and filmy and too clich√©d < br /><br />There are loopholes like how Ajay runs away from London Airport and makes a place for himself with no one ? even the way he starts his band is not convincing The second half gets better with the twist in the tale of Ajay destroying Salman but sadly the climax falls short and the film ends on a bad note < br /><br />Direction by Vipul Shah is ordinary to below average Music is the worst point , most songs are mediocre < br /><br />Amongst actors Ajay gives his best shot though he is n't convincing as a Rock singer yet he does superb as the negative role Salman however irritates with his punjabi and talking nonsense he only impresses when he gets drugged and thereon Asin is nothing great just a show piece Ranvijay should stick to MTV Om Puri is okay
0 The movie is a total crap . We have two good actors who are miscast and a meat - head of an actor Salman Khan just to attract the female audience . The story is a crap . The characters poorly sketched . Non existent story telling . No editing to speak of . Ajay Devgan as a Rock Star .. that is a dream in itself . The movie drags along to the point of decadence . The whole charade about Arjun bringing his Manna to London , let him grope his girlfriend and let him not play at Wembley ( Vimbley in the dubbing process ) is absurd . Salman Khan 's over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch . I remember seeing some good movies from this Producer Vipul Shah but this is not one of them . It seems all the good directors are falling prey to the Box Office mania .. that the Mumbai Media Morons have created . This is yet another crap movie in the lines of " Wanted " with idiot actor like Salman Khan who has no place in a Good Hindi Cinema . He is good to the Indian Cinema as Titanic was to the Winter Cruise Business . On a positive note - I like Asin character dancing Bharatnatyam when she changes to the Western style dancing when the teacher is not looking .
0 Maaan , where do i start with this god awful movie . Bad bad bad story telling . I do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie . Namaste London was quite an enjoyable movie to be honest .. even the soundtrack was good . But in this one .. oh my good .. for a movie which is supposed to be a musical one .. the songs are soooo bad . AR Rahman should have been the music director . < br /><br />Given two great actors a much better job should have been done by the director . Even though the first half sucks , the last 30 mins of the movie are OK . Performances from Salman and Ajay save the movie from being a total disaster.<br /><br />Watch it if you have nothing better to do . The last good movie from Bollywood i watched ( and i do watch a load of them ) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid .
0 Who were they kidding with this ? There was just too much in this film that was hard to digest . Right from when Arjun ( Ajay Devgan ) unknowingly wishes death on his father to when he arrives in London with his uncle(played by Om Puri ) only to abandon him minutes later . The only problem with that theory is that anybody who has ever passed through London Heathrow knows that such a f√™te would be impossible to pull off and especially not by an Indian . But the film problems do not end there , there 's the issue of the two main leads ( Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan ) passing as rock - stars on the verge of achieving their dreams . I mean yeah we saw success come to Susan Boyle ( a woman in the UK achieving her dreams after age 50 ) but that was a rare case . It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief because I felt that the casting of Salman and Ajay was just ill - conceived . They would never cast Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi to play the same roles so why should we be forced to watch Ajay Devgan and Salman Khan ( men well into their 40s ) prance around desperately trying to hang on to their 20s ? Let 's not even talk about the most self - conscious actress on screen today , Asin . This is her second film ( that I have seen ) and she is just hopeless as an actress , so conscious of her looks that she only concerns herself with looking good and voguing for the camera rather than giving in a good acting performance . It 's just hard to believe that she turned down all those other movie roles to star in this fluff and then be so fluffy as an actress , nothing to write home about at all . And to top all of that , the film just boringly dragged on . There 's nothing special about it at all , trust me you will predict every clich√©d thing that is going to happen in it .
0 Vipul Shah has done some really impressive work as a filmmaker in the past . ' Waqt - The Race Against Time ' and ' Namaste London ' were entertaining and interesting to watch . ' Singh Is Kinng ' was fun , which he produced . His latest outing as a filmmaker ' London Dreams ' comes up as his careers weakest fare.<br /><br />'London Dreams ' has a mediocre storyline , it 's about how success turns friendship into hatred . Agreed , it has the potential but when you watch ' London Dreams ' you wonder what 's happening ? This film has maybe the worst climax in recent times . Vipul Shah the writer puts Vipul Shah the director down . < br /><br />The first hour is boring , The second hour is better ; but again the climax is horrendous . How can anyone forgive a person who decided to destroy you ? I wo n't . Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask forgiveness to his diaper buddy , thanks to his uncle Om Puri . When he reaches India , rather than slapping or abusing him Salman welcomes him with band baja and says he was the reason behind the entire fiasco ? Was Vipul Shah 's intension to show Salman 's character as a GOD ? If yes , than you 've failed completely . The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is that , would you welcome a person who destroyed you with such a great reception ? Write what you feel , do n't fool us { the audience } , we are sensible enough to understand what 's good or not . < br /><br />This is a musical but the music by Shankar - Eshaan - Loy is terrible . Not a single song stays in your mind . < br /><br />Salman is superb though . He carries the film on his shoulders and does really , really well in the emotional scenes . But again his character is shown as a GOD , which makes him look like a retard in the end . Ajay is equally good , but Salman has over - shadowed him completely . Asin is wasted , and what is a great talent like Om Puri doing in this film ? Rannvijay hams , though Aditya Roy Kapoor excels . Brinda Parekh is alright as the vamp.<br /><br />On the whole , this dream remains a dream !
0 London Dreams , directed by Vipul Shah , is a frustratingly foolish film about foolish people . It 's the kind of film whose central conflict could be instantly resolved if the characters concerned simply sat down and had a chat . Ajay Devgan plays Arjun , an aspiring pop - artiste obsessed with performing before a cheering crowd at London 's Wembley Stadium . He becomes jealous of his devoted best friend and band - mate Manu , played by Salman Khan , who is evidently more talented than him , but nowhere near as focused or ambitious . Arjun decides to sabotage Manu when the latter 's popularity threatens to outshine his own . Now here 's where a heart - to - heart might have helped . Had Arjun explained what this Wembley fixation meant to him , Manu would have graciously backed off and let Arjun fulfill his childhood dream , and we 'd have been spared the agony of watching the rest of this uninspiring drivel . But director Vipul Shah and his writers are in no mood to do us any favours . London Dreams is packed with unintentionally hilarious gems like that back - story involving Arjun 's grandpa who committed suicide out of shame for getting stage - fright at a packed Wembley concert . Or the ridiculous incident at a show where Manu must take over vocal responsibilities after a blast of confetti practically chokes Arjun into silence . The idiocy , however , does n't end there . In his attempts to shame Manu publicly , Arjun uses his connections to get Manu hooked onto drugs . A buxom groupie urges Manu to down a couple of tequila shots with her but replaces his salt with cocaine . Before you know it , Manu has acquired quite the appetite for the addictive white powder , practically chomping it down like dinner . If that is n't silly enough , there 's a crude scene later in which Manu chases after the said girl to find out who she 's been taking orders from . The pursuit ends in a dark London alley where the girl gets down on her knees pretending to do the unmentionable so as to mislead Manu 's girlfriend who 's been secretly following after them . Wait , there 's more ! Expect to howl hysterically when Arjun snaps off his belt and whips himself mercilessly to banish all thoughts of romance or lust towards the band 's lead dancer Priya ( played by Asin ) because nothing and no one must distract him from his musical goals . Too generously inspired by Milos Forman 's Amadeus for it to merit any comparison with last year 's Rock On ! , Vipul Shah 's latest is a clunky melodrama that 's as loosely directed as it is scripted . The film goes for broad humor , over - the - top emotions , and basically chooses loudness over subtlety . That works for Manu 's character , with Salman Khan playing him all loutish and lovable , but in the case of Arjun , Ajay Devgan comes off too passive with a performance that is mostly internalised . When Arjun does reach boiling point however , it results in an awkward pre - climax scene in which he lectures a packed concert hall and is understandably pelted with plastic bottles as punishment . Of the remaining cast , there 's not a kind word I can say for Asin , who practically lit up Ghajini with her ebullient charm , but disappoints here with unnecessary over - acting in a thankless role . Ranvijay Singh and Aditya Roy Kapur , reduced to mere sidekicks in the band , show up at regular intervals , usually to utter some inane dialogue like , " We 'll rock it dude ! " For its dim - witted writing and sloppy direction , London Dreams is ultimately a tiresome watch . If you must , watch it for Salman Khan who 's turned buffoonery into a bonafide acting style . It 's the only thing that 'll make you smile in this sad , sad film .
0 The Lack of content in this movie amazed me the most . First i though that people was going to compare this to Rock On ! but i 'm really surprised myself to say that this was worst than Rock On ! So - so story Horrible cast Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin you got ta be kidding me . The music was Okay Khanabadosh was the track of the movie the rest was bad ! Vipul Shah has n't still learn from Singh is King 's critically bashed comedy . Now Asin .. where do she come from sorry for Asin 's fan out there but she suck*d big time in this movie seriously bad acting she did n't look good at all overdose of make - up ! My final verdict go watch Aladin with your family instead wasting your time here .
0 It 's a bad season for Bollywood with all the big releases with a massive hype surrounding proving to be duds at the box office . London Dreams is no exception to that . Let 's dissect it ... It 's all about chasing your dreams and how far will you go to achieve it . Sounds impressive right ? But unfortunately the film is not.<br /><br />Arjun ( Ajay Devgan ) is an aspiring musician who wants to make it big someday . His dream is to perform in Wembley stadium in front of a cheering 90,000 audience calling out his name . He is joined by two brothers , Zoheb & Wasim ( debutants Aditya Roy & Ranvijay ) and a ravishing Priya ( Asin ) . Together they form " London Dreams " their dream band . After impressing the chief of a record company , they become overnight sensations . Arjun is secretly in love with Priya which he does n't want to reveal till he achieves his goal . Arjun then brings his childhood friend Manjit Khosla aka Mannu ( Salman Khan ) , a carefree flirtatious guy who has got no ambitions in life , to join their band . Mannu is a trained musician and a real talent for whom later Arjun become envious for Mannu 's superior skills and his affair with Priya . Arjun with the help of Zoheb plans to blight Mannu . What happens next forms the rest of the movies.<br /><br />Coming to the technical aspects , we feel only the shadow of Vipul Amritlal Sha whom we have admired in Namaste London . Felt like he simply visualized the screenplay . To cut it short , a glorified cameraman . Screenplay by Suresh Nair dulls even though it has its moments . Defined in a predictable fashion , the screenplay bore you to stiff . Camera work was awesome in capturing the beauty of London . It 's the only entertaining part while watching songs.<br /><br />Few songs are hummable while others are passable noisy fare . Ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character . Salman is monotonous and he irks you . Asin is forgettable and I do n't that she will make it big in Bollywood . Aditya Roy is impressive while Ranvijay is strictly OK . Brinda as the bitch is what we have seen in innumerable movies . Ompuri is ongoing with the proceedings . I do n't want to pen down about the flaws as it will be a herculean task.<br /><br />Finally let me put it simple and straight , London Dreams is a soulless movie which you may better enjoy on DVD .
0 First thing first . In this genre movie the first thing you need is a good music , and that s where Mr. shankar and his party fails.<br /><br />music is completely pale and uneffective . On other hand there is AJAY DEVGAN , WHO HAS REMOVED A LETTER ' A ' from his spelling , done good job but was of no use to a bad casted movies like this.<br /><br />ASIN is like a doll which is used to amuse public , even though she is good to look at but her role in movie is to dance , actually she is dancing member of a rock band and i do n't think any rock band have there dancer as a member of band.<br /><br />in nut shell this movie is a piece of crap a piece of * * * t . watch it if you wanna get fooled .
0 Below average movie with poor music considering a movie based on music ? ? ? Ordinary Script & Direction with full of blunders . Salman Khan was at his usual acting . Ajay 's performance deteriorating with time as his looks , especially his styles as a Rock Star were pathetic . Asin was just a showpiece only . Overall I felt like wasting my money in cinema . Salman Khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan . There were many songs in the movie all boring except " Man Ko Ati " . The Most Important Song to impress the UK Music Sponsor was most unimpressive . " Khanabadosh " can be very easily understood by an English Music Sponsor . The other movie I saw last week was " Wake Up Sid " which was simple slow love story with good direction & acting despite average music
0 I could n't believe some of the horrible dialog coming out of people 's mouths , and the end reel of bloopers attached to body of the film was a real hoot . And we get titty shots of Angelique Pettyjohn ( sort of ) and Loren Crabtree to boot.<br /><br />A teleportation device activated by psychic Angelique Pettyjohn brings an alien container to an underground lab out in the desert . According to director Fred Olen Ray , they were leftover sets from the Klaus Kinski film , ANDROID which gives the film an increased value beyond how cheap it looks.<br /><br />Inside the container is a midget alien ( played by Ray 's son ) who starts clawing people to death . It was pretty funny watching this little ' creature ' in a black reptile suit with what looks like large beetle shells attached to it , running around in the dark . We even get to see the little thing stamp and tear at a poster of ET , which I thought was hilarious.<br /><br />And then there 's what looks like a snake that also comes out of the container that gets hammered to death by William Fair , after the mini creature chews into Frank McDonald 's neck in the kitchen . A low budget take on ALIEN , I suppose ... <br /><br />The whole thing ends abruptly , looking like they ran out of film at the end before the blooper reel comes in with the end credits . Talk about a lack of funding ... <br /><br />Fred Olen Ray also mentions in the director 's commentary that they also were n't sure if Aldo Ray would make through the shooting and remember his lines . He barely did.<br /><br />Low budget cheese sneeze . It 's fun to watch , I 'll grant ya that . < br /><br />4 out of 10
0 If you 're watching this movie , you 're either a Fred Olen Ray fan , you found it on the $ 4.99 shelf at Suncoast and thought " what do I have to lose ? " , or you spun around the video store with your eyes closed and rented the first movie your finger touched.<br /><br />This movie is hysterically bad . It 's got everything a terrible movie needs : a screenplay featuring jaw - dropping dialogue and baffling detours in the plot , wacky science involving psychics and other dimensions , continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space , actors that are not only wooden , but seems to border on befuddled , gratuitous nudity ( not all of it is what you necessarily would ask for ) , and of course , a 5 ' monster played by what I assume is Fred Olen Ray 's kid.<br /><br />Underneath it all , however , there is something resembling heart -- as if Mickey & Judy decided to get together all the kids in the neighborhood and make a monster movie ( hey ! my dad can direct it ! yeah ! We can use red paint from my johnny 's dad 's hardware store , and I know this ex - stripper who can act in it!).<br /><br />Watch for the blooper reel over the credits -- you get to find out why the final cut of the movie was so crappy.<br /><br />Incidentally , Biohazard II ... the Alien Force is also worth a look , but does n't have the same enjoyably crappy veneer this one does .
0 I was always curious about this film because it is so tough to find , so when I stumbled upon it on Ebay I forked over the $ 10 and bought it , now I understand why its so rare ! This film is SO bad , so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits , which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines , are literally the movie 's highlight . The film is about a psychic ( Pettyjohn , cast for one obvious reason , her topless scene ) whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality . When she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it , and gee , what do you know ? SURPRISE ! A kid in a foam - rubber monster costume pops out , instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face , then escapes to a nearby city . But rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to Pettyjohn and Ray to find it on their own , but no matter , this movie blows all its credibility LONG before then . This barely escapes being voted a 1 by me only because of unintentional laughs , somebody needs to alert the producers of " Mystery Science Theater 3000 " if they do n't know about it already ! 2 out 10 , really , REALLY bad !
0 Occasionally one is served a new entr√©e from foreign films . That is their great attraction . They take from life and serve it up raw . American films , rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society . Too many hang - ups and a morbid fear of financial failure . The Almighty dollar , determines their selections . Something which invites European directors . In addition , audiences world wide remain hungry for " different " films , especially those which offer a savory bite out of the wretched , suffering body of humanity . Despite the fear of directors or producers , many audiences yearn for beauty , poetry , and the pristine flavor of life . That is what the film " To the Left of the Father " offers to curious audiences . A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it 's obedience to tradition . Yet when the patriarch of a family forgets it 's members are flesh and blood humans , filled with raging , unbridled dreams and dark passions , then the two are set in motions against itself . Selton Mello plays Andr√© a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father . Raul Cortez plays his Father . Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters . Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro , the elder brother . The film offers much , but does takes an extremely inordinate amount of time to say it . * * *
0 " Boom " has garnered itself a something of a reputation . With heavyweights Taylor , Burton , Noel Coward , Tennessee Williams and Joseph Losey , one might be tempted to think , how bad could it be ? Well , it 's a lot worse than you could possibly imagine.<br /><br />The sad and disturbing fact of " Boom " is that is seems to signal the decline and fall of the aforementioned heavyweights . It was only director Joseph Losey who having plummeted the depths with " Modesty Blaise " and " Boom " ( some may wish to add " Secret Ceremony " ) , managed to recuperate and in 1970 create his best work , the wonderful " Go - Between".<br /><br />Saddest of all is the work of Tennesee Williams . From the mid forties until the early sixties , Williams penned a number of plays which have gained classic status , remaining in theater repertory throughout the world , many becoming much praised films . When William 's muse deserted him , probably owing to his notorious substance abuse , it deserted him for good . Williams at his best is an actor 's dream providing many unforgettable performances . ( Were Ava Gardner or Deborah Kerr ever better than in " Night of the Iguana " ? ) Taylor in particular , shone in both " Cat on a Hot Tin Roof " and " Suddenly Last Summer " . There is an anecdote in which supposedly Taylor asks John Gielgud whether he would teach her to play Shakespeare , to which he replied " if you will teach me to play Tennessee Williams " . Had Gielgud seen " Boom " he would have held his tongue . Taylor simply has never been worse , turning in a cringe inducing performance . Despite her face photographing well , she is decidedly podgy . Besides the physical decline , from this time onwards she would basically lose credibility as a serious actress with a string of completely forgettable ( and worse ) roles to her credit.<br /><br />Much the same could be said of Burton . Following his short lived theatrical stardom , he won fame and fortune in Hollywood . But the body of his work from this point onwards ( 1968 ) would be unremarkable to say the least.<br /><br />Noel Coward had long ceased being a force in the theater where his drawing room comedies had been replaced by the likes of Williams and the British " angry young men " . He seems to be enjoying himself camping it up , but barely manages to amuses , that from the man who claimed such a talent.<br /><br />The only cast member who maintains her dignity is young Joanna Shimkus , who in a few years would forego a promising screen career to become Mrs. Sidney Poitier.<br /><br />"Boom " reeks of self indulgence ; it 's simply out of control . A rather sad pointer to careers gone wrong rather than a camp fun fest as some have suggested .
0 Boy , this was one lousy movie ! While I have n't seen all of the Burton / Taylor collaborations , I can say with confidence that this is the worst . This rich but ill woman ( Taylor , of course ) owns this beautiful island in the Meditteranean , ruling over a put - upon staff when she 's suddenly visited by this traveling poet , who mouths platitudes . In fact , the whole film is just a talk fest , with much of the talk making no sense . Even in 1968 , no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense , and the passage of time makes that even more clear . If it were n't for the beautiful cinematography and scenery , it would deserve a negative rating . The only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars .
0 This astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians . From a ( silly ) play by Tennessee Williams and directed ( with a dead hand ) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff - top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to Universal in 1967 . The result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief . Visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set . The shrill antics of a screeching Taylor , Burton 's half asleep wanderings , the loony dialog , Noel Coward laughing at himself , the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer . BOOM is a disgrace , a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet 's plebs . Not even fun . Just terrible and mad shocking waste .
0 WOW ! Pretty terrible stuff . The Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and hooks up with arty director Joseph Losey for this remarkably ill - conceived Tennessee Williams fiasco . Taylor plays a rich , dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates , very loudly , her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary . When scoundrel Burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend , Taylor realizes her time is up . Ludicrious in the extreme --- it 's difficult to determine if Taylor and Burton are acting badly OR if it was Williams ' intention to make their characters so unappealing . If that 's the case , then the acting is brilliant ! Burton mumbles his lines , including the word BOOM several times , while Taylor screeches her 's . She 's really awful . So is Noel Coward as Taylor 's catty confidante , the " Witch of Capri . " < br /><br />Presumably BOOM is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along --- two standard Williams themes , but it 's so misdirected by Losey , that had Taylor and Burton not spelled it out for the audience during their mostly inane monologues , any substance the film has would have been completely diluted . < br /><br />BOOM does have stunning photography --- the camera would have to have been out of focus to screw up the beauty of Sardinia ! The supporting cast features Joanna Shimkus , the great Romolo Valli as Taylor 's resourceful doctor and Michael Dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard ... both he and his dogs do a number on Burton !
0 Whatever rating I give BOOM is only because of the superb location photography of Sardinia and Rome . Otherwise , this is only for hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR ( her downward phase ) , and RICHARD BURTON ( his miscasting phase ) . Tennessee Williams wrote " The Milk Train Does n't Stop Here Anymore " and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play -- but apparently , he was the only one . Taylor reportedly hated it and Burton needed the money.<br /><br />Whatever , it amounts to a hill of beans with Taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner , exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby - talk with no less than NOEL COWARD who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears.<br /><br />It 's so campy that among Taylor fans it 's probably considered a " must see " kind of thing . But if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand , you 're way ahead of me . Sadly , this is the film that signified the end of Taylor being taken seriously as a film actress , even after winning two Oscars . For Burton , it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a BOMB . Judge for yourself if you dare .
0 Is rich , ailing Elizabeth Taylor courting the Angel of Death on her island fortress in the Mediterranean , or is she just overreacting -- or more precisely , overacting -- as usual ? Actually , both are applicable in director Joseph Losey 's wandering , meandering mess called " Boom " , appropriately titled since tempers in the lush , luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode . Richard Burton climbs Taylor 's mountain uninvited ; she dresses him in a samurai 's robe complete with saber . Though great - looking in widescreen , the picture is otherwise quite deadly , a failure even Liz ' n Dick - philes should shun ( the stars ' collective " what the hell ! " attitude to their late-'60s film careers reached an ego - mad nadir here ) . Pointless , confused , and maddening , " Boom " is a catastrophe -- although screenwriter Tennessee Williams , who adapted his own unsuccessful play " The Milk Train Does n't Stop Here Anymore " , was said to be quite fond of it ! * from * * * *
0 I have an awful pan - and - scan videotape of " Boom ! " , and I want to see it in all its widescreen glory . So I voted " 1 " and hope you will too . Together , we can pull this movie down into the pits of cinematic dross , and hope that someone will see an opportunity for BIG MONEY in releasing " Boom ! " in its Director 's Cut Extended Version . The movie is one of my howling favorites ¬Ö you just look at the people involved , the director , the actors , the cameraman , and you say to yourself , " Yep , I guess you can fool some of the people for a lot of time . " Producers considering the DVD release of " Boom ! " should note that , everywhere it 's been shown , there have been sellout crowds in the theaters . But it has n't been up to Frostbite Falls yet .
0 The movie appeals to public due to charisma of Ben Stiller and notoriety of J. Aniston . It seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title , but there 's nothing successful in this movie.<br /><br />Polly is very well played by Aniston , no doubt . This is the kind of character which suits her perfectly . < br /><br />Bem Stiller is the same troublesome guy like in " Meet the parents " , but in this movie the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above.<br /><br />The script is very poor with nothing special at all . With this two well payed actors the things could get a lot better - but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script.<br /><br />4 out of 10 .
0 I realize several Ben Stiller movies are out or will be out this year , but perhaps he should insist on quality , not quantity.<br /><br />I was dumbfounded at what the filmmakers thought passed for comedy in " Along Came Polly . " < br /><br />Stiller 's Reuben is grating , charmless and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year . Stiller 's schtick is getting tiresome . He undoubtedly has comic talent , but he needs to either find another schtick or take a break , find some material that is actually funny . Because his movies are going from painfully humorless to excruciatingly bad.<br /><br />There 's absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston , which is a shame because she 's a good , smart actress with a promising career . As long as she keeps making more movies such as " The Good Girl " ( in which she 's terrific ) and less like " Along Came Polly , " she 'll have a career of which she could be proud.<br /><br />Aniston tries desperately to overcome the limp material with which she 's working , but it 's a daunting task for any actress . With the exception of a few moments with Alec Baldwin , as Reuben 's boss Stan , and Philip Seymour Hoffman , as Reuben 's best friend Sandy , there 's nothing funny in this awful film . Other supporting characters , including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude , are annoying . Azaria 's accent is not only stupid , it 's terribly unfunny.<br /><br />The premise of " Along Came Polly " certainly showed promise . Unfortunately , it needed a writer who could actually turn it into a good comedy , instead of this lame , dull , boring excuse for a comedy .
0 I saw this for free , thankfully , and wish it was better than it was , but it 's really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to foist on us in the last ten years.<br /><br />Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple who are opposites- and yet they are attracted to each other.<br /><br />If that plot line does n't take you by surprise and thrill you , the movie wo n't either.<br /><br />Lots of sight gags and fart jokes . Halfway through the movie I began to realize that Ben Stiller really is n't that funny , but he tries VERY hard . And Jennifer Anniston really is n't that pretty , but her HAIR looks great . And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman must have got paid a great deal of money to be in this kind of average ho - hum movie , I 've come to expect more from them.<br /><br />What was interesting was that I saw this after I saw American Splendor , which is a truly funny and original movie- and I compared the two in my head , and found myself wishing that the movie executives would be forced to sit through those two movies back to back- perhaps that would knock some sense into them and < br /><br />they'd start making better movies with unknowns rather than this formulaic stuff that plays best on airplanes .
0 This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen . The DVD was given to me free with an order I placed online for non DVD related items.<br /><br />No wonder they were given away , surely no one could part with money for this drivel.<br /><br />How some reviewers can say they found it hilarious beggars belief , the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it spot on.<br /><br />How on earth a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman could get involved in this rubbish is unbelievable . Mostly toilet humour and badly done at that.<br /><br />Anyone wanting to be entertained should avoid this at all costs .
0 Okay , I absolutely LOVE Ben Stiller , although I am lukewarm about Jennifer Aniston . I do not think this girl can act in the least . Every movie or sitcom I 've seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting . It sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script . This movie only had one good thing about it , and that 's that Ben Stiller was in it . This plot is so used and abused it 's ridiculous . How many movies have this same type of plot ? ? Can we say " Forces of Nature ? ? " Not only is the plot so old , but the outcome is so predictable , it 's boring . I knew everything that was going to happen before it did . It was a bore , but watching Stiller is always a delight ! ! !
0 Make no bones about it . There are a lot of things wrong with this movie . It 's clich√©d the whole way , not very funny , predictable , and illogical . Let 's start at the beginning : characters . There 's the boring , luckless guy - giving Stiller another notch in his boring , luckless guy belt - the allegedly wild , but in reality just fairly normal , love interest - whom Aniston plays well , but really needed no effort to do so - the fat , jovial friend , and then the assortment of clich√©s : an annoying daredevil Australian guy , a confident Spanish guy , etc . The storyline : the beginning is slightly unusual , but thereafter goes into the standard any - movie style , with every plot turn as predictable as your average knock - knock joke . The biggest problem was that Stiller 's character 's " development " really seemed to come from nothing - like your average school play , the writers knew where he started and where he ended , but did n't put enough stock into properly telling the middle bit . Finally , the alleged ' jokes ' were nothing but highly watered down versions of standard gross - out humour ; there was a regulation chunder scene , sweaty fat men , etc.<br /><br />In conclusion , the simple fact about this movie is that learning the meaning of the word ' shart ' was the only good thing . Hamburg really dished up a dog 's dinner here , and the sugar coating of Stiller and Aniston may have lured the viewers , but the taste left at the end was just as rancid.<br /><br />Final comment : This film may have been dreadful , but Aniston still picked a better between - Friends - seasons movie than Kudrow 's odious ' Marci X. '
0 This film offers absolutely no imagination in it 's premise nor in it 's execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so - called comedy that has no energy to speak of . Story is about nit - picky over analytical insurance risk manager Reuben Feffer ( Ben Stiller ) who finds his new wife Lisa ( Debra Messing ) cheating on him with a scuba instructor ( Hank Azaria ) after only one day on their honeymoon . Upon returning home Reuben and his best friend Sandy ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) go to a party and run into Polly Prince ( Jennifer Aniston ) whom they went to school with years earlier.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT * * * * * Polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree which is the opposite of who Reuben is as a person but they start to date and Reuben starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods . But one day Lisa comes back and wants to remain married to Reuben but he really does n't want to but Polly decides to leave as she does n't believe in marriage to begin with.<br /><br />This film is the second directing effort by John Hamburg who wrote two generally unfunny screenplays in " Zoolander " and " Meet the Parents " but those two films seem like classics compared to this stale piece of drivel . It 's very easy to say something is not funny but I think with this film it 's even easier to figure out why . This film is totally and utterly predictable from start to finish with every scene looking as if it 's only happening because of the ridiculousness of the script . Hamburg who also wrote the script seems to have written this without any thought of trying something different and at times he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as " There 's Something About Mary " but instead the events seem incredibly forced . Did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny ? If you do , your easy ! A few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is overstating the obvious . Stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the better scripts to come his way because this film does n't work as a comedy or as a romance .
0 Considering the potential this move had , the reality was disappointing . While it 's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie , even that could n't turn this around . Most of the action was predictable . The jokes were flat to mildly amusing . And the characters were not very interesting . I wanted to like this film , but it just never happened . Ben Stiller was hilarious in " There 's Something about Mary " . Here it looks like he 's just going thru the motions . If they have to lift plot points from " Friends " , they should have known something was wrong . The toilet humor should have stayed in the closet : -).<br /><br />Watch " 50 First Dates " instead .
0 Ben Stiller does n't so much act as react . And he does it very well . He is very dependent on the comedy going on around him . In There 's Something About Mary , the stand - up hair scene only works because of Stiller trying to keep a straight face . When he confronts Mary 's other two suitors , he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilarious.<br /><br />In Along Came Polly , the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom . Stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent . Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines , of which there are too few . Having said that , Hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour - you know we are in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh . A basketball scene where Hoffman hams it up is completely overplayed ( though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile - noticeably through Stiller 's reaction ) . However , everyone seems to be acting in a bubble , there is very little reaction . Hoffman and Stiller 's characters could have played off each other much , much more . Aniston again reprises her Rachael role , but Stiller is no Ross . It is more of a " Joey with a crush on Rachael " scenario.<br /><br />Polly is a by - the - numbers rom - com and that is its failing - it lacks heart . You do n't root for the characters . With a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story , but in the end the film 's failure comes down to poor writing . Worth watching if it pops up on TV on a slow night , but you 'll regret forking out cash to see it .
0 When I saw that this movie was being shown on TV , I was really looking forward to it . I grew up in the 1980 's and like everyone else who has grown up in that era , have seen every 80 's teen and summer camp movie out there . So I could n't wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre . What a disappointment ! ! The movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over , with hardly any plot and no substance . And the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed - some of these so - called jokes did n't come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive . The only good things about this film were the wardrobe , music , and acting . It was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80 's , and the same goes for the music . And the acting was top - notch throughout : almost all of Hollywood 's best comedians were present . Too bad they did n't have better material to work with .
0 I was dying to see this once I saw the ridiculous MEATBALLS poster and divined that it had to be the best satire ever . What a brilliant idea for a satire -- the genre is rife . Unfortunately , the finished product ( as I think all involved probably realize ) is a catalogue of missed opportunities , not - quite - there performances and ( thankfully ! ) a few extremely hilarious , inspired bits . Janeane Garafolo , who is very striking , looks really bad here , probably because she is uncomfortably struggling to make her flat role funny . David Hyde Pierce is just sad to watch , trying to hard to be funny and looking like a Castro nerd . Molly Shannon is so funny just SEEING her makes you laugh , but somehow her segment fails to snowball into something hysterical . Paul Rudd had great teen mannerisms and was sexy as hell , the other guys are also really funny ( the nerdier ones ) . I think the problem is the director just does n't move things along at the right pace . He starts out very deadpan , and that sets the monotone . But when he lets things get really outrageous ( the drug sequence is the second funniest moment I 've had all year in movies , the first also coming in a lame movie : Andrea Martin in ALL OVER THE GUY complaining about the movie IN & OUT ) , it 's just plain funny . I wanted this movie to work so badly , but it just did n't . The clothes and styling for 1981 are 99.9 % PERFECT , and the very few songs used are also perfect . This ends up as a medium - bad MAD TV episode , complete with frustratingly overlong sketches .
0 IT IS A PIECE OF CRAP ! not funny at all . during the whole movie nothing ever happens . i almost fell asleep , which in my case happens only if a movie is rally bad . ( that is why it did n't get 1 ( awful ) out of 10 but 2).don't be fooled , like i was , by first review . a waste of money and your time ! spend it on other stuff . at this point i 'm finished with my review but i have to fill in at least ten lines of text so i will go on ....

0 If you can believe it , * another * group of teens return to * another * lakeside cabin three years after * another * one of those fatal ' accidents ' claimed one of their number . Low and behold , a psycho wearing a patterned hockey mask ( a cheap papery one at that ) turns up to waste them one by one . This mechanical ' Friday the 13th ' knock off gained slight notoriety as one of the first digitally - shot features , but that 's where the interesting facts end and all that remains is a predictable , amateur production with sub - par performances and a recurring boom - mic intrusion . A last - second twist does little to lift the spirits , and ' Memorial Day ' is something best tossed in a lake and forgotten about . One for insane slasher collectors only .
0 I have to say although this movie was formulaic throughout with a plot stolen from films like Friday the 13th / I Know What You Did Last Summer , this movie was n't that bad . In fact it was n't as bad as most of the Horror films Hollywood has released recently . The killings although at times a little too imaginative were in most instances just that , original . The cast was mediocre which is to be expected from low - budget features but much better than what that much bigger studio Artisan / Lions Gate has been offering . My only real complaint that was n't due to the film 's budget , which must have been small , was the contrived " twist " ending . I 'm sorry but this is what put this film in the bad category for me . The ending was just stupid and tacked on . Before that I was a little bored , but actually enjoying it . 4/10
0 Three years ago , Rachel(Therese Fretwell ) was partying at the lake with her friends when her brother falls out of a boat and drowns . Rachel 's friends think it is time for her to stop beating herself up and taking blame for something she had no control over . So grab the brew and something to chew and head back to the same lake that has been in Rachel 's constant nightmares . As expected , a bloodbath has already started when two of the friends are splattered before even heading to the party . This flick has the feel of a high school play where everyone forgot their lines and ' winged it' ... very badly ! Writer Marcos Gabriel gave himself the meatier role as Rachel 's boyfriend Leo . Outside of Fretwell and Gabriel there are some pretty lame acting and a few characters you would like to choke the crap out of before they get ' offed ' . Giving attention to a few more players that had the nerve to appear : Erin Gallagher , Andrew Williams , Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves . This is one MEMORIAL DAY you would n't mind missing .
0 First off , I had my doubts just looking at the DVD box and reading it saying that it was about of bunch of teens gathering at a lake where they will find do or something . Any movie that has a premise like this has failed miserably , even as a slasher movie , except for the first Friday the 13th.<br /><br />I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times , but I just kept thinking that it had to get a little better . It did n't . Usually , I think every movie has something that you can take from it . This has nothing.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor , and find something constructive to do for 80 minutes . Like , give yourself papercuts , or eat dirt .
0 It seems evident from this adaptation that he did not . Not only did he leave the plot behind , he made up his own ! The things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously unbelievable that I was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel . The plot was hazy , inconsistent and choppy to say the least . I do n't want to say anything mean - spirited about the actors , but they ca n't act ! Dickens is difficult , of course , but this is pathetic ! Micawber was nothing more than a mid - nineteenth century Kramer , and the less said about Betsy Trotwood the better ! If you want to see the real Copperfield , watch the wonderful 1999 BBC adaptation . As for the screenplay writer , I think he read the Cliff 's Notes !
0 I would n't recommend this unless you 're keen on David Copperfield and want to " complete the set " . There are some good performances ( e.g. Uriah Heep ) and well directed moments ( e.g. the beating ) , but on the whole it really pales in comparison with the 1999 BBC version , as well as earlier versions . < br /><br />There are inexplicable changes to the story that really serve no great purpose except , possibly , to dumb it down ( the stolen jewels being a case in point ) . The American cast were poorly chosen : Sally Field is a good actress , but she is wrong as Betsy Trotwood , and her English accent is only slightly better than Dick Van Dyke 's cockney . I can see why Michael Richards was chosen to play Mr Micawber ; he hams it up rather too much , however , and becomes irritating . He also speaks his lines in an accent that goes beyond eccentric and becomes simply preposterous . Anthony Andrews is menacing as Mr Murdstone , but one almost expects him to don a black cape and tie David 's mother to a railway line ( though this is perhaps partly the fault of Dickens ) . < br /><br />I got this for free with a newspaper . It helped pass a Sunday afternoon , but I felt more disappointed than charmed at the end of it
0 I 'm guessing the writers have never read a book of any kind , much less a Dickens novel , and certainly not David Copperfield , and that they based their screenplay on another poorly written screenplay , possibly an adaptation of Copperfield , though just as likely anything else , from which they randomly discarded about a third of the pages and then shuffled the rest , along with some random pages from a screenplay that someone 's eighth grade nephew had written for an English class , and for which he had received a failing grade . < br /><br />If the casting was a bad joke - e.g. , Richards as Kramer playing Micawber - which it was , then the direction and acting were the poorly- delivered punch lines . Getting beyond Kramer as Micawber , if possible , Ham was such a complete ogre , hunch - back and all , that I was half expecting at some point to see him being pursued by an angry pitch - fork and torch wielding mob of villagers . Uriah was almost as much of a clown figure as Micawber . Mr. Murdstone evoked about as much terror as that Muppet vampire from Sesame street . The actor playing older David was , I believe , actually a woman . In any case , looking perpetually as if he wished he could find a mirror to see how pretty he looked , and fancied that he looked quite pretty indeed , he could scarcely convince us that he was writing with a quill pen . And while we 're on that subject , in one of the many gross inaccuracies perpetrated by the half - wit producers of this embarrassment , in the unnecessary shots of David writing his story he appears to be somewhere between 18 and 21 years old , when he should be in his forties . Perhaps the greatest transgression , although it 's difficult to choose , was the invented showdown between David and Murdstone as he courted a third wife in Switzerland , preceded of course by the invented death of Murdstone 's second wife . While they were at it it is a wonder they did n't send Heep to the guillotine , and have him deliver Sidney Carton 's famous last words . It could n't have made things much worse really . It might have been far far better.<br /><br />There are literally thousands of small and large sins against literature throughout this miscarriage of art , and anyone who watches it runs the risk of severe and permanent damage to all aspects of their sensibility .
0 Right up until the end the bad guys have the upper - hand - always - which kind of put into question the competence of the good guys . A couple of innocent - man - accused - of - a - crime plots are irritating . Some unnecessary dialogue in which various dull legal issues get debated . This is just a mediocre dumb old western , so what 's this nonsense about trying to keep things " realistic " ? Cagney 's atypical presence in a western is one of the few - if not the only - entertaining thing about the movie . Somewhere around the middle there is a ridiculously - timed marriage proposal ; sort of like " Where is the Kid hiding ? ? ! ! Where is he ? ! ... Oh , and by the way , will you marry me ? "
0 There are so many goofy things about this movie that I ca n't possibly name but a few:<br /><br />BOGART 's character : 1 . His name ¬ñ Whip McCord ( too easy , so I 'll leave it at that . Boy , it makes ` Humphrey ' sound good . ) 2 . His long , curly hair and silly sideburns . 3 . His Black Bart get - up , complete with spurs ! 4 . Not sure what shade of lipgloss they 've got him wearing , but it ai n't none too flattering.<br /><br />CAGNEY 's character ( Jim Kincaid ): 1 . His lipstick does n't do him any favors , either . 2 . The man is being swallowed by his hat during the entire film ! Could they not find a hat to fit him ? Even a LITTLE ? ! ! ? ! 3 . His pants are too tight in the rear . 4 . He blows the smoke off his gun one too many times , if you know what I mean , and I think you do.<br /><br />If you are a casual Bogart or Cagney fan , and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a western , do yourself a favor and forget that thought . EVEN THE HORSES LOOK EMBARRASSED ! ( That is , when they do n't look bored.)<br /><br />In all fairness , I admit that westerns are my least favorite film genre , but I 've still seen much , MUCH better than this.<br /><br />On a comedy level , or as high camp , The Oklahoma Kid works . Otherwise , it 's viewer beware . Therefore , see this only if a ) you must see every western out there b ) you are a TRUE Cagney or Bogie completist c ) any of the above comments appeal to you . Woah ¬Ö ..
0 In Hollywood in the 1930 's and 1940 's , I think that every studio can make a western , except Warner bros . The few times they try , it always ridiculous ( except , perhaps , for They Died with their Boots on - which is a cavalery western . ) I have read that Humphrey Bogart , seing James Cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head , said that he looks like a mushroom . True ! Cagney and Bogart are too urban , too XXe century to be credible in a western movie . The story here had no suprise , and it did't help . Every 10 minutes , I figure I can see Bogart and Cagney drops their little guns and put hands in a machine gun to get away from the set in a 1930 's black car .
0 I started watching this movie expecting some barely tolerable Hammer horror film wannabe ... and I was n't far off . There 's a fair amount of glimpsed gore , and they threw in lots of nudity , but the latter half of the movie presents a few ironic twists . Holy cow , they actually put a little thought into the story , and did n't completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset . And dare I say it , some of the " gratuitous " nudity was n't so gratuitous after all , because it fit in with the story and setting.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong , it 's still overall a bad movie , but as bad movies go , it 's a shade more intelligent than the REALLY horrible tripe like Mesa of Lost Women and Robot Monster .
0 Man , what the hell were the people who made this film on ? And more importantly where can I get some ? The opening scene sets the tone for the film : a woman writhing naked in a circle of fire , transforming into a werewolf . And this is no Rick Baker ' American werewolf ' transformation , folks . We 're talking some of the worst makeup ever captured on film here . I can just imagine some stoned Italian spreading glue on naked Annik Borel ( who plays Daniela , the film 's protagoness ( is that a word ? ) ) , and asking her to roll in fur . That 's how bad it is.<br /><br />From here on in it does n't get much better . Minutes are wasted as the scenery chewing male actors waffle on about Daniela and her condition or something ( I ca n't remember , but the dialogue is so bad if you do n't laugh at it you 'll cry).<br /><br />The funny thing is Daniela is n't even a werewolf , she 's a psycho who goes mental whenever there is a man around ( understandable , as she was raped as a child ) so she thinks she becomes a werewolf like her ancestor ( the opening scene ) . She ca n't help but tear out the throat of every man she meets , and she only wants to be loved ! Things start looking up for Daniela as she meets and falls in love with a buff stuntman who does n't trigger her ' episodes ' . Check out the montage here , one of the cheesiest you 'll ever see ( laughing and hugging after diving headfirst through a window).<br /><br />Daniela 's luck does n't hold out as the film takes a brutal turn , she is suddenly viciously beaten and raped by a group of thugs who kill the stuntman . Reminiscent of " I spit on your grave " , Daniela extracts bloody vengeance on her rapists.<br /><br />This is 100 minutes of my life I will never get back . But hey , that 's the game you play when you 're a film geek .
0 Do n't listen to the misleading title " Werewolf Woman " . The Europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films , but this one here is just a bit too much . " Werewolf Woman " seems to have a sleazy sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner . Fun the first few times , but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly . She s not even a werewolf , but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy . The film ca n't even decide its tone , with the first ten minutes ( a flashback ) being legitimate supernatural horror ( I thought I was in for a trash classic after these ) to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller . At the end , the director insists this is based on a true story . Yeah , all right.<br /><br />To be fair , there are a few entertaining aspects of the production . The title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes . However , these become rather monotonous quickly . Also , the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion , especially the worlds most swinging doctor ( he drinks on the job ) . Unfortunately , the film becomes pretty irritating fast . There 's no actual plot or anything else really . Its a shame , because reading a description I felt the film had some real potential . " Werewolf Woman " is far overlong , slow moving , and a bit too pointless , even by the standards of the exploitation genre . ( 4/10 )
0 " La Lupa Mannara " aka . " Werewolf Woman " of 1976 is a film with a highly promising title , but , sadly , the film itself is pretty far away from being a must - see for my fellow Italian Horror buffs . You wo n't hear me say that Rino Di Silvestri 's film is entirely bad - it has its stylish moments , and the first half is actually great fun to watch ( though the fun is unintentional ) . The film also profits from an exceptionally exhibitionist leading actress , Annik Borel . However , the film , which has no real plot ( at least no linear one ) often makes no sense at all , and it drags incredibly throughout the mostly superfluous second half.<br /><br />Daniella ( Annik Borel ) has strange dreams about a dancing around naked in the night before turning into a Werewolf Woman . Since she was a raped as a girl , Daniella is afraid of men . Then , when her sister ( cult siren Dagmar Lassander ) comes to visit with her husband , Daniella suddenly feels attracted to the husband and subsequently turns into a Werewolf Woman herself ... or something . The storyline really does n't make the slightest sense , which makes the film a lot of fun to watch throughout the first half . The leading character Daniella is some schizophrenic mixture of frigid hysteric and lusty nymphomaniac , who occasionally turns into a werewolf woman . Director Di Silvestri chose to make up for the plot - holes with a lot of of female nudity , which works fine for me . There are also some pretty well - done gore moments . The film is never even slightly suspenseful or creepy , but it is very entertaining in the beginning . Also , there are no attempts to hide that this is a slice of sleaze , the camera often does close - ups on the Miss Borel 's private parts for the simple heck of it . I 'm not complaining . Then , for some reason , Di Silvestri chose to make the film longer by completely changing the direction in which it was going . While Daniella is , at first , a typical werewolf , who can not help but follow the urges of her curse , this suddenly changes when she meets a guy ( Howard Ross , who was in Fernando Di Leo 's " Il Boss " of 1973 ) . Suddenly , she goes back to normal again , and the subsequent part of the film does not at all go in hand with the first half . It gets pretty damn boring after a while ; all things considered , it probably would have been better for this 99 minute film to be only 70 minutes long . At the end , they even want to make us believe that the absurd story ( if one can call it that ) is based on true events . " Werewolf Woman " has some redeeming qualities ; my fellow Italo - Horror fans can give it a try . However , if you wanna watch Italian Horror / Exploitation cinema from the 70s , there are hundreds of films that you should see before seeing this one .
0 This Italian film from the ' 70 's is NOT even in the class with Dog Soldiers , The Howling , or even that awful American Werewolf in Paris , BUT ... it is fun to watch . I 'm talking about watching the lead actress , a stunning blonde , run amok in her birthday suit . We 're talking about graphic , complete nudity ... it 's obvious that she is a real blonde ... humma humma humma ! ! The story is a hoot , the SFX are childish , and the acting ( for the most part ) stinks . The only redeeming value of this movie is all ( and there is a LOT ) the nudity & sex scenes . Tame by HBO standards , but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night . OK ... HERE 'S THE SPOILER ... There is NO werewolf ( except in the opening scene of the heroine ( ? ? ) 's ancestor . The girl just imagines that she 's a werewolf ... in other words , a clinical Lycanthrope .
0 First thing I noticed in this movie of course , was the unnecessary amount of nudity . It 's not oozing nudity or anything , but a lot that was not needed . Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf , and believes their fate are destined to be the same . Which actually I found quite interesting . The original Wolf Man was intended to be a completely psychological movie , but Universal threw in the actual Wolf man you were never supposed to see for n extra buck or two . I find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting . Unfortunately this is not the film I was searching for.<br /><br />Instead we know she s not a werewolf from the beginning , so there 's no thrill or twist , also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario . They fail there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality . At first I was excited upon reading the description of the film . But I slowly realized it was a cover just so they could expose the main characters breasts as often as possible.<br /><br />Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role , or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role . Since the character Danniele has no brains and is just a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf , it takes little skill to play . She has moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy moment but is quickly ruined by the poor camera work and light . The idea is great , but hideously executed throughout the film . 3/10
0 " A young woman suffers from the delusion that she is a werewolf , based upon a family legend of an ancestor accused of and killed for allegedly being one . Due to her past treatment by men , she travels the countryside seducing and killing the men she meets . Falling in love with a kind man , her life appears to take a turn for the better when she is raped and her lover is killed by a band of thugs . Traumatized again by these latest events , the woman returns to her violent ways and seeks revenge on the thugs , " according to the DVD sleeve 's synopsis.<br /><br />Rino Di Silvestro 's " La lupa mannara " begins with full frontal , writhing , moaning dance by shapely blonde Annik Borel , who ( as Daniella Neseri ) mistakenly believes she is a werewolf . The hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between her legs . The opening " flashback " reveals her hairy ancestor was ( probably ) a lycanthropic creature . Ms. Borel is , unfortunately , not a werewolf ; she is merely a very strong lunatic.<br /><br />As a film , " Werewolf Woman " ( in English ) would have been better if Borel 's character really was a female werewolf ; with her sexual victimization a great bit of characterization . But , as far as 1970s skin and blood flicks go , this one is hard to beat . Bouncy Borel is either nude or sexily clad throughout the film , which features a fair amount of gratuitous gore . Dazzling Dagmar Lassander ( as Elena ) and hunky Howard Ross ( as Luca ) are good supporting players .
0 Daniella has some issues brewing under her attractive exterior . She starts to lose her mind when she finds out about a distant relative ( who she resembles ) that was burned for being a werewolf . She goes a bit feral when she beads horny men and slashes out their throats . She does eventually find a man that helps contain her inner beast but when others ruin their bliss she extracts her violent and furry revenge.<br /><br />'Werewolf Woman ' is n't a very goof film but it does pose as a good crowd film . A fun time could be had by harping the bad acting / dubbing / translation and the just plain cheesiness of the production . But on it 's own it moves slowly but does have ample nudity to keep you awake ¬Ö barely .
0 This film ends with a speech in which the narrator tells us the fates of two of the lead characters and that the names of people and places have been changed ... before telling us that relation to actual people and events are purely coincidental . This ending line actually sums up everything that has gone before it ; as Rino Di Silvestro 's messy film completely lacks vision , and if there is any point to the plot ; it was n't put there on purpose . Werewolf Woman is often seen as a guilty pleasure or a ' so bad it 's good ' film , but I completely disagree . Normally , I enjoy films like this ; but Werewolf Woman is indeed a bad film , and despite all the sex and savagery on display ; it does n't even make for a fun watch , and that really is unforgivable . The film really does n't have much plot , but the thin sliver we are given involves a young woman , who also happens to dream that she is a werewolf . She dreams of going out and finding men , having sex with them and eventually killing them . Back in the real world , she falls in love , but her lover is killed and she goes out for revenge ... <br /><br />The film is made up of scenes of sex and gore , which are padded out with extremely dull talking sequences in which various characters mull over the recent events . These scenes are probably there to forward the plot and build characters ; but they really do n't do that , and succeed only in turning what could have been a passable exploitation romp into an extremely underwhelming film . It would seem that the director was more interested in style and atmosphere than the plot , and this is shown by the fact that the film looks and sounds nice . The sex scenes are often overlong and not very erotic , but the gore works well . The premise is ripe for giving way to a very sexy slice of exploitation , as there 's plenty of naked women , and the fact that the central character has a werewolf origin means that there could be plenty of erotica ; but this is n't capitalised on , and while I can stomach huge doses of bad acting and poorly done plot lines , I really ca n't stand watching films and being bored . Overall , I would n't even recommend this film to big exploitation fans . There 's plenty of better stuff than this out there , and while the title may sound intriguing - the film is n't .
0 Very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story , but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice , gruesome make - up effects . Daniella is a beautiful twenty - something girl , carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13 . Nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she 's the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf . She kills her brother - in - law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital . She escapes again , however , and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives , doctors and relatives . It 's all pretty to look at and listen too ( really great soundtrack ) , but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast . Luckily enough , leading lady Annik Borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire . The film is too long , too weird and too forgettable . The biggest surprise comes at the end , when suddenly and out of the blue , director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts . Yeah , right ...
0 Let me begin by saying I am a big fantasy fan . However , this film is not for me . Many far - fetched arguments are trying to support this film 's claim that dragons possibly ever existed . The film mentions connections in different stories from different countries , but fails to investigate them more thoroughly , which could have given the film some credibility . The film uses ( nice ! ) CGI to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragon 's life . This is combined with popular - TV - show - CSI - style flash - forwards to make it look like something scientific , which it is definitely not . In many cases the arguments / clues are far - fetched . In some cases , clues used to show dragons possibly existed , or flew , or spit fire are simply invalid . To see this just makes me get cramp in my toes . Even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it , but this one just does n't have it . Bottom line : it 's a pretentious fantasy - CSI documentary , not worth watching .
0 This documentary ( or I should say mockumentary ) is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be , when they have full enthusiasm on something like that . Honestly , I hate Cryptozoology . It is unscience , it just destroy it . However , something positive in this was the visual effects ( dragons were beautiful ) , but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake , and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists , so that is the reason why it deserves a 1 of 10 and not a 0 . An example of false information would be the hydrogen idea : It is true that , according to Chemystry , the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions , so in that case , you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach . There are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly , and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing , so it is impossible . Anyway , there is actually something worse , the idea of the platinum : This element is more difficult to find than gold , and I can not explain myself how dragons survive depending of that . It is ridiculous , they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet Earth , but off course at least that explain why they got extincted . Probably cryptologist 's call themselves scientists , but they are not . People like them say lies like in this mockumentary , and what is worst , some people buy them . But I do not think that a person who cares about Science would believe in dragons after watching this . Those fake scientists waste their time .
0 I think that most everyone wants to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no restraint in trying to exploit that to the fullest . The presentation is very interesting , well presented and the graphics are state of the art , but from a scientific point of view it just does n't work . Hydrogen filled flying bladders ? They would need to be the size of a Mack truck to be useful . And then there 's the ever - present possibility of a catastrophic explosion . I have no problem with fantasy , just do n't try to pass it off as fact . Some folks will always misunderstand . All in all the film is entertaining , but I constantly found myself saying " oh brother , what a load of .... " . If you want a FAKE documentary , watch This Is Spinal Tap instead . Or at the very least turn the sound off .
0 Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed of themselves . This Fantasy is modeled after the " Walking with Dinosuars " series . Even though this is 100 % fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way . Even mixing the fantasy dragons with T - rexs and the extinction of the dinos . Added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say Sci - Fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show.<br /><br />On its own the show is about an 7.5/10 far as entertainment goes . But the way in which it is presented I have to give it a 1/10 . Do n't get me wrong I have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong . I can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real.<br /><br />I also think this weakens the great " Walking with Dinosuars " series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini - series .
0 Even worse than the worst David Lynch " confusathon " , " Brain Dead " makes no sense whatsoever . Shamefully wasted talent ( Bill Pullman , Bill Paxton ) , bounce around like they are in a " Tom and Jerry " cartoon on acid . There is negligible character development . It simply starts climbing the " strange scale " , until climaxing in total chaos . Do not get sucked into this because of the above fine actors . They are given nothing to work with , and you will be wondering what 's going on throughout the entire , unbearable 85 minutes . I highly recommend avoiding " Brain Dead " at all costs , unless you are into scattering your brain into total nonsense . - MERK
0 I felt brain dead , I 'll tell you . This is the worst film I have ever bought . ( in my ignorance I thought this was the Peter Jackson film of the same name ) . The performances are so terrible they are laughable . The special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire . The script promotes that kind of TV movie , stare into the middle distance kind of acting . The cast look as if they have been taking lessons from Joey Tribbiani , they have one look each , and stick to it . Plus I have never been confused by a movie until I sat down to watch this . The is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes . Avoid like a plague .
0 This is one of the worst films I have * ever * seen ! It is bad , even at TV Movie level standards . The plot is diabolically flawed , and the known names in this film are wasted on confused , uncertain characters . I do n't know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a film together - it is that bad . Billed as a ' Psychological Horror Thriller ' - it is certainly Horrific . There is nothing Thrilling about it . And it could do you Psychological damage ! The initial opening scenes held such promise - a possible embarkation on whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain , but the utter shambles that followed the car - crash scene is beyond belief . No matter how hard you try , you could n't care less about the characters . There are so many sprinkled ideas that the film is at best a collage of disconnected phrases from Chinese philosophers , and at worst the film would actually make you go Brain Dead!<br /><br />I have purchased over 300 films on DVD , and this is the FIRST one I 'm going to get my money back on . STEER CLEAR .
0 This movie does have some great noirish / neorealist visuals , and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood 's sugar - coating , which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film . But some of the scenes go on for much too long ( the wedding , especially ) , and I found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screen.<br /><br />The dialog was particularly distracting , and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on . Most of the characters were either Italian - Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirties , but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a Shakespeare play while they mixed cement and laid bricks . Toward the end I was laughing , and not because the filmmakers wanted me to . I guess the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters would have been speaking Italian , and the dialog is a literal translation of how they would really talk . But it absolutely did not work for me.<br /><br />Another line of dialog made me laugh for a different reason : the main character 's son , born and raised in New York in the 1920 's , suddenly picks up a lovely lilting British accent . I 'm only guessing this had something to do with the fact that the movie was made in England.<br /><br />I give this movie an ' A ' for effort and intention , but a considerably lower grade for execution .
0 Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher ( ha , ha ) , a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one . Although he 's witnessed a treasure being buried , he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank . Thus , Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts ( do you place an ad for that ? ) and help lead a path to the treasure . It 's mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film . Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as director , and given Medak 's talents in the film The Ruling Class , you can probably guess which of the grainy , poorly lit scenes had Milligan in the director 's chair . Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the film 's first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain . He 's probably quite thankful that Young Frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned , so that he can keep this off his resume . Franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power - behind - Scratcher but he and Seller both look pretty desperate , with even Sellers ' makeup and hair looking quite terrible . They had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it . With lines like these , I can understand any possible unease:<br /><br />PIERRE : ( about to be hanged ) You 'll pay for this.<br /><br />SCRATCHER : No , I wo n't . I 'll do it for free.<br /><br />And that 's one of the GOOD jokes . It 's amazing to me that much of Sellers prolific material is still in the vaults , but this was made available on VHS more than 15 years ago ! How about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the US the well - received British TV program " A Show Called Fred " starring Sellers , Milligan , and directed by the great Richard Lester ?
0 You might be tempted to rent this film because Peter Sellers appears in it . That would be a mistake . This is one of the most pointless films ever made . I kept waiting for something funny to happen , but nothing funny appears in this movie . Even the film industry recognized this was a very weak film and did n't even try to promote it . Its a wonder that it was ever put on video.<br /><br />I wonder what sort of contract caused Sellers to be in this film . I also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to go on to make other bad films . Surely this film is a waste of the money used to create it , and a waste of anyone 's time watching it . Surely there are high school students who would be able to write / produce a film which as a plot .
0 ! ! ! ! POSSIBLE MILD SPOILER ! ! ! ! ! < br /><br />As I watched the first half of GUILTY AS SIN I couldn`t believe it was made in 1993 because it played like a JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas clone from the mid 80s . It starts with a murder and it`s left for the audience to muse " Is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his attorney ? " , but halfway through the film shows its early 90s credentials by turning into a " Lawyer gets manipulated and stalked by her client " type film which ends in a ridiculous manner , and GUILTY AS SIN has an even more ridiculous ending in this respect .<br /><br />This is a very poor thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by Sidney Lumet the same man who brought us the all time classic court room drama 12 ANGRY MEN
0 this was one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . I 'm still not sure if it was serious , or just a satire . One of those movies that uses every stupid who dunnit clich√© they can think of . Arrrrgh.<br /><br />Don Johnson was pretty good in it actually . But otherwise it sucked . It was over 10 years ago that I saw it , but it still hurts and wo n't stop lingering in my brain . < br /><br />The last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is . I wo n't ruin it for you , should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie . But I garantee you a * nghya * moment at the end , with a few in between . If you have nothing better to do , and you like to point and laugh , then maybe it might be worth your while . Additionally , if you 're forced to go on a date with someone you really do n't like , suggest watching this movie together , and they 'll probably leave you alone after they see it . That 's a fair price to pay , I guess .
0 It is only Robert De Niro film which I really hates . It is stupid film with horrible acting ( of course not De Niro ) . For me , Brian De Palma must do his mafia films as always like Scarface ( 1983 ) or The Untouchables ( 1987 ) . I also loved De Palma 's Mission : Impossible ( 1996 ) . De Niro worked with Palma two different times too , Greetings and The Wedding Party . I though that The Wedding Party was OK too ( I did n't watch Greetings ) . < br /><br />Screenplay is really bad and unfunny . There are no any scene where I can smile for even one time . Film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a " Be Black baby " scene and also I do n't like the scene where a guy 's sexual organ appeared . So , it is one of the worst film I have ever seen ! just worst . I hate that .
0 Seems everyone in this film is channeling Woody Allen . They stammer and pause and stammer some more . Only for REALLY die - hard DeNero fans ! It tries to appear as edgy and artistic - but it comes off as looking like a very , very low budget film made by college students . The most often used word in the whole film is " hum " . The film does peg the atmosphere of the late sixties / early seventies though . If you like films where people are CONSTANTLY talking over each other , horrible lighting ( even if it is for " art 's sake " ) , and makes you feel like you are sitting in on a lame political meeting , then you might like this - but you need to be really bored . I found this CD in the dollar bin and now I know why .
0 I really , really wanted to like Julian Po . I think that Slater is underrated as an actor , and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film . I realize this is based on a short story which I have not read . So , I do not know if what I see as the film 's faults originated with the story , or were imposed on it by the director / screenwriter . The premise is wonderful , and I loved the voiceover , confessional tone the opening narration strikes . But then ... ? Nothing ! Several of the cliched local characters ask Julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide . One could argue that he does n't answer , because it 's none of their business . But Julian is the one who , under only token pressure , blurted out his intentions in public . Then neither Julian nor the director / writer , despite the fact that the Julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for God 's sake , seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on Julian 's life . He says he was a bookkeeper . He says his family moved around when he was a child , due to his father 's job . So what ? There are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate Julian 's purpose . But none of them go anywhere , because Julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet , as if he were the ultimate ( and only ) sane one among them . This might work as an allegory , if Julian Po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart . The closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive , religious wife of the mechanic . And what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for Julian . I can only see the Julian character --as rendered -- as selfish , petty , and totally condescending . Sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half - baked , contrived film . And poor Michael Parks , an actor who once had so much promise , is given nothing to work with here .
0 Quirky , independent , theatrical , Christian Slater -- these are all teasers that made me look forward to spending an hour or so " discovering " a jewel of a film . Boy , was I disappointed . Julian Po never gets over itself . The film is relentlessly self - conscious . I found myself unable to suspend disbelief for even a moment . The overdone , obviously theatrical sets , the overdone , obviously theatrical acting , the overdone , obviously theatrical directing -- well , you get the idea . < br /><br />Allegories do not need to be delivered sledge hammer style . And it 's hard to feel much of anything for Julian Po because we never know much about him . The ridiculous girlfriend , the annoying townsfolk , the idiotic clergyman , the bratty kids -- why would anyone , particularly anyone with a life long ambition to get to the seaside ( Slater 's character ) , decide to stay in such a dismal place ?
0 The beginning of this movie was good . It started to get really dumb after he told the people he wanted to kill himself . I think if I came from a little town like that I would be offended after seeing this movie . They made a lot of these people look dumb and crazy . How could these people have so little to do that they follow him around all day . A lot of times these people were telling him ways to kill himself like they were urging him to do it . How can so many people have little respect for other people ? I also think they could have made a much better ending for this movie . There were some good parts to this movie also . Some people might like it , but I would n't recommend this to anyone .
0 This movie is horrendous . Decent fight scenes or not , the acting is REALLY bad , like you can tell they 're reading their lines from a card . With painful line delivery by everyone in the cast . Think watching a high school play and cringing at the obvious lack of smoothness in the actor 's interactions ( weird pauses between different character 's lines , combined with hurried line delivery by others ) . If the movie were all action , this might be forgivable , but a lot of the movie includes plot set - up and Family Guy style , irreverent cut aways ( Oh , wow , are they badly done ) . I 'm assuming they were attempting to be funny with these , but it again came off as a bunch of high - schoolers/ college entry students goofing off for the afternoon trying to set up a funny Youtube clip . < br /><br />Now to the fight scenes . They 're not too bad , considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film . Nothing great either , certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated ( Nothing like Drunken Master ) . The fights have an overly staged feel , with LOTS of cuts to different angles with blatantly different positions by those involved . < br /><br />In sum , the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the guy 's friends involved with this very , very cheap production . Which guy you may ask ? Oh , the same guy who wrote , directed , produced AND stared in this Middle School masterpiece .
0 This early John Wayne Lone Star western has a bit more going for it than the run - of - the - mill oaters Wayne had been making for Lone Star up until that time . For one , it has his old friend Paul Fix in it ; Fix , being a much better actor then the standard Lone Star villain , brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line - readings often delivered in these oaters . The plot , about mistaken identity , payroll robbery and murder , is as trite and perfunctory as you 'd expect it to be in a 1930s low - budget western , but Wayne 's strapping good looks , easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable . Plump , balding Eddy Chandler is n't quite believable as Wayne 's womanizing " partner " , and there 's a running gag about something that happens whenever Chandler and Wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome . On the other hand , Wayne 's love interest is played by none other than Mary Kornman , the little " Mary " of the early " Little Rascals " fame . She is a grown - up 20-year - old now , blonde and cute as a button . Most of Wayne 's leading ladies in these Lone Star / Monogram " B 's " were fairly bland and colorless , but Mary is perky , cute and , yes , sexy . There 's a scene in the general store , where she works , in which Wayne asks her to get him a bottle of " nerve tonic " , which happens to be on the top shelf , so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf . Wayne 's ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps , then again as she comes down , then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935 . Wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt . Anyway , it 's an interesting little " B " , not great , but not as choppy and random as many of his LoneStar productions of the time . The final gunfight is n't handled all that well , and Chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while , but all in all , it 's worth a look , if only to see a cute and sexy Mary Kornman .
0 John Scott ( John Wayne ) and partner Kansas Charlie ( Eddy Chandler ) are trail buddies who make their way to the Rattlesnake Gulch rodeo . Scott is a pretty fair contestant , but finds that unless he 's willing to accept twenty five cents on the dollar in prize money from a crooked promoter , he 'll have to collect his winnings at gunpoint . Quite coincidentally , bandits Pete ( Al Ferguson ) and Jim ( Paul Fix ) decide they 'd like the rest of the rodeo take ; they shoot promoter Farnsworth ( Henry Hall ) , and make it look like Scott and Kansas Charlie are the killers . < br /><br />Wayne and Chandler use a running gag in the film where they 're about to go at it with their fists over various trivialities . Each time Chandler takes a wild swing , Wayne foot stomps him and knocks him silly.<br /><br />If you 're very attentive , there 's a neat Lipton 's Tea ad in one of the scenes in which Scott 's love interest Anne ( Mary Kornman ) appears.<br /><br />Later on in the film , the buddies are framed once again over a stage robbery . Having a change of heart and seeing the error of his ways , bad guy Jim wants to come clean and confess to the sheriff , but Pete shoots him down . While being patched up , Jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister Anne . In an unbelievable scene , Anne marches right into the middle of a gunfight between the good guys and the villains to confront the sheriff.<br /><br />"The Desert Trail " is one of the blander John Wayne Westerns from Lone Star Productions during this era . Noticeably absent are George " Gabby " Hayes and Yakima Canutt , one or both are usually to be seen in these oaters . If you 're a John Wayne fan though , you 'll have to see it once , but that will probably be enough .
0 Before I explain the " Alias " comment let me say that " The Desert Trail " is bad even by the standards of westerns staring The Three Stooges . In fact it features Carmen Laroux as semi- bad girl Juanita , when you hear her Mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as Senorita Rita from the classic Stooge short " Saved by the Belle " . < br /><br />In " The Desert Trail " John Wayne gets to play the Moe Howard character and Eddy Chandler gets to play Curly Howard . Like their Stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53- minute movie is Moe hitting Curly . Wayne 's character , a skirt chasing bully , is not very endearing , but is supposed to be the good guy . < br /><br />Playing a traveling rodeo cowboy Wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good - the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar ( actually even less after Wayne robs the box office ) . No explanation is given for Wayne 's ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl . < br /><br />Things get complicated at this point because the villain ( Al Ferguson ) and his sidekick Larry Fine ( played by Paul Fix - who would go on to play Sheriff Micah on television 's " The Rifleman " ) see Wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager . Moe and Curly get blamed . < br /><br />So Moe and Curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to Smith and Jones . Who do they meet first but their old friend Larry , whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest ( Senorita Rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie ) . < br /><br />Larry 's sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful Mary Kornman ( now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of Hal Roach 's " Our Gang " shorts ) . Kornman is the main reason to watch the mega - lame western and her scenes with Moe and Curly are much better than any others in the production , as if they used an entirely different crew to film them . < br /><br />Even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film- making is staggeringly bad . The two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse . Both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground , but there is no horse in the frame , the film stock is completely different , and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider . There is liberal use of stock footage in other places , none of it even remotely convincing . < br /><br />One thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where Moe and Curly get on their horses and ride away ( to screen right ) from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left . The cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse . Outside of home movies I have never seen anything like this , not because it is looks stupid ( which it does ) but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner . They would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action . Or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background . < br /><br />Then again , what do I know ? I 'm only a child .
0 One of the more ' literate ' Lone Stars , with time spent on character development and interaction , dialog and acting business . The opening scene sets the stage ( literally ) for the personalities of the gambler , Kansas Charlie ( Eddy Chandler ) , and his buddy , John Scott ( John Wayne ) the rodeo ( say Roh - Day - oh ) star , both of whom are slightly randy . The film follows their adventures , as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the Mexican Juanita , and later in their pursuit of perky Mary Kornman , who has the inevitable evil brother ( though he 'd been led astray by the real villain , and wants to repent ) . And oh , of course , they 're being wrongly accused of two crimes and have to serve jail time before escaping and being exonerated at the end.<br /><br />The high point is Scott continually and deliberately ogling Mary 's butt in her grocery store , and knocking away the ladder she 's standing on so he can catch her and grab her as she falls . It all seems a little contemporary for a 30s western , but it sounds better than it actually is . < br /><br />Sadly , the exciting action elements we find in many other Lone Stars are sorely missing here . No Yakima Canutt . Cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses . No George Hayes . Tedious Stooge - like bi - play between Scott and Charlie , with Charlie swinging at Scott , Scott stomping on his foot and then punching him ( repeated two more times ! ) . The skilled Paul Fix is underused . Eddy Chandler himself , here in his big star turn , is not really believable as a randy side kick . The villain looks too old and fat . So does Chandler , who spent his later career in 300 more movies as an uncredited meatloaf . Mary Kornman , of the twenties " Our Gang " ( see ' Mary , Queen of Tots ' 1925 ) is cute in her scenes with John Wayne , but that 's about it for this one . Seeds of a better western lie buried here.<br /><br />P.S. The ultra - short colorized version , which looks good , moves along so fast , it 's over if you blink more than once . Thankfully though , the embarrassing scenes with Eddy Chandler have been cut .
0 Falsely accused , skirt - chasing chums John Wayne ( as John Scott ) and Eddy Chandler ( as Kansas Charlie ) change identities to become " Alias Smith and Jones " . Mr. Wayne becomes " John Jones " . Mr. Chandler 's is supposed to be " Rev. Smith " , but Wayne calls him " Dr. Smith " . At no time are either of them as entertaining as Roger Davis , Pete Duel , Jonathan Harris , or Ben Murphy ; although , Wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them , career wise . Pretty blonde Mary Kornman ( as Anne ) , grown - up from her days in " Our Gang " , is a lovely interest for Wayne . She and Chandler have a couple of cute scenes with Wayne . If you 're not a fan of low budget John Wayne films of the 1930s , this movie wo n't make you one .
0 I picked up Time Changer because it looked like a nice low - budget scifi time travel movie and I was in the mood for something like that . The description said it had something to do with some biblical stuff and time travel but I did n't expect a fundamentalist Christian film!<br /><br />The movie had decent special effects and an interesting premise that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being . Our hero , who is a bible professor from the 1890s , eventually travels forward to the 2000s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil - Jesus is nowhere to be found . This wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional HG - Wells - style time machine . The movie starts to lose some credibility at this point , which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film . Earlier ( or perhaps immediately later , ca n't remember for certain ) , our hero professor was seen teaching what appeared to be a science class where he claimed that scientific findings could only be considered validated if it could be matched with what the bible says . What should be obvious to anyone is that this is clearly not what the scientific method is about , however it is presented such that the filmmakers appear to prefer the point of view that science is useful only if it supports their claims and otherwise is not useful.<br /><br />In any case , that belief is perfectly valid and sensible in the context of the character at the time . So , if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors , then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine is n't a very strong believer as I do n't think there 's any evidence ( and none was offered ) for the physics of time travel in the bible . So immediately there 's a problem with mixed messages and credibility there , but never mind ... <br /><br />After the professor is convinced to take the leap into the future , the shock of modern technology was handled quite well in most cases . It was also fun to not have it pinned down to an exact year ( as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself , a car honks a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date : it 's just two thousand and ... * honk * ) . Some of the shock went on a little too long , though . For instance , the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he 's invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van . He sticks his head out the window like a dog might , is scared by the headlights and the starting engine , etc . That seemed a bit off since he 'd been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic . In any case , that 's easy to ignore . The rest of the tech shock was well done - especially his first encounter with the TV which was delayed because he did n't even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote.<br /><br />Unfortunately , our hero predictably starts to preach to virtually everyone he meets as if he 's an authority on all life and religion just because he 's from the past and is an elder . Eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of Christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful , but mostly was just more of the same . A couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy ( go figure ) and investigate his name . They eventually conclude that he either is a time traveler or is impersonating this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is . The movie frames these guys as non - believer bad guys for being skeptical.<br /><br />Just before the professor is to head back to his own time , he is confronted by those two men . In an effort to avoid being arrested or hauled away , he eventually breaks into an almost insane - like rant about how Jesus is coming soon and that he 's a prophet so they should listen to him . Just in time , he 's whisked away and one of the husbands wonders if perhaps this is the rapture he 'd heard so much about.<br /><br />The irony is that this essentially means the professor became a self - proclaimed ( and most likely false ) prophet claiming to know that the rapture was near and he was sent by God when truthfully he was sent by his fellow bible professor and did not have any God - given knowledge ( that was stated or even hinted at).<br /><br />As I understand it , Revelation claims that the time of the end is only for God to know and at the end of the film we see the inventor professor trying ( and failing ) to send a bible into the future . First 2080 , then 2070 , etc . as the scene fades out . Clearly he 's trying to determine the exact date of the end times - which he should n't be able to know ! Essentially , the entire premise of the movie cancels itself out because by being so insistent on their religious beliefs and how certain things are for God to know only , it means there could n't ever BE a time machine in the first place because then mankind could find out something that only God should know ! The entire movie 's premise collapses and makes the whole thing basically worthless as it undermines it 's own credibility in the end .
0 I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it , for while it is suppose to have a " good " message ; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture . An interpretation , in my opinion , will mislead a lot of people . In addition , I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable . Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie . So , if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority , then by all means , get this film . This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi , because the title will deceive a lot of people as well . This was an unfortunate film , because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered . The film 's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the " Time Machine " probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future .
0 I 'm afraid that you 'll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a 10 are highly Christian . I am not . If you are looking for a Christian movie , I recommend this film . If you are looking for a good general movie , I 'm afraid you 'll need to go elsewhere.<br /><br />I was annoyed by the characters , and their illogical behaviour . The premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was Jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong . One scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal , and then the character goes on to say that it was Jesus who taught us this . I find that offensive : are we to believe that " thou shalt not steal " came from Jesus ? I suppose he wrote the Ten Commandments ? And stealing was acceptable before that ? I rented the movie from Netflix . I should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments . Oh well .
0 The premise sucked me in , but it was clear about 30 seconds in that this was either David Lynch or something seriously terrible . Interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list . I can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece ( Romero comes to mind ) , but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one . The message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of 80 ( or simply get a lobotomy - Jennifer what happened to ya ? ) and blindly follow the Bible without any sort of self - examination whatsoever or we 'll trigger the second coming . It 's the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings ( I work around the corner from the site of the former WTC ) . I like to think that God is a little greater than that .
0 I rented this by mistake . I thought , after a cursory examination of the box , that this was a time - travel / sci - fi story . Instead , it 's a " Christian " story , and I suppose is fairly typical example . If you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plot / acting / etc . , but I found it rather painful . < br /><br />I have to admit that I 'm bothered by the rewriting of history in this story . It paints the 1890 's as some sort of paradise of family values and morality ( a character is aghast that 5 % of marriages end in divorce ! ) , but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this " highly moral " society ( rigid racial , sexual , and social discrimination were widespread , for instance ) . And at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some Iranian leaders about women 's clothing styles ( as reported in a recent WSJ).<br /><br />Overall , thought , I suppose that it 's the sort of thing you 'll like if you like this sort of thing , and it 's certainly wholesome ...
0 First of all , this movie reminded me of the old movies I used to have to watch in religion class in school . That 's NOT a good thing . Basically , it 's just a preachy and pretentious piece of filth , just like the terrible " Left Behind " series . I 'm not offended by religious movies ... but I am offended when these religious movies just happen to be extremely awful . I would just like to be able to say nice things about a christian movie but it does n't look like that will happen any time soon . I bet if you gave the bible thumpers a decent budget , they still would n't be able to come up with anything good . Just avoid this one . Also , the fact that the " American Family Association " ( basically , Reverend Wildmon 's lackies ) beam about this film on their website is another reason to make me hate it . In fact , after I viewed this , I went home and watched my copy of David Cronenberg 's NC-17 rated " Crash " . Forgive me father for I have sinned . Hahahahaha !
0 I guess this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized Christian Dogma , but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will , rational thinking , the separation of Church & State and GOOD Science Fiction it is a terrible joke!<br /><br />There are some well known actors who were either badly in need of work or had a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us heathens.<br /><br />I WAS entertained by this movie in the same way I was entertained by " Reefer Madness . " That movie attempted to teach drug education by scare tactics the same way this movie tries to teach " Christian " principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who do n't share their interpretations of our world.<br /><br />It had me howling with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe that our society should revert to the good old days of the 19th century !
0 This movie seems to send the wrong message . There can be morality without using Christ . Poeple of other religions , I believe , can get into heaven . I am a Catholic who goes to church every week , but I do not agree with such Christian arrogance . This is the worst time travel movie I have ever seen and I 've seen Timeline .
0 Not being familiar with US television stations , when I flicked onto this on my in - laws ' cable , first I thought it was just a low - budget sci - fi film , then after a couple of minutes I started thinking it might be a clever satire on the worst excesses of Christian fundamentalist , and then it dawned on me - good grief , these people are serious ! It 's been a while since I saw anything so unintentionally hilarious . I hesitated about writing a review of this for fear of offending believers , but then I saw other reviews and thought , hey , they can take it . Tough philosophical conundrum : how do you make a movie criticizing movies without actually showing what it is you 're criticizing ? Answer : make it in such a way that the only people who 'll appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movies you 're criticizing . I suppose some liberals ( ugh ! spit when you say that ! ) might be offended at the filmmakers ' contempt for those in the audience who are n't obsessed with the J * * * * C * * * * * myth , but I did n't mind - it was so darn funny !
0 There is an interesting discussion in this movie . Is being a moral person good enough , or do you need something more?<br /><br />The movie preaches that without the guidance of God , being a morally good person is not enough . There is a line early in the movie , " You and I can look at a person who is morally good , but both know he is going to go to hell." < br /><br />While I am not a Christian , the discussions about this throughout the course of the movie were fascinating , but not in the way the movie intended . I left the movie with a stronger feeling that being morally good * is * enough . The arguments and discussions presented were heavily biased , so much so that they crush themselves in the weight of their own ignorance . Fanaticism can be a powerful thing , especially when inferenced in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated . As George Carlin 's character in Dogma said : " hook em while they 're young".<br /><br />The basic premise is a very interesting one also . A Bible Scholar from the 1890s is attempting to publish a book that says that morality without God is OK , as long as the morality is meaningful . Do you only tell a child not to steal ? Or do you tell him not to steal because God tells you not to ? ( not bothering bringing up that telling the child not to steal because , well , how would he feel if it was his marbles that were stolen?)<br /><br />The author , Carlisle , wants the recommendation of his school to help sell the book ( to spread the world ) . However , it needs unanimous consent , and one of the scholars opposes it . He brings up , in a very interesting discussion early in the film about the morality for morality 's sake vs God 's words argument . To prove his point , he produces a time machine ( put in the movie solely to make the plot work , which I 'm fine with ) , and sends Carlisle to the year 2002 to see where teaching morality without God will lead us.<br /><br />As should be obvious , he has his opinion , and is changed by what he sees , and has reversed himself by the time of his return ( for he does return , that 's not really a spoiler , this is a bible movie after all).<br /><br />As for the movie as a movie itself , it 's pretty slow and pretty poorly acted . Something that was * not * needed in this movie , is that it produces two " bad guys " who want to try to figure out who Carlisle is , even tho he has n't hurt anyone , committed a crime , or anything . What 's wrong with the movie just showing Carlisle 's opinion , showing his view of this " sinful world " , and returning him with a new viewpoint ? < br /><br />Also , there a few points in the movie which affirm to me that I 'm happy I 'm not a Christian , or at least someone who says " It 's God or nothing " . Three near the end of the movie rather disturbed me .. first , when the two " bad guys " corner Carlisle right before he jumps , Carlisle does his * only * truly despicable act .. he fakes like his time - jump is the coming of Jesus , and makes it so the " bad guys " ( who are also Christians btw , oddly enough ) , think they just missed the rapture . < br /><br />Secondly , after Carlisle returns , he finds a boy in which he scolded at the beginning of the movie about not stealing ( but not mentioning God , kid kept the marbles and ran away ) , and tells him this time that stealing is wrong because God commands it . Like the Carlin quote above , scaring kids into religion is a faux - pas in my book.<br /><br />And lastly , the epilogue . Another scare tactic . Carlisle asks the inventor how far into the future they could go , and he says he does n't know .. the epilogue shows him trying to warp a bible into the distant future ( starts at 2100 ) , and it fails .. he keeps decrementing the years by 10 , and trying again , and by the fade - out , he 's at like 2030 or so . Throughout the movie , Carlise mentions that he felt the end of the world coming , because the world was rife with sin and the loss of the name of God .. scare tactics have been in use for thousands of years .. you would think in these enlightened times , the church would have enlightened as well.<br /><br />I'm glad I saw this movie . While I was fairly certain before that being morally good was enough , now I know it for a fact . Worth watching if you are not a Christian , to affirm how happy you are to not be as ignorant as the folks in this movie .
0 There were times during the movie I wish I had been beat to death . The only reason I endured the entirety of the movie was because I could n't believe how bad it really was and thought it must get better . This truly was a horror film . I was horrified that I wasted what seemed like 4 hours of my life that I will never get back . The other two hours I spent mourning at the loss . Please recommend this movie to whomever you wish to torture and tell them the suspense will kill them .
0 It is not often I watch a film that is as dreadful as this one . I continued to watch , every minute hoping that this was intended as a joke only to find it was meant to be taken seriously . Well , as seriously as this genre requests.<br /><br />The acting was disgraceful and the situations horribly contrived and clich√©d . If a film was made in 1920 ( for example ) and had the quality of Hide & Seek ( Cord ) in its direction we would think that cinema back then was naive . As it happens , this film was made in 2000 and I have yet to see a film from the silent era that has as little charm as this one.<br /><br />Definitely not for the serious movie - goer.<br /><br />[Not worth a rating ]
0 I 'm glad some people liked this , but I hated this film . It had a very good idea for a story line , but that 's where it ended . It was badly written , badly acted and badly made.<br /><br / > It had some interesting plot points , but they were just skipped over too fast , the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits , like lying about why she was kidnapped , and ditch the dross . Instead it was " what 's going on ? " , 5 seconds later they tell you.<br /><br />This film had no suspense , and I was bored from start to end . I just wanted it to finish.<br /><br / > Go and rent misery , or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end .
0 I have read the other comment about this movie , and usually I try not to be harsh in my criticisms because I try to be a nice person . However , this movie is one of the worst movies that I have EVER seen ( And that s topping a lot of bad USA Network plus Cinemax nights . ) Whoever thought of this movie needs to be prevented from EVER making another one . This film disgusted me in a way that no other film ever . I REALLY think these people are insane . Just save your time and do not watch this fllm . Please - I wish that I had . The acting is horrible , the plot ( what plot ) is STUPID and degrading and insane . I really do not think this should have been made into a movie . But that is my opinion , and I am trying to save you from wasting your time .
0 This movie raises a number of pressing questions in my mind . Firstly , how has Jennifer Tilly managed to sustain a film acting career for all these years based on that ridiculous squeaky voice and the very limited range of hammy facial expressions she employs ? Secondly ... what on earth were the people responsible for making this offensive and deeply repulsive film thinking of ? And thirdly ... given that there were people perverted enough to decide to make dreck like this , should n't there have been someone in the system - the studio , the distributors , or somewhere - sane enough to prevent it actually getting completed and released . You really would have to search a very , very long way to turn up another movie as profoundly nasty as this ... and it is n't even billed as a horror movie - which , inasmuch as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate film genre , it certainly is . The movie wallows from beginning to end in the sickest kind of madness , violence and abuse , and has essentially no redeeming features at all . I 'm not actually advocating censorship ( which I do n't believe in ) ... but I really ca n't see how anybody could conceivably draw anything positive from watching a film like this .
0 Wow ... sheer brilliance.<br /><br />Turning a thriller / suspense / horror into comedy.<br /><br />After watching this , I never laughed so hard at a horror movie before ... a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that were just insanely developed - either not written in depth or too much depth.<br /><br />If you want to watch an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialog , messed up plot , useless scenes , wasted characters , bad sound and lousy development overall , then this is the one to watch.<br /><br />Be sure to keep focused for the classic " food processor " scene and the totally inept police investigation scenes.<br /><br />This is a remarkable new low in screen performance and writing and to sit through it for the entire duration makes you either stupid , daring or brave .
0 This movie was like a bad train wreck , as horrible as it was , you still had to continue to watch . My boyfriend and I rented it and wasted two hours of our day . Now do n't get me wrong , the acting is good . Just the movie as a whole just enraged both of us . There was n't anything positive or good about this scenario . After this movie , I had to go rent something else that was a little lighter . Jennifer Tilly is as usual a very dramatic actress . Her character seems manic and not all there . Darryl Hannah , though over played , she does a wonderful job playing out the situation she is in . More than once I found myself yelling at the TV telling her to fight back or to get violent . All in all , very violent movie ... not for the faint of heart .
0 This movie starts presenting a somehow original idea but became a great frustration later on . What is the deal of having an original start if the rest of the movie did little to avoid a clich√©d plot ? The movie itself is very unbelievable . I would like to know how exactly someone enters a clinic , gets a nurse outfit , kills a doctor , takes out a patient in her bed , puts into his Chevy pickup and leaves ? I guess no one could answer this question , so they just jumped to the other scene hiding these little details . The performances are just plain bad . The villain is just another " annoying crazy antagonist " , no deepness , totally linear character . After 20 minutes of film , most scenes are unbelievable , seemed like they were put there just for the sake of the 90 minutes since they were totally unneeded . A doctor see a woman clearly under strong medication , is denied to examine her , gets kicked out of the house and simply leaves quiet ? The ending scene made me burst into laugher , only Mickey Mouse could make it more out of reality . I 'm giving it 2 out of 10 for the first lets say 10 minutes of movie .
0 This is the kind of movie you regret you put in your VCR . It is some weird bad rip off version of Stephen kings movie " Misery ( 1990 ) " . I can not understand how this movie got a 5.2 score , because it has no story what so ever , and when the movie finally ended , I was relieved.<br /><br />This movie should have been released as a short - movie instead .. to much time is spent on the same thing . And as in every bad movie , everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10 - 15 minutes time span ... <br /><br />So , before you decide to watch this movie , be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control , because you are going to do whole lot of fast - forwarding ... do n't worry , you wo nt miss anything important .
0 ... and I have seen some bad ones.<br /><br />I have nothing good to say about this movie . The acting is poor by Jennifer Tilly - as to be expected . Daryl Hannah does an OK job , but nothing close to being able to save this movie.<br /><br />The biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is so weak - though based on a good premise - that the writer resorted to the " stupid heroine trick " to create a contrived suspense . When all Daryl Hannah would have to do is hide , she runs out in front of her pursuer . The hospital scene is absurd . Without exposing too much of what passes for a plot , I think it would be difficult for a bloody petite woman to carry a pregnant from a hospital without being noticed . Lame . Very lame.<br /><br />Save yourself some time and pick out another flick .
0 Not only was the plot of this film contrived with the ease in which the two psychos are able to kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat but it was a terrible rip - off of ' Misery ' . However , the main reason I gave this film such a low rating was because it absolutely disgusted me.<br /><br />I'm not someone easily shocked by what film - makers dish out and have always had a love for horror flicks but this film went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just for the sake of getting points in the shock factor.<br /><br />I think most people , when watching just the first ten minutes of ' Hide and Seek ' , will find themselves reaching for the remote .
0 What can I say ? ? ? This movie was so Dumb & Stupid I thought it was a Psychotic DRAG Comedy - They should rename it " Bitching Pregnant Cat Fight ! " What a stupid waste of time , if you want to see(DIE DIE ! ! ! " I WANT YOUR BABY DRAG QUEEN ) Jennifer Tilly being her Freaky self then just rent out one Of the " Chucky " movie , oh ya , " The Bride Of Chucky . " It 's more fun watching the Two Ugly Plastic dolls ( one of them Jennifer Tilly turned into the UGLY Female version of Chucky ) having Squeaky plastic rubber sex then watching Daryl Hannah being pregnant , Dumb & stupid ; & Jennifer Tilly Grinding up her Husbang in a Food Processor reminded me of my Mother trying to do House Work ! OK it 's just BAD ! ! !
0 It 's hard to criticize this movie , because I dislike the story itself , and no amount of good acting would have saved it . Think " Raising Arizona " with a mean streak . The acting is passable , but Jennifer Tilly is way over the top ( yet not enough to make this a nice camp film ) as usual , coming in somewhere between " Misery " and a sarcastic DMV employee . The rest of the cast have their brows perpetually knitted in consternation , either from the stress of their parts or the stress of the whole futile exercise . A real degrading few hours of film . Darryl Hannah spends most of the movie weeping too hard to be understood . I wish I could tell you how it ended but I walked out , sorry .
0 Some wonder why there were n't anymore Mrs. Murphy movies after this one . Will it 's because this movie totally blew snot . Disney was not the right studio to run this film . MAYBE Touchstone ( well , they 're owned by Disney , but it 'd be more adult ) . The film is too kid - ish , as the book series is not . The casting is all wrong for the characters . The characters do n't even act the way they do in the books . And why was Tucker changed to a guy ? He 's a girl in the frigging books ! Was this done to make the film appeal to boys ? Sheesh . And where was Pewter , the gray cat ? One of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth . Rita Mae Brown is a good writer , but letting Disney blow her work was wrong . An animated feature film , perhaps in the vane of Don Bluth 's artwork would suit a better Mrs. Murphy film . Overall , I give this a 2 , because at least Disney made a film from an under - appreciated book series . But , I wish they did better . Either way , I still have my books to entertain me .
0 Worst show I 've ever seen . The story is about a group of teenagers who , for some inexplicable reason , have super powers , and when they use some special device , they morph into strange , poorly designed suits . The acting when they 're not in the retarded - looking suits is decent . Definitely not good , but not the worst acting I 've ever seen . However , when wearing their suits , the actors ' acting goes from bad to worse ; much , much worse . The hyper - animated idiots have a myriad of unnecessary motions they do . Even when they talk they look like they 're having seizures . The villains are stupider than the Rangers . Every episode , some weak , idiotic villain comes up with some plan to destroy the Rangers . He / she then sends a force of hyper - animated aliens to attack the Rangers . The Rangers then initialize their 10-hour transforming animation , then they annihilate the aliens . Then , the poorly designed villain , which can either be an armored villain that actually looks and acts evil , to a humanoid ladybug - like creature with trumpets attached to its back that shows obvious signs of mental retardation . The Power Rangers fight the villain off , then the villain turns into Godzilla , whether it be by a rain cloud or a nuclear missile ( yes , they fire nukes at the creatures and the creatures turn into giants ) . The Power Rangers spend 5 minutes acting hyper - animated and summon their Zords which are obviously toys that the producers of the show used special effects on to make them look real . The Power Rangers win , the villain gets mad , they all teach a " valuable " lesson , and the show ends . That 's it . Twenty - five minutes of brain - washing , fake kung fu fighting .
0 Very rarely do I give less rave reviews on a show or film I dislike on IMDb , but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful , it 's terrible.<br /><br />I would n't have minded if this had been an animated series- would 've been better that way I guess , but as a live - action show , it typifies the terms ' cheesy ' and ' campy ' . Of which Power Rangers is . Five multi- coloured , spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills . The costumes are horrid- they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear . The acting is woeful , and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch , it makes Jean- Claude Van Damme , look as equally as good as Bruce Lee , which is an understatement in itself . In fact , they look as if they are jumping and dancing about ; like it was some version of the ' Nutcracker ' , or they were doing ballet , rather than fighting . Besides , there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun - yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly.<br /><br />Kids show or not , this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity . And even though this version is set in America , you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the US , but rather in Japan ; thus the somewhat ' fake ' fighting and footage was borrowed from the Japanese version - only to be juxtaposed onto the US version.<br /><br />If you like this type of thing , then stick with Sentai- the Japanese equivalent .
0 I can not for the life of me explain what the popularity of the children 's television show , power rangers is all about.<br /><br />I never understood why unsuspecting children liked this show in the first place , since the characters seem so idiotic and not worth caring about whatsoever.<br /><br />The costumes look completely atrocious , like multi colored spandex that people wear to go to the gym.<br /><br />What exactly is the purpose of this show anyways , but for kids to learn how to fight to solve their problems ? What is up with the awful hair cuts , and clothing on this show anyway ? Not to mention this show is still playing on cable television , just to make money to teach kids how to fight each other when they disagree on a certain problem.<br /><br />There 's far better entertainment for today 's children , hopefully they are n't as gullible as kids of the 1990s who watched this show.<br /><br />Oh , and what is up with the homo erotic tension between the red and green rangers anyway ?
0 I never quite understood the popularity of Saban 's Power Rangers show which was quite simply a second rate Americanized version of Japan 's ultra popular super sentai series of the past three decades ! What was cool about the Japanese version gets completely lost in the American version , characterization , special effects , etc.<br /><br />Of course many kids will say that power rangers are the greatest but they would be incorrect.<br /><br />I'm sure if they spoke Japanese , they would learn how much better super sentai is over the American version.<br /><br />Power Rangers is completely awful , try Super Sentai instead ! Looking for a better show , try Voltron The Third Dimension instead !
0 Power rangers , the moronic merchandising television kids show from the 1990s , has got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever created.<br /><br />What exactly is the point of this show anyway , other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to children ? There is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in anyway.<br /><br />Look at the costumes , which look like spandex gone bad.<br /><br />The mullet style hair , earrings , and fashions of the early 1990s look completely ridiculous these days.<br /><br />Avoid this show at all costs !
0 The power rangers is definitely the worst television show and completely ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the United States.<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about this completely awful television show.<br /><br />This is simply the worst show ever made , with awful actors , dressing up in multi colored spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous.<br /><br />The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves , since there is no redeeming value to this nonsense.<br /><br />Kids of today should try watching better shows like the Toy Story movies instead of this garbage .
0 Many people here say that this show is for kids only . Hm , when I was a kid ( approximately 7 - 9 years old ) I watched this show first . It was disgusting for me . I talked with other kids about this and , sure , other shows and know what ? This was the measure of disguise , whenever we wanted to emphasize something 's silliness ( either on TV or anything else ) we said " Uh , just like Power Rangers " and laughed . < br /><br />And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there actually are fans of MMPR . It was so strange for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it . I did not enjoy that viewing . But it dawned upon me : maybe I have not enough imagination ? It may be . However this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star .
0 I remember this show being on the television when I was a kid back in the early 1990s , and there was this rage about kids with goofy leotards doing kung fu on one another and riding around in plastic dinosaurs . It was called power rangers . I remember that little kids would go around hitting each other and then the shirts and the stuff from the show was banned in many school districts all over the country because this show taught kids how to fight each other in solving their differences.<br /><br />I never really thought of this as a show , especially when better shows like The Tick were playing on Fox Kids . Most older teens always looked at power rangers in a ridiculous and scornful manner , and it 's not hard to wonder why . The footage is ridiculous at best . The colored rangers costumes look like stuff you would work out in and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense . Then you get into the acting , and of course those really laughable haircuts . All the guys run around with earrings on , half of them are wearing 90 's mullets , and they always wear the same clothes everyday , and then change into leotard wearing power rangers.<br /><br />The toys are especially ridiculous as well , and was the joke of many late night talk show hosts . And of course two of the worst movies ever made , and I do mean two of the worst movies ever made were based on this show with nearly every critic trashing both the films , and the shows it was based on.<br /><br />Power rangers is nothing more than a bad television commericial for especially bad toy merchandising . As an adult , I do n't look at it fondly , but rather as another embarrassment of 1990s kids shows , fashion and guys ' earrings .
0 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came out in 1993 , supposedly based on the Japanese sentai television show that started back in the 1970s . Now as a fan of Japanese action films and series , you would think I would get a kick out of this show.<br /><br />You could not be more wrong . What worked in the Japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty morphin power rangers.<br /><br />MMPR is based on five teenagers who get powers to becomes costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robot.<br /><br />Now this premise is more far fetched and more laughable than anything in either Transformers movie , yet , the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked.<br /><br />It was followed by two really bad , and I do mean , really bad movie knock offs , and the actors starring in this series , completely disappeared from the scene.<br /><br />If you must choose , try watching Japan 's Zyuranger series instead.<br /><br />Also , what 's up with the awful long 1990s haircuts and all the earrings on the guys ? It makes them all look feminine !
0 Power Rangers , the completely awful kid 's show from the 1990s still continues to disturb young children with it 's complete cheesiness , and awful settings.<br /><br />This show was not entertainment , it was an excuse to teach children violence in showing kids how to fight one another in order to solve their differences.<br /><br />The toys were further demonstration in how to promote a violent television show and such.<br /><br />I have never been able to figure out what the purpose of this completely ridiculous show ever was.<br /><br />As such , it remains one of the worst kids shows ever made .
0 15 years ago , Power Rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations , especially that of the youth . When I was a 3-year - old kid living in the Philippines , I would watch this show every Friday on ABS - CBN ( Channel 2 over there ) . When the movie came out in 1995 , it was all shock and awe to me when I watched it with my dad and 2 uncles . My grandparents even sent me a " Balikbayan " box full of Power Rangers stuff ( including the easy - to - build Megazord figure and the stuffed toys of the Rangers ) . I even played the video games , and loved only one of them ( " MMPR : Fighting Edition " ) , which was REALLY sad . Anyway , it was the show that set a stepping stone on my interest on robot series ( especially anime mech series like " Gundam " ) Now that I 'm 18 , I 'd like to think this show is pretty cheesy to me now . To prove this , I took a trip down memory lane by buying a 2-set DVD collection with " MMPR : The Movie " and " Turbo : A Power Rangers Movie " and watched both of them . I was like , " Ugh . How awful . Just another junk in the attic for me . " For all of you people of my generation , this is NOT a show that you 'd want to watch over and over again . I 'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life , but occasionally is not a bad thing now , is it ? Instead of " Power Rangers " , I 'd recommend something like " Mobile Fighter G Gundam " ( HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ) , " Ninja Senshi Tobikage " ( aka Ninja Robots ) , or even the ORIGINAL Sentai shows that were the basis of " Power Rangers . "
0 Nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin 90 's as classics ( people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days ) , and while some of those shows were / are undoubtedly good , this one is just pure crap . I watched this show a lot back in those days since it got A LOT of reruns on TV back then , and even as a child I did n't like it . Even a 8-year old can see how much the people in Power Rangers are overacting , and how much the special - FX sucked even back then . When the show does n't resort to the painfully bad ' fighting'-scenes , it plagues the viewer with this unnecessary soap - opera about a group of teens and they'r little social problems every now and then . I do n't know about you , but I did n't give a rats ass about any of that at all , and its basically filler until they have to ' fight ' some dude again in a very clich√© alien - costume with fireworks or some toy - robot . You never feel ' involved ' in some kind of way with this show , and the fact that most of the actors act like there really have no interest at all besides they'r wallet just enhances the lack of feeling.<br /><br />There is really nothing memorable about this show , and its pretty surprising that it got so many spin - offs ( Beetleborgs is a good example ) . All it is is just a quick way to make some money though . I challenge any ' fan ' to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because I could n't find anything that is even slightly appealing to children . My guess is that most ' fans ' of Power Rangers will tell me that I " just do n't get it " anyway , or something along that line . I really do n't care though ; this was crap back then and it still crap now .
0 Okay , I seriously CAN'T think of anything worse than the PR series . There are many bad things in life ... traitors , liars , etc . But seriously , Power Rangers has GOT to be at the bottom of this list . Can you think of anything more stupid than five - six teenagers ( who do n't even act like a normal teen ) dancing around in identical suits WITH DIFFERENT COLORS SO THAT YOU CAN TELL THEM APART ? Fans , have you ever come across a real person who gets flung against a mental wall and gets up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting injured ? Power Rangers are for five - year old boys , and believe me , I never liked this show even when I was five.<br /><br />I guess you can say Dino Thunder is an exception . The teens actually ACT like teens , and Tommy Oliver actually acts like a mentor , or no , a teacher . It 's got teen - humor , though the fighting is lame , I do n't hate Dino Thunder.<br /><br />Many people say Power Rangers are crap , but I would n't . It would be an insult to crap . So face it , five year old boys , Power Rangers is rubbish .
0 Come on , what is the deal with this show , Power Rangers anyways ? I always felt that the show , which was originally brought over from Japan in a better form , took what was great in Japan , and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy merchandising history ! There is absolutely no point with this show whatsoever.<br /><br />The bad haircuts , bad costumes , earrings , etc , all show what was ridiculous back in the 1990s From the two idiots , Bulk and Skull , to the " duhs " , of the main cast , Jason , Trini , Tommy , Kimberly , Billy and Zack , I just want to say one thing : GIVE ME A BREAK!<br /><br />Saban brought this from Japan , and then Disney bought the rights to this show around five years ago.<br /><br />Now the public has to endure reruns of this show on the Disney channel and such.<br /><br />All I can say once again is give me a break !
0 I really do not have any clue as to why some people find the power rangers television show even remotely interesting at all . The costumes are completely ridiculous and the people playing in them also look completely foolish at the same time . There is absolutely anything remotely interesting about the power rangers . This is just a higher priced television commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic garbage to the unsuspecting children around the world . From the notes , I can see that it 's been banned in the country of New Zealand and from what I have seen , I can agree with their decision . Avoid this show at all costs , it 's terrible and ridiculous .
0 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers has got to be the worst television show ever made . There is no plot , just a bunch of silly costumed kids using martial arts while dressed up in second class spandex outfits.<br /><br />The special effects look like they are from the ' 70 's , the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy , and the show is just plain awful.<br /><br />The only thing worse than the television show are the toys , just second rate plastic garbage fed to our kids.<br /><br />There are far better shows for your kids to watch!<br /><br />Try giving your kids something like Nickelodean , those shows actually have some intelligence behind them , unlike power rangers .
0 IT SHOULD FIRST BE SAID THAT I HAVE READ THE MANGA AND THEREFORE MY ARGUMENT IS BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES.<br /><br />This anime greatly disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and OVA . What it left behind was merely a husk of what it could have been . Many of the characters lacked the depth that is seen in the manga . Alucard is not the sympathetic character that secretly wishes for death . Walter 's story lacks the betrayal . And the Nazi villains that plot to engulf the world in war are completely absent . Instead , the anime provides the Gary Stu villain Incognito who is defeated against what appear to be all odds.<br /><br />My primary complaint is not that the anime diverges from the manga , but that it does such a poor job .
0 Basically this is about a couple who want to adopt a second child . At the adoption agency they meet a mouse ( Stuart ) and they decide to adopt him . If you think that this is stupid , hold it , because it 's getting worse.<br /><br />Stuart arrives to his new home , where he is treated like a human child . ( Spare me ! ) The rest is pretty much the usual clich√© , about family problems , jealousy from the elder " brother " , and at the end all issues are resolved and they are all a " happy family " . Boring and worn out as this is , it is also shown in the most blunt and unsophisticated way.<br /><br />I do n't know if the director believed that he was being creative by introducing a mouse to the clich√© , or he was just trying to fill in minutes , but he only upgraded the clich√© from boring to abhorrent.<br /><br />Then why I gave a 3 and not a ZERO ? Because of the family cat , who loves Stuart as much as the " brother " . And because of some funny gigs , where Stuart makes good use of his small size.<br /><br />On the overall I believe that the film would work reasonably well if : a. Stuart was a PET and not a " sibling " . b. It had kept to the funny gigs , like Stuart trying to outwit the cat , and had left out boring clich√©s which do n't even match with anything else .
0 At least the under ten year old set will stay interested . Eleanor(Geena Davis)and Fred(Hugh Laurie)Little , a nice well - to - do couple set out to bring home from the orphanage a new little brother for their son George(Johnathan Lipnicki ) . They come home with quite the odd new sibling ... a sharp dressed little mouse named Stuart(voiced by Michael J. Fox ) . Yes , mouse . Stuart is happy to have found the sense of belonging even if it is in a super sized world that contains his new family 's pet cat Snowbell(voiced by Nathan Lane ) . Stuart embarks on the experience of family loyalty and overall friendship . George will finally accept his tiny new brother when the dapper dressed Stuart saves embarrassment at a model boat race.<br /><br />Also in the cast : Julia Sweeney , Harold Gould , Estelle Getty and Jeffery Jones . And the voices of : Chaz Palminteri , Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly .
0 They should have called this movie : " Adopted Mouse Brother That is Slightly Inspired by Someone 's Vague Recollection of Stuart Little Who Just Kind of Skimmed the Book a Little , But Mostly Just Remembered the Cover " If it was n't so misleading I 'd give it a better review.<br /><br />But seriously people , do your kids a favor and have them read the book . They might actually learn something instead of having their mind numbed by what we all know as Hollywood film.<br /><br />The book Stuart little is n't about a mouse , it 's about a person who happens to be very small and mouse - like . He 's born to his parents , not adopted . The book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he embarks on . There is a cat named Snowball who thinks he 's food and wants to eat him , but Snowball ca n't talk . < br /><br />In the movie they screw all of that up . I think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names .
0 Not that I dislike childrens movies , but this was a tearjerker with few redeeming qualities . M.J. Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted . Hugh Laurie can be amazingly funny , but is not given the chance in this movie . It¬¥s sugar - coated sugar and would hardly appeal to anyone over 7 years of age . See Toy Story , Monsters Inc. or Shrek instead . 3/10
0 ... but the trouble of this production is that it 's very far from a good musical.<br /><br />Granted , one ca n't always expect the witty masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter ; yet the music of this piece makes even Andrew Lloyd Webber look witty . It 's deadly dull and uninventive ( with one or two exceptions ) and just after I watched it I could n't recall a single significant melody - which is rather tragic coming from someone who learned the whole Another Hundred People from three listenings.<br /><br />It is also strangely un - theatrical . It takes place on an incredibly large stage ( one really has to feel sorry for those people in front rows who broke their necks in order to see something happening 50 meters on the right or 100 meters on the left ) and does absolutely nothing with it . When there 's supposed to be one person singing on - stage , that 's just what you get - and the rest of the enormeous stage is empty . For me as an aspiring theatre director it was almost painful to watch.<br /><br />The fact remains , Cole Porter seems to have captured the French culture in his works better than these no - talents can ever come close to . And I 'm puzzled by the popularity of this would - be - legendary musical .
0 OK , I bought this film from Woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday , because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it.<br /><br />But we decided it to watch it anyway . Just for hilarity purposes.<br /><br />And I 'm sorry , but this has got to be , one of THE worst films in history.<br /><br />It began off alright , and we thought " Ok this might actually be OK " . But after about 10 minutes , we were sadly mistaken.<br /><br />It began when the " mysterious paint baller " turned out to be the most obvious character , the Scouser / Australian ( I say that because he had an accent which could n't be identified ) , who 's acting might I just say , was abysmal.<br /><br />Then it got to the end , and by that time , we had all lost the will to live . The paint ball finals.<br /><br />The only thing I did like about this plot is that they did n't actually win , but annoyingly enough they won by default.<br /><br />And I know this has nothing to do with it , but the name the team were given was just awful . Critical Damage . I mean they could of picked a more awesome name , like " The Destroyers of the Anti - Christ " or something . Or that 's what the film should of been called anyway .
0 This film , for an after school special , is n't that bad , and that 's the problem . Nothing happens . You feel as if you 're still in class . A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players . We never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them . They all of the sudden turn into good players by meditating . Also there are too many characters and no character development . Too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids . This could have had a ' Bad News Bears ' feel ( the original ) since there was a girl on an all boys team , but there was n't any feel to this movie at all . It has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it , is not fun to bag on , not fun to watch , and is just kind of ... there . Plain . Boring . Something you 'd watch after school before your pre - evening nap . As dull as the day is long and it 's been a long , long day watching this movie .
0 Mind , my friends and I saw the movie based off it 's title alone . It 's cute , though obvious in it 's plot and direction-- you know where the movie is going within the first five minutes . My main contention with the plot is that while it remains tolerably consistent , they never explain a lot of the things behind the characters . An alcoholic father , overworked mother , stressed - out sister ... that 's a bad family , but aside from the occasional mention from the sister , there 's not any resolution . I was also confused as to the scene with the bottles ... it seemed pretty random.<br /><br />The writing is a secondary concern ... the kids were n't bad actors , but their script left a lot to be desired . Unfortunately , what could have been a cute niche movie was pushed aside for a single , blah special effect , lame scripting , and a glaringly obvious plot .
0 Not the worst movie I 've seen but definitely not very good either . I myself am a paintball player , used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change . The movie portrays similar qualitys First of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this " Phantom " guy or whatever , they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags , autocockers . One guy sporting a bushy . Not much wrong with the movie but more how it 's perceived it was very cheesy . A bunch of kids who are the good guys are woodsball players who do n't appear to have much money and have dreams of getting " better guns " . Another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah The phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them and all this crap , he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the " professionals".<br /><br />So what exactly is wrong with the movie ? Well the budget is a huge thing , a paintball movie WOULDN'T be bad but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was done by an amateur . There are no big names in this film and the acting is very cheesy . The perception of paintball is pretty bad too . They seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other crap . It just was a lousy movie in my opinion and does n't give a real perception what paintball is . To be honest real paintball is n't all buddy like , it 's a lot of cussing and bonus balling not " respect " and playing by the rules . Do n't watch this movie and then expect to go to a field screaming " 4 is 1 ! ! "
0 This film had such promise ! ! What a great idea , an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory , only to lose it 's speed due to bad dialoge , poor editing and a half - written story . The characters in the beginning were interesting , only to lose steam half way through to become one dimensional people sputtering out tired one - liners.<br /><br />Maybe if they spent some more time on the story and dialoge it would have been a great movie , instead of a almost afterthought effort .
0 I do n't think I 'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the worst movie I 've ever seen . I 've been working on a list of my favorite war movies : " The Longest Day , " " To Hell and Back , " " Bridge on the River Kwai , " ( all black and white ) which all have good plots , rich characters and great acting . I 've seen better dialog and acting in student - written high school one act plays . The plot , however is n't a bad premise - just poorly implemented . It 's kind of like a traffic accident , though , I could n't seem to turn it off ! A movie does n't need big money or great sets i.e. " Twelve Angry Men " and " Lifeboat " to be good ... so budget is no excuse . What were they thinking ?
0 Good lord , whoever made this turkey needs to be buried alive . I 'm sorry , but the other reviewer must not have seen this movie , he must be watching something else , or have never seen a movie before ... 9 out of ten stars ? He 's saying what , this is as good as Ben Hur or Gone With the Wind ? Unintentionally funny , massively unbelievable characters , absurd situations , looks like it was shot in Griffith Park ( which works out pretty well -- MASH was shot in Griffith Park ) , crappy script , just about everything that could possibly be wrong with a movie all rolled into one package . Should be required viewing for all prospective film makers as an example of how a movie could be horribly wrong . It reminds me of something a USC student may make for a film class . < br /><br />Give this one a pass unless you do drugs and are into high camp .
0 Relentlessly stupid , no - budget " war picture " made mainly to show off the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meyer -- not a bad idea in itself -- but that should be an embarrassment to everyone connected with it . Laughable " script " , performances that would n't pass muster in an elementary - school Christmas pageant , inept " action " scenes , confused direction by the normally competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen -- who is apparently not quite sure if he 's making a comedy , a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a leering T&A ( by early 1960s standards , anyway ) travelogue of Eve Meyer 's magnificent body -- and a general air of shoddiness and incompetence . Worth seeing in order to watch Eve Meyer strut her stuff , but that 's pretty much it .
0 I 'm sure that Operations Dames was a favorite at the drive - ins back in the day . There 's absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied . And if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the mood.<br /><br />Otherwise there ai n't a whole lot that Operations Dames has going for it . It 's set in the Korean War where a platoon of GIs together with a British tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the UN lines . Bad enough already , but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same predicament.<br /><br />You know what 's sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the Army and in combat situations . These bimbos from the USO set women 's liberation back light years . In fact not even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pants.<br /><br />But that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drive - in for . This no name cast is better off with me not recognizing any of them for any individual effort.<br /><br />Operations Dames is definitely a team flop .
0 I was drawn to this movie , curious to see how they have adapted Hubert Shelby 's brutal novel . I thought that a literary piece of such depth , with a rich tapestry of characters , horrid situations , and social critique could not translate into a bad movie . I was wrong.<br /><br />This flick is a terrible movie experience , not for its content , but for its form . Director Ulrich Edel executes , in my sincere opinion , a terrible directorial job that does no justice to the original book . No wonder Edel is a TV director ; this movie looks and feels like a bad " made for TV " flick . Some of my views on this bomb ( * * spoilers ahead**):<br /><br />- Lack of directorial creativity . The scenes are slow , feel slow , look poorly shot , and barely ever move from an anchored position . The only liberty they take is in the cinematography area , with a nice dark tone . Other than that , the movie has the same technical creativity as a TV soap - opera.<br /><br />- All the actors do a terrific job at portraying these miserable characters . The problem is that the adaptation does not tackle a basic element in the development of the plot : MOTIVATION . All these characters move around like robots , without a clear motivation for their action . They seem to do things out of the blue , like robots , for no reason at all . Edel misses every opportunity to enrich character development by not exploring the character 's motivations , and by avoiding developing each character 's personality to its full extent.<br /><br />This lack of character development is blatant on Tralala . Jennifer Jason Leight does a great job playing this trashy prostitute , but her alcohol - induced decision to let the sailors violate her is not explained . It looks extremely stupid , as we see this character doing this out of the blue . This is a clear example of poor character development.<br /><br />The movie also has many secondary , token characters that do nothing , feel nothing , and add nothing to the plot . I would have liked to learn more about Harry 's wife , for instance , and the interaction between the two . That 's another missed opportunity.<br /><br />Edel only approaches character development with Harry and his fixation with his gay lover , only to screw it up at the end , not clearly explaining -again- his motivations . The thugs are also a joke in their lack of development.<br /><br />- The soundtrack is one of the worst I 've ever experienced . Terrible job by Mark Knopfler . I seriously expected more from the former leader of Dire Straits , but his job in this movie is seriously lacking . At times , like in the battle between the union workers and the police , the music seems totally disconnected from the movie . It also feels completely poor and anachronic ; I could swear the whole soundtrack was made with a Casio toy keyboard . It distracts from the actual action.<br /><br />- The book adaptation by Desmond Nakano is so literal that eliminates the point of the story . It feels as if they tried so hard to keep the action - by - action storyline in the book , that they forgot to actually develop the characters and , once again , explain their actions and motivations.<br /><br />I seriously can not recommend this movie , not even to a Shelby fan , because it can ruin the original book . It 's a very uninspired effort in adapting the novel , and shows very little creative input .
0 I do n't know much about film - making , but good movies have to tell some sort of a story ... your characters have to start and complete their journey . In Last Exit to Brooklyn they may , but its not in any satisfying way , and I 'm not meaning a happy ending , just ANY ending.<br /><br />Last Exit to Brooklyn , set in 1952 Brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike , sets a number of story threads in motion . Most involve some of the most unlikeable characters to ever walk across a movie screen . But Last Exit to Brooklyn fails to bring these stories to any conclusion ... it leaves some of them dangling with no ending , or blasts off into some bizarre stratosphere for an " artistic " ending.<br /><br />Two cases in point , and they contain spoilers.<br /><br />A sad transvestite character ( an important character in the film ) , is struck by a car and killed . And that 's it for him in the movie .... he 's gone for good , erased from everyone 's memory .. no reactions from his friends , enemies , lovers .... nothing.<br /><br />In another thread the stupid , clueless , and secretly gay strike leader , having been rejected by labor , his gay lover , and found out by the neighborhood thugs , gets stomped by the thugs . The closing scene to the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn , and the streetlights are very , very similar to those of Nazi death camps ... and the scene drags on and on and on ... and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader , and he 's been crucified ..... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez . And of course that 's it for him too .... brain erasure ..... gone.<br /><br />Bottom line .... no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film .... this movie is a depressing piece of sludge . Avoid it . And if you do n't be forewarned , it really deserves an NC-17 rating for massive amounts of physical , emotional and sexual brutality ... don't even let the teenagers watch .
0 Fine performances and art direction do not a good movie make . This movie is so grim and depressing , I could feel absolutely no joy at the " happy " ending involving the union strike . The attempts at humor involving Lake 's pregnancy are absolutely disastrous , and any movie involving a Baldwin brother already has a strike against it . On a positive note , Lang is still one of America 's great underrated actors , he alone almost makes this worth keeping in the VCR . I give this a 4 .
0 Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book " Requiem For A Dream " and co - wrote the screenplay to Aronofsky 's movie of it . That movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate , and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them . " Last Exit To Brooklyn " still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives , but it hardly does them the same justice Aronofsky did.<br /><br />The film seems laughably anti - gay at times . Especially when in the film homosexuality equals death . One gay character gets stoned , is launched skyward by a speeding car , and lands dead on the pavement . Another is crucified and still more are simply beat up . Another exaggerated piece of shock value , that might actually have been compelling if it were done well , are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike - breakers . Who 'd have thought a drama about Brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions?<br /><br />The director , Uli Edel has a skill level like that of a TV director , but he is far below the cut for real movies . The film is clunky that ca n't even seem to settle on a genre . Lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and Baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part . And then comes Jennifer Jason Leigh as our lead , a loathsome hooker named Tralala ( believe it or not , I 'm not joking ) . Her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least . Poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is , and also takes the " real " edge off the more provocative bits . A failure .
0 When this was released , I thought this was one of the most profane films ever made . However , thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him , there have been mainline films worse , language - wise , than this .... but this is a pretty brutal assault on one 's ears . Hey , I can take a lot of it , but this got ridiculous . In the first six minutes alone , I heard a half - dozen usage 's of the Lord 's name in vain plus an untold number of f - words . I wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990 ? I could n't have been the only one.<br /><br />Not surprisingly , some of the feature actors included Jennifer Jason - Leigh , Burt Young , Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake . Since this film , Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image , at least playing the Godly " Stonewall " Jackson in " Gods and Generals . " Lang 's role here is just the opposite : perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film.<br /><br />Depressing , gloomy , semi - pornographic , repulsive : these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some Liberal critics - in describing this story , which is painted even worse in the novel . Of course , some of the better - known critics , all extreme Libs , praised the movie . However , they were the only ones . Most critics were disgusted , as well almost all of the paying public . It 's unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this.<br /><br />Trust me on this : there are no good , likable characters in this entire movie . This is a mean , sick film : one of the worst of the " modern era . " That is , unless you enjoy seeing child abuse , drug abuse , teen prostitutes , on and on - two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and just plain evil people . No thanks .
0 Just too many incidents of violence.<br /><br />The film goes from one scene to another , and in nearly every one violence erupts.<br /><br />Now I am not one who is shocked by violence , and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing . But , please , not one after another . My reaction was not shock or horror , it was : " Here we go again . " There is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence , but two thirds of the way through the film I had switched off completely , and could n't wait for the end.<br /><br />If this is the best the film makers can do , they should find something else to do with their miserable lives , like making shoes or delivering mail .
0 Welcome to Our Town , welcome to your town ? As we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of 1901 America , this three act play is opened before us with the help of " The Stage Manager " , a visual narrator if you like . After his initial introductions , we are lead into the homes of two particular families ; The Webb 's and the Gibb's.<br /><br />This is most definitely middle America at the turn of the century , and the progressive way of life of the American Dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town . Here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of Grover 's Corners , New Hampshire , even if there are , too , the migrant Polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers , they , never get a look - in.<br /><br />Once the daily lives of these families have been introduced ; wives cooking , children home - working , fathers working , kids falling in love and the clean picket - fences painted white , the second act is started three years later , after young George ( a young and unrecognisable William Holden , then aged 22 ) and Emily have fallen in love and intend to marry . Blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching , too , a turning point in their own lives , from the nest they lived and now , into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step . The third act is slightly more sour and foreboding , it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent , here we see not life , not celebration but death , and it is in this predicament that the dead , as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past , are here to remind us , to tell us , that life , and every last minute , every precious breath is not to be wasted and squandered.<br /><br />It is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too , feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on , and by , middle America and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order . This is n't just about " Our " town , this is moral diction aimed at " Our " souls and how America can better itself if its peoples ' , ( excluding the Poles , the Irish , the Native American and the freed ethnic minorities ' , and minorities ' in general , plus the supporting backbone of the Americana 's who , still , have not had a fair part in this narrative ) , such as the middle classes , can live up to the expectations of the American Dream through honest , decent living . The purveyors of the American Dream with special invitation only.<br /><br />I was entertained , slightly , by this movie too , but I felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting , the musical score or how well , or not , it was made . This was the movies intention to exclude other groups , and to only include the likes of the Webb 's and the Gibb 's , in the future of the developing country of the USA , a good movie , but also a slightly biased in its stance , I thought.<br /><br />Taken from the play by US ' born Thornton Wilder ( 1897 - 1975 ) this Pulitzer Prize winning play , and six Academy Award nominated movie , was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes ; Life , love and death , the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness . Our Town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness , like other towns , nothing too exciting ever happens here , if anything at all , this town only has the " right sort of people " , you can still leave your back - door unlocked here , we are seeing the developing lives of these two families , but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves . Our Town may just have been " Any Town " , just as long as you came from the right part of town that is .
0 This is the version that even the author hated , because it 's so schmaltzy . They gave it a ' happy ending ' and changed a lot of the dialogue , and it 's just a big pile of saccharine . The ' stage manager ' is quite good , I believe he originated the role , but everyone else falls into that acting style of the 40 's that is really just posing . The one great feature- the music . This has one of the best scores ever recorded , and it 's worth seeking out in a record shop . Overall I think the 1989 Spalding Grey/ Eric Stoltz/ Penelope Miller version is far superior .
0 I read this Thornton Wilder play last year in eighth grade . I was also forced to sit through this weak translation of it on screen . Let me tell you , it 's not a terrific play , it is easily surpassed , but man it deserves a much better shot . The acting was really lacking , the scenery - honest to God - looked like it was designed out of cardboard by a group of three - year - olds . As if it could n't get worse , the sound quality is lousy ... there is this mind - numbing ' buzz ' whenever an actor speaks ... and I also could n't help but notice that the chemistry between George and Emily , well , is non - existant . The actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there . There is no music . It is in black and white , which would be OK but it brings out the cheesiness of it all the more . In any case I think that if you 're going to make a point of seeing this movie , which I do n't really reccomend , then do n't aim your hopes to high . The play , as stalwart as it is , is probably better .
0 When I first popped in Happy Birthday to Me , I checked the timer to see how long the film was . I was amazed at the length . Both animated and horror films share a common ground : attention span of the selected audience and that should be at or right around 90 minutes . Anything more , and you 'll lose the bulk of your audience.<br /><br />This 110 minutes , or 20 minutes past its prime was a huge problem for me . I 'd like to say half of this movie could 've been edited out , but I would be too generous to say that . Go ahead and watch it and tell me how many scenes could 've been edited , even without being a film major.<br /><br />Regardless of the overstayed visit , the movie was below mediocre . It spent all of its time trying to be this huge mystery on which of the " elite 10 " is killing off the remaining friends . For the most part , they not only over - do it , but they zoom in on a face and pretty much say " It 's this guy ! No ! It 's this gal ! " You 'll spend more time with the camera misleading you than actually enjoying the movie . And do n't get me started on the acting.<br /><br />Okay , that got me started . I had to laugh in the beginning trying to remember if Melissa Sue Anderson played the character that went blind on Little House on the Prairie ( later , research proved my suspicions correct ) because all the way through this movie , she genuinely looked blind . Strange , as an established actress , she should 've been the best of the group , but turned out the worst . The rest of the staff , aside from Ann ( Bregman ) was pretty damn bad , too , but she , uh , took the cake.<br /><br />The movie begins with a group of ten friends , and one 's immediately killed off . Barely anyone thinks twice of this " dear " friend 's disappearance , so they continue on their merry way . Slowly , then more rapidly , there are revelations about Virginia 's ( Anderson ) , the main character , past and her psychologist , who 's a tad bit more personal ( AND ON CALL 24/7 , apparently ) than most shrinks . All the while , more and more deaths occur.<br /><br />What 's funny is , just as the first " disappearance , " the more " best buds " vanish , the less the rest care . Sure , they give a few seconds of air time to say " Wow , ( that person ) just would n't run off " etc , but then they 're back to their sexual ways . And speaking of which , it 's probably due to the horrid script , or maybe it was I who was losing interest at minute 30 , but it was really hard to keep up with who liked who of the group as they all seemed to be sexual partners of the next or someone would either be freaked out to the MAX by another and best friends the next scene . SEE : the creepy guy that kept a mouse / rat in his pocket ¬ñ literally ¬ñ and was the most obvious suspect . I 'm giving the film too much credit ( and time , ) but how he became part of the " elite 10 " I 'll never know.<br /><br />But , I digress , there 's a mystery here . Why are these kids targets ? Why is Virginia thinking she 's killed someone , when it was never proved ( ' till the end ) that any of them actually has been slaughtered ? And why would the trailer and poster claim these killings to be " Six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see " ? Hell , even for 1981 , most of these had been shown in any of the first two Friday the 13th films ¬ñ coincidentally enough , Friday the 13th Part 2 was released 2 weeks to the day of Happy Birthday to Me . Perhaps , they 're speaking of when they filmed it months prior , but were late to the , well , party.<br /><br />When the " secrets " are revealed , trust me , you 'll have to rewind 3 - 4x to actually get the laughable and incoherent motives , and even then , put the subtitles on to get all the mumbling victim / killer 's words . Even if you get the first time , it 's an unbelievably outrageous and hilarious finale . It 's almost worth watching the whole movie again , but as a drinking game.<br /><br />This birthday gathering should be avoided . It 's a horrible and illogical first draft script ¬ñ please , please know it takes multiple rewrites before the cameras role , it contains either way under acting or extreme over acting and it 's 100 % unrealistic on how people react in extraordinary circumstances.<br /><br />Side Note : When I was a kid , or say 10 - 11 years old , I loved horror films . ( Still do , oddly . Definite guilty pleasures , but they are getting harder and harder to watch as years pass . ) We got our first VCR , and I taped as many horror films off network ( or , EDITED VERSIONS ) TV . All I remember of Happy Birthday to Me is getting the last 10 minutes on tape , which scared me to death ¬ñ and obviously gave away the big mystery on who the killer was . Even though I have seen other clips of this movie , I think this is the first full - length viewing I 've had . Thankfully , this awful movie did n't wound me as a child . I am older now , and I can take this trash . But never again.<br /><br />Side Note 2 : That said , that crazy " Happy Birthday to Me " song played in the end credits ( and as a score throughout ) still creeps me out tremendously . I guess , this movie ( or last few minutes , ) did have an influence on my childhood . Shame on you , Melissa Sue Anderson !
0 I think if you are into the sixties kind of thing , as I am , you are obligated to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely watchable trainwreck . The saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early ( and embarrassing ) footage . It 's as if the producers of Laugh - In sat down and decided to write a full length film , covering all the high points ( and more ) of the issues between the flower children and the establishment , then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a $ 10,000 budget to complete it . Hardly a classic , but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was , the silliness , the over - idealism , and the uptightness of the establishment . Clearly not for everyone .
0 Roger Corman is undeniably one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history . He was single - handedly responsible for some of my favorite horror films ever ( like the Edgar Allen Poe adaptations " Masque of the Red Death " and " Pit and the Pendulum " ) as well as some insufferably cheap and tacky rubbish quickies ( like " Creature from the Haunted Sea " and " She Gods of the Shark Reef " ) . Corman also made a couple of movies that are simply unclassifiable and ¬ñ simply put ¬ñ nearly impossible to judge properly . " The Trip " , for example , as well as this imaginatively titled " Gas - s - s - s " can somewhat be labeled as psychedelic exploitation . In other words , they 're incredibly strange hippie - culture influenced movies . Half of the time you have n't got the slightest idea what 's going on , who these characters are that walk back and forth through the screen and where the hell this whole thing is going . The plot is simply and yet highly effective : a strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally unleashed and promptly annihilates that the entire world population over the age of 25 . This * could * be the basic premise of an atmospheric , gritty and nail - bitingly suspenseful post - apocalyptic Sci - Fi landmark , but writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn it into a " trippy " road - movie comedy . None of the characters is even trying to prevent their inevitable upcoming deaths ; they just party out in the streets and found little juvenile crime syndicates . " Gas - s - s - s " is a disappointingly boring and tries overly hard to be bizarre . The entire script appears to be improvised at the spot and not at all funny . Definitely not my cup of tea , but the film does have a loyal fan base and many admirers , so who am I to say that it 's not worth your time or money ?
0 I do n't hand out " ones " often , but if there was ever a film that deserved this sort of attention , it 's " Gas ! " This is self - indulgent crap that reaches for some of the ambiance of M*A*S*H and falls completely flat on its face in the attempt.<br /><br />I see what Corman was going for - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould 's deathless role in the original movie version of M*A*S*H with a similar plot ( in the movie " Whiffs " - look it up here in IMDb , http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073891/ for more information).<br /><br />Marmorstein and Gould got closer to the brass ring with " Whiffs " than Corman did with " Gas ! " but did n't quite get there . Neither one of those films even got close to the success of M*A*S*H.<br /><br />What 's wrong with " Gas ! " ? What is n't ? No one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school theatrics . The production values stink . Someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on a getaway car , and there 's more of that lack of attention to detail . Nothing works the way it 's supposed to in this film , and nobody cares.<br /><br />"Gas ! " actually put me to sleep . It 's not a sure cure for insomnia , but really close . On the Cinematic Sleep Induction scale , " Gas ! " falls somewhere between " Last Year at Marienbad " and George Clooney 's remake of " Solaris " ( which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the Mosfilm original , despite that studio 's seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of keeping the audience 's attention by judicious editing).<br /><br />Judicious editing would have decimated " Gas ! " to about twenty minutes . The result would be pointless , but no more so than the original film.<br /><br />Certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway . This is n't one of them . Do n't waste your time . It 's not even amusingly bad .
0 In one word ... abysmal . I give it one star for the hippie sex scenes and eye candy women , otherwise forget it . Corman 's worst effort , bar none . Ben Vereen should have had his name permanently stricken from the cast . I can not believe that this is now going to be on DVD ( as of 2/15/05 ) with " Wild In The Streets " - another retro stinker . I woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold , decided to watch a movie to cheer me up some , scanned the digital channels ... the premise looked interesting enough because I like viewing B - movie sci - fi , hippie culture and rebellious teen flicks . It seemed familiar somehow and with Ben Vereen in the cast , I thought ... why not ? What a big mistake ... it was a horrible start to my day.<br /><br />Only after viewing it , I now know why the familiarity crept into the recesses of my newly - awakened brain . I remembered seeing coming attractions for this film as a 14-year old ( I 'm 45 ) , back in the early / mid - seventies at the Sombrero , a local art theater that no longer exists ... the whole theater laughed hysterically and even groaned out loud at how bad this movie looked . Acting : dreadful , story : awful , cinematography : nearly - awful , music : terrible , sound : horrendous , directing : a joke . If you choose to watch this after my warning , remember ... " I told you so." < br /><br />"Gass - s - s - s " is the perfect title for this film ... you feel " gassed " after viewing this putrid movie - or maybe that you should be taken to a " gas " chamber for wasting your brain away . I have seen homemade Super 8 movies that put this film to shame . Definitely a new addition to my all - time Top Ten WORST films ... it 's up there ( er , down there ) with " Tentacles . " < br /><br />Ted in Gilbert , AZ
0 Bestselling writer George Plimpton(Alan Alda)takes on an assignment for Sports Illustrated . He is to go incognito to the Detroit Lions training camp and try out for a position as third string Quarterback . He is quickly found out by the team members featuring Alex Karras and Mike Lucci . The entire team finds it amusing to cause stumbling blocks in the writer 's determination to Quarterback for a series in a real game.<br /><br />This movie is Alda 's debut and also helped Karras leave the gridiron for acting . Besides the 1968 Detroit Lions , the cast also includes " Sugar Ray " Robinson , Roy Schieder and Lauren Hutton.<br /><br />Alex March directs this story based on Plimton 's book .
0 Alan Alda plays real - life " Sports Illustrated " writer George Plimpton , who was once invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member . Rather wan , uncompelling drama curiously tempered with fantasy . Director Alex March takes an interesting tack on this material , shooting it in a quasi - documentary fashion ( with macho commentary ) and yet giving the tale a touch of Capraesque whimsy ; still , by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this set - up , he turns the main narrative into a jumble . Alda 's smug , uncharismatic performance is another handicap , though the supporting cast is filled with real - life pro - athletes ( and scintillating Lauren Hutton as Alda 's girlfriend -- how 's that for a fantasy ? ) . * 1/2 from * * * *
0 It 's pretty clear that the director and production crew set out to paint a less than flattering picture of the Palestinian girl and her family . The film and it 's website tries to imply that Ayat has a secret reason for blowing herself and Rachel up- a boyfriend problem- perhaps pregnancy . Neatly glossed over is the fact that Ayat had herself just witnessed the death of a close friend at the hands of the Israelis'-just outside her home . Gosh , so why on earth would a young , pretty , intelligent girl with plans for college go and do such a thing ? Could it be that the hormonal , emotional teenager was traumatized by seeing seeing someone she loved die before her very eyes ? This detail merits all of 5 seconds in the movie . Another neatly sidestepped detail is that Avigail Levy , Rachels ' mother , could have prevented the destruction of the building the Akhras family lived in(along with 22 other families ) . One distinctly gets the impression that she 's offering this as a " concession " - should Mrs. Akhras agree to speak with her."why should I ? " she says.(since the movie was made the home has been destroyed- apparently the interview did n't result in what she wanted- so bring on the bulldozers)Mrs Levy claimed that she " wanted the movie to be cathartic as well as a symbol of hope , a chance to transcend entrenched hatreds"- instead she uses it as an excuse to harangue Ayats mother , while dangling the house as a carrot . Moreover although the two women live only 4 miles apart , she is so out of touch with the realities of the occupation for her Palestinian neighbors , that she really thinks that Mrs. Akhras can just drop over for a cup of coffee?Please . And she forgoes the one chance she had to meet Mrs. Akhras in person and see what kind of life she lives.(the Akras family originally came from Jaffa , but now live crammed into a refugee camp only 4 miles from where the Levys live in comparative luxury . Any sympathy I would have had for the obviously well to do Mrs. Levy is dissolved by her air of self - righteous bitchiness . By contrast , Ayats mother comes off as kind , forthright and loving- in spite of the best efforts by the post production crew to paint her and her family as monsters . Heck even the music and sound design was one sided- I guess the muezzin sings ALL day every day 4 miles from the Levy family home , always in a sharply contrasting key from the sappy new - age music that scores this drab excuse for a documentary . Also there is the small matter of translations - Mrs. Levy DIRECTLY addresses the camera in English when she has something worked out to say ahead of time , Hebrew when she does n't . Mrs . Akhras spoke only Arabic which received sometimes a TRANSLATION , sometimes TRANSLITERATION , always awkward , and very suspect for a supposedly objective movie . They also " sweated " her under the lights , while Mrs. Levy sat in ( air conditioned ) comfort . Rotten editing for Mrs. Akhras ' segments too . I gave it a 2 because I liked Ayats mother and father , who seemed like good decent people . Shame on HBO , producers and director , for releasing such a stink - bomb .
0 The filming crew did not have good access to the occupied territories , so filming of the Israeli side dominated . I was struck by the nearly completely opposite points of view of the mothers . The Israeli mother lost a child who had the possibility of a life of tremendous happiness . The Palestinian mother lost a child who had only the possibility of a life of privation and despair . With such completely different viewpoints , any meeting had no real chance of any meeting of the minds . The word " peace " did not have the same meaning to each of them . Peace to the Palestinian was freedom . Peace to the Israeli was security . With such an abyss , is this sort of film really worth much ? I finished with the feeling that I had watched pointless propaganda -- both sides were unconvincing .
0 It 's rare that I feel a need to write a review on this site , but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created , and how bias its product was.<br /><br />I felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film - makers to display the Palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy . We hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression , yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population . We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager . We only hear from other Palestinians in prison . I understand restrictions are in place , but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace.<br /><br />I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence , so to speak . She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber 's parents , and her angry and closed - minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control . It is more realistic , in my mind , to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem ; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom , ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land.<br /><br />I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother , which normally would be admirable in a documentary , however in the light of the lack of impartiality , it all seems exploitative . Also for the poor edits , lack of background in the actual instance , and finally the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side . Ultimately , it is a poor documentary and a poor film . I acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation , but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heart - wrenching and sad subject matter .
0 I tend to love everything the great late Paul Naschy ( R.I.P. ) ever was in . While not all films starring Naschy are great , they all have a specific charm that can be found nowhere but in Naschy - flicks , and they are always entertaining . There is no rule without exception , however , as " El Mariscal Del Infierno " aka . " The Devil 's Possessed " ( 1974 ) proves . While the film does have the specific Naschy - flick - charm , it sadly drags far too much and gets really , really dull in - between . Naschy stars as the evil Baron Gilles De Lancr√© , who oppresses the people and uses black magic and bloody rituals to stay in power . When Gaston de Malebranche ( Guillermo Bredeston ) , who fought side by side with Gilles De Lancr√© against the British , learns about the Baron 's evil behavior , he decides to turn against his former comrade in arms and help the people free themselves from the satanic Baron 's tyranny ... <br /><br />Directed by Le√≥n Klimovsky , who is best known for directing Naschy in " La Noche De Walpurgis " ( " The Werewolf Vs . The Vampire Woman " , 1971 ) , the film was scripted by Naschy himself . Naschy often scripted his own films , and one must say that he mostly did a better , more original job than it is the case here . " El Mariscal Del Infierno " is mostly built up as a historical adventure rather than a Horror film , and it gets quite boring throughout the middle . It often resembles the Sword and Sandal films from the 50s , only that this film is set in medieval times . The Satanic part was probably only added because the great Paul Naschy 's name is linked to the Horror genre . The film has its good parts : Paul Naschy giving weird speeches , Paul Naschy looking weird , Paul Naschy doing Satanic stuff , Paul Naschy torturing innocent victims , etc . But sadly , most of the film concentrates on the boring hero and the good guys , and these moments are boring . The female cast members are nice to look at , but , unlike most Naschy films , this one features no nudity and sleaze . There is some gore , but it mostly looks clumsy and is n't as fun too look at as it is the case with most other Naschy films . Overall , " El Mariscal Del Infierno " is only worth a look for my fellow Naschy - enthusiasts . There are dozens of films starring the Spanish Horror deity which should be seen before this one , such as " El Jorobado De La Morgue " ( " The Hunchback of the Morgue " , 1973 ) , " La Orgia De Los Muertos " ( " The Hanging Woman " , 1973 ) , " El Espanto Surge De La Tumba " ( " Horror Rises From The Tomb " , 1973 ) , " Latidos De Panico " ( " Panic Beats " , 1983 ) , " Rojo Sangre " ( 2004 ) , or any of the ' Waldemar Daninsky ' werewolf films . R.I.P. Paul Naschy . Legends never die !
0 Not the greatest film to remember Paul Naschy by.<br /><br />Gaston ( Guillermo Bredeston ) is probably the worst swordsman I have ever seen . Zorro would be ashamed ! His only salvation came as the competition was just as bad.<br /><br />This film is described as adventure and horror . Forget the horror - there is none . No nudity , no blood , no monsters ; just a Robin Hood adventure against an evil Baron ( Paul Naschy ) who wants to be King.<br /><br />The main feature of the film was seeing Graciela Nilson , who only made four films in two years and disappeared to our regrettable loss . Where did she go ?
0 Despite the ( English ) title , this seems to have little to do with Devils and much more to do with a power hungry ruler who seeks the Philospher 's Stone & wants gold made from lead ( & virgin 's blood ) . Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little issue with having people put to death when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood . He 's basically egged on by his lady love and an alchemist that he 's employed and it 's more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession ( unfortunately ) . There are parts that are at least somewhat exciting like jousting and grown men trying to knock each other down with big sticks , and the film at least has a good look to it , but otherwise there 's little about this to recommend . Little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all , and most unusual , for a Molina / Naschy film , not really any unintentional humor . Therefore , 4 out of 10 .
0 This 1974 Naschy outing is directed by Leon Klimovsky , and a cursory glance at the publicity photos and packaging might lead you to believe that this medieval romp lies somewhere between " Inquisition " and " Sadomania " . Sadly not.<br /><br />This is a strictly PG affair with tame torture sequences , no nudity and little edge at all . Naschy ( of whom I am a fan ) struts his stuff as Gilles de Lancre , " antiguo Mariscal de la nacion " . Sadly he is more pantomime villain than anything else . One gets the feeling with this film that we have seen him ( and it ) done all before . Strictly therefore for Naschy completest only .
0 Posh Spice Victoria Beckham and her alleged new adventures after just moving to LA for work purposes ( footballer hubby David is now a Galaxy LA player after his transfer from Real Madrid ) was originally going to be a full series , but was thankfully abridged to just one hour or so . But even in this form , it is still numbingly interminable.<br /><br />Like virtually all ' reality ' TV shows , most of the incident comes across as blatantly faked , with the programme itself even admitting that Posh 's newly appointed personal assistant is an actress . An Ugly - Betty lookalike , we hear some lamely written and performed banter early on(with an obvious joke about Becks ' apparent dalliance with a previous , and rather more glamorous PA Rebecca Loos , though her name is not mentioned ) with further sequences involving a fake blow - up doll to trick the paparazzi and hopeless attempts to pitch a baseball.<br /><br />This could have been more entertaining if all had acknowledged it was a piece of fluff , and had an actress or impersonator in the lead role . Talented impressionist Ronni Ancona would 've been perfect and is better at being Posh than Posh herself is , and if this more sensible decision had been taken , much more fun and amusement would 've ensued . Sadly , we are left with the real thing here ( Ms Ancona may have rejected the script as too weak anyway),and although there are odd scattered attempts at self - deprecation and irony , it never remotely works because of prior info of La Beckham 's considerable wealth beforehand , and her non - ability at delivering would - be jokes;despite the intentions to send up her image , Mrs Beckham comes across as a shallow egotist , and her weak one - liners do n't persuade us she has any humorous self - awareness . I suspect that if a more realistic fly - on - the - wall documentary approach had been taken , namely Posh walking down any street in LA and being totally ignored ( instead of the frantic , staged scenes of mild hysteria on show here ) , and associates making unscripted jibes about the previously mentioned Ms Loos , this would 've made marginally better TV , but being sycophantic PR material , the bony one herself would never allow such events to happen.<br /><br />Having said that , the later scenes where she made a special appearance at the baseball stadium where she was indifferently presented in front of an uninterested crowd show it will be tough times ahead if she wants to make it big in Hollywood . Her colleague Scary Spice ( aka Mel Brown ) also found it impossible to make it big residing in the movie capital despite her affair ( which was not consummated ) with big name Eddie Murphy.<br /><br />The Spice Girls were of course a massively successful bubblegum pop group in the mid 1990's , more so in their native Britain but still popular briefly in other countries , including the US.They were certainly good fun at their peak of glory ( 1997 ) when there seemed to be a glorious period of optimism in the UK with Cool Britannia and a New Labour government which The Spice Girls seemed to sum up better then anyone else at the time , even if it was somewhat manufactured . But they were never outstanding musical or singing talents , and UK optimism seemed to fade rapidly later that year ( the starting point was arguably the tragic death of Princess Diana),as did The Spices ' themselves . Their presence on the music and entertainment scene soon became repetitive and obvious , and if they had all quietly moved out of the public eye permanently with dignity to enjoy their fortunes , then we would have all had pleasant memories encrypted on our mind without any guilt . Unfortunately , the emergence of the hideous ' celebrity ' culture in the UK towards the start of the millennium has put paid to those imaginings , and we have all suffered thousands , if not millions of stories about the Spices since , Posh being the worst offender , with the rest of her colleagues not too far behind . It was recently announced that there will be a reunion tour soon , which is baffling as they have never gone away and they certainly do n't require any additions to their swelling bank accounts . Maybe it 's because two of them are struggling single mothers , perhaps?<br /><br />Good , it 's soon time for Becks ' adventures on a revelatory documentary next , I can hardly wait ............. <br /><br />Rating:2 out of 10 .
0 I 'm grateful for one thing and one thing only - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on an entirely different continent ! ! ! Yay ! ! ! This programme summed up perfectly just how obsessed Victoria Beckham has become with whoring herself and her family out to the media in the name of self promotion and ' Brand f*cking Beckham'.<br /><br />A few years ago I used to really like ' Posh and Becks ' , I still very much admire David 's talent , but I have no respect for him anymore . How can you respect someone who has his wife 's hand shoved up his backside working him like a puppet.<br /><br />It was clear the hand of Victoria was all over Beckham 's premature departure from Manchester United and now the same thing has happened at Real Madrid . I hope Beckham can live with the fact that although he may be earning squillions of pounds - he 's sold his soul for the American Buck and will end his days playing for a team who would struggle to gain promotion from Division One in England ( no offence America - but at Baseball and Basketball you rule - football you do n't ! ) < br /><br />Anyway - I digress . It 's been years since I 've seen such an over - the - top , entirely false performance from ' Posh ' - this being topped only during her cringe worthy red carpet performances following the Rebecca Loos ' debacle ' , when instead of throwing all the cr*p at David he deserved , she desperately clung onto his arm trying to save the million pound money - spinner her marriage has become.<br /><br />This whole PR stunt was pathetic . Why ca n't she just go over there quietly , support her husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep her head down ? When did she become so full of self importance that she feels the move to America should be shrouded by this huge fan fare ? < br /><br />Incidentally , I saw the David Beckham documentary last night . At least he has retained a sliver of grace and humility . Two things his wife could do with learning.<br /><br />One more thing Victoria - you complain about constantly being hounded by the paps . Little hint - stop tipping them off about your whereabouts you stupid woman.<br /><br />Good Luck America ! !
0 I honestly ca n't believe what passes for entertainment now . Death ( and making fun of death ) , violence , sexual innuendo , adults threatening children , crudeness , alcohol abuse by minors , drug theft , dysfunctional parents , babysitter from hell , stereotypical jokes about African Americans , police and fat people , and kids sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night - yup , sure sounds like a kids movie to me - NOT ! ! ! Add to that the dark and scary elements - a dead woman possessing and turning into a house and keeping her loving husband a prisoner inside for over 20 years , and also terrorizing an entire neighborhood - how sweet for kids . PARENTS - is this really what you want your kids to be watching - is this what you want to teach them about life?!<br /><br />This movie is too scary for young kids , and i 'm afraid that teens today may be living some of this movie scenario - so why rub it in their faces ? As for an adult audience - you wo n't find it scary or amusing - just boring , contrived and predictable . And the characters are just wrong - clueless parents , ignorant police , stupid and annoying friends , nasty and manipulative babysitters , and beer drinking / womanizing boyfriends . What great material for kids - does this really sound like a children 's movie to anyone ? Even the computer animation and good voice work are n't enough to redeem this terrible flick . Save your money , save your time , and save your children 's minds - go rent Ice Age , Monsters Inc. , the Incredibles , Shrek , A Bug 's Life - ANY of them are way better than this horrid film . Spielberg and Zemeckis - shame on both of you for making such a disaster and then billing it as a children's / family movie ! !
0 The only reason I do n't give this movie fewer than 3 stars is because it is n't quite on par with a movie like Manos : The Hands of Fate . This movie 's greatest crime is the fact that it is head - meltingly boring & terribly , unforgivably British . The premise of this movie sounds potentially promising , the whole teleporting concept , but the direction they went with it was completely uninteresting . It was more a movie about research funding and bowties than projecting lasers . The actors were wooden , unemotional , and aloof . As was the love affair between the two scientists-- which was anything but intriguing . I never was able to tell what the attraction was between them as the chemistry was non - existent . Nor did I really understand why the melty - faced main guy decided to slaughter everyone he met . At least now I know that I should always give someone a fair hearing before I cut off their research grants , else they go rampaging about , killing wantonly with goofy hand gestures .
0 The film , a Universal release of a Protelco - MLC production , is a boring retelling of the theory of breaking down the molecular structure of an object , capturing it in a cell as " pure energy , " and then sending it back complete to a " target area . " There is no explanation WHY this is necessary , but Professor Paul Steiner ( played by pock - mocked actor Bryant Haliday , " Devil Doll " ) thinks it 's something to dedicate his , and his assistants ' , Pat Hill ( Mary Peach ) and Chris Mitchell ( Ronald Allen ) , lives to . < br /><br />During an experiment before noted Dutch scientist " Lembach " ( Gordon Heinz ) , his machine fails due to sabotage , so he has himself " projected " by his secretary , Sheila ( Tracey Crisp ) to seek revenge . Of course , she screws up and he comes out looking like a " pork roast " with the power to electrocute people . < br /><br />With this new - found power , he manages to zap some Cockney idiots , a security guy named Latham ( Derrick de Marney ) and his lab boss , Dr. Blanchard ( Norman Woodland ) . He also is able to break into a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat , as well . < br /><br />In the end , though , despite Hill and Mitchell 's attempt to help him , the clown destroys his equipment and himself . On the whole , a completely pointless movie with no message at all . < br /><br />Also one of the most depressing color films you will ever see .
0 Professor Paul Steiner is doing research in matter transference . He has developed a machine that he can use to make an object like a wrist watch or rodent disappear , only to have that object re - materialize in a different location . But there are those at his research facility that do not like or approve of his experiments and will do whatever it takes to see that he does n't succeed . After a failed demonstration that might have saved his funding , Professor Steiner decides to test his machine on himself . As expected , things go horribly wrong and he is transformed into a heavily scared madman whose mere touch will kill.<br /><br />In hindsight , maybe it was n't such a good idea to re - watch The Projected Man in the same week I watched The Fly , Return of the Fly , and Curse of the Fly . There seems to be only so many movies about matter transference and the potentially horrendous effects it can have on the human body that one person should be made to endure in a three or four day period . I 'm not sure what those responsible for the movie list as their source material for The Projected Man , but much of it is so similar to the Fly movies that it can not be mere coincidence . However , The Projected Man is n't even nearly as good as the worst of the Fly trilogy.<br /><br />Besides being terribly unoriginal , The Projected Man has several other problems that really hurt the enjoyment of the movie . A big issue I have is with Bryant Haliday in the lead . He 's such a horse 's ass that , not only do I not care about his suffering , I actually root for it . Supporting cast members Mary Peach and Ronald Allen are almost as bad . They 're so bland and dull they hardly matter . In fact , there 's very little to get excited about while watching The Projected Man . The soundtrack ¬ñ not very memorable . The " look " ¬ñ I would describe much of it as " muddy " . The plot ¬ñ predictable . The action ¬ñ there is n't any . Overall , this is one to avoid.<br /><br />Fortunately , I watched The Projected Man via a copy of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode . Funny stuff ! While not an absolute , very often , the poorer the movie ¬ñ the better the MST3 K riffs . The guys hit almost all of their marks with The Projected Man . I 'll give it a very enthusiastic 4/5 on my MST3 K rating scale .
0 The title alone ( along with the poster ) is enough to give away " The Projected Man " as an obvious rip - off of " The Fly " . And Bryant Haliday , while much better than the typical IMDb review would have you think , is nobody 's idea of an acceptable stand - in for Vincent Price . Although , come to think of it , who would be , unless Micheal Gough was available ? ? Still , if you are in the mood to watch a British " Hammer " style movie with a science fiction theme about a teleportation experiment gone horribly wrong ... well , you still might want to give " The Projected Man " a pass and rummage around in the ' remaindered ' bin at your local Wal - Mart for another teleporter - accident movie . Because this one just is n't all that good.<br /><br />Haliday caught a lot of good natured ribbing from the MST3 K crew for his part in this movie and in " Devil Doll " , but he is actually the best thing in TPM . Maybe he ca n't carry the movie , but he gets practically no help here from the screenplay . The script bogs down any forward momentum the plot may have in a mire of nonsense about funding and university politics and a guy named Lembach and some sinister cabal who want the teleportation machine to fail so they can steal its secrets ... or something . So all the dramatic sequences in the first half of movie involve either phone calls or unconvincing special effects with transparent espresso machines and teleporting rats . Then when poor Haliday gets mutilated by his machine , he has to spend the last part of the film wearing a diaper over half his face and rubber cement over the rest while he electrocutes various Londoners who chance across his path . Tom Cruise and Eric Roberts using bullhorns could n't have made this screenplay work . < br /><br />Meanwhile all the other actors diligently try to inject life and interest into their roles for this turgid little project , but the screenplay just swallows their efforts whole . The corrupt project administrator frets and fumes and hisses into the phone to his blackmailers , all the while failing to notice that he looks like a werewolf outfitted in a tweed suit and a Tattersall vest . Haliday 's research assistant and ex - girlfriend have the least convincing romance in the history of British horror cinema . His secretary is forced to parade around in her " smalls " . None of it really works or gels into a real movie . And it all just kind of stops dead , leaving the viewer going , " Eh ? excuse me , was n't there supposed to be an ENDING here??" < br /><br />Still , for all its problems , I can easily name a dozen horror movies from the same period that were as bad or worse , and so could anyone else who follows movies ( or who has ever browsed the IMDb " Bottom 100 " ) . I would n't actually pay money to own " Projected Man " , but if it were included in some compilation along with a dozen other movies in a DVD collection , I 'd probably feel OK about having it . It 's a harmless diversion , perfect for a horror movie film festival , to watched with friends while consuming many beers and snacks on a Saturday evening .
0 Ok first of all , this movie sucks . But lets examine why . The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy , storing it , and then transporting it and reasembling it is at the least intriguing . But that 's as far as they take this premise . Instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine , they break the damn thing . This could have been a good premise . Living with the responsibilty of this kind of power , and dealing with the constant temptation , ie .. the invisible man . But no .. they break the damn thing . And Lembach wants to leave . So then the doctor jerry - rigs the thing back together , and trys to transport himself . Only to have it goofed up by his beautiful but dumb secretary , ( duh ) . Which would n't happened if Lembach had n't decided to leave . So now he is roaming the country side killing people because his little experiment failed , and they would n't give him money . Wah . Then to make the movie worse , throw in a dry British relationship between the two semi - competent professors hired to assist him . Between their loving sessions , they make a couple of half - hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of London . All of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine , which would never have happened if Lembach had n't left . This movie tried so I give it an honest 2 stars for effort , but it would have been better if they had n't broke the damn machine , making Lembach leave , making him try it again . Damn you Lembach ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0 I remember this film , exhibit in Barcelona ( Spain ) in 1970 , for the time of a week . Although it could seems incredible , and I ca n't offer any explanation for it , this movie was exhibit in a theater dedicated to ... movies of art and big quality ( that , is , Bergman , Resnais , Malle , Bu√±uel , and ... The Projected Man ) . Few people saw it ( luckly people , no doubt ) and no reference about this very boring SF movie can be found in the Peter Nichols Science Fiction Encyclopidie , or about the author of the original novel . Very indicative . I remember of it , after all this years , a no - story , a lot of special effects that seems ridiculous effects in fact , and no more . It seems that in some countries the running time is 90 mm . and in anothers 77 min . Well , it means only a little more of pain .
0 This movie is spoofed in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . I think MST3 K was at its best when they ripped this movie.<br /><br />Terrible acting , bad makeup , poor effects , chick in skimpy ( 1960's)underwear . I give it a 2.<br /><br />The villain is hard to understand due to the makeup . The assistant says things like ' not you ' that sound like NACHOO ! ! ( think sneezing ) . It 's just poor oration . The long eyebrows are hilarious on one of the characters . < br /><br />I still do n't know what ' The Projected Man ' means in terms of the plot . I missed some of the beginning though . < br /><br />What is up with this 10 line minimum on posting ? ?
0 This is one of the worst things to ever come out of England , so that says a lot right there . The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is amazing though . The upside is seeing the nice secretary , Sheila , in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by Dr. Rat Face . This movie has several views of London too although none of them are good . There is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate back to just below normal . There is also a watch that gets teleported away , and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the horror of " The Sixth Sense " only a lot more dull and British . Add on a furious gun fight between the British police and the Dr. Rat , which results in nothing , plus the electrocuting of a lot of people , plus a cat and you have yourself ... ummm ... A British movie . The MST3 K version is pretty good although not one of there bests .
0 With that line starts one silly , boring British sci fi film . The Great Vorelli from the movie " Devil Doll " builds a teleportation machine only to have his funding cut off by Blanchard , a bearded man who has a thing for bow ties and men with large eye brows . When his experiment fails , the good doctor learns that Lembach , the man who controls all of the grants in the world , will be staying in London for a few days . He attempts to project himself into the house of Blanchard with the help of his comely lab assistant , Sheila . Needless to say something goes wrong and he winds up looking like a rat . The rest of the movie is devoted to the good orange haired doctor walking around London shocking people with his mutated hand and wearing a diaper on his face . There are some more killings , some modest paper work , and finally , the doctor vanishes to where ever rat faced doctors go . Thankfully no one decided to make a sequel .
0 This is a rather dull movie about a scientist that creates a teleporter device and gets horribly disfigured when he uses the machine to transport himself . Simple plot done before in the fly and others . Not only does he get disfigured , but he also can electrocute people with a touch . What is really dumb about this film is that we are expected to believe the place this guy works is against him . He could probably make millions for the institution that he is working at , but the head of the institution tries to sabotage his teleporter every step of the way . In the end the projected man electrocutes three people for no reason then goes after those that have wronged him .
0 ( spoilers)The one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of British cuisine is Steiner 's henna rinse , one of the worst dye jobs ever . That , and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil dude who was trying to steal Steiner 's invention . MST3 K does an admirable job of making a wretchedly boring and grey film funny . I particularly like it when Crow kills Mike with his ' touch of death ' , and when he revives him in the theatre , Mike cries " Guys , I died , I saw eternal truth and beauty ! oh , it 's this movie ... " That would be a letdown , having to come back from the afterlife to watch the rest of The Projected Man . The film could make a fortune being sold as a sleep aide . Some of the puns in the film were wicked : police inspector-"electrocution ! " Crow-"Shocking , is n't it ? " police inspector-"That 's LOwe , all right " Tom Servo-"Very low , right down by the floor ! " police inspector-"Can I get on ? " Tom Servo-"He 's dead , but knock yourself out " MST3 K is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer .

0 It 's not so much that SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION had little potential . Indeed the under - explored title phenomenon is quite intriguing and , for at least the opening half , this Tobe Hooper effort promises to entertain in a way only cheesy ' 90s horror can . But somewhere between Brad Dourif 's on - again - off - again performance and the overly intricate plot , this would - be thriller loses its way.<br /><br />Dourif , featured here before his built - in horror fan base had accumulated , is average guy Sam . Of course average guys do n't stay average for long in horror movies , so after a well - done origin outline , we see Sam 's various body parts start to ignite . Soon he 's igniting other people , too , much to the consternation of gal pal Lisa , played unmemorably by Cynthia Bain.<br /><br />While the title of the film implies a fire - happy monster on the loose , director Hooper opted to make Sam an unwilling killer . This approach gives the film an added human depth it would otherwise lack , but it also prevents us from truly fearing the human flamethrower . We 're left wondering whether this would have worked better as a straight - up villain - versus - everyone effort ala NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.<br /><br />SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION is a pretty nominal effort when all is said and done . It will carry added appeal for Dourif 's fans and those who ca n't get enough 1990s horror , be it good , bad or in between , but only on a slow night .
0 Not as bad , as it 's credited to being ( Hooper 's done far worse ) ¬Ö  more so disappointing for me . Such an imaginative concept , which is never really tapped in to by Hooper with his economical direction and even less so in the smoky ( excuse the pun ) writing . It goes so sinister and over - the - top in a dead serious tone , becoming ridiculous and unfocused letting the whole pessimistic mystery / conspiracy - laced narrative being easily telegraphed to end on something completely abrupt . Because of that , the pacing goes on to be rather sluggish and Brad Dourif ( cool to see him in a leading role ) seems to struggle with an off - balanced performance , despite etching out a bemusedly quirky intensity to his off - colour character . Even though it 's cheaply done , there 's a competent technical attitude to it . However it does n't seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to plaster in nasty jolts ( which some do work ) and strikingly steaming special effects ( flames , flames everywhere ) instead . Hooper does display some stylishly frenetic imagery ( more so towards the latter end ) , and the camera - work is swiftly manoeuvred and the beaming score is titillating . The performances are bit all over the shop with the appearances of William Prince , Cynthia Bain , Dey Young , Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon . Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small , but amusing cameos ¬Ö  especially Landis . Nothing surprises , but it 's passably engaging .
0 Bizarre Tobe Hooper exercise regarding an unfortunate young man(Brad Dourif)with the ability to set people on fire . This ability stems from parents who partook in atomic experiments in the 50 's . They die of Spontaneous Human Combustion and it seems that what Sam is beginning to suffer from derives by these pills his girlfriend , Lisa(Cynthia Bain)gives him to take for rough migraines . In actuality , Lisa was told to manipulate Sam into taking the pills by Lew Orlander(William Prince ) , pretty much the young man 's father who raised him from a child . Lew has benevolent plans .. he sees Sam as the first " Atomic Man " , a pure killing machine in human form . Sam never wanted this and will do whatever it takes to silence those responsible for his condition . As the film goes , Sam 's blood is slowly growing toxic , green in color instead of red . It seems that water and other substances which often put out fire react right the opposite when Sam 's uncontrollable outbursts of flame ignite . Come to find out , Lisa has Sam 's condition whose parents also dies from SHC . Dr. Marsh(Jon Cypher ) , someone who Sam has known for quite some time as his physician , is to insert toxic green fluid into their bodies , I 'm guessing to increase their levels of flame . Nina(Melinda Dillon , sporting an accent that fades in and out)was Sam 's parents ' friend and associate on the experiments in the 50 's who tries to talk things over with him regarding what is happening . And , Rachel(Dey Young)is Sam 's ex - wife who may be working against her former husband with Lew and Marsh to harm him and Lisa.<br /><br />Quite a strange little horror flick , filled with some pretty awful flame - effects . Dourif tries to bring a tragic element and intensity to his character whose plight we continue to watch as his body slowly becomes toxic waste with fire often igniting from his orifices . There 's this large hole in his arm that spits out flame like a volcano and a massive burn spot on his hand which increases in size over time . Best scene is probably when director John Landis , who portrays a rude electrical engineer trying to inform Sam to hang up because the radio program he 's calling has sounded off for the night , becomes a victim of SHC . The flick never quite works because it 's so wildly uneven with an abrupt , ridiculous finale where Sam offers to free Lisa of her fire by taking it from her .
0 It 's often said that Tobe Hooper just struck lucky with his grisly 1974 horror film ' The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ' and every time I see another Hooper film - that view is only reinforced . It would seem that Hooper wanted to make his own version of films such as Scanners and Firestarter in 1990 and so we end up with Spontaneous Combustion ; a film with a couple of good ideas and a whole load more that are borrowed from other films . Put it all together and you get a messy , boring film that most people would do well to miss ! The film leads the audience to believe that it might be half decent initially with an intriguing back story that focuses on some experiments carried out on two young people in the fifties . The couple have a child and shortly thereafter burn to death as a result of the experiments done on them . Fast forward some years and the baby is now an adult named Sam ; but naturally he 's not a normal person and soon finds when it 's discovered that he has the ability to set things on fire at will.<br /><br />The film stars Brad Dourif , who must have seemed like a good casting choice given his success with Child 's Play two years earlier ; but actually was an uninspired decision as the central performance is really terrible ; and not helped by the terrible supporting performances . The turgid direction and dull script also do n't do the film many favours and the trend of lacking in favours is continued by the special effects , which are very unrealistic and have nothing on the films that this one is ripping off ; all of which were made some years earlier . The plot is really slow and it 's almost an hour before anything of note happens , and I did n't care for it even then . It soon becomes obvious which direction the film will go in and it all boils down to the sort of tedious ending you would expect . The final confrontation is a big disappointment and nothing is really explained during the film . Not that any revelation would have been interesting anyway . Overall , this is a rubbish film and another reason why Tobe Hooper is a long way from being a great horror director . See Firestarter again instead .
0 I tried as hard as I could to sit all the way through this irritating mess , but I just could n't do it . Brad Dourif absolutely sucked as the lead and all the supporting cast were only marginally worse . < br /><br />The whole thing is just ludicrous , from the awful acting to the laughable FX to the stupid plot.<br /><br />Complete waste of time ; do n't bother . Root Canal therapy would be more enjoyable . Bamboo slivers under the fingernails would be a lot more pleasant . < br /><br />Watching a Uwe Boll movie would be only a little worse than this . Get the idea ?
0 A man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 50 's and that he now has the power to ... burst into flames ! < br /><br />I was really geared up for this film , what with being directed by the great Toby Hooper and staring wild card Brad Dourif . Unfortunately it did n't rise above the average individual - with - violent - powers movie . Spontaneous Combustion has an interesting premise behind it , unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolongs its plot too much . The special effects are n't bad though and help to carry the movie to the finale.<br /><br />The cast is n't bad , Dourif does steal the show.<br /><br />All around , no classic but it 's not the worst of its kind either.<br /><br / > * * out of * * * *
0 Pretty poor Firestarter clone that seems more like a bad TV movie than a bad feature film . How disappointing for this to come from Hooper and Dourif!<br /><br />Government contractors do a human experiment with a Hydrogen bomb . The boy born to the couple from the experiment constantly runs a fever of 100 degrees , and when he 's an adult , people in his life start spontaneously combusting . He tries to find out why.<br /><br />The people completely on fire are well done , but when they get to the point that they are well done in another sense , they 're obviously changed to dummies . When jets of fire shoot out of characters ' arms , it looks silly rather than alarming the way it should . Also ridiculous is fire that evidently travels through phone lines and erupts in huge jets from the receiver 's earpiece . How is that supposed to happen , exactly?<br /><br />Something else that struck me as silly about the movie is when a character has visions of his late parents . We later see the exact same shots from those visions in home movies .
0 First off , the lead , Brad Dourif is a KOOK . If you 're trying to take this movie seriously , then , I guarantee he 's going to ruin it for you . If you do n't take him too seriously , then he 's actually kind of fun to watch . As with another reviewer , I loved the scene where Lisa ( Cynthia Bain ) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car . Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room . In fact , I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non - stop laugh - riot - I 'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way .
0 Others have already commented on the " decline " of director Tobe Hooper , but what about Brad Dourif ? He was perfectly capable of selecting good projects ( as he proved by starring in the same year 's " Exorcist III " ) , so why did he agree to appear in this ? Sure , he gives a suitably demented performance , and the film is not outright bad ; it 's just uninvolving , uninteresting and unappealing . That 's three " un-"s too many . ( * 1/2 )
0 Now , i hired this movie because Brad Dourif was in it . He is an excellent actor , BRILLIANT in everything ... except this movie . And i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was , and did n't bother with a good performance . This movie is a unintentional - comedy . Some of the lines just crack me up . And them there are some lines that make no sense , and it seems like Tobe Hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot . Oh ! BTW the plot is BAD ! But it one of those films that is TAHT BAD that its actually PAINFUL to watch . I recommend this only for BIG Brad Dourif fans , or fans of any of the other actors , because the plot is pathetic .
0 Seriously , what is THIS ? Hooper has made such classic films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre , then he made this god awful film , what happened ? did he dip into the crack a little too much ? This film is about some dude named Sam who has the ability to set things on fire,(Firestarter , anyone ? ) the acting was godawful , the plot was rubbish , and the special effects were extremely rubbish , they looked like something from the 70 's . Van Damme should be pleased that Derailed is no longer the worst film ever , and what was with the ending ? he started glowing blue , turned into a glowing blue blob , sucked out his girlfriends fire , and the film ended . WHAT WAS THAT ? HUH ? when the film ended I hoped the DVD would Spontaniously Combust to save me from my pain.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM.<br /><br />DON'T THINK , OBEY , you 'll thank me later .
0 Tobe Hooper has made great movies so I was certain this could n't be BAD . I did n't read any reviews and tried to watch this unintentionally humorous film . At times this made me laugh , sometimes I almost fell asleep , sometimes made me almost CRY for Hooper.<br /><br />I rated this 3/10 because its 1990 " horror "- movie and many interesting or funny things happened there . Throughout the movie I was thinking something like " they simply CAN'T add more things in this movie ... " .. but they did.<br /><br />Some tell this is some sort of Firestarter clone but truly is n't . It 's based on that idea but that s all . This is combination of horror , comedy , weird religion / god things , funny gore , simple effects , drama , horrible acting , unbelievable script .. and more.<br /><br />*spoilers * Story is : Government tries to create ultimate weapon using nuclear power or something and fails , during process child is born for 2 test persons . When mom sings to her child after the birth , both husband and wife burns and it is SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION . Government buries whole thing and leaves this child live amongst other people and ... then after x years this kid is grown up and realizes he has been born for a reason and whoa he can burn things with his brains . Then everything goes unbelievable messy nothing really explains anything and .. Well when The Government realizes " okay now he can set this fire thing to work " they take him to normal hospital where is some nuclear toxic what they are going to use on this man BECAUSE they could kill him , no they ca n't shoot him no ! .. and argh , I guess that s enough to tell , I promise there is 100 more weird things in this movie.<br /><br />Well if you want good laughs watch this one . Gosh .
0 This film is a massive Yawn proving that Americans have n't got the hang of farce . Even when it has already been written for them ! The original film " Hodet Over Vannet " is a witty comedy of errors that I would rate 8/10 . It is n't just about a linguistic translation , but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely , robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap " oops there go my trousers " style of farce .
0 Story starts slow and nothing funny happens for a while . All the action is in the end , but you wo n't have to laugh because the movie is funny , but because the story is pathetic.<br /><br />The funniest part is when Harvey ' I 'm not Paranoia ' Keitel really loses it and the judge starts a massacre . Oscars for this guy !
0 This movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery . It fails badly at both . The only mystery here is why would anybody make such a poorly constructed movie . The only comedy is the laugh I got when I saw how high the readers here ranked it . Could there be two movies with the same name ? The movie I saw starred a girl with pretty blue eyes and a plot that was n't there.<br /><br / >
0 Do n't waste 90 minutes of your time on " Fast Food , Fast Women . " It 's annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing , horrific acting , and even bad music . I found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen . SHE needs the fast food.<br /><br />Spend the 90 minutes you 'd devote to this turkey doing something more exciting ... like trimming your toenails . You 'd have more entertainment value.<br /><br />The only redeeming thing about this film is Louise Lasser , but she deserves much better than this tired script . It 's as impotent as the elder guy she courts in the movie.<br /><br />VIEWER BEWARE !
0 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! I saw it at the Toronto film festival and totally regret wasting my time . Completely unwatchable with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.<br /><br />Steer clear .
0 My girlfriend and I were stunned by how bad this film was . After 15 minutes we would have called it quits except we were too curious to see if the film could possibly redeem itself . It didn't.<br /><br />I ca n't understand the praise given to this film . The writing was downright awful and delivered by some of the worst acting I have seen in a very long time.<br /><br />One thing that especially annoyed me about this film was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines . I understand using a pause to create a feeling of awkwardness ( like in Happiness ) . This was not that type of pause -- it was just simply bad directing . This film might actually be much better with subtitles , and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film , because then the innane dialogue and bad acting would n't be noticed as much.<br /><br />I generally like these types of small quirky films ( The Real Blonde , Walking and Talking , Lovely and Amazing ) , but this one failed on so many levels that I consider it one of the very worst films I have sat through in the last few years .
0 This kid is rather bad , but in no way do they make him the type that outsmarts adults and can foil experienced thieves at every turn . No , he is not so much a brat , as he is a kid with severe emotional problems . A nice couple looking to adopt get rather suckered into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not . Through in a bizarre Michael Richards character and the always annoying Gilbert Gottfried and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there . I actually prefer the sequel to this film as I like the fact they brought Amy Yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is . Even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one , and they kind of chill him out in the sequel too . The plot is simple enough though as the prospective parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party as they depart , they soon realize they have themselves a little hellion . Add to that this little hellion getting into contact with a convict of some sort . Not sure about this character , at first I thought it was supposed to be his real father or something . Not all that good , but I will pick this ahead of that Culkin kid any day of the week .
0 The first scene in ' Problem Child ' has a baby peeing into a nun 's face . For this movie , that 's witty . A nasty , mean - spirited ' comedy ' , it 's inept on so many levels it beggars belief . John Ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from Hell , and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one - note , annoying performances and puerile humour . And what the hell 's Jack Warden doing in this mess ? Slackly directed by Dennis Dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when it 's done with the crudity , the movie is made so badly it 's quite a bizarre experience . But never mind all that . The lowlight of the whole thing is Michael Oliver , the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen ¬ñ believe me , you will want to smack him right in the mouth .
0 I remember watching this movie several times as a very young kid , and there were parts of it ( many in fact ) that I did not understand . I think I have seen it once as an adult , and I then understood those parts . The only problem with viewing it as an adult was that it was not entertaining to me at all . So what kind of movie is this ? Is it a " kids movie " ? Not hardly . It contains language and subject matter not suitable for kids . Is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are going through with their own children ? Maybe , but then why would n't it focus more on John Ritter 's character instead of Junior ? When a film has a 7-year - old as its main character , in order to do well with it 's audience , it should be a movie for the seven and under crowd , otherwise people older than that will have no way to relate ( even 8-year - olds would n't want to see a movie about a kid who is whole year younger than them ) . I 'm pretty sure this film did not do well in the box office , and the reason has to be because it was unable to find a niche in the market .
0 I have to admit I 've caught this one a few times on the USA Network . There 's just something about the , well , sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever it 's on . Yes , you 're right about the sub - par acting , the plot which only an seven year old could like , etc . But I ca n't help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors . Then again , a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel .
0 " Problem Child " is one of the goofiest movies ever made . It 's not the worst ( though some people will disagree with me on that ) , but it 's not the best either . It 's about a devilish 7-year - old boy who wrecks comic havoc on a childless couple ( John Ritter , Amy Yasbeck ) who foolishly adopts him . This film is too silly and unbelievable because I do n't buy for one second that a child could act as unrurly as the kid does in this film . It 's asinine and preposterous although I did laugh several times throughout ( I really do n't know why ) . But I ca n't recommend this film . I know I 'm being too kind to it . If there is one positive thing about " Problem Child " is that it 's better than the sequel which was just awful . < br /><br / > * * ( out of four )
0 PROBLEM CHILD is one of the worst movies I have seen in the last decade ! This is a bad movie about a savage boy adopted by two parents , but he gets into trouble later . That Junior can drive Grandpa 's car . He can scare people with a bear . He can put a room on fire ! It is a bad movie as much as BATTLEFIELD EARTH . A sequel is an even worse fate . Rent CHICKEN RUN instead.<br /><br />*1/2 out of * * * * I give it .
0 I ca n't for the life of me remember why -- I must have had a free ticket or something -- but I saw this movie in the theater when it was released . I do n't remember who I went with , which theater I was in , or even which city . All I remember was how offended I was at this travesty someone dared to call a film , and how half the people in the theater walked out before the movie was over . Unfortunately I stuck it out to end , which I still consider to be one of the worst mistakes of my life thus far . My offense became pure horror when just before the closing credits the smarmy demon child sticks his head out from behind a sign and says " Look for Problem Child 2 , coming soon ! " That was hands - down THE most terrifying moment ever recorded on film.<br /><br />The plot , if I recall correctly , involved John Ritter and perhaps his wife ( Lord , how I 've tried without success to block this film out of my mind ) adopting a " problem child . " Maybe they think they can reform him , or something . I really do n't know . If that was their intent , they fail miserably because from first frame to last this child remains the brattiest , rudest , most horrid demon - spawn ever to hit the big screen . Forget Damian , forget Rosemary 's Baby . This kid takes the cake . The only difference is , we are supposed to feel sorry for him because he 's a " problem child . " However , this is impossible since this child is quite likely the most unsympathetic character ever portrayed . You want to kill him through the entire film , and when ( SPOILER , like anyone cares ) John Ritter decides to keep the vile hell - child you will be yelling " Send him back ! " in shocked disgust ( like several of the people at the theater where I saw it did).<br /><br />This is only the second movie I have given a " 1 " to on the IMDb . The other was Superman IV , and by God I could n't tell you which was worse . John Ritter had a quote in TV Guide about the time that Problem Child 3 , which he was not in , came out . He said something like " The only way I would do another [ Problem Child ] sequel is if they dragged my dead body back to perform . " Amen to that!<br /><br />I would rather watch a 24-hour marathon of Police Academy sequels than see even twenty minutes of Problem Child again . 1/10 , only because I ca n't give it a negative score , which is what it really deserves . Someone burn the original negatives of this film , please !
0 People who actually liked Problem Child ( 1990 ) need to have their heads examined . Who would take the idea of watching a malevolent little boy wreak havoc on others and deem it funny ? The movie is not funny , ever , in any way , beginning to end . It wants to be a cartoon , but the writers do n't realize that slapstick is n't funny when people get attacked by bears , or hit with baseball bats . It may be funny in cartoons , but not in a motion picture.<br /><br />The film 's young hero is Junior ( Michael Oliver ) who , since he was a baby , has been placed at the front doors of foster parents for adoption . The families reject him , because Junior tends to give them a hard time.<br /><br />He is then thrown into an orphanage , where he terrorizes the nuns , and writes pen pal letters to the convicted Bow - Tie Killer ( Michael Richards ) . He is soon adopted by Ben and Flo Healy ( the late John Ritter and his wife , Amy Yasbeck ) , who are dying to have a child , in order to be just like every other parent in their neighborhood.<br /><br />Junior becomes a member of the Healy household , and " Little " Ben takes an interest in him , despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by luring a bear onto the site , or throws a cat at his father " Big " Ben ( Jack Warden ) , a bigoted politician.<br /><br />I think that we 're supposed to care for Junior so that we can root for him when he gets his revenge on people . His new mother , Flo , is a bitch , his grandfather is completely selfish , and one little girl -- who despises adopted kids -- is such a spoiled brat.<br /><br />But what Junior does to get the last laughs is n't funny- -it 's mean , cruel , and sometimes life - threatening.<br /><br />And what is the film 's message ? That kids should resolve problems with violence and vandalism ? That they should seek friendship by writing to convicted killers ? They definitely do n't what it 's like to be a bad kid . Junior is n't a one -- he 's just a sadistic , little twerp . There used to be a time when it was bad for kids to beat up others . Now , everybody 's laughing when Junior beats up kids with a baseball bat.<br /><br />It 's a shame that this movie has been marketed as a " family comedy . " What 's worse is that Problem Child is rated PG . What was the MPAA thinking when they saw this ? There 's a lot of profanity and mean - spirited pranks here , that one may wonder about the dividing between the PG and the PG-13.<br /><br />Kids will enjoy this , but parents will be shocked at what is being depicted on screen . And to most people , Problem Child will be considered a " guilty pleasure " classic ; a film that someone will shamefacedly admit to liking , even though the prevailing opinion , as put forth by more serious viewers , is that the movie is a piece of crap .
0 I joined this site to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster of a film . I was n't drawn in for even a second . The characters were all one - dimensional . They threw every topic they could think of hoping something would stick . I would bet ( and hope ) that everyone involved in Teachers looks back with embarrassment . There are some great actors here but you would never know it . Thank God it did n't destroy Morgan Freeman 's or Judd Hirsh 's or Nick Nolte 's or Laura Dern 's careers . There was no vision , no labor of love here , only a horrible effort gone wrong . BTW I do n't think the writer ever set foot in a real school .
0 As an ex - teacher ( ! ) I must confess to cringing through many scenes - ' though I continued to watch to the end . I wonder why ? ! ( Boredom , perhaps ? ) : -)<br /><br />The initial opening scenes struck me as incredibly mish - mashed and unfocussed . The plot , too , although there were some good ideas - the plight of a relief teacher , for example - were not concentrated enough in any one direction for 3-D development.<br /><br />Not one of Mr Nolte 's finer moments . As to young Mr Macchio , does he speak that way in * every * movie?<br /><br />Plot and acting complaints aside , the hair - styles alone were a nostalgic ( if nauseating ) trip.<br /><br / >
0 < br /><br />This movie sucks . Ridiculous " school " athmosphere , unbelievable students that are very bad and behave like criminals but then later after the " good teacher " Nick Nolte taught them they became as good and as quiet as kittens.<br /><br />If this works for you , it does n't for me . 0 out of 10
0 Though I never like to be the sort of person who negates another 's personal taste ; if you like something , that 's fine . But , this movie was horrible and there is no way around it . I do n't like Ani Difranco too much , but she 's a great guitarist and songwriter , that I can admit . But I ca n't admit to there being any redeeming qualities to this film . Many people way that it is an accurate portrayal of issues that high school students face . Maybe , but everything is portrayed too far - fetched . There seems to be an attempt at a " Naked Gun " - esque kind of comedy , but the timing is off ; there is too much space between each actors line , as if they 're holding for laughter ( there was n't any ) . Whoever wrote the script was all over the place . They tried to cram as many controversial issues together in one film , almost never fully developing any of them ( especially the girl getting impregnated by a teacher ) . I did not laugh once throughout this entire movie . I was too insulted by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything but roll my eyes at the screen .
0 WARNING ! SMALL PLOT DETAILS REVEALED!<br /><br />I can find virtually nothing positive to say about this film . It is written so badly that every character is a caricature , yet it seems to take itself seriously . It is poorly cast , especially Ralph Macchio ( all baby - faced , 5-foot - nothing of him ) as a streetwise tough . Plot elements are all drawn in black and white , with every situation almost immediately escalating to some extreme climax.<br /><br />Most egregious of all ( PLOT ELEMENT ABOUT TO BE REVEALED ) it has perhaps the most gratuitous and contrived nude scene in the history of semi - serious film . One can just imagine the filmmakers saying , " We need JoBeth to shed her top ... hmmm ... I've got it! ... early in the film , let 's give Nick some ridiculous dialogue about baring yourself in the hallways ... then JoBeth can use that line on him later and REALLY bare herself in the hallway ... yeah , that 's the ticket!" < br /><br />I will give the producers credit for tackling a weighty subject in 1984 , one that proved all too weighty in the late 90 's with events like Columbine . However , the execution is dreadful . This film could have been a dark comedy in the vein of " Heathers " , a campy political statement like " Network " or a serious examination like " Brubaker " . Instead , it tries to be all of these things -- and ends up being none of these things . " Teachers " get an F.
0 In a recent biography of Alec Guinness I could n't find too much about To Paris With Love . I 'm sure Guinness did the film to get a free trip to Paris out of it . The film has no other reason for existence.<br /><br />Paris of course is nicely photographed with that wonderful opening of Guinness and his son driving down the Champs Elysee with the Arc De Triomphe in the background . Unfortunately it goes downhill from there.<br /><br />There is just no chemistry at all between Guinness and the young girl who he has a brief fling with in Paris . According to the recent biography of Guinness by Piers Paul Read , Guinness positively disliked the girl , found her conduct unprofessional . As to what Odile Vernois thought of her co - star , no record is available . They have as much chemistry as two neutered cats.<br /><br />Guinness does have a good moment in the film which was straight from one of his Ealing comedies as he climbs a tree trying to retrieve a badminton shuttlecock . But I would n't wait through the film for it.<br /><br />At least Alec got a trip to Paris out of the deal .
0 I love Alec Guinness . And that 's saying a lot after this film . Actually , he is not bad in it . He just seems to stand aside , be urbane and his usual delightful self , but invest nada . It is obvious the girl he is matched with is a featherweight , even as an inexperienced young French girl . Sir Alec would n't have chosen her when he was young and very obviously is n't too happy about it now.<br /><br />The interesting character is the brooding brother of the odd " Suzanne " , another twit . " Donald " aspires to be a French Heathcliffe and I waited in vain for the source of his mystery . What deep dark secret was he hiding behind that forehead ? Was he in love with the father 's mistress ? Why did he jerk Suzanne 's hair when she plotted to bring the disparate parts of this turkey together on the country estate ? Or perhaps he had simply had enough of her obnoxious acting.<br /><br />The film would have been charming with Guiness and the " older woman " reminiscing and seeing Paris together . THAT would have been a great story ! Two lovely experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II . Why did n't somebody come up with that ? I suggest watching Alec Guiness in " The Card " , a little known but worthwhile film .
0 Uta Hagen 's " Respect for Acting " is the standard textbook in many college theater courses . In the book , Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor : the Presentational approach , and the Representational approach . In the Presentational approach , the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible , by introducing emotional elements from the actor 's own life . In the Representational approach , the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion , through a high degree of control of movement and sound.<br /><br />The Representational approach to acting was still partially in vogue when this Hamlet was made . British theater has a long history of this style of acting , and Olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the Representational school.<br /><br />Time has not been kind to this school of acting , or to this movie . Nearly every working actor today uses a Presentational approach . To the modern eye , Olivier 's highly enunciated , stylized delivery is stodgy , stiff and stilted . Instead of creating an internally conflicted Hamlet , Olivier made a declaiming , self - important bullhorn out of the melancholy Dane -- an acting style that would have carried well to the backs of the larger London theaters , but is far too starchy to carry off a modern Hamlet.<br /><br />And so the movie creaks along ungainfully today . Olivier 's tendency to e - nun - ci - ate makes some of Hamlet 's lines unintentionally funny : " In - stead , you must ac - quire and be - get a tem - purr - ance that may give it ... Smooth - ness ! " Instead of crying at meeting his father 's ghost ( as any proper actor could ) , bright fill lights in Olivier 's pupils give us that impression.<br /><br />Eileen Herlie is the only other actor of note in this Hamlet , putting in a good essay at the Queen , despite the painfully obvious age differences ( he was 41 ; she was 26 ) . The other actors in this movie have no chance to get anything else of significance done , given Olivier 's tendency to want to keep ! the camera ! on him ! at all ! times ! < br /><br />Sixty years later , you feel the insecurity of the Shakespearean stage actor who lacked the confidence to portray a breakable , flawed Hamlet , and instead elected to portray a sort of Elizabethan bullhorn . Final analysis : " I would have such a fellow whipped for o'er - doing Termagant ; it out - herods Herod : pray you , avoid it . "
0 Amelia and Michael are a married couple that are cheating on each other . Amelia has a long - time lover in the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute that does n't satisfy him . The two smolder with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the end.<br /><br />There 's not a whole lot to this particular short . The direction is straight - forward and dramatic , which is good , the acting is sincere , but the story leaves a little bit to be desired . Why , exactly , do we care about these two people ? It 's a little hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that it 's much more pared down and does n't search for meaning in it ( a welcoming change of pace if anything).<br /><br />I do n't know , it 's possible I do n't connect to these stories because I 've never experienced them . But I have noticed that the blocking in these narratives are typically the same , i.e. , a couple talking together while avoiding eye - contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines , etc . The nice things about short films is that they provide a bit more room for trying something different , and I 'd like to see a different take.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
0 MY BROTHER TOM < br /><br />Aspect ratio : 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format : Dolby Digital < br /><br />Following an episode of sexual abuse at the hands of a trusted neighbor , young Jessica ( Jenna Harrison ) forms a relationship with a strange boy ( Ben Whishaw ) she meets in the woods . Unfortunately , Whishaw has secrets of his own , no less troubling and far more dangerous ... <br /><br />Dour drama , sparked by brave performances by Harrison and Whishaw , in which two kindred spirits immerse themselves in a mutual love of nature after being traumatized by their experiences in the ' real world ' . Unfortunately , their friendship unravels as harsh reality begins to intrude , leading to an inevitable tragedy . Directed by Dom Rotheroe and photographed in digital video format , the movie looks ragged in places ( too many awkward close - ups and sloppy hand - held camera moves ) and takes a while to find its feet , but the dramatic pay - off is quietly rewarding .
0 Cheap and manipulative . This film has no heart.<br /><br />It 's also got dire dialogue , unconvincing characters and a preposterous , or rather non - existent , story . It just lurches from bad to worse in a cynical effort to wrench some kind of emotion from an insincere and unengaging hysterion - afest!<br /><br />And the HEDGEHOG!!!!How many cheap shots can a film take ? The hedgehog , by the way , gave the most convincing and watchable performance in this ninety - minute cringe - athon.<br /><br />If you have considered watching this film , do n't . I 'm sorry but I can not find a single redeeming feature to this movie . It scores a big , fat ZERO with me . Strictly for sub - Dogma knicker - wetters . Yawneroony!<br /><br />Still , if you liked Dancing In The Dark ... <br /><br / >
0 If utterly facile , regressive , self - indulgent , anti - establishment , anti - civilisation juvenilia appeals to you , then this is the ideal film . Very poorly scripted , with often inaudible dialogue and infuriatingly tiresome hand - held camera throughout , this is a film that presents the world in appealingly simplistic , Manichean terms : all adults ( especially teachers , parents , priests and doctors ) are insensitive and bumbling at best , and predatory monsters at worst . The only escape from the horrors of civilisation as a whole is plenty of primal screaming ( yawn ) and infantile regression ( literally ) in a primitive cave - like space in the woods , with utopia taking the form of a rave party - again , in the woods ( naturally ... ) . Displays all the weaknesses of a first film , and plenty more besides .
0 One of the most peculiar oft - used romance movie plots is this one : A seriously messed - up man falls in love with a terminally ill woman , who turns his life around before dying . Occasionally this story is done well and realistically ( as in " The Theory of Flight " , an excellent weepie ) , but more frequently it 's done like it is here , where as usual the heroine dies of " Old Movie Disease " . You know , the terminal illness that has no symptoms but one fainting spell and a need to lie down as you 're telling your lover goodbye forever ; and your looks are n't affected one bit ( and since this is the 70 's , neither is your sex life ) . This is one of the worst versions made of that particular story , where a very silly script puts two incompatible and unbelievable characters together , and they 're played by actors who are completely at sea.<br /><br />This has got to be the worst performance of Al Pacino 's career , and I say that after having seen " The Devil 's Advocate " only two days ago ! He plays a control - freak , emotionally constipated race - car driver , and plays an unlikeable character lifelessly . He seems to constantly be asking himself why he 's staying around the grating Marthe Keller ( so does the audience ) , and spends most of the movie just ... standing there , usually with his mouth hanging open . The only time he shows any sign of life is towards the end , where his character proves that he 's changed from uptight to liberated by doing a hilariously bad Mae West imitation . Hey , it * was * the seventies!<br /><br />Marthe Keller is equally terrible as the dying love interest ; her character was conceived as bold and free and touching and uninhibited and full of life even though dying , and was probably meant to be played with an actress with the sensitivity of , say , Vanessa Redgrave or Julie Christie . Instead , they got the expressionless face and heavy German accent of Ms. Keller , who comes across as more of a scary Teutonic stereotype ( " You VILL eat ze omelet ! " ) than anything like lovable . She 's supposed to be reforming Pacino and filling him with courage and spirit and all that , but it does n't work that way , it 's more like she 's harping on his faults in the most obnoxious possible fashion . This makes for one of the least convincing romances in movie history , where you ca n't believe she 'd be with someone she finds so worthless , and you ca n't believe he 's with someone who gets on his nerves that much.<br /><br />Some bad - movie fans call this a cult classic , mostly because of Pacino 's silly " liberating " Mae West imitation . The scene is a scream , especially in context , but not worth sitting through the rest of the film for . No , only see the film if you 're a serious bad - movie aficionado who is especially interested in studying Extreme Lack of Chemistry between leading actors , or Very Bad Casting ( not only are the leads terrible , but Pacino 's other girlfriend is played by an actress who looks and sounds just likes Keller with shorter hair , I got them totally confused ) . This is n't one of those laugh - a - minute bad movies like " The Conqueror " , it 's just a really , really bad movie.<br /><br / >
0 I made a special effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the outcome . On paper , the script seems hopeful , and the choice of actors leaves one with hopes - I liked Pacino in Scent of a Woman and have seen Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French and other films of the 70s/80s . But I had forgotten how important a part dialogues can play in a film , and in this film they are absolute ..... trash ! The filming locations were also attractive but the hopeless , pretentious and forced dialogues pulled the whole thing down to sub zero level . In addition to that , I am pretty allergic to the world of motor racing and find no interest in this sport . Even the inelegant dialogues in " Love Story " were better than the ones in this film ( and that 's saying something ! ! ) . I was really expecting better from this film and was very disappointed to have been let down so much .
0 The entire thing is very beautiful to look at .. the European location shooting was a good idea . The lead actors are attractive . The score is servicable.<br /><br />BUT THEN THEY SPOKE ! And the non - plot developed ! And it was all downhill from there . Pacino is sleepwalking and Keller keeps talking about how bored she is .. hello , dear , you 're not alone . When he does a Mae West imitation , you might have to hide your face , its that painful to watch.<br /><br />I ca n't imagine how either actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved with this , or a better question , why it ended up stinking so bad?<br /><br />Since death is represented in almost every scene , one way or another , maybe you 're supposed to have low enjoyment here . Maybe its supposed to feel as empty and cold as death . But I still ca n't recommend it .
0 From beginning to end , this is the most emotionally overwrought movie about NOTHING I have ever seen . The characterizations and interactions between the title character and Marthe Kller 's character are pure torture . The racetrack as metaphor gimmick is so overplayed that it borders on cliche , yet director Pollack treats every hairpin turn as if it were something profoundly important.<br /><br />Maybe there 's some value for a MSFT3000 re - playing of some of the scenes , such as Pacino getting in touch with his inner female , for goof value . But , even such accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey .
0 I really must watch a good movie soon , because it seems every other entry or so is something that I despise . However my history speaks , I must not tell a lie . Bobby Deerfield and everything about it sucks big green banana peels . I never thought that I would see a film thud as thunderously as this one did . Al Pacino is n't acting in this film : he 's posing . There are many , many scenes of his character , who is a race car driver , just staring at the camera . He 's perfectly awful . Marthe Keller is just as bad . These two are supposed to be in a love affair , and there is simply no chemistry whatsoever . Sydney Pollack directed this film ? There 's no trace of the genius behind Tootsie here . Is this the same man I cheered for in Eyes Wide Shut ? I can hardly believe it . Save yourself a horrible movie experience . Run , do n't walk , away from Bobby Deerfield .
0 Just emailed a friend who 's in film school about this flick . Something to avoid when making a film - characters blabbering senseless , overwrought , convoluted monologues on screen that are ultimately trite and unconvincing . If the film is an attempt at social realism , these verbal barrages are so over - the - top that they actually draw attention to the film constructed as film and effectively neutralize that intent . Is it the acting , or the script that is bad , or both?<br /><br />The protagonist is also highly unbelievable for social realism - ravenously consuming canonical English literature and the bible while high or hungover and able to produce such profoundly sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated ? And how is such an unattractive , unwashed and verbally noxious character able to bed most of the women he meets within minutes of encountering them ? ( I had to applaud when one chick finally threw him out onto the street , despite his whining and self - pitying banter).<br /><br />The viewer encounters pretentious references to Ancient Greek literature , Nostradamus and the Book of Revelations . The impending doom of mankind , in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in spooky biblical fashion , is presented to a character who is oh - so - cleverly exposed in his role as a guardian of empty space . < br /><br />This flick is over - scripted and over the top - a melodrama clumsily infused with pedestrian " philosophy " about the meaning of mankind , life , etc . It is trite , overwrought and tedious.<br /><br />There are some very fine English films available with content similar to this film . " Nil by Mouth " is an excellent , far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu . Ditto for " In the Warzone . " And although the comparison is not even warranted , check out anything by Peter Greenaway , who far more deftly handles dialogue , wit and absurd characters and situations .
0 Johnny and Jeremy are vampires of sorts . Minus the fangs , of course . They 're dark , bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery . Through their charms ( namely a sharp tongue and a fat wallet , respectively ) they seduce desperate souls , who they proceed to torment and victimize . That 's more or less the basis of this black comedy , as I understand it.<br /><br />It 's not a blend of black humor that I can easily subscribe to , partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy , main character . I did enjoy , however , the sound and the melody of the rapid - fire ( and supposedly very witty ) remarks . I was very impressed by the cast 's strong acting , particularly David Thelis 's ; only the character of Jeremy seemed too bi - dimensional . The photography and the music , both dramatic and somber , work very well together . < br /><br />What really turns me off about " Naked " ( and the main reason I 'd never recommend it to anyone ) is the way it repeatedly seems to present misogyny as a valid way to vent one 's angst . In other words , in a world that sucks so bad , what difference does it make if one inflicts some pain on girls , right ? To suggest ( as some have on this website ) that Johnny is not so unkind a person because he 's not as rough on girls as Jeremy , seems completely absurd to me . They 're both terrible , nasty people . And they 're particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance . One could argue that Johnny eventually gets what he deserves , as if his bad karma suddenly swung straight back and bit him in the ass . But still , his and Jeremy 's sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter . And I could be wrong , but I 'm guessing that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the film darkly comical .
0 Had the original casting idea been kept ( hunting Rutger , not Ice - T ) , this movie might have worked . Sadly , racism had to come into the picture ( literally ) and mess it up . The predominantly black production staff could n't allow the antagonist be black , so they swapped Rutger 's and Ice - T 's roles . This was only the start of the downward spiral of this film . Ernest Dickerson 's news - room approach to ' directing ' only verified that this was another affirmative - action job assignment . Master shot , close up , close up . Gads , ' Who 's Line Is It Anyway ' even uses more creative camera work . Eric 's rewrite of ' The Most Dangerous Game ' is at least an attempt at modernizing the classic tale , but fails to give us any motivations for why the characters are doing this . We are never given the reasons , other than " no one will miss these people " , why the leader ( re - written as Rutger ) does these things . Aside from a heart - felt performance by John McGinley , and a fair job by Charles Dutton , do not bother with this one . One small bit of trivia , there was a real drunk - driving accident during filming that injured F.Murray Abraham , and resulted in the death of the intoxicated young driver that caused the accident .
0 This movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite . Not that I expect a great deal of plausibility in movies , but you 'd think that even the homeless and urban - dwelling Jack Mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide . And upon reaching the hunting grounds , poor Ice - T plays his part as if he is actually going to lead these men through woods he 's never seen before.<br /><br />And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns back in Seattle?<br /><br />I'm assuming this movie was based on Richard Connell 's short story " The Most Dangerous Game . " A few years ago I showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after they read the story . I reedited the movie , cutting out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity . It ended up being 43 minutes long .
0 Ice - T stars as Mason a homeless African - American who finds himself hunted by wealthy hunters ( Rutger Hauer , Gary Busey , Charles S. Dutton , F.Murray Abraham , William McNamara and John C. McGinley ) however Mason proves to be much harder prey then the usual targets in this ridiculous and slow paced actioner which takes too long setting up actionscenes and then totally botching them .
0 This movie was horrible . I swear they did n't even write a script they just kinda winged it through out the whole movie . Ice - T was annoying as hell . * SPOILERS Phht more like reasons not to watch it * They sit down and eat breakfast for 20 minutes . he coulda been long gone . The ground was hard it would of been close to impossible to to track him with out dogs . And when ICE - T is on that Hill and uses that Spaz-15 Assault SHOTGUN like its a sniper rifle ( and then cuts down a tree with eight shells ? ? It would take 1000 's of shells to cut down a tree that size . ) Shotguns and hand guns are considered to be inaccurate at 100yards . And they even saw the reflection . What reflected the light ? ? I did n't see a scope on that thing . Also when he got shot in the gut and kept going , that was retarded he would of bled to death right there . PlusThe ending where he stuffs a rock or a cigarette in the guys barrel . It would n't blow up and kill him . The bullet would still fire kill Ice T but mess up the barrel .
0 SPOILERS HEREIN < br /><br />My High School did all they could to try and motivate us for exams . But the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker , who was none other than Australian Kickboxing 's favorite son , Stan " The Man " Longinidis . The first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone , because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him . Now , his speech was full of the usual " if you fail to prepare , then prepare to fail " stuff , but there were various instances where I got really worked up . The guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no - one else . He was offered many deals in the past to give up kick - boxing , but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming Australia 's greatest kick - boxer . He said that he was n't a sell - out , he was happy and a retiree , he was n't ever involved in any other activity other than Kickboxing ¬Ö  then he plugged his film . Yes , you heard right , he PLUGGED his new FILM . As he talked about it , he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it , and then he showed this shitty 4 minute clip of this vile film called " Trojan Warrior " . ( This all being before he was defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his final career fight ( for now))<br /><br />Stan plays Ajax , a kick - boxing ex - special forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of Melbourne . Ajax 's cousin , Theo ( Arthur Angel ) recently sold out ( well , at least Stan did n't stray too far away from EVERYTHING ) to the feds , and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime . Ajax and Theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations , from fighting in a Kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party . It 's all pretty ridiculous , but if Silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here , this man should never be handed a camera again . < br /><br />I'll admit , I was actually pumped to see this . I love action films , even if they 're corny , and especially if it 's set in my own backyard . But what I was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word " go " , and continued to do so after the words " for the love of God please make it stop ! " , subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open , characters were just thrown in for absolutely NO reason whatsoever , and the most over - choreographed fight scenes that did n't even remotely reflect Stan 's actual talent in Kickboxing . The cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone REMOTELY famous ( Dermot Brereton , Mark " Chopper " Read and Greg Matthews ) . The whole time you 're sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background . Too bad the movie relies heavily on split - second appearances by former celebrities . Remember those plot - holes I told you about ? Ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up , wrongly accused for murdering his wife . Now , we hear that Ajax was in special forces via ONE single sentence in the WHOLE film , and then leave it for buggery . This is followed by another SINGLE sentence which persuades Ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up . Then , get this , at the end , it is revealed to Ajax that his wife is n't actually dead , but was sold into prostitution . Do we see her ? No . Does Ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this ? No . Now THAT 's a marriage ! < br /><br />Amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap , some website described this film as " ¬Ö a cross between Jackie Chan & Guy Ritchie ¬Ö " . Has this man ever sat down and watched a Jackie Chan film ? ! Chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than Stan did doing ¬Ö , well , ANYTHING ! And Guy Ritchie is the crime - film Messiah , and you 're comparing him to Salik Silverstein ! ? This film is more like a mix between " Pizza " and " Enter The Ninja " . < br /><br />Now , where do you thing the whole " Trojan Warrior " title comes from ? Ajax 's fierce fighting skills like that of an Ancient Greek Warrior ? No . The gangsters ' unification to find Theo , like that of the Trojan Empire ? No . It 's because ¬Ö  wait for it ¬Ö  Theo carries a condom around with him . Yes , that right , because THEO is ALWAYS PREPARED with a Trojan BRAND RUBBER in his pocket , he is a Trojan WARRIOR ! < br /><br />I had the displeasure of seeing " Trojan Warrior " on DVD , as well as it 's " special " features : < br /><br />¬ï Video clip of " Chop Chop " , a rap song by Mark " Chopper " Read : Chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that ANYONE can rap . The funny thing was Chopper just rapped for 30 seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from Doncaster , using such words as " dis " and " dope " etc in their Australian accents . Face it people , rap was developed in the States , LEAVE IT THERE ! The clip looked like something a Channel 31 cameraman on ecstasy put together . < br /><br />¬ï Bloopers : There was no real difference between these and the actual film . < br /><br />¬ï Stan " The Man " Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette : This was n't too bad , considering it was just 6 or 7 different fights shown from different angles ( I think I saw Dennis Alexio fall over about 15 times in that 3 minute montage).<br /><br />I do n't want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film , but ... oh wait , I just did . My advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of " Trojan Warrior " , tape them together , and use it for a paperweight , because this movie is just that damn bad .
0 After watching about half of this movie I noticed something peculiar ... I found myself constantly switching through tv - channels to see what else is on - not exactly a good movie trait.<br /><br />This movie is listed as being in a number of genres , and I must say it mostly failed misserably in every one of them . 80 % through the movie I switched over to watch an old rerun instead . Bottom line - the whole movie felt as if the ones making it did n't exactly know what to make and ended up in a concoction with no discernable taste .
0 Well our standards have gone into the toilet . The direction was poor , the acting was mediocre and the writing was amateurish . And those are the good points . Hopefully there wo n't be a sequel . Otherwise , I might have to leave the country .
0 The cover art ( which features a man holding a scary pellet gun ) would make it seem as if it 's a martial arts film . ( Hardly.)<br /><br />I find it interesting that the film 's real title is Trojan Warrior . ( Trojan is a brand of condoms in the US ) This movie is loaded with homoeroticism . If you like that stuff , then this film is n't that bad really . However , consider these points:<br /><br />There are numerous close - ups of actors ' groins & butts , ( One scene even features every actor with an erection bulging in his pants . ) the film is also bathed in gaudy colors like lime , peach , and red . From a cinematographer 's standpoint , this movie 's a drag queen ! Several scenes feature characters standing EXTREMELY close to one another , occasionally touching as they converse . Also , the cousin of the hero likes women , and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him . Is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey ? < br /><br />Shall I go into the fight scenes ? ( Yes , someone 's private parts get grabbed in one fight . ) The martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative . No fancy stuff here , just your standard moves you 'd see in an old Chuck Norris flick . There 's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever LOW - speed chase put on film .
0 At least the seats in the theater were comfortable and I ate the pop corn as loud as possible to drown out the inferior dialogue . This is absolutely not a girls film . Any blokes who like it , are the ones us ladies can be sure to stay far away from . Dumb story , mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap looking film . I 've seen many , many movies but this one is the new winner in the bad category . If you do happen to see it , the one thing you 'll look forward to is the ending . So you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can .
0 I mean really . This is not going to help the Australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind . Okay , if you 're a stoner and have nothing better to do , then maybe . I think film - makers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have , and this is not the vehicle for it . Come on now , this film is just tacky .
0 In the 60 's , having as the background the rehearsal and recording of " Sympathy for the Devil " in the classic album " Beggar 's Banquet " by the revolutionary bad boy Rolling Stones ¬ñ Mick Jagger , Keith Richards , Charlie Watts , Bill Wyman and Brian Jones ¬ñ plus Marianne Faithful , Godard discloses other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements ¬ñ the Black Power through the Black Panthers , the feminism , the communism , the fascism - entwined with the reading of a cheap pulp political novel divided in the chapters : " The Stones Rolling ; " Outside Black Novel " ; " Sight and Sound " ; " All About Eve " ; " The Heart of Occident " ; " Inside Black Syntax " ; and , " Under the Stones the Beach".<br /><br />"Sympathy for the Devil " is another pretentious and boring mess of the uneven director Jean - Luc Godard . The narrative and the footages are awful , but fortunately I love the Stones and " Sympathy for the Devil " and it is nice to see them in the beginning of their careers ; otherwise this documentary would be unbearable . My vote is three.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Sympathy for the Devil "
0 The film - school intellects can drool all they want about the important ( imagined ) meaning of this film , but it 's just that : intellectual drool . This film is creatively bankrupt , and some mistake it 's endless self - indulgent wanking as substance . Yeah . < br /><br />Obviously Godard was n't a Stones fan . Too bad , because this could have been great . He 's capturing the birth of this timeless song and he chooses instead to cover the music with some guy reading out of a True Detective mag or some such crap . < br /><br />Then there 's the endless shots of what looks like 60 's librarians spray - painting words on people 's cars . And then there 's the seemingly neverending " interview " where the actress was brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all the really deep and intellectual questions . There 's some dude in a purple suit is reading more crap from a book , which goes on for , oh , only about 20 minutes . And black panthers or something in a junkyard.<br /><br />It almost sounds intriguing ? Well , it 's not.<br /><br />But for unwashed film - school hipsters who do n't care squat about the lost opportunities of having full access to the Stones bringing Sympathy for the Devil into the world and would rather hear some English guy reading instead whilst gazing at the covers of nudie mag 's , this film 's a real winner!<br /><br />More accurately ... maybe Godard just blows .
0 Jean Luc Godard 's Marxist polemic is as close to unwatchable a film as you 're likely to see from an internationally respected filmmaker . Bits of political theater , mind - numbingly boring and interminable , are interspersed with the making of " Sympathy for the Devil " , featuring the Rolling Stones in the studio.<br /><br />The process of the song 's development , from Mick Jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar , to the backing vocals being recorded towards the end , is fascinating , and it 's worth renting this film just to see the bits with the Stones . Almost half the movie is devoted to this , so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops , you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch the Stones put a song together.<br /><br />When I had this on laserdisc , I valiantly attempted to watch it all , but I do n't see how anyone could get through it . I finally gave up and just chapter - skipped my way to the Stones segments .
0 Firstly , this is a very dated film , non - focused in its exposition of the left wing political revolution . Honestly , when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to cease to be intellectual ( which in itself is quite nonsensical , since the answer was arrived at by precisely being intellectual ) it reduces me to despair ; as if we all should return to being apes in the name of equality - it is simply ridiculous . Our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities , but this does not mean we should not educate ourselves to the highest possible degree . But no doubt this non - educational message ties in with Godard 's use of rock music ; hence The Rolling Stones.<br /><br />The song ' Sympathy for the Devil ' , whose creation we witness , and from which the film takes its name , is in fact nothing special . The chord sequence , which is not especially original , was used to much better effect in Led Zeppelin 's ' Thankyou'(Led Zeppelin II ) . Apart form that , ' Sir ' Mick Jagger declaims in his usually nebulous manner ( rather like Bob Dylan)- notice how the first melodic phrase is unimaginatively repeated over again to form the verse.<br /><br />Besides the fact that the Black Panthers depicted in this film , do n't seem to know what they are fighting for , the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography ; a message that in fact undermines the sexual ' liberation ' of the 1960s and today ( indeed , a message that would belie the behaviour of The Rolling Stones around the time the film was made).<br /><br />No wonder , the DVD came free with The Sunday Times ! For a truly profound historical exposition of left - wing sympathy , listen to Luigi Nono 's masterpiece , ' Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore ' .
0 Picked this up for 50 cents at the flea market , was pretty excited.<br /><br />I found it fascinating for about 15 min , then just repetitive and dull.<br /><br />It is neat seeing Mick and the gang in their prime , i wish there was not so much over dubbing of dialog so I could hear what there are saying and playing.<br /><br />The skits are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple , sort of poorly written Monty Python on acid . I spent more time looking at the late 60 's England back drops rather then what was actually happening in the silly skits.<br /><br />This movie is a good reminder that times really change , and what was important quickly becomes just plain silly . Good song , but it has now been played to death by this DVD .
0 It utterly defeats me why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an ' intellectual ' polemicist . It 's hard to credit that Godard actually believed all that Marxist and Maoist kant . Anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those ' isms ' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as Godard was making his films supporting them . As a filmmaker , ask yourself : would you have boring voice - overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience , and then , when you could n't think of anything else to do , layer another voice - over to the first voice - over , which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case ? Brilliant , Jean - Luc ! As for Godard insisting on making a film with the Rolling Stones : of course he did ; would n't you ? It was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place : the genius of the Stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera . The bookshop scene was n't worthy of even the worst fringe theatre , and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it - as could be readily seen . Copping - out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film - making is no more than a safe get - out to offer those who clearly see Godard 's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience . Ironic that Godard 's one - time great friend , Truffaut , with Nuit Americain , made the best film about film - making ever , and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris ! Incidentally , Godard did n't choose the Stones ' track of Sympathy With the Devil . It just happened to be the track they were working on when the ' film ' started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios .
0 As a casual listener of the Rolling Stones , I thought this might be interesting . Not so , as this film is very ' of its age ' , in the 1960 's . To me ( someone born in the 1980 's ) this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap , but I am sure this film was not made for me , but people who were active during th ' 60 's . I expected drugs galore with th Stones , I was disappointed , it actually showed real life , hard work in the studio , So much so I felt as if I was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film . I have not seen any of the directors other films , but I suspect they follow a similar style of directing , sort of ' amatuerish ' which gave a feeling like the TV show Eurotrash , badly directed , tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value . My only good opinion of this is that I did n't waste money on it , it came free with a Sunday paper .
0 It was difficult to sit through this horrible heretical adaptation of Sherlock Holmes . Apparently Matt Frewer was cast because he is tall and skinny . His skull - like face made for a good zombie in the Dawn of the Dead remake , but as Sherlock Holmes he looks like a scarecrow . Not only does Frewer have a lanky lackadaisical walk that is hard to watch , but he looks uncomfortable in the stereotypical Holmes overcoats that he is wearing . Not only that , but while the coat is gray twill they apparently could not find a matching cap . So his cap is black and it looks shiny as if it were made of polyester . Whatever the cap was made of , it looked very new and artificial . Jeremy Brett occasionally wore those traditional outfits , but Brett did not have to dress - up like Sherlock Holmes in order to look the part . Frewer on the other hand is painful to watch . Even in the full " Holmes " outfit , he does not carry himself like Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Frewer 's cadaverous face grinning all the time as he spouts on and on in a very bad " Upper - Crust " British accent is painful to see and listen to . To say that Frewer is overacting is an understatement . After he finishes each sentence with some kind of nasal hum , he then sneers as if that were some kind of British trait . When I started watching this I thought it might be a comedy featuring Wishbone , the Jack Russell Terrier . I thought Frewer had been cast as some kind of foil for Wishbone . But sadly , there is no dog in this movie except for Frewer . Wishbone would have made this movie a lot better.<br /><br />Not only does Frewer 's version of Sherlock Holmes never stop talking ( in that awfully artificial British nasal accent ) , but he is much to friendly and kind . Frewer is always smiling at the witnesses he talks to , and he is so polite and courteous that he could be teaching at a Charm School instead of being a Sleuth . Perhaps since this is a Hallmark Channel production , they are trying to make a children 's version of Sherlock Holmes ( Wishbone was better at that , too ) that was kindler and gentler . Whatever the point of Frewer 's interpretation of Sherlock Holmes , it is flatter than a pancake , and easily the worst version of Sherlock Holmes that I have ever seen ( including the previous worst , by Charlton Heston).<br /><br />Overall , the tone of this film is awful . It reminded me of a typical episode of Barnaby Jones or Murder She Wrote or Diagnosis Murder . All the suspects over - acted suspiciously and glared at the victims before they were killed . Holmes and Watson are explaining every clue to each other during the entire movie . Even on Murder She Wrote there is less exposition.<br /><br />This Sherlock Holmes does not even compare very well to Jim Rockford of the Rockford Files and it is miles below Columbo . The awful dialog is probably the fault of the writer . It is obvious that who ever wrote this script has very little familiarity with Sherlock Holmes , especially the BBC version with Jeremy Brett . This movie has all of the atmosphere of an episode of Little House on the Prairie . The fact that the actors seem to be smirking when they enunciate their lines in their fake accents does not help.<br /><br />The only minor bright spot is Ken Walsh who plays Doctor Watson with some dignity . Walsh does not ham it up compared to Frewer , and when he is often interviewing witnesses , his demeanor and conversational style are much more natural and credible . Unfortunately , the rest of the cast is amateurish , and the visual clues they give by glaring and making faces at each other ( to show they are suspicious ) is something that I had not seen in any modern movie .
0 Dan Duryea , a perfectly decent B - movie actor who made lots of lookalike noirs in the 1940s , ca n't do much with this one : young man is accused of murdering an unhappily married singer ; when he 's sentenced to die , his wife decides to solve the case herself with help from the dead woman 's husband . After a dazzling opening shot , flick quickly settles into B - movie formula . It certainly looks good , but the twist finish is colorlessly handled and the cast ( including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford ) is just a bit stiff . Based on a Cornell Woolrich novel , and passable for a single viewing . < br /><br / > * * from * * * *
0 " Black Angel " is minor whodunit , with June Vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he is found guilty of killing an old acquaintance . Dan Duryea ( the husband of the murdered woman ) decides to help Vincent find the real culprit . Peter Lorre has one thankless role as a suspect . This film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer , never achieving anything special . It is pleasant enough but then , at some point , it stops making sense and the solution to the mystery provokes one of those big " give me a break " reactions . That ending alone could have sank the film completely , but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either . Vincent is a wimpy heroine and Duryea was never very good at playing good guys . I love film noirs , but this one was a real disappointment .
0 A mercilessly corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant the character of Sheriff Bart from Mel Brooks ' Blazing Saddles into his own weekly sitcom , this is really as bad as some people say it is!<br /><br />The laugh - track only serves to remind the unamused viewer what all in this supposed comedy is intended to be a joke and just how desperate for laughs it really is!<br /><br />However , it is somewhat interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. trying his best to impersonate Cleavon Little . His embarrassment shows through in every scene . He was much funnier in the HBO movie El Diablo than he was here in this slab of cheese!<br /><br />Truly the best and funniest thing about Black Bart is the name of his horse !
0 Watching this was like getting a large mackerel slapped in your face over and over again . Even when you thought , " That mackerel surely ca n't be coming around again , " * slap * there it was . I 'm not sure what they were thinking . This is the sort of pilot I watched and wondered , " Did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series ? " Not only black stereotypes but Swedish and Indian ones as well . And while " Blazing Saddles " made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and uncomfortableness , these stereotypes were just downright offensive . There was no plot line , the ending was slapped on , and the jokes are n't . Still , if you are a student of comedy , watch this pilot to see what you should n't do .
0 To review this movie , I without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in Tarantino 's " Pulp Fiction " ( 1994 ) when Jules and Vincent are talking about Mia Wallace and what she does for a living . Jules tells Vincent that the " Only thing she did worthwhile was pilot " . Vincent asks " What the hell is a pilot ? " and Jules goes into a very well description of what a TV pilot is : " Well , the way they make shows is , they make one show . That show 's called a ' pilot ' . Then they show that show to the people who make shows , and on the strength of that one show they decide if they 're going to make more shows . Some pilots get picked and become television programs . Some do n't , become nothing . She starred in one of the ones that became nothing . " Now to stretch on what Jules was talking about , there are BILLIONS of television shows / pilots that were never aired because they simply were not ... well , good . Probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is " W*A*L*T*E*R " , a spin - off to " M*A*S*H " with Gary " Radar " Burghoff as the lead . Hmmm , would somebody really want to be watching Radar for a half - hour trying to solve crimes ? Hence , the show was never picked up . What many people do n't know ( or what they thought they knew ) is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air , for they are made strictly for the Television networks for them to decide . Some have made they 're way past and got onto the air ( The pilot for the animated series " American Dad " comes to mind , as the show 's serial itself did n't begin until nearly four months later . However , there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air , and this here is why.<br /><br />"Black Bart " , a supposed tie - in with the Mel Brooks comedy classic , " Blazing Saddles " , is a stale and bland " sitcom " with little heart and no soul . " Saddles " was a controversial comedy , nevertheless , with it 's racist humor and vulgar comedy , which comes to mind " what idiot decided this would make a great television show FOR PRIME TIME TV ? ! ? " I say " supposed " , because none of the memorable characters from the movie , aside from Bart , on in this mess of a TV show . Mel Brooks was n't even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line ( In a related story , I recently found out about an unaired TV pilot for a series based on the movie " Clerks . " that Kevin Smith was no involved in .... you see what happens?!?).<br /><br />Set somewhere around the same time as the movie ( or at all ) , the story circles around the only Black sheriff in the wild west , named appropriately ' Black ' Bart , who is this time played by future Academy Award winner Louis Gossett Jr. , obviously before his stint in " real " acting , whereas in this he is playing a " G - rated " Richard Pryor . Most of the other characters are carbon ( if not , really bad ) copies of the characters in the movie : Jim , The Waco Kid is replaced by a similar looking character named Reb Jordan , a former Confederate soldier who is quick with the gun . Lilian Von Schtupp is now Belle Buzzer , a more of a ripoff of the character being that she 's a show dancer and a German with a Marlene Dietrich - type accent and personality . While that 's pretty much the end in similarities , The lead " bad guy " in the story is Fern Malaga , played by Noble Willingham , who I assumed would 've been Hedley Lamar if Warner Bros. secured the rights to the name ( See trivia for " Blazing Saddles " ) and his son Curley ... I dunno , Taggart I suppose ? The story is a poor excuse for a sitcom , much less a pilot . Bart deals with the mayor 's drunk son and he 's out - of - control behavior which has caused the town to spin . Really , it 's a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the " series " and does n't focus on the variety and context that would make this an " alright " show . I ca n't really call it a sitcom ( and even if I wanted to ) and that 's primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at Warner Bros. Studios and later added a laugh track , so the show is set up almost exactly like " M*A*S*H " ( complete with a bland and dull " laughing " that is identical to the series ) . The acting is so - so , but there 's one part that always make me laugh , and that 's when the actor playing Reb Jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue . HA ! The script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie ( Surprisingly , they use the word " N***er " numerous amount of times through a 22-minute episode , rather touchy for it 's time period and even for today ) and it gets repetitive.<br /><br />If you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of sssss ... surly interesting novelty item , watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots ( It 's on the collector 's edition of " Blazing Saddles " , God knows why ) . There , yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie - in pilots never air .
0 This very unfunny failed TV Pilot can be found as an extra on the 30th Annivesery DVD Special Edition " Blazing Saddles " . Imagine the movie without the satire , humor , or writing skills . But with all the trappings of a typical lame ' 70 's sit - com show complete with obtrusive laugh track and you 'll still have no clue how sheer putrid this failed show was . What the hell was Lou Gossett Jr. thinking when he signed onto this disaster ? ? This was possibly the worst thing he 's been in ( and yes I 'm including the first " Punisher " movie and " Iron Eagles 3 " . Steve Landesberg , I understand as he ca n't say no to crap.<br /><br />My Grade : F
0 I just watched the 30th Anniversary edition of Blazing Saddles , one of my all time Favorites ! ! The TV Pilot for Black Bart stunk . The plot was non - existent and the acting was not good . It was obviously an attempt to profit off of the success of Blazing Saddles and there have been TV shows that have succeeded in doing take - offs of big movies , but this one would never have worked . Considering that for so many years TV would not even play the farting noises when they televised the movie , it is inconceivable that they thought they could put a show on TV with the " N " word thrown around . On the other hand , I enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces ! ! ! There were quite a few actors / actresses that I recognized from other shows over the years . I had to write down all the names and do a few searches . That was fun . I was arguing with my mother if Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash . I won ! :)
0 This was on the 30th Anniversary DVD for Blazing Saddles , itself brilliant , but not this . Nowhere did I see Mel Brook 's name on here and I can guess why , he 's got a lot more sense to not be associated with this pilot . My gawd , who would find this funny . Sure there may be a race issue but for me it just was n't funny , well cause it 's simply not funny . It 's like the writers did n't even try to be funny , just to cash in on being tied with Blazing Saddles . Did they expect this show to go for several seasons when they made this pilot ? Flat out , they did n't care . It was a quick cash cow which thank god did n't cash out . I guess it 's useful for historical purposes only , or only to demonstrate how stupid and unimaginative Hollywood writers can be .
0 " Dutch Schultz " , AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer , was a real person and his rather nasty life is fairly well documented . This movie which purports to depict his life should have used a fictional character , because the overdramatized events are too strong a departure from the facts and the chronology . Not only that , it ignores some interesting details which other versions have included such as the public relations fiasco in upstate N.Y. and his religious conversion . It is true that he was executed by Luciano , Lansky , et . al . but that 's as far as it goes . The exploding plate scene which represents Luciano carrying out the execution of Bo Weinberg in his own home , assisted by his own mother is rediculous . Also , there is the scene in which Dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to Legs Diamond . It just does n't work . The character of Mrs. Fleggenheimer does n't work either . This movie does not need a doting Jewish mother for comic relief . The lame representation of Legs Diamond was humorous enough . I 'm sure the man is turning in his grave . And , by the way , Dutch did in fact personally kill people , but , he was not Rambo or 007 . The scene in which he wipes out the brewery is absurd . I do n't know . Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and I just did n't get it .
0 As I write this review in 2008 , we are mired in a remake culture . Movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless updates including ' King Kong , ' The Wicker Man ' and practically every film that ever starred Michael Caine . This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon , however , as ' Dough for the Do - Do ' proves . An entirely pointless colorized version of Bob Clampett 's surreal masterpiece ' Porky in Wackyland ' , ' Dough for the Do - Do ' sucks the life out of the original by splashing colour all over Clampett 's original footage and adding some lame new footage overseen by Friz Freleng . Freleng was an entirely unsuitable director to be tampering with Clampett 's source material , although in truth no director could hope to come close to Clampett 's inspired insanity . Inevitably , then , ' Dough for the Do - Do ' is nothing more than the raping of a classic with an appalling new title attached . For cartoon fans like myself , its equivalent to a colorization of ' Casablanca ' .
0 Growing up , Joe Strummer was a hero of mine , but even I was left cold by this film . For better and worse , The Future Is Unwritten is not a straightforward " Behind the Music " style documentary . Rather it is a biographical art film , chock full of interviews , performance footage , home movies , and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from " Animal Farm . " The movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour.<br /><br />The campfire format , while touching in thought , is actually pretty annoying in execution . First off , without titles , its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are . Secondly , who really needs to hear people like Bono , Johnny Depp , and John Cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man ? They were not relevant to Strummer 's life and their opinions add nothing to his story.<br /><br />This picture is at it 's best when Strummer , through taped interviews and conversation , touches on facets of his life most people did not know about : the suicide of his older brother , coming to terms with the death of his parents , the joy of fatherhood . To me , these were most moving because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved , but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face.<br /><br />There have been better , more straightforward documentaries about Strummer and The Clash . ( Westway , VH1 Legends , and Kurt Loder 's narrated MTV Documentary from the early 90 's come to mind . ) Joe Strummer : The Future Is Unwritten is for diehards only .
0 Strummer 's hippie past was a revelation , but overall this felt like crashing a wake . Campfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire . There were just too many semi - boring old friends anecdotes and too much filler stock footage . I love The Clash and Joe for not reuniting and selling their songs until now ( FU Mick Jones ) , but this doc left me wanting .. to relate more . Using campfire storytellers without proper explanation of who is telling the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent . They should have been interviewed on their own . Even using Strummer 's ' radio DJ voice ' did little to glue the film together . And can someone explain all the flags flying behind the campfire scenes ? After the awesome " Filth And The Fury " I hoped Temple could deliver . A Joe Strummer doc deserves better .
0 I love the music of the Clash and I love the music of Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros . I went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that . But I came out of the theatre not knowing much more about Joe than I already did after reading the entry on Wikipedia . The movie never really gets through to the person , his thoughts and feelings . What they did was to collect the little material that they had , shaky blurry videos and to interview some people about Joe Strummer at a camp fire . It turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all , and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say , " Oh , he was such an inspiration to all of us " . Like Bono or Johnny Depp ( whom they seemingly asked to keep his pirate costume on to benefit from his current success in Pirates of the Caribbean ) . It seems that the director could not even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of " the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart " that ever lived , sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him.<br /><br />Sure , being a fan i enjoyed seeing the images of the band , hearing the anecdotes behind the songs and such , but in the end I felt like what remained as the portrait of Joe Strummer could have easily been told in 60 - 90 minutes.<br /><br />Go see the movie if you are a fan , otherwise better listen to some music of the Clash or even better the undeservedly unknown Mescaleros , where Joe Strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death , melting all his rich influences together to one amazing sound .
0 In the opening scene of " Malta Story " Mr A.Guinness bore such a startling resemblance to Noel Coward that I fully expected his first words to be " Certain women need striking regularly - like gongs " or some such world - weary bon mot . Unfortunately his dialogue is hardly deathless prose and even the Master would have had trouble bringing it to life . Indeed Mr Guinness wanders through the picture as if looking for a focal point and failing to find one . And therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie . Mr J.Hawkins likewise gives up early on and ends up giving a " Jack Hawkins " performance without an ounce of individuality . It could have been spliced from any of a dozen British war movies . Many of the early fifties usual suspects turn up and do their schtick to very little purpose . The Luftwaffe failed to bomb Malta into submission in much the same way as it failed to bring London to its knees . The courage of the Maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognised by the King and the island was awarded the George Cross . A worthy subject you might think for a movie , but " Malta Story " does not even qualify for the term " worthy " in its most patronising sense . It gives the appearance of being hastily cobbled together to meet a deadline , perhaps before the actors lost the will to live .
0 Another British cinema flag waver . Real garbage on offer here once again . I can not understand ( and I am British ) why this over the top , patriotic nonsense was ever made . EIGHT years mark you , from when the second world war had actually ended ! Other commenter 's here have remarked on the editing and apparent seamless use of archive footage . This is extremely poorly observed . The archive footage is in abundance . Model aircraft swing from wires in the ' action scenes ' like so many children 's kites in the wind . The usual map room sequences tattoo the movie to make us supposedly drawn into the whole Malta event . Guinness must have his worst acting performance ever . The shocking back drop dog fight scenes are laughable . Hawkins bores us all to death in the map room area . Ealing made many great movies . This clearly is not one of them . They should have stayed away from such unconvincing rot !
0 When Stanwyck 's husband - to - be is murdered on the eve of their wedding , she retreats to a mountain lodge , where she slips ( sort of ) off a cliff and is rescued by wealthy attorney Morgan . Morgan falls in love with her , leading to a definitely one - sided marriage , spent on a huge estate in Chicago ( which appears to be surrounded by mountains ! ) . Stanwyck is tempted by dashing Cortez , but eventually returns to Morgan , in a very subdued and unconvincing story resolution.<br /><br />This film has a great cast ( Morgan in particular is one of my favorites ) and a great director , but the script is meandering and seems pointless at times . I was so ready to enjoy this movie but I was ultimately disappointed . Still worth watching for the cast , and it 's good for anyone who likes 1930s films .
0 Justin goes home to live with his strict , hard - nosed police detective father , but it seems daddy has turned the upstairs into three makeshift apartments each with bizarre tenants residing in them . Straight - laced idealist Justin is thrust into the world of the occult , murder , under - aged drinking and other dastardly things . Ho - hum < br /><br />Wow , have I seen the same film that nearly all the other reviewers on here saw ? ? ? Clever , compelling , original , intense , clever , genius ? ? ? ? ! ! ? I witnessed none of those things . What I DID see was an uninteresting , bland , trite , extremely clich√©d low - budget thriller that was ripe with implausibilities and no tension in the least bit as the killer is telegraphed as soon into the film as he gives his monologue / debate / discussion . And where are these humorous laugh - out - loud moments ? I never so much as chuckled , perhaps because i was too busy struggling not to be put to sleep by the film.<br /><br />My Grade : D < br /><br />DVD Extras : Audio commentary with director Dave Campfield ; Second commentary with various contributers as well as isolated music tracks ; 4 featurettes ( Making of , on the set , turning 1 room into 4 , & Inside the black circle ) ; Interviews with Felissa Rose , Desiree Gould , & Raine Brown ; Alternate scenes ; bloopers ; a music video for ' Addiction ' ; A trailer for this movie ; And trailers for " Shock - o - rama " , " Chainsaw Sally " , " Skin Crawl " , " Sinful " , " Bacterium " , " Creature from the Hillbilly Lagoon " , & " Millennium Crises "
0 I just finished " Dark Chamber " aka " Under Surveillance " and I 'm stunned . Stunned , not by the film , but by some of the rave reviews I perused which influenced my watching it . The story was so ravaged by plot - holes and the majority of the acting so flat , categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate . Seriously , I found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as I endured this movie.<br /><br />Justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killer - addicted mom to go live with his cop father despite Mom 's warnings that Dad is no good . When a young woman is found murdered , Justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments . With the help of a couple pals , he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks . As the truth begins to unravel , Justin uncovers an unexpected secret.<br /><br />One positive point is that Felissa Rose is HOT ! I would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit , but no such luck . It would have been the film 's potential saving grace . Eric Conley played Justin very adeptly , I thought , and I would n't be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future . < br /><br />The general premise of the film , although plagued by clich√©s , might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow " performances " of key cast members , most notably Alexandra Eitel ( Kayla ) and David H. Rigg ( Justin 's father ) . The horror ! ( pardon the pun).<br /><br />I have nothing against low - budget films . Indeed , I believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come . I 'll cut low - budget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects , lighting , even musical score and the overall picture quality . I do n't give allowances , however , for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lover 's script . There are a vast number of competently - made low budget films out there . Sadly , this is n't one of them . I ca n't help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised " Dark Chamber " here are in some way affiliated with its production .
0 This movie tackles child abduction from the point of view of a Mom ( lisa Hartman Black ) who acts like a man would in an action thriller . Unlike other movies where the focus is on the Police , here the Mom is tracking down her ex - husband who kidnapped their son . She gets help from her lawyer who eventually falls in love with her.<br /><br />Before finally catching up with her son , a lot of bizarre things happen . The Mom tries to take a child that looks like her son from a local Children 's Play at a community theater . She gets caught , and then realizes it is not her child . That alone would have gotten most people put into the Mental Ward or a few months in jail waiting for trial . However , in this movie the Mom is release after a couple of hours because the victim 's parents feel sorry for her . A little while later Mom breaks into her mother - in - law 's house and then the Police arrive and they have their guns aimed at her but they let her run away because they recognize her ( and feel sorry for her?).<br /><br />At another point in the story they have found the child , but when the Police arrive to search the house it turns out they left out the back door and got into the river on a dinghy that apparently the Dad kept around just for such an emergency escape ! The Mom gets someone to lend her a raft , and even though it must have taken some time ( in a real world ) , she and the lawyer - boyfriend , and the Police catch up to the other raft pretty fast and it is upside down in the water by landfall . Instead of getting out of the raft to search for the Dad on the land , Mom presumes he drowned the boy and she jumps into the water when she sees his life - jacket . Of course , she can not swim and sinks like a rock . The lawyer saves her , but they miss a chance to run after the Dad . At one point the Mom is told her son died at a Clinic in Mexico . On and on it goes , and where it stops nobody knows ! In some ways , this movie really exploits child abduction and it is not very positive . On the other hand , seeing a woman do all the crazy things that men do in these kind of movies was fun ( or funny ? ) .
0 This is one of those cheaply made TV Movies were the characters seem to lose all sense . The premise of the story , the kidnapping of a son by the boy 's father , is very good . But the story just seems to beggar belief . Whenever the mother is advised not to do anything you know fine well she is going to do it . It is a bit far fetched and not worthy of a viewing .
0 I agree totally with another of the reviewers here who was pleased " For The Birds " won the Oscar in 2002 for " Best Animated Short , " not this sick material , which is pretentious at best and appealing to anyone , of course , who has no belief in heaven or hell.<br /><br />The animation was good , but so are a lot of animated shorts . And , by the way , I love dark humor but this just was unappealing from the start.<br /><br />As for the story here : a guy walking around and surrounded by nothing but grey ( symbolism here ) is told by a TV set ( which appears every few hundred yards away ) that he is in either heaven , hell , or purgatory . Each time he puts a gun to his head and shoots himself after hearing the news . I guess that would be funny in two of the three instances .
0 If you have beloved actors , Peter Falk , Rip Torn , George Segal , and Bill Cobbs , you do n't need Billy Burke , Coolio , or any other distractions . Massive talent is totally wasted in " Three Days to Vegas " , with the blame falling squarely on the script . My neighbor 's vacation films are about as interesting as this misguided road movie . If you want to see how to utilize a veteran cast with a good script , check out " The Crew " . There really are no redeeming factors here , and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime . I wanted to like it , but the shallow script cheats the audience , by essentially giving the actors nothing to work with . - MERK
0 One of the worst films ever . Not funny , poor TV style cinematography , bad acting . Sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk , let alone act . Lead female Nancy Young ca n't act . Terrible direction . Sub - par with bad TV movies . Occasional weak jokes fall flat . Even the basic premise of the movie makes no sense . Somehow they are supposed to stop a wedding from happening but there 's no logic behind their actions . Slow pacing made my wife stop watching but I suffered through it . The old men are supposed to be acting like they are young and horny , but it comes off as pathetic instead of funny . How did they even get the money to make this ?
0 This was not a well done western . You 've got this nut riding around in the blazing sun in a buggy with a parasol over it , killing people for his own reasons . You 've got this same person sitting in a snow cave during a blizzard , cutting off pieces of his anatomy which have been frostbitten . Then you 've got some woman in a house out in the middle of somewhere shooting wolves that are not there . What is the point of this film ? Could n't Bruce Dern find something better to do ? This was a waste of film .
0 I gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open - ended and left unexplained , and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way , plus scenes of a decaying corpse . < br /><br />Neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner.<br /><br />The film 's plot , such as it is , concerns three loosely interconnecting stories , none of which conclude satisfactorily.<br /><br />The bounty hunter , played by Bruce Dern , is the character that connects all three vignettes.<br /><br />First we have Dylan McDermott , looking darn fine , as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to Mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter , when he rides through a border town and spots a sad - faced saloon girl played by Helen Hunt.<br /><br />Then we have one of the Hemingway girls , not sure which one , playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman , an attractive redhead , whom we soon realize has been out in the badlands a little too long.<br /><br />The conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him , with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational comprehension .
0 DVD has become the equivalent of the old late night double - bill circuit , the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like The Border . There were great expectations for this back in 1982 ¬ñ a script co - written by The Wild Bunch 's Walon Green , Jack Nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast ( Harvey Keitel , Warren Oates , Valerie Perrine ) , Tony Richardson directing ( although he was pretty much a spent force by then ) ¬ñ but now it does n't even turn up on TV . The material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s American Dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption , with Nicholson 's border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wife 's relentless materialism , until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business . Unfortunately , he never really gets his hands dirty , barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface . The film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and , sadly , the recent DVD release is a missed opportunity to restore the original , nihilistic ending where Nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the film 's trailers.<br /><br />While that probably was n't too convincing considering how low - key Nicholson 's crisis of conscience is in the film , it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity : at one point he 's holding characters at gunpoint , then he 's somewhere else and they 're free trying to kill him , one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the Rio Grande while Valerie Perrine 's character gets dumber on an exponential level . The villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease ( and one impressive car stunt ) in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely . What makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring . Unfortunately Ry Cooder 's beautiful title song , Across the Borderline , says it all much more economically . But if you want to know the film 's real crime , it 's completely wasting the great Warren Oates in a nothing bit part . When even he ca n't make an impression , you know something 's really wrong . All in all , all too easy to remember why I found this so forgettable at the time .
0 After reading the reviews , it became obvious that everyone intellectualized this work . How utterly boring . Oh how about the good ol' days and there was nothing like it . Of all the comments no one expressed any emotion to this work or any other.<br /><br />I grew up just after the end of the steam age and this cinematic gem along with Dan'l Boone graced the Saturday afternoon matin√©es . This was an annual movie that made the rounds and filled the seats with gabbing , yapping , farting , giggling , snot monsters like myself or was - self . And it was a movie theatre filler at the time . Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz.<br /><br />IMDb insists that every critique contains something about the plot . Problem is was that it was rather a template . Here goes . Randolph Scott ( cowboy / hero)gathers friends and goes defeats those evil people . Hooray ! < br /><br />All of us kids figured out that plot before we plunked our quarter down to watch it . That was just about the plot line of every Scott , John Wayne , Roy Rogers film ever made . If you take the time to go back and review each and every movie - just do n't ask for surprises.<br /><br />One must remember the context of the times . There was no or little TV . None for kids . There was school . There was the great outdoors . There were toy guns . No Cyber time . And the steam age had just collapsed . But movies such as this provided the entertainment and filled the imaginations of young whippersnappers . Even the girls got into it.<br /><br />This movie was the entertainment . And it is just as mindless as anything produced today . It had a purpose originally of being propaganda . But quickly came to be kids movies.<br /><br />Our fathers had experienced the real thing . And it would n't be until Sam Peckinpah a decade later who finally lavished the red splashes of imitation blood in realistic and copious quantities . Not until his directorship did anyone die slowly , with great pain and miserably . Until Peckinpah war and gun fights were a rather bloodless affair . Thanks Sam.<br /><br />To see a movie had little or no blood , the adults did n't mind . They would n't have tolerated it I think . No guts spraying the shattering plant life . So this movie had all of the glory and none of the gory . Gung Ho was suitable for kids then.<br /><br />You will see that I assigned a four to this rating . Why would I do that ? Well . It is a terrible movie . No matter how I love it . I do love this movie because it brought back one of the happier moments of my childhood . But it is not all that good of a movie in quality terms . Basically Gung Ho transitted to become a romance novel for children.<br /><br />Should people watch it . Of course . I am not saying to stay away . Realistically however . The plot is simple . The characters shallow ? they are shoals . You can love a bad movie .
0 Should have been titled ' Balderdash ! ' Little in the film is true except the name of the island and the fact submarines were involved . Little more than training film quality with poor camera work , muddy stock footage and perhaps the low point of stereotyping ' Japs ' with laughing Japanese infantry , laughing Japanese fighter pilots and one - dimensional square - jawed Americans dying left and right . Sixty years later it is unintentionally funny as an odd artifact and as an opportunity to see what is possible when the war fever is upon you . The plot and the dialogue remind me of playing guns on a summer 's afternoon in my childhood , peering through the neighbor 's hedge to gain a fatal advantage on my best friend Steve and my little brother . In actual fact , the Makin Island raid was a near total failure with Carlson and his men wandering around in the dark exchanging gunfire with shadows until finally , thirsty and completely disoriented , looking for someone to surrender to , before they happened upon some equally confused Japanese soldiers who promptly surrendered to them ! In the withdrawal several of Carlson 's Marines ended up on another island and were abandoned ! The film , of course , could n't tell that story , not in 1943 , so this bit of whimsy was fabricated and rushed into release to the beating of drums . With Randolph Scott , and his jaw , as Colonel Thorwald ( Carlson ) leading a unit comprised almost entirely of stock caricatures , the green recruit ( Harry Landon , Robert Mitchum ) , the grizzled veteran ( J. Carroll Naish , Milburn Stone , Sam Levene ) , the country - bumpkin ( Rod Cameron ) , the all - American boy ( Alan Curtis ) , and scores of sneering ( when they were n't laughing ) ' Japs ' . And yet the cast nearly overcomes the material . Almost . Randolph Scott 's narrow range is well suited to his role of earnest commander and he is supported by a solid group of professionals who do their best with thin gruel . But in the end , the one - note object of the exercise wins . Any pretense is totally abandoned at the close when Randy Scott simply looks directly into the camera and delivers a stirring ( well sorta stirring ) call to arms . The cast was better than this material . So was the audience . Should be viewed with Reefer Madness and a bottle of moderately priced Merlot .
0 The movie ' Gung Ho ! ' : The Story of Carlson 's Makin Island Raiders was made in 1943 with a view to go up the moral of American people at the duration of second world war . It shows with the better way that the cinema can constitute body of propaganda . The value of this film is only collection and no artistic . In a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and actors . Watch that movie if you are interested to learn how propaganda functions in the movies or if you are a big fun of Robert Mitchum who has a small role in the film . If you want to see a film for the second world war , they exist much better and objective . I rated it 4/10 .
0 This true story of Carlson 's Raiders is more of a Army training film than anything else . Obviously thrown together quickly on a miniscule budget about the only thing it has to recommend it is an early performance by Robert Mitchum , who 's the only decent actor in the cast , and actual footage of the wreckage at Pearl Harbor which gets your blood boiling , as it was obviously intended to do .
0 A very attractive and capable cast is lost in this deadly boring rehash of the slasher sub - genre . The plot a simply a collection of cliches and set - pieces that we 've all seen a hundred times before . Has great potential as an insomnia treatment .
0 This really should have been a one star , but there was so many , clich√©s , predictable twists , seen it all before slasher flick parallels that I actually give it an extra star for the fact it made me laugh ... although this was never the directors intention I m sure.<br /><br />I do n't often write comments about films , they have to be either sensational , or in this ones case really bad.<br /><br />To be honest , as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey in it I knew it was going to be poor as he has a unique nose for picking out the worst films.<br /><br />Somehow the farce of it all made me watch it all the way through , possibly for the hilarious voice of MR T , ( not relay Mr T , but you 'll know what I mean if you bother to watch this ) , if you do watch it , make sure you do n't pay to see it . This may have worked had they actually put intended comedy into it , but I m sure you 'll find the odd laugh here and there at the farce of it all ...
0 I suppose that any novel that 's as much of a downer as Moby Dick would not find much favor with Depression era audiences who had enough of their own troubles . But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is a pure coincidence . < br /><br />In fact half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it , not that too much of it was kept for the film . We first meet Ahab Creely ( he 's got a last name and a brother ) as one happy go lucky soul with two legs and intentions to marry Joan Bennett who is Father Mapple 's daughter . That brother Derek , played by Lloyd Hughes , also wants to marry Bennett.<br /><br />John Barrymore is Ahab in an over the top performance . Barrymore had not quite mastered the sound cinema and he gave out with all the silent era histrionics plus a stage voice that would have shaken the rafters of any movie theater this film was playing in.<br /><br />We see Ahab lose his leg to the great whale Moby Dick and I have to say the amputation scene was pretty gruesome . Of course this was all before the Code . Still I 'm sure 1930 audiences shuddered.<br /><br />After that the story of Ahab 's hunt for the whale that he thinks made him unsightly in Joan Bennett 's eyes . That is not exactly Melville 's motivation , in fact there are no women characters in Moby Dick as he wrote it.<br /><br />One of the things Melville did was invest the crew of Ahab 's ship the Pequod with personalities . Other than Queequeg the cannibal harpooner the names are there , but not the personalities . Starbuck and Stubbs might as well be Smith and Jones.<br /><br />I'd see this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing else .
0 Necessarily ridiculous film version the literary classic " Moby Dick " . John Barrymore is Captain Ahab , who falls in love with the pastor 's daughter , Joan Bennett . His brother Derek is a rival for Ms. Bennett 's affections . When Mr. Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident , Bennett rejects him . He must slay the whale and win Bennett back ... <br /><br />There are several scenes which may have thrilled 1930 theater audiences ; particularly the scenes involving Barrymore losing his leg . The film has n't aged well , however ; there are much better films from the time , both 1920s silents and 1930s talkies . The two name attractions , John Barrymore and Joan Bennett are n't at their best . < br /><br / > * * * * Moby Dick ( 8/14/30 ) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore , Joan Bennett , Lloyd Hughes
0 This version of " Moby Dick " insults the audience by claiming it is based on Melville 's novel - even going so far as to show a phony first chapter sentence rather than the famous " Call me Ishmael " . In addition to having atrocious acting , even from John Barrymore , this is perhaps the greatest example of how far Hollywood ( especially early Hollywood ) would go to revise and change a famous novel just to beef up its chances at the box office . All of the novel 's beautiful , poetic language has been absolutely eradicated , and Ahab has been changed from a brooding , blasphemous , obsessive madman to a dashing , misunderstood hero who only wants to kill Moby Dick after his fiance ( ! ) turns away from him after seeing his wooden leg . To this is added the standard evil brother who wants the fiance for himself , and a different ending !
0 I found this a good movie to pass your time , but not by any chance of any historical value . The portrayal of Cleopatra reminded me a cheap soap opera.<br /><br />The twist of the facts is ... funny ! She gave birth while feeding her people ! ? ! ? O please ... A pregnant Queen of Egypt ( especially this one ) would not bother to go from one room to the other for that reason ! They tried to make her appear a saint for God 's sake ! And the way they tried to justify her murdering her own sister ... beyond description.<br /><br />Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time . Her decisions were based anything but her feelings and morals . She did everything for only two reasons : Power and self - preservation ! She was borne in a family where she had to straggle for survival , something she did very well . Anything that stood on her way was either murdered ( her brothers and sister ) or seduced ( Ceasar and Mark Anthony).<br /><br />Unfortunately Octavian was too powerful to kill and too ... gay to be seduced . So , he was her end ...
0 The DVD version consists of 2 episodes , the parricide of Caesar being the juncture . In addition , the language was Spanish without subtitles . Hence , it 's hard for me to review in depth this movie because because i did n't understand what was said.<br /><br />Cleopatra being an historic icon , the part is very difficult and i found that for a newcomer , Leonor Varela just plays fine . She is strong - willed but also a very supportive , tender soul mate . Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and their romance is the main thing of the first episode . So , it is not really a documentary , nor a peplum but a great love story.<br /><br />After the parricide , a new lover comes ( Marc - Antoine ) but the flavor is gone : we remember always our first love . So , i found the second episode dull and their tragic fate is n't told powerfully.<br /><br />Nonetheless , the production is luxurious : the sets are big , tastefully decorated ; the Moroccan live location exotic and the wardrobes splendid . The producers have a lot of money for sure , but they spend nothing on the special effects . They are so poor ( blue screens , ships , Sphinx ) that it 's funny.<br /><br />Finally , I would like very much to hear it in french or English to make a definitive opinion about this two movies .
0 If this book remained faithful to the book then we can only assume that the author was ignorant of history . Mark Anthony never died of injuries obtained in battle as depicted . He died a coward 's death by committing suicide and even then , he asked his slave to do it for him . The slave chose to kill himself instead . In the real story Mark Anthony was ashamed by the slave 's great valor and decided to copy him . But even in death Mark Anthony was a drunken failure and failed at his own suicide attempt . He cried out for Cleopatra and was taken to her , bleeding . She hauled his litter up on ropes and Mark Anthony died a while later . If you want history do n't watch this movie . If you want romantic drivel then you will probably enjoy it !
0 I missed the beginning of this film , which might account for why I disliked it so much . On the other hand I 've studied the fall of the Roman republic for years so I know the story . Then again , that might also be the reason why I disliked this film.<br /><br />The film has more historical inaccuracies than extras . Though it 's so inaccurate that I do n't think they made an attempt for it to be correct , in which case it can be forgiven . The odd thing is that they sometimes go to great lengths to be historically accurate that it ends up getting confusing . Like throwing in Antonius ' marriage to Octavia , and then pushing it aside two scenes later . Why even bring it up if it serves no purpose for the plot and Octavia is never even seen ? And like calling Antonius by his actual name ( Marcus Antonius ) in some scenes , and by his strange English name Mark Antony in other scenes.<br /><br />Though historical inaccuracies aside , the film could still have been an entertaining watch if it was n't for the leading lady . There is n't an ounce of dignity in her . She 's hysterical , dramatical , and completely lacking control of herself . Instead of being a clever and composed queen Cleopatra turns into a hysterical teenager with a bad case of PMS . 95 % of that comes from the poor acting , but 5 % is also from poor script writing . Far too many stupid dramatic scenes are written into the script . Sometimes you were n't watching Antonius and Cleopatra , you were watching immature versions of Dawson and Joey from " Dawson 's Creek".<br /><br />If you want to watch something about this period , watch ... anything but this .
0 I only hope that no classicists / ancient historians saw " Cleopatra " , or , if they did , that they took it as a laugh . The movie is horrendously inaccurate , more laughably , even , than " Gladiator " ( which is at least a well - written script whose historical errors are articulate and correspond well to the story ) . Most blatant is Octavius , Caesar 's heir , in the Senate before Caesar 's assassination : at the ripe old age of 19!<br /><br />Besides this , the acting is mediocre . Timothy Dalton has more than a hint of James Bond in him when he says , " Caesar . Julius Caesar . " Billy Zane is a laughably dense Marc Antony . And Leonor Varela tries her best to be the seductive Pharaoh ( who in real life was not good - looking at all ) but comes off as unbelievable.<br /><br />So this is a warning for all historians -- this movie is not true to life !
0 Why is it that any film about Cleopatra , the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making ? Whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest Roman of them all , Julius Ceasar , and his successor , Mark Anthony , never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors . Despite lavish sets and costumes , this movie is as bad as any Italian " sandals and toga " extravaganza of the 50 's . Admittedly , this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen , which is why " Gladiator " went over well , but " Gladiator " did not have all the romance novel sex.<br /><br />Miss Varela has as little acting talent as Elizabeth Taylor , but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare . Pity some of it did n't wash off on the others .
0 I think the biggest disappointment in this film was that , right until the end , I expected the acting instructors of the cast to break in and apologize for how poor the acting was . When you consider the powerful subject , the brilliant scenery and the effort made in creating a wonderful set and spectacular images , it is a shame that little attention was given to acting.<br /><br / >
0 Another rape of History < br /><br />This movie is a catastrophe ; it just uses a historic story and makes a sweet love story , with bad acting and low budget production.<br /><br />The movie should be 1/3 the time , they just dragged the time to make a mini series.<br /><br />The battle scenes are so stupid and illogical , the solders log stupid , the costumes a catastrophe . The Romans were good in fighting in opened areas , one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans when they tried to fight in a forest , in this movie the Romans choose to fight in side the city , I mean get real.<br /><br />And by the way Cleopatra was from a Macedonian origin , which means a light skinned person .
0 In A Woman Under the Influence Mabel goes crazy , but I can see why she does go crazy . If I lived the kind of life she lived with the family she has I would go crazy too . Everyone in her family is off their rocker and not completely with it . She is constantly surrounded by people yelling at her and telling her what is best for herself and people that are n't the sharpest knifes in the drawer.<br /><br />To start with the one person closest to her in her life , her husband , Nick , is a little off his rocker . He is always yelling at her when he is home telling her how to live her life and to stop acting like an imbecile . The rest of the time he is working long hours at his job and he is n't there to support her when she needs support . The one person in her life that should always be there for her is never there and if he is , he is just making her feel worse . She relies on him for support and always goes to him first when she feels she is acting wrong and he does nothing to support her . When she comes home from the hospital all he does is tell her how to act , instead of comforting her , he just yells at her and tells her what to do.<br /><br />The other major people in her life are her parents . Her parents do nothing in her life for her . Mabel basically runs their lives because they are afraid to stand up to her and stand up for her . In the end she even asks her father to stand up for her and he does n't understand , and when he does get it he still does nothing . They do nothing to help Mabel recover or to keep her from going crazy because they do nothing for her period . The only person that tries to do something for her is Nick 's mom . Nick 's mom is adamant about having Mabel committed . She does n't want to have Nick deal with it so she has the doctor commit her . It seems as though everyone is against Mabel and they feel that having her committed is a good idea because then they wo n't have to deal with it anymore . They all want to live their own lives and do nothing for Mabel except for yell at her and make her feel like she is doing something wrong when she really is n't . That is why she went crazy , and why she had to be committed , it was her family 's entire fault .
0 From actor and independent writer / director John Cassavetes , A Woman Under the Influence gives the viewer a look at a working class family with a problem of mental instability . The husband , Nick ( played by Peter Falk ) is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing his wife , Mabel ( played by Gena Rowlands ) the amount of attention that she deserves . From the onset of the film , it is obvious that Mabel is very quirky and strange , but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that . Crazy . Bonkers . Out of her damn mind . Nick tries his hardest to hide this from his co - workers , and after she has a particularly strange incident at dinner , he asks her if she 'll be okay , as if he 's trying to deny Mabel 's illness . Her problem only spirals from there.<br /><br />I did find some particular problems with this film . I guess these problems were mostly present in the story , and the way some of the character acted toward the end . Mabel has been committed , because , frankly , she 's nuts . Then , six months later , she 's ready to come out of the hospital , and her husband throws a party to welcome her back . He never acts stupid in the beginning of the movie . Why would he invite all these people , some of them strangers to Mabel , over to his house when his wife is in such a fragile state ? It 's simply idiotic . Later , after Mabel comes in the house , Mabel 's father has a huge outburst at Nick , screaming at the top of his lungs about not wanting to eat spaghetti . His daughter has just gotten back from six months of rehabilitation , and the thing you want to do is keep her calm , and he goes nuts over spaghetti ? A few minutes later in the film , Nick brings Mabel into the stairwell and forces her to do the things she did when she was mentally unstable ; make her weird noises and gestures . Did n't he send her there to make her better and not do those things ? There were various other parts that occurred after this , but it would just be redundant to look at them in more detail . I guess I just had a serious problem with the decision by Cassavetes to have his characters act in this way . It simply did n't make sense.<br /><br />However , although I had problems with the ending of the film , there was one aspect that really redeemed it ; the acting . Gena Rowlands played an amazing crazy woman . There were times when I forgot she was acting , where I got so caught up in her wild gesticulations and crazy talk that I was actually scared of her . She was amazingly convincing and intense . However , I was also impressed by the rest of Mabel 's family . Peter Falk played a very strange character , and I almost thought he was crazy himself , because of the awkward way he handled his children , his job , and especially the situation with his wife . I also usually do n't appreciate child actors . But the young people who played Nick and Mabel 's children in this film were phenomenal . It really felt like they were Mabel 's children , because they seemed so attached to her and were so interesting in helping her with her problem . I think their performances are one of the things that kept this film together , and without them it would have made the film less realistic and less intense.<br /><br />In general I was n't impressed by this film . The story was jumbled and unclear , and the characters acted in ways that made me wonder who was n't insane in the movie . The only saving grace were brilliant lead acting roles of the Longhetti family . Their realistic dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together , and are probably the only reason the film has ever amounted to anything .
0 Cassavetes was clearly an intelligent , sensitive man with bold new ideas about making films . He wanted to be an auteur , to break away from the confines of the system and bring a new realism to the American cinema . For that , I applaud him.<br /><br />Unfortunately , as a member of his audience , I can not applaud A Woman Under the Influence . Cassavetes took what could have been a fascinating topic ( an insane woman ) and somehow managed to craft a dull film , filled with lengthy , ad - libbed ranting and drawn - out scenes . He seems to have had a gift for capturing the dullest moments of a person 's life on film , and it often appears as though he simply turned the camera on his family and let the motor run and run . This tactic would be acceptable if Cassavetes had captured something devastatingly REAL -- or even a kernel of something so real it touched the heart in ways a conventional film could not . Yet I found the performances , particularly Rowlands ' , to be artificial . I never believed for a moment that she was really insane . I have met people who are truly mentally disturbed , yet I 've never seen any of them act quite like Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence . She played it like a very obnoxious , uninhibited woman who drinks a lot , and even that was confusing because we only see her drink once ( at the beginning ) , but she acts drunk for the remainder of the film . There are some moments in which she taps into something real , but those moments are few and far between ; she fails to sustain a seamless mentally disturbed character . Again , I applaud her efforts , but effort alone is not enough to make the performance ring true.<br /><br />Novice audiences who happen upon this film and see its high IMDb rating will no doubt feel compelled to love it and rate it highly , just to prove that they ' get it . ' But do n't be brainwashed by the hype -- judge for yourself . You do n't have to pretend to like it.<br /><br />Like Woody Allen , John Cassavetes could be accused of solipsism in his film - making , seeming to find his own psyche and his own life experiences so endlessly fascinating that he could n't imagine that to others they appeared presumptive and tortuously self - indulgent . But Woody Allen at least has demonstrated a gift for keeping an audience entertained -- he knows that a compelling story structure and a good dose of humor are essential to any movie . If Cassavetes had employed some self - discipline ( and a sharp pair of editing shears ! ) , A Woman Under the Influence could have stood a chance . But what 's the point of making a ' realistic ' film if the only people who can stand to sit through it are the art - house devotees and film students who worship Cassavetes as some sort of anti - establishment deity ? Without dumbing anything down , I believe Cassavetes could have made A Woman slightly more accessible by keeping the pace moving with an actual plot , instead of presenting a string of 30 minute - long scenes of ad - libbed arguments . If you just make films for yourself and a few of your fans , you 're just reaching the already converted . Watch this movie with your own set of eyes and make your own decisions about it . If you are truly moved and fascinated by it , good for you .
0 This is Peter Falk 's film . Period.<br /><br />I was 10 years old when this film came out ; I was already a film maven at the time . Of course neither my parents nor I saw this film when it came out , but I was in love with the typeface of its ads & the aura that this was An Important Film . Okay , 34 years later I 've finally seen the film -- having never seen any Cassavetes - directed film previously . He 's a hack , overall . Zero sense of timing , editing . Gena 's performance reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffman 's stint in " Rain Man " : technically on par but entirely one - note . As Tom Cruise stole " Rain Man , " Falk takes the cake for this film.<br /><br />I was annoyed with Gena 's performance , really throughout -- it seemed better suited for " Awakenings " ( blecch ! ) . It 's not all her fault : she 's a basket case from first scene to last . We never find out why ? ? But Falk 's character seems real & is performed WONDERFULLY by Falk as a seriously flawed man.<br /><br />Shave off at least an hour ( an editor needed ! ) , and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple , Cro - Magnon , man coming to grips with a wife who does n't work & yet can not deal with her three kids & her husband 's long hours of work.<br /><br />I'd rather remember Cassavetes for " The Dirty Dozen " or " Rosemary 's Baby . " He would have been a better director had he snipped his own tendency for excess -- as he amply demonstrates with this film.<br /><br />Bob
0 He only gets third billing ( behind Arthur Treacher & Virginia Field ) , but this was effectively David Niven 's first starring role and he 's charmingly silly as P. G. Wodehouse 's dunderheaded Bertie Wooster , master ( in name only ) to Jeeves , that most unflappable of valets . As an adaptation , it 's more like a watered - down THE 39 STEPS than a true Wodehousian outing . And that 's too bad since the interplay between Treacher & Niven is n't too far off the mark . Alas , the ' B ' movie mystery tropes & forced comedy grow wearisome even at a brief 57 minutes . Next year 's follow - up ( STEP LIVELY , JEEVES ) was even more off the mark , with no Bertie in sight and Jeeves ( of all people ! ) forced to play the goof .
0 I have been a fan of Without A Trace from the premier episode . I really can not express my disappointment in the episode last week . This is a REAL problem that far too many Afican - American families have dealt with and continue to deal with . The lack of media coverage crucial in the first 48 hours has been documented by a recent study . Law enforcement including local , state , and federal are also complicit . What was the purpose of advertising this subject matter and then copping out on the ending ? Seemingly , television can deal with almost ANY subject matter EXCEPT RACE . This is shameful . Get it together or do n't explore it next time .
0 Reasons to watch the movie:<br /><br />1 ) Bo Derek at 16 looks good and occasionally gets naked . She does a pretty good job playing an immature , insecure 16 year old beauty , in fact < br /><br />2 ) Many shots of a pretty Greek island < br /><br />But:<br /><br />1 ) Peter Hooten turns in the worst performance by an actor since Brutus played Caeser 's friend in " Roman Senate Proceedings of March 15 . " He delivers each and every line in a delightful baritone bellow . Turn down the volume whenever he speaks . Preferably all the way down < br /><br />2 ) Bo 's fantasies are sadly tame , especially by today 's standards . A few turns in the bath and as a fully clothed model < br /><br />3 ) The plot is skimpier than Bo 's costumes
0 There are exactly 2 good things to be said about " Fantasies " ( both mentioned by a previous reviewer as well ) : < br /><br />a ) Bo Derek 's extraordinary , poetry - inspiring beauty . She has shots in this movie where she gives even Catherine Zeta - Jones a run for her money , and that 's a high compliment indeed . Her nudity is brief and discreet , but just looking at her face is enough.<br /><br />b ) The Greek island setting , with its sun and crystal - clear blue waters.<br /><br />Other than that , there is no story , the dialogue is abysmal and at times unintentionally funny ( " He touched you where you 're a woman ! " ) , and Peter Hooten 's character is a slimy jerk . Bo overplays the naivete of her character , but then again when you have to work with dialogue this bad it 's unfair to blame the actors ( the fact that she kept saying the name " Damir " in almost every sentence is a major irritation ) . Oh , and although the film is set on a Greek island , there is hardly a Greek word to be heard - apparently everyone there , from kids to old people , speaks English the whole time . ( * )
0 Bo Derek 's debut film remained unseen for eight years ¬ñ and that 's how it should stayed ! John Derek was a competent actor but , as a director , he 's virtually the Ed Wood of erotic cinema ¬ñ not that this is especially explicit , considering that Bo ( atypically sporting dark hair ) was only 16 when the film was made ! John also wrote and photographed it ; the latter results in some decent footage of the Greek island setting against which the narrative is set ¬ñ but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious ! < br /><br />The character played by male lead Peter Hooten has been brought up with Bo 's family : they grew up as brother and sister but , now in their teens , the couple discover they 're attracted to one another ( but , as I said , do n't expect any sexual fireworks ! ) . Still , the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness ¬ñ Hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized sea - side resort and keeps expecting a cruise - liner to appear into view ( which , of course , it does at the finale ) ; Derek 's is even nuttier ¬ñ she craves possession of a large antique bath - tub ! ! For the record , the couple are married by the end of the film.<br /><br />Also involved in the non - events are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of Bo ( and who , naturally , incurs the wrath of the jealous Hooten ) . Occasionally , for no very good reason , we 're even treated to snippets from the screening of old Hollywood classics in an open - air movie house to which the whole town assembles ( among the titles shown is THE PUBLIC ENEMY [ 1931 ] ) ! At the end of the day , while Bo 's naivete throughout is undeniably charming , it 's not enough to offset the film 's overwhelming dullness and amateurishness .
0 I saw this movie way back at the first theatrical release , in a justifiably empty theater . Believe it or not , after decades of watching movies , this one still sticks clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time ; or at least the worst that I would allow myself to watch.<br /><br />The acting is far beneath the standard set by any random group of drunken high - school students yanked off the street and forced to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less.<br /><br />After the first shock of disbelief , we laughed for a while as each scene hit new lows . But after a while , even that dubious pleasure wore off and it just got to be really sad .
0 After viewing the film , I was truly shocked to see such a high rating on IMDb.<br /><br />'The Fantastic Mr. Fox ' is an adaption of a beloved children 's classic , portraying the story of the smooth , slick protagonist Mr. Fox ( or ' Foxy ' ) as he attempts one ' last ' heist to steal from the dreaded Boggins , Bunce and Bean . That 's right , one short , one fat , one lean , or however it goes.<br /><br />I do n't quite know where to start with my criticism.<br /><br />Well , I 'm in my late teens and was never a fan of Roald Dahl , but I like his material well enough , having read a few of his books as a child and seen Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory over and over again . This film , however , struggles for an audience . Is it aimed at children ? Adults ? I 'm still unsure ! Many of the ' jokes ' would bore a child , especially as Mr. Fox visits a lawyer for example , or complains about being poor . Also , an audience of ( I 'm assuming ) children is expected to sympathise with a character who steals and kills chickens . I 'm all for the food chain , but you practically see Mr. Fox biting down on their necks ! Surely that 's a bit much ? And also , the plot ... well , it 's kind of boring . I stayed only with the hope of it getting better , but instead I just got more and more annoyed at Mr Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions.<br /><br />The humour , meanwhile , falls flat . I laughed only once or twice , even though I specifically recognised attempts at jokes . I think part of it is that the voice acting is so incredibly flat and monotoned . The voice actors have no sense of comic timing , instead aiming for the subtlety of humour that only works with certain mediums . George Clooney aims to portray Mr. Fox as charming and sleek , but his voice has no character . Meryl Streep shows no emotion , I did n't even realise Bill Murray had a role until the end credits , and Ash , twelve - years old in fox - years , sounds like he 's about 30.<br /><br />I love animation , particularly stop motion , but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit . Characters are tall , spindly and lacking any warmth of design . They move with very little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange . There is also a distinctive ' mixed medium ' feel , as 2D components are added in sporadically and unsuccessfully . Characters look straight at the camera and talked ; it was very awkward . There was one or two moments when Kylie looked straight at the camera , did n't move and had swirls on his eyeballs . It actually freaked me out.<br /><br />Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential . Lots of people still seem to like it - look at the reviews . Maybe it just was n't for me .
0 There has been a lot of love that has been put into Wes Anderson 's " Fantastic Mr Fox " , unfortunately all the love is for himself . Granted , there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self - consciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny . The worrying thing is that I think it was , and this is the best that Wes Anderson could come up with.<br /><br />The animation is good in the close - up shots of the animals , however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess . There was n't really anything special about the acting either , with Wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better . I 'm pretty sure George Clooney 's voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in South Park , one of them where he played a dog.<br /><br />The film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically , despite the film being set in England , all the good animals are typical Americans playing baseball , whilst the bad guys are stereotypical English with the most insulting English accents . I can not stress how much of a waste of time this film is . I did n't laugh once .
0 Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book . Wes Anderson directs , and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film . While I respect what Anderson , an incredibly talented man did , the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit . Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man , and if this happened to be a bad film , it would be his first bad film . Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day , this is Anderson 's first bad day in film making , so I am going to let him off easy . I will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it , and the animation is nice , but the film gets progressively harder to get into , leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening . The characters are good , also . Jason Schwartzman voices Mr. Fox ( George Clooney ) 's smart ass son , Ash , and especially engaging . The film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness , but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along . I 'm sure Wes Anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film , but for now , I 'm sorry , Wes Anderson , this film of yours was a big disappointment .
0 I went in not knowing anything about this movie and I walked out in an half hour knowing everything about it . It was one of worst movies I 've ever seen . I 'm a generally a nice person but if somebody told me they liked this movie , I would probably never talk to them again . Anybody who likes it throughly is most likely to have an extremely dry , hermit type personality . I 'm gon na also include that they think they are pretty intelligent too , just like the self - centered fart bags who do the voices for the movie . I know everyone has different types of humor , some people may not even like mine , but that 's okay ; I do n't think this covers any range of humor though . This movie is as flat and dull as Wes Anderson 's mind . Go in and get ready to walk out ; it 's best to get your money back too .
0 Brilliant technology . But what good does it do if the content is hollow and foolish . I have left after < than 30 minutes of watching , being bored and irritated . < br /><br />The theatre administration returned my money , but the time waisted and aggravation remained . I have been had and no thanks to the stars whose names were the main attraction . < br /><br />George , Meryl , Bill - I hope you were well paid . You might have even liked it . So I apologies for my limited mind . A lot of people seemed to like it too . Look at the comments . Oh well ... <br /><br />Wish to know - what is remotely redeeming in a story about Mr Fox the husband , the father , the citizen , the ... whatever .
0 A fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do . that being stealing from farms and killing prey . until a trio of farmers decide they 've had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem " solved " . They are of course " out foxed " at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land.<br /><br />The"film " version , and I use the term film very loosely , is more of a god awful pastiche of American heist movies particularly the Oceans movies . They they even have George clooney as Mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely . So kudos to them .They'll make lots of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl children book .
0 I watched it with my mom and we were like ... <br /><br />What the hell ? We did n't get it at all . I may have this wrong , but a chair had something to do with the death of this woman 's father . That movie was terrible ! This is not a movie for those who love a good suspense movie . Bad suspense movie ! * shakes cane at movie * I 'm never seeing it again . And I 'm a big fan of lifetime movies , too ! They kinda need to quit trying to make movies outta books . It 's driving me crazy!!!<br /><br />And Whit was butt - ugly and yet , she loves him more than Hugh , who was a TINY bit nicer - looking.<br /><br />My rating : 1/10
0 Kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness ! The plot is so contrived and unbelievable . . . starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain ! Then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people(including clergy ) involved in what is a crime everywhere . Next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces . A very unpleasant and coo coo mother , aided , abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends ! Moving the setting from an island off the coast of South Carolina , did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget . The very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service . Kim Basinger whom I do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade . Also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads . I thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all . The movie I kept surfing back and forth to , had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much . Unless you like an unbelievable story , wooden acting , a contorted mixture of religious / mythological / allegory my advice is to skip this one . Oh and maybe a small carping criticism , but would n't a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat ? The best part of this movie is the scenery
0 and shot in Vancouver with the ' mountains ' of the low country of South Carolina visible in the background . For heaven 's sake , they should have reset the location . There are no coastal mountains in South Carolina . Period.<br /><br />Lame visuals . They should have been beautiful . And the story limped along.<br /><br />I really do n't understand why it was such a hit as a book , although I have to admit it 's one I have n't read as yet . Usually I read the book and give the film a miss . There was nothing in this movie that made me want to buy the book , or even borrow it from the library.<br /><br />Verdict : The Mermaid Chair seemed pretty shallow to moi .
0 I had several problems with the movie : < br /><br />(1 ) The screenplay -- specifically , Kim Basinger 's voice over : Movies are not books ; they should * show * the action rather than have a voice over * tell * us what 's happening . Occasionally I find a movie with a voice over that works , but here it seemed more of a lazy way of writing the script . In fact , it sounded to me as if she was practically reading excerpts from the novel in her voice over.<br /><br />(2 ) I felt no emotion in the relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas and also felt that Alex Carter 's acting was pretty bad . That 's a significant failure for me in defining Jessie 's and Thomas ' characters -- with no connection between them , it seemed to me as if she just wanted a stud and that for him it was a matter of being sex - deprived . If it had been properly done , the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story.<br /><br />(3 ) With the book , I understood Jessie 's mid - life crisis . In the movie , it seemed more like just plain boredom.<br /><br />On the plus side , I did n't think the movie was so bad as for me to turn off the TV . . . though that thought did occur to me .
0 Did n't care for the movie , the book was better . Does anyone know where it was filmed ? * * * this was my first visit to your site ... just found the answer to my question . so now I look like a dummy , but I think I 'll still submit my comments . and yes , British Columbia is lovely * * * Or why they took it from its South Carolina Coastal setting?(this question stands ) The place was essential to the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the movie . Oh , I just read where I need to write at least ten lines . Here 's my other main issue with the film . Kim Bassinger was too vapid and not at all what I pictured from the book . I know , the book was the book and the movie ; well not so good . I found the character in the book much more empathetic . Also the book evoked rustic , almost primitive images of the monastery . While the " castle " in the film was much more visually impressive , it distorted the feel of the story and seemed at odds with the characters .
0 I almost never comment on movies , but I saw the 5 glowing reviews of this " movie " and decided I had to weigh in with my own review . An instructor of mine received this film in the mail , mixed in with his Academy screeners ( AMPAS , aka the guys who vote on the Oscars ) , and was so floored with how terribly constructed this movie was that he brought it in to our class to demonstrate to us how NOT to put together a movie.<br /><br />This film has no plot , the scenes are horribly , horribly edited ( oftentimes using faux " 24 " style picture - in - picture techniques ) , and the performances ( particularly the lead , who even fails at acting like a bad actress ) are for the most part , obnoxious . Someone truly failed to understand the point of an introduction , namely , the setting up of the plot . There is no setup ! Halfway through the movie neither myself nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was supposed to be about . The opening crane shot , which sets up some kind of murder , is never addressed , and now that I think about it , was possibly meant to be a flash - forward , with the rest of the film being a flashback , but it cuts from that scene directly to the next without any indication as such.<br /><br />Bah , I could really go on and on . At the very least , this movie gives me renewed confidence in my own film - making ability .
0 Saw a screener of this before last year 's Award season , did n't really know why they gave them out after the voting had ended , but whatever , maybe for exposure , at the least , but the movie was a convoluted mess . Sure , some parts were funny in a black humor kind of way , but none of the characters felt very real to me at all . There was not one person that I could connect with , and I think that is where it failed for me . Sure , the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive towards Scientology , WOW ! What a grand idea ... let 's see if that already has n't been mined to the point of futility . The whole ordeal feels fake , from the lighting , the casting , the screenplay to the horrible visual effects(which is supposed to be intentional , I can tell , and so can everyone else , no one is laughing with you though ) . Anyways , I hope it makes it out for sale on DVD at least , I would n't want a project that a lot of people obviously put a lot of effort into get completely unnoticed . But it 's tripe either way . Boring tripe at that .
0 You want to see the movie " THE Gamers " by Dead Gentlemen Productions . This is not that movie . This movie is not funny . It is a waste of time.<br /><br />All of the good comments here seem to be written by ( poorly disguised ) false third parties . The people who made this movie seem to be attempting to synthesize fake interest.<br /><br />This movie is not a well done mockumentary . Comparisons to " Spinal Tap " or Christopher Guest are insulting.<br /><br />The movie is so mean - spirited that I can not imagine anyone familiar with the subject matter finding it funny . Being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality , but if you are the ones being lampooned in this manner , you 'd have to hate yourself to enjoy it.<br /><br />The movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo topics but because of its constant pathetic banality .
0 I picked up this movie in the hope it would be similar to the hilarious " The Gamers " by Dead Gentlemen Productions ( which is highly recommendable , by the way ) . Boy , what a disappointment ! The movie is shot in this fake documentary style made famous by the office but it fails to deliver . The reason is partly the stiff acting but mostly the writing and directing . True , it can be funny to use every singe clich√© there is about role playing games , but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable . Already at the beginning of each scene you know what the " joke " will be about . But maybe the biggest problem is that everything is depicted way over the top . There is no subtlety in this movie , if there would be captions " LAUGH NOW " or a cheap 80s - style fake - laughter track it would not make much difference . With some scenes you ca n't help to think " Yea , I get why they thought this would be funny " but the way it is executed takes all momentum out of the possible joke .
0 As a gamer , I ca n't say I like this film . Fact is , I down right hate it . I tried to watch it as open minded as possible , but when it gets down to it , it feels rather insulting to my social group.<br /><br />To me , there are several reasons why.<br /><br />1 . The characters seem unnatural . I 've met lots of players , of all different walks of life . I do n't know any who act like any of the characters in the film . It 's like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people . Most gamers are rather social people , some with rather active lives.<br /><br />2 . The style does n't work . The mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film . An actual documentary on gamers would actually work better . While it is good looking ( I.E. cleanly put together ) , it is n't very good.<br /><br />3 . The dialogue feels forced , unnatural . It also seems to lack any real world context . Gamers swear , I 'll admit that , but we do n't have Tourette 's Syndrome.<br /><br />4 . The humor is lacking . While self - deprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups I 've encountered , this is less self - deprecation , and more like toilet humor . Likewise , a large part of gamer humor is full of in - jokes and anecdotes , not toilet humor . Most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokes.<br /><br />5 . The biggest problem to me is basically this : Accuracy . I do n't mean rules , but instead dynamics . Invariably , this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films The Gamers and The Gamers : Dorkness Rising , both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game . The difference is , Gamers : The Movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs. The Gamers , where you can say something like : " Huh , I know a guy like that ... Yep , that 's definitely like Gary . "
0 Christopher Guest need not worry , his supreme hold on the Mockumentary sub - genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at RPG - gamers . The jokes are beyond lame . Not enough substance to last the typical length of a ( particularly rancid ) SNL skit , much less the 87 atrocious minutes I waisted watching this drivel . The great William Katt ( Greatest American Hero , House ) deserves much MUCH better . One thing and one thing alone makes the fact that I saw this worth it in my mind and that 's posting about it on here so hopefully just hopefully I 'll save someone such a bad experience.<br /><br />My Grade : D- < br /><br />DVD Extras : 2 Audio commentaries ; 7 interviews with various cast members ; 4 deleted scenes ; & theatrical trailer < br /><br />DVD - Rom extras : 2 Wallpapers < br /><br />Easter egg : Highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene
0 I could n't believe it when I put this movie in my DVD player . I thought I 'd have a good laugh , since I 've played D&D for half my life . I had to turn it off as I had company and they were wondering what the crap I was watching.<br /><br />Finished it later , and I should have just left it off at the soft - core gay clown porn in the beginning . No , they run the gamut of fart jokes , cum jokes , incest , racism , dressing up as KKK ... This movie is flat out mean to anyone who 's ever played D&D.<br /><br />No wonder it looks like the Real D&D would n't let them use their game . Who 'd want their name attached to this ?
0 I sat through this at GenCon only because it was quiet and I could nap . What a waste of time . Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt ? WTF ? Were the lady who played Flo and Abe Vigoda busy or something?<br /><br />Truly , a piece of unfunny garbage . The characters were stereotypical without meaning to ( I think ... ) and wooden , most of them seemed like they were on autopilot . The so - called " hilarious " situations described in some of the other so - called reviews were so hackneyed , I weeped for the writers.<br /><br />I'm confused as to how anyone can find this worth their time , seriously . I 'm only giving it 3 out of 10 because in order to be a 2 or 1 , it would need to be either five - hours long or feature more Kelly LeBrock .
0 I usually enjoy films like this . It 's shot documentary style , but the acting and writing are just awful . The acting is wooden and stiff and the writing is just so clich√© , but not at all in a good way . As of typing this , I 'm surprised it 's at a 5.2/10 on IMDb . I 'm certain that most of these votes must have come from relatives of people in the movie . I suppose if that 's the case , you might manage a couple of laughs , as it 's always funny seeing your relatives / friends make a movie . Well , in a way , I guess this gives hope to all up and coming writers , directors , actors , etc . , 'cause if they can do it , you can do it . Although , maybe you should n't .
0 This movie is just lame . A total waste of time and money . The jokes are predictable , the characters are so clich√© and the way it talks about RPG gamers is not funny as well . The problem is that the writers seems not to know how a RPG game works and , most important , how to make jokes about this game . Of course there are a bunch of losers who play RPG like freaking retards and total losers . But for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game . The story does n't make any sense at all . Who cares about how long a game is being played ? The greatest problem in this movie is that the writers and actors did n't even try to know what RPG is about to make jokes about it . I felt ashamed by watching this lame movie .
0 This movie is NOT funny . It just takes the D&D nerd stereotypes and amplifies them . All the main characters make less than 30k a year , they all live with their parents , they 're all socially retarded , and they have no luck with women . The jokes are horrible and unimaginative , such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a KKK looking hood on ( it was his wizard costume ) and the other guy had on a John Rocker warm up ( oh how funny , he 's a nerd so he does n't know about sports ) . You may have to be a childish high - schooler to find any of this stuff funny . Poorly done mockmuntaries are so painful to watch , but obviously extremely cheap to make . I feel sorry for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo . I guess these are the only opportunities available for hotties way past their prime .
0 I just finished watching this movie and I found it was basically just not funny at all.<br /><br />I'm an RPG Gamer ( computer type , none of the DnD tabletop stuff ) but I found none of the jokes in this funny at all.<br /><br />Some of the scenes seemed to drag out a lot ( tilt and zoom could 've been cut down to 5seconds rather than over a minute ) and it feels as though the director was just trying to fill in time.<br /><br />I think I laughed a total of 2 - 3 times in the entire movie.<br /><br />The acting itself was n't all that bad , around the standard that a B Grade movie should have.<br /><br />I'd suggest not bothering with this movie unless you 're a huge DnD fan and even then it would probably be best to steer clear of it .
0 In the autobiographical coming - of - age tale " Romulus , My Father , " Eric Bana , of " Munich " fame , plays an impoverished German √©migr√© struggling to raise his son , Raymond ( Kodi Smit - McPhee ) , in rural 1960 's Australia . The major obstacle to the family 's stability and happiness is his wife , Christina ( Franka Potente ) , who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men . Despite her highly unconventional behavior , Romulus refuses to grant her a divorce , masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him . It is , unfortunately , the good - hearted and good - natured Raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie ( Raimond Gaita would later grow up to be an author).<br /><br />Even though I admire " Romulus , My Father " for what it is trying to do , I ca n't honestly say I enjoyed it , for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it , these simply are n't enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing , which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen . A serious slice - of - life drama is one thing , but this unremittingly downbeat wallow in adultery , insanity and multiple suicides ( let alone attempted suicides ) is something else again .
0 Horrible acting , Bad story line , cheesy makeup , and this is just the tip of the iceberg . I have never seen a worse movie in my life , 5 minutes in I decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen ... It did n't . ( Aside from a nice breast shot ) The movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse , and the same warehouse was used for at least 90 % of the sets . You even see this same red chair in several different " locations " If you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment , not some warehouse which will echo all your actor 's dialog .. ( Note to producers ) Renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse , and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable ) If you spend your money to rent this people I hope you got it with a return guarantee ... You will be demanding your money back ... I only spent $ 2.99 to rent this tonight and I feel ripped off .
0 This movie was by far the worst movie that I have ever seen in my entire life . I 'm not even kidding . It was poorly made and the actors could n't act . It was a waste of my time and money . It looked like a movie that my friends and I could have put together on our own . The case the movie came in is definitely a disguise . Nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case . It appears that the director or make - up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie . The credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie . Which watching the credits was the best part of the movie . This was honestly an awful movie and I could n't believe how badly it was put together . Scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like " what s going on ? " The audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen 's joking around making a fake fight scene.<br /><br />IF you are considering renting or buying this movie I would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show 's how awful it truly is . I wish i would have watched it before i rented it .
0 BTK Killer , Green River Killer , Zodiac Killer ; the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is , he loves his crap.<br /><br />I've never seen a Ulli Lommel film but I was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful . Like the movies I said in the beginning do n't even equal a six when added together ! After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is . He is the worst out there.<br /><br />The credits would n't end as the pathetic movie started and quickly I noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in . The acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots . The editing is easily the worst . This movie made no sense and I unbearably could n't take it anymore as it would n't end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie . I could n't take it anymore . I wasted 45 minutes of my life.<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP !
0 German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible : he 's unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.<br /><br />Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium . This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best - worst of EW . I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto , morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set . The answer is : subterranean ; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.<br /><br />The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies . Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles , where every auto mechanic , doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered , could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.<br /><br />The main character , a villainous beat cop , is played by a German actor with a thick German accent . Aside from being a serial killer , he is also the oldest beat cop in LA . Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody , then drags them into his home ( which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse ) , and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners , the LAPD refuses to investigate , going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.<br /><br />The sets are excruciatingly bad . The production designer 's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint ; enough to paint " Precinct 707 " on a cardboard wall.<br /><br />Since the actors were obviously unpaid non - professionals -- a sad assortment of European emigres ( possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands ) , bimbos , mimbos , and desperate middle - aged women -- and since little if any money was spent on sets , special efx , locations or other production value , it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine - looking police uniforms . Sadly , they could n't afford a police car ; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental.<br /><br />More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him . One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he 's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies . The other fits right in , with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie , as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her . Do n't ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered , just accept Lommel 's logic and enjoy the absurd ride.<br /><br />After much prolonged hand - clawing out of straw - covered roadside graves , the zombie girls manage to make their appearance . They look exactly as they did before death , maybe even prettier , with black glamor make - up generously airbrushed around their eyes . Looking nothing like zombies , they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.<br /><br />At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll , and injects large doses of cheesy Euro - trash techno into the soundtrack . We 're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise . Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.<br /><br />Unlike other zombies , Lommel 's girls speak and function as normal ... er , I mean , as they did before becoming zombified . This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog . Yes , a golden shower it is.<br /><br />I wo n't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending . All I can say is it 's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece . The spirit of Ed Wood lives on ... or should I say his geist .
0 Last weekend I bought this ' zombie movie ' from the bargain bin and watched it with some friends thinking it was going to be a budget version of " Land of the Dead".<br /><br />Boy , was I wrong . < br /><br />It seems as if they spent a good portion of their budget on the cover - art , which is very misleading to fans of the zombie genre.<br /><br />We watched up to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get in the car with some yuppie who is out in the middle of nowhere talking business on a cell - phone . They actually speak to the guy before one of the girls kills him ; but once they started driving the car , I could n't suspend my disbelief anymore.<br /><br />Some people actually consider this a " so bad , it 's good " movie , they are liars . I did n't finish the movie , but one of the other reviews mention that they actually somehow become police officers at the end of the movie , which makes me glad to not have watched it all the way through.<br /><br />This is even worse than " Zombiez " DO NOT WATCH !
0 Yeah , I 'm sure it really could be a nation . . . if four of them all stood at the four corners of the world and the other two cloned themselves a few billion times . Man , I am REALLY glad that I saw this movie on FEAR.net instead of renting it . I 'm a big fan of the George Romero movies and I 'm pretty sure that if he saw this movie , he 'd probably throw up while laughing too hard . I mean , what was with the raccoon girls posing as zombies and walking around like Charlie 's Devils ? It really helped too that the music composer chose the crappy fashion show music for when the zombies walked up to their killer , especially the part where they go into the warehouse posing as the furniture shop / police station / apartment / flat / whatever room it was with the gong in the background , and the live woman was arguing about the closed furniture shop . I could n't even tell what nationality the killer was , and the fact that his accent indicated some multiple nations did n't help either . Oh well , what can I expect from a movie where they throw in a random fight scene for no good reason in a warehouse where they apparently ship boxes of air around the world . So , for all of those who worship Mystery Science Theater 3000 or if you just like reaming on bad C movies ( C for Craptastic ) , then this is the movie for you . . . or not .
0 Zombie Nation 2004 R < br /><br />Hey , I was bored . I looked in my Comcastic little box to find a movie to watch . Zombie Nation ? Hey , I love zombie movies . Says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description . Funny how it does n't warn me not to watch this film . I could 've used that advice.<br /><br />Zombie Nation is just like Troll 2 in that it 's completely misnamed . It has little ( if anything , depending on your point of view ) to do with zombies , and takes place all within one city . This film revolves around a crooked cop , who acts as badly as possible ( he has to be trying to suck this much ) , while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them . Yup , he 's a serial killer cop . Not only is this film flawed in thinking that it 's a zombie flick , it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong . Serial killers enjoy killing , they live for it and they get down and personal with it . This guy knocks out the women , and injects them with some poison . He does n't even have sex with the corpse or dismember it . Talk about boring ! Eventually , one of the whopping five women he kills has Voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason , all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy . They were all buried or tossed into the ocean , but you would n't know it buy the sharp clean clothes they 're all wearing . The women then act very poorly and take their revenge . Oh yay.<br /><br />This film was crap in every category . Crap acting , crap writing , crappier sets , and crappier make - up effects . The women do n't look zombie - like , unless you count really dark make - up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie . They can all talk , behave , think , and act perfectly human . The gore is weak compared to even many PG-13 films and the nudity is beyond brief . You see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence ... Then the exact same breasts later ! Go figure . Guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite . The police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they 're obviously filming in . You can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set - up and even , unless you are blind , you can see the director failing . Steer clear , it 's a waste of time.<br /><br />1/10
0 I only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what I saw was a total piece of crap . The scenes I saw were as bad as an Ed Wood movie . No , it was a hundred times WORSE . Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that 's not true ; the idiot who directed this junk is the WORST director ever.<br /><br />The American cop has a German accent ! The " police station " was a desk in a warehouse with a sign " Police Station " hanging on the wall . There is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about TEN FEET.<br /><br />This cop pulls women over , cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse . He tells his cop partner to wait in the car . Then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag . The cop partner thinks maybe something is not right , that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women , but he is n't sure if that is what 's happening because - he 's a moron ! The dialog is totally stupid , the acting is awful , and the characters act in the stupidest manner I have ever seen on screen . It is totally obvious to the cop 's partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it , and yet , the partner , who is there all along , does n't know what is happening ! < br /><br />The director of this film is a total hack . I stopped the movie at 30 minutes because I could n't take it anymore . It has to be one of the WORST movies I have ever started to watch and I wo n't waste anymore time on it writing this review . < br /><br />Absolutely WORTHLESS .
0 This movie had me going . The title was perhaps the greatest idea that I heard . I thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the US and a group of lone survivors , band together , and plan to take out the zombies . DEAD WRONG ! It 's about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets what 's coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge . As you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved . Where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation.<br /><br />First off , the zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face . What are zombies but mindless , debatable intelligent , cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs ? These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models , they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies . Sure the eating and killing is there , but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement ? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre , it makes fun of that genre and asks the question , " why ca n't zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines ? " I would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies . I would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much , it 's an insult and as for scary ¬Ö not even .
0 If ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it 's this pile of crap . I love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity . I actually began to feel angry watching this film because it 's so insultingly poor , I ca n't believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable.<br /><br />There 's no plot and the non - plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking . The people do n't react , act or in any way resemble human beings . The entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be . The whole thing is one pointless mess , it does n't go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and do n't do very much.<br /><br />I could make a better film than this , so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before . It 's pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time.<br /><br />Honestly , the very worst movie of all time . You 'll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a 10/10 and urge you to BUY the DVD . I ca n't imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film , it 's terrible.<br /><br />0/10 and that 's generous .
0 Notice I have given this 1 star if the option been given I would have given this zero . As I put this DVD into my TV and sat down on my couch I was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest . I looked this movie up on IMDb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so I guess I came into it critical of every mistake . But it did n't prepare me for the crap that was about to spew from my television screen.<br /><br />The box makes this movie out to look ¬Ö well OK at best . DO NOT LET THAT FOOL YOU . This movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it . The acting ( if you can call it that ) , the " plot " ( so many holes must look like Swiss cheese ) , and the special effects really are just terrible.<br /><br />Please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch.<br /><br />In the end I 'm not saying I can make a better movie than this , but I am thinking it .
0 usually I support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant ... i tend to support everybody , because their efforts are worth ... <br /><br />but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits!<br /><br />imagine the following situation:<br /><br />1 . think about the REALLY WORST horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far.<br /><br />2 . think about some great , attractive ART for that movie 's DVD box ... and a promising plot ... <br /><br />3 . voil√† ! you got ZOMBIE NATION.<br /><br />see it only if you really do n't have anything else better to do . ANYTHING is better .
0 Thank God ! I did n't waste my money renting it but i downloaded it ! This happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life , f*****g visual effects , unnecessary gore and nudity ! Far apart from other Zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others . There are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie . OK if you get time after reading this comment , please check out the director's(Ulli Lommel ) profile . After seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this , i mean every movie directed by Ulli Lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2 . And now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him , but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence . Even for fun or time pass or even at an extreme bored situation please DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE .
0 Not worth the video rental or the time or the occasional efforts.<br /><br />*Makeup that a child can do . * Acting was over done ... poor directing . * Editing was very choppy ... many things made no sense or just seemed gratuitous . * Sound was badly dubbed . * Music was highly inappropriate . * Casting was extremely off ... must have been on crack . * Zombies that talk let alone ... drive , dance , work ... just pisses me off . * And the bad guy ... Holy Crap ! As horribly casted as he was ... he was the best looking zombie of all . Which does n't say much.<br /><br />The Cover Art was good but very deceiving ... as was the Main Menu of the DVD ... great artwork and music.<br /><br />DON"T BOTHER !
0 I stopped by BB and picked up 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend . Now , I understand that the effects will be cheesy , the acting will be sub - par , and the sets will be suspect . So I 'm not expecting much . But it should at least have a story . Stories do n't cost a thing except time ..... apparently , they did n't have any time either.<br /><br />"Zombie Nation " had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers . The picture of the zombie on the front cover NEVER appears in the movie . It was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre.<br /><br />The running time is only 81 minutes but it felt like 2 hours . According to my wife ( who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room ) , it sounded like zombie porn .... which if you think about , sounds kinda gross ..... but it was n't even that good.<br /><br />The only suggestion I can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess.<br /><br />It ended up being a free rental and I still feel ripped off . I rated it a 1 out of 10 because IMDb wo n't allow me to use decimals .
0 This film has to be the worst I have ever seen . The title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope . The story line of the film is laughable at best , with the acting so poor you just have to cringe . The title ' Zombie Nation ' implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total . This can not be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy 80 's music when the zombies ' attack ' . The zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a La Roux video . If you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so , then burn the copy .
0 Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars . There 's a very high chance they need immediate professional help as anyone who does n't spend 30 seconds to see if you can award no stars is quite literally scary.<br /><br />This film is ... well ... I guess it 's pretty much some kind of attempt at a horrible porn / snuff movie with no porn or no real horrible bits ( apart from the acting , plot , story , sets , dialogue and sound ) . I wrongly assumed it was about zombies . < br /><br />Watching it is actually quite scary in fairness ; you 're terrified someone will come over and you 'll never be able to describe what it is and they 'll go away thinking you 're a freak that watches home - made amateur torture videos or something along those lines . < br /><br />I'm so taken aback I 'm writing this review on my mobile so I do n't forget to attempt to bring the rating down further than the current 1.6 to save others from the same horrible fate that I just suffered . < br /><br />I worst film I 've ever seen and I can say ( with hand on heart ) it will never , never be topped .
0 Mt little sister and I are self - proclaimed horror movie buffs . We have seen just about EVERYTHING , especially zombie flicks . Now , we have seen a lot of good zombie movies , and a lot of bad ones . This BY FAR is the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life . Not only was the acting horrible , but the special effects , graphics and ever " zombie " make - up was the worst I have seen . If you can even call it make - up ( black eye shadow around the eyes ) This is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it 's cover . Cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about . do your selves a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I was so adamant about this movie I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying " This movie sucks , do n't waste your time , return NOW " hahahhaa I do n't want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this POS movie ! i do n't even know how it got the ratings that it did , t should be in the negative
0 I ca nt believe blockbuster carries this movie . It was SO BAD . I was totally fooled by the box art . DON'T BE FOOLED ! ! Its not worth your time I promise you . I do n't know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what . I am so disappointed . :( < br /><br />The description on the back of the box does n't even match ! The girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper . The synopsis on the back says she is only 17 . Did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it ! ? Those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be . If anyone actually liked this flick then I 've lost all faith in humanity.<br /><br />And do n't even get me started on the story compared to the title . Or the fact that the entire movie was done all in 2 locations . Or that the cops did n't even have close to real uniforms . Why would i even say that ? ? Who cares about the cops uniforms ! ? Compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on . < br /><br />This movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans .
0 Seriously crappy movie.<br /><br />First off , the movie starts with a cop and his partner parked outside of a warehouse / furniture store . The " bad " cop takes a girl , which they had pulled over , into the warehouse 's attic , while the newbie cop sits outside and ponders what could be happening up there . The " bad " cop eventually returns with a heavy duffel bag , and the newbie cop does n't think there are any problems , but he still wonders what was in the bag , so he asks , gets a bullshit response , and then he thinks everything is OK ( for now).<br /><br />The " bad " cop repeats this process , and even once with a tit scene ( made it slightly better ) . But eventually people start to catch on , which took awhile considering how f***ing obvious it was . One girl gets a voodoo curse placed on her just in case she dies , like ya do . Now , the " bad " cop eventually kills this magically protected bitch , and then he gets rid of the duffel - bagged body.<br /><br />Since she had the oogey - boogey magic put on her , she comes back with lots of eye - shadow on , which is supposed to indicate that she may be a zombie ... also , the magic curse causes all of the other girls to become " eye - shadow monsters " . Some of the girls meet up with a dude , who is apparently a currency specialist , and he offers them a ride ( they look normal to him apparently ) . But when the girls see other people , such as the one girls husband , he freaks out because she is hideous ( some people freak out , but others do n't even notice ) .... massive plot hole.<br /><br />So , to wrap it up , the eye - shadow monsters kill the " bad " cop , who in turn ends up becoming a zombie in the last scene . It was as though they were trying to prep us for a sequel ! Like anyone would want to see part 2 of this cow dropping .
0 I can not believe that this movie was ever created . I think at points the director is trying to make it an artistic piece but this just makes it worse . The zombies look like they applied too much eye makeup . The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes . Finally , there are maybe five or six zombies total , definitely not a nation . The best part of the movie , if there is one is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished . Again to reiterate other user comments , the voodoo priestesses are strange and do not make much sense in the whole movie . Also , there is a scene with a snake and a romanian girl that just does not make sense at all . It is never explained .
0 This movie is a joke . I mean a " ha ha " funny joke . Why ? Because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh I got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical , inane plot and horrible acting . Wow!<br /><br />Within this movie there are so many unanswered questions ... for example ; why do these women become zombies and how ? Why are there four black women who are zombie 's " caretakers " and what is their purpose ? Since when does 6 people make up a " nation " of Zombies ? And is smeared black eye mascara " scary " to anyone , anywhere ? Even a 2 year old?<br /><br />And lastly ; Why was this movie made at all ? Why ? why ? why ? No answer ? That 's what I thought.<br /><br />On the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie : We apologize for this movie in advance " LOL . At least they had the decency to do this much !
0 German filmmaker Ulli Lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible : he 's unseated fellow Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made.<br /><br />Lommel is truly the Ed Wood of the new millennium . This film is as shoddy and laughable as the best - worst of EW . I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto , morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set . The answer is : subterranean ; Lommel dug a pit and buried it.<br /><br />The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies . Only someone who has lived in Los Angeles , where every auto mechanic , doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered , could easily understand how Lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face.<br /><br />The main character , a villainous beat cop , is played by a German actor with a thick German accent . Aside from being a serial killer , he is also the oldest beat cop in LA . Despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody , then drags them into his home ( which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse ) , and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners , the LAPD refuses to investigate , going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment.<br /><br />The sets are excruciatingly bad . The production designer 's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint ; enough to paint " Precinct 707 " on a cardboard wall.<br /><br />Since the actors were obviously unpaid non - professionals -- a sad assortment of European emigres ( possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands ) , bimbos , mimbos , and desperate middle - aged women -- and since little if any money was spent on sets , special efx , locations or other production value , it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine - looking police uniforms . Sadly , they could n't afford a police car ; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new Mercury rental.<br /><br />More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged German LAPD officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him . One of these young actors is especially pitiable because he 's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies . The other fits right in , with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured Brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated.<br /><br />The latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie , as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her . Do n't ask why a girl from Romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered , just accept Lommel 's logic and enjoy the absurd ride.<br /><br />After much prolonged hand - clawing out of straw - covered roadside graves , the zombie girls manage to make their appearance . They look exactly as they did before death , maybe even prettier , with black glamor make - up generously airbrushed around their eyes . Looking nothing like zombies , they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway.<br /><br />At this point in the movie Lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman Boll , and injects large doses of cheesy Euro - trash techno into the soundtrack . We 're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise . Stuff they might have played in an Ibiza disco when Lommel was still young enough to shake his booty.<br /><br />Unlike other zombies , Lommel 's girls speak and function as normal ... er , I mean , as they did before becoming zombified . This gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog . Yes , a golden shower it is.<br /><br />I wo n't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending . All I can say is it 's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece . The spirit of Ed Wood lives on ... or should I say his geist .
0 I am an actor , producer , director and what i am about to say are facts . This project was the worst film in movie making history . From producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a BIG joke . Why would Blockbuster released such crap ? I take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession . Was the director trying to make a bad movie ? I do n't think so . I seen bad Zombie movies , but this takes the cake the Coffie and everything on the damn table . THIS MOVIE SUCKS ! ! ! I really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself , but please consider in taking up a different profession . I respect the fact that you completed a movie , but i have to ask you " WERE YOU SMOKING CRACK " , I mean the makeup on your girls , the scary Zombies , what were you thinking . To the whole nation , if i could have voted Zero i would have . WORST FILM IN MOVIE MAKING HISTORY ! ! !
0 This is probably the first entry in the " Lance O'Leary / Nurse Keat " detective series ; in subsequent O'Leary films , he was played by much younger actors than Guy Kibbee.<br /><br />A group of relatives ( all played by well - known character actors ) gathers in an old house ( on a rainy nite , of course ! ) to speak to a wealthy relative , who goes into a coma.<br /><br />While they wait for him to recover , all sorts of mysterious goings - on happen , including a couple of murders.<br /><br />A creepy film ; worth seeing !
0 I remember watching this film in the eighties as a teenager . But i wanted to see it again , because Traci Lords is now earning a living as a " serious actor " . What the hell was going on in the eighties ? This is a really bad film with bad taste and bad actors . Definitely a waste of money .
0 Why do all movies on Lifetime have such anemic titles ? " An Unexpected Love " - ooh , how provocative ! ! " This Much I know " would have been better . The film is nothing special . Real people do n't really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed . The straight woman who " turns " lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character . If you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion , you might enjoy this . Although it seems like it was written by someone who does n't really get out in the world to observe people . Why am I wasting my time writing about it ?
0 This movie was okay , but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are " born that way , " especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman . It almost seems as if Kate 's gender preferences turned on and off like a switch , making this film seem a little simplistic.<br /><br />Also , as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda , it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as " bigots . " And there was no happy medium . It was either Kate 's friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her . This is not typical of interactions between gay and non - gay relatives and friends . It is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play . It is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make . Sadly , the movie showed none of these types of interactions . For a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance , it struck me as very intolerant movie ! Then at the end , Kate apparently decides after all these years she wants to be with Mac and everything is hunky dory - is that what being gay is really all about ? Come on !
0 They changed the title of this atrocity to An Unexpected Love . The only thing worse is the film itself . The script contains dialogue that would be laughed out of a third grade play recital . At one point when the wife leaves the husband , a bad cover of All by Myself plays over the soundtrack ! No kidding . The actors try but are defeated by the inept , unbelievably terrible script . Direction is staggeringly bad . No wonder Lifetime has such a bad reputation . How do things like this get made . I 'm turning off the television before it 's over !
0 I laughed all the way through this rotten movie . It 's so unbelievable . A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage , has a breakdown in front of a real estate office . What happens ? The office manager comes outside and offers her a job ! ! ! Hilarious ! Next thing you know the two women are going at it . Yep , they 're lesbians ! Nothing rings true in this " Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do " movie . Clunky dialogue like " I do n't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and did n't take it " does n't help . There 's a wealthy , distant mother who disapproves of her daughter 's new relationship . A sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003 , a film gets made in which there 's a sassy black maid . Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave . The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids . Sheesh ! No cliche is left unturned .
0 I 've read some of the comments about this film and can only surmise that some people are easily entertained . This movie is nothing . It 's so badly written , directed and acted that it barely makes an impression . The characters speak in cliche - ridden dialogue and the situations are completely implausible . While that might make this campy and fun , it does n't because everything is so lifeless the film becomes dull . It 's as if Lee Rose decided to write a drama about a woman struggling with her sexuality but then she either was n't allowed by studio execs to give the story some true - to - life gusto or did n't have the cojones . This movie could go in the enyclopedia as the standard - issue bad Lifetime TV movie .
0 I had to do a search on the actresses to find the board of this film because the title is now An Unexpected Love . It 's not really worth looking for but I was unfamiliar with both leads and wondered why they were headlining a lesbian flick on Lifetime . Everything 's pretty restrained and you do n't really get an idea of who these characters are so , as a viewer , I was n't able to become emotionally invested in the storyline . I guess I 'm not the target audience for this but I 'm not sure who is . Everything 's muted and soft focus and earth tones ... nothing 's very interesting . I had a prurient interest in seeing two women make out but it 's handled so discreetly that I was disappointed . Rent Personal Best instead .
0 When I was 11 , Grease 2 was like crack . It was a classless , shameful , euphoric , and powerfully addictive experience . My sister and I would watch it , rewind it , and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another . So , if you are an 11-year old girl , and you reviewed this film as " brilliant " or " fun " or " better than the original Grease , " you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass.<br /><br />If , however , you are not a little girl , you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that Grease 2 was anything but an inane , artless , slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production , distribution , and/or consumption.<br /><br />For the sake of criticism , I will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows ¬Ö  < br /><br />1 . In a well - executed musical , the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters . In Grease 2 , with a few debatable exceptions , to the music is obscenely pointless . Most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way ( " Score Tonight , " " Reproduction , " " Do It For Our Country , " and " Prowlin ' " ) without making one concrete statement about any of the film 's characters or themes . Plus , all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance.<br /><br />2 . The T - birds should be badass , and if not at least somewhat likable , but instead each of them is an annoying wussy - dufus - loser . In the end , when Johnny Nogerelli offers Michael the sacred T - bird jacket and initiates him into the gang , Michael should kick it to the ground , spit on it , and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it . But of course , he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads , there is no greater honor than to be one with the T - birds . < br /><br />3 . Since Michael is beautiful , smart , kind , resourceful , and above average in everyway ( his musical impotence notwithstanding ) , it is feasible that Stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask . Stephanie , on the other hand , is a slovenly , slack - jawed , bubble gum smacking , dirty sweatshirt wearing , gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat . So aside from being pretty ( I guess ) , she harbors no likable characteristics , thus , audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of Michael 's attraction to her.<br /><br />I could go on and on , but I did n't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair . I will say this though , to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time 's sake : Grease 2 is an experience akin to re - living your first kiss . Only you are 32 now and kissing a snot - nosed 13-year old kid with acne and slobby braces . The magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed . Trust me .
0 Boy - girl love affair / sequel with songs , only this time she 's the punkette and he 's the straight arrow . Movie - buffs out there actually like this movie ? It has fans ? I must say , the mind reels ... " Grease 2 " is a truly lame enterprise that does n't even have the courage , moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames ( like " Jaws 2 " or " Exorcist II " ) . No , it whimpers along in slow - motion and often just plays dead . It looks and feels cheap , with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling . This was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer and , although she does n't embarrass herself , it 's a role worth forgetting . A misfire on the lowest of levels . NO STARS from * * * *
0 Well , at least my theater group did , lol . So of course I remember watching Grease since I was a little girl , while it was never my favorite musical or story , it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it 's still a lot of fun to watch . I heard horrible things about Grease 2 and that 's why I decided to never watch it , but my boyfriend said that it really was n't all that bad and my friend agreed , so I decided to give it a shot , but I called them up and just laughed . First off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it was n't really clever , not to mention they just used the same characters , but with different names and actors . Tell me , how did the Pink Ladies and T - Birds continue years on after the former gangs left ? Not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy , gee , what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these T - Birds were just stupid and ridiculous.<br /><br />Another year at Rydell and the music and dancing has n't stopped . But when a new student who is Sandy 's cousin comes into the scene , he is love struck by a pink lady , Stephanie . But she must stick to the code where only Pink Ladies must stick with the T - Birds , so the new student , decides to train as a T - Bird to win her heart . So he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the T - Bird 's butts . But will he tell Stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own ? Well , find out for yourself.<br /><br />Grease 2 is like a silly TV show of some sort that did n't work . The gang did n't click as well as the first Grease did , not to mention Frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable , because I thought that she graduated from Rydell , but apparently she did n't . The songs were not really that catchy ; I 'm glad that Michelle was able to bounce back so fast , but that 's probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel , I would n't really recommend this film , other than if you are curious , but I warned you , this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical.<br /><br />2/10
0 The tenuous connection between this film and the first Grease is established right at the beginning of the film when Didi Conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young Maxwell Caulfield who is a British exchange student . Although in the previous film Olivia Newton St. John 's foreign speech pattern is not explained , it 's explained here Caulfield is her cousin . What 's Conn still doing in school , I guess she just likes hanging around Rydell High even though now she 's a beautician.<br /><br />Caulfield 's a smart kid , so of course the hood types led by Adrian Zmed have him labeled as a nerd . And that 's especially bad when Zmed 's girl friend decides she likes Caulfield . But being a nerd just is n't going to cut it.<br /><br />That 's when Caulfield decides to put on a modern day Zorro act . He gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride . He gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face . If getting Michelle Pheiffer is not in the cards , Caulfield wo n't have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he 's outfitted.<br /><br />Grease 2 introduced Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed . If you saw the first Grease film , a much better film , than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out.<br /><br />In addition to Conn , Eve Arden , Sid Caesar , and Dody Goodman , all faculty members from the original Grease return in their roles . The music score is n't remotely as good as the songs that come from the original.<br /><br />It 's not that Grease 2 is bad , it 's just not all that great .
0 I 'm sorry , but even TJ Hooker 's Adrian Zmed could n't save this sequel . I went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original . Then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene ( notice that this is the only movie that Patricia Birch directs ) ; and I sadly realized they were trying to be serious . I did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang , having lost their " wheels " due to their gambling habits in the original Grease , were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie . Being shamed by that putz character Carrington , I 'd hate to see what they would resort to later : maybe Mopeds?<br /><br />I also never bought the hackneyed theme : hunky - Australian - boy - can't - fit - into - Outsiders - dominated - school - ergo - goes - for -tough - guy - with - stupid - biker - helmet - look . It was Disney story gone horribly awry.<br /><br />So , it looks like you CAN ruin a good thing by placing a bubble - gum smacking Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical . The only thing I took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it .
0 The first part of Grease with John Travolta and Olivia Newton John is one of the best movie for teens , This one is a very bad copy . The change is only in the sex . In the first one the good one was Sandy , here it 's Michael . I prefer to watch the first Grease .
0 Hollywood 's misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more misfires than hits . For every " Godfather II , " there are dozens of " More American Graffiti 's , " " Stayin ' Alives , " and " Grease 2 's . " While the original " Grease " is not a great film , the 1977 adaptation of the long - running Broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960 's , energetic choreography , and an appealing cast . When Paramount began work on a follow - up , the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster.<br /><br />Fortunately for moviegoers , Michelle Pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts . Her talent and beauty were already evident herein , and Pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform . Maxwell Caulfield , however , lacks even the skill to express embarrassment , and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic . What romantic interest , beyond hormones , could the cool sassy Pfeiffer have in the deadpan Caulfield ? That dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory . Only cameos by veterans such as Eve Arden , Connie Stevens , and Sid Caesar have any wit , although Lorna Luft does rise slightly above the lame material.<br /><br />Reviewers have complained that , because " Grease 2 " is always compared to the original , the movie comes up lacking . However , even taken on its own terms , the film is a clunker . After a frenetic opening number , which evidently exhausted the entire cast , the energy dissipates . With few exceptions , the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960 's , and the only nostalgia evoked is for " Our Miss Brooks " and " Sid Caesar 's Comedy Hour . " The jokes fall flat , and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer Patricia Birch is clumsy to be polite . However , worse films have been inflicted on audiences , and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters . Unfortunately , " Grease 2 " is not even unintentionally funny . Instead , the film holds the viewer 's attention like a bad train wreck . Just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered , the next scene plunges into even worse carnage .
0 Unfortunately I made a mistake and I paid 7 Euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie . My points;<br /><br />Film is based on 2 things;<br /><br />1 ) Ethnical point of View : As it happens on most of the American Films , the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the Asian culture . But unfortunately it is not enough . Knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods does n't make a person understand a culture . For example shaving is the sign of clean life in Asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that . Lebanese people are Christian ( Ok they got that ) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arabic countries . The main difference between eastern and western culture is we do n't make ethnocentrism . So we do n't judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film . < br /><br />2 ) Sexual revolution of a girl : There is nothing much to say about this . Show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than I will say that I am wrong.<br /><br />I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre . Please watch Dr . Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor . A black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it . Where is the truth ? Where is the meaning about the movie .
0 I saw this film at its premier at Sundance 09.<br /><br />Since American Beauty is a movie that had something to say , I had hopes for Towelhead . Unfortunately , it was a disappointment . In fact , of countless movies I 've seen in almost a dozen Sundance festivals , Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I 've ever wanted to walk out early from.<br /><br />The worst problem with Towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of " provocative " concepts concerning cultural stereotypes , rather than with an organic human drama . The screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian . The famous Edith Wharton quote comes to mind : I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author 's political views . That observation is especially devastating for Towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic . If there ever was a time when Towelhead 's white male villains , condescending portrayals of blacks , ironic treatments of foreign cultures , etc . , were fresh , it 's long past.<br /><br />For a more detailed review , please look up any of the many professional reviews available online . Almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on.<br /><br />On the other hand , the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled . As you read through the reviews in this and similar sites , you 'll frequently come across superlatives : " stunning , " " breathtaking , " " profound , " " shocking , " ... It embarrasses me to read them , but it does not surprise me . Indeed , I 've encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial , cultural , gender , or sexual issues as deeply moving , thought provoking , full of profound insight . If you are such a person , by all means , rent Towelhead and be moved by it . On the other hand , if you set your standards higher , you can safely pass on this one .
0 Roy Rogers stars as Jesse James and his look - alike , gambler man Clint Burns . George " Gabby " Hayes is Mr. Rogers 's ex - pal , Sheriff Gabby . Gale Storm ( Jane Fillmore ) and Sally Payne ( Polly Morgan ) are a noteworthy team , as two reporters on the lookout for stories about the elusive outlaw hero.<br /><br />Of course , mistaken identity / impersonation is a plot development , since Rogers essays a " dual role " . Rogers is charming , as usual ; but , there is nothing really elevating this his performance above the ordinary - any potential to deliver a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance is done in by poor material . The better pair to watch are Ms. Storm and Ms. Paye as the St. Louis Journal reporters - they are the film 's highlight . The songs are fine , though badly synched . < br /><br / > * * * Jesse James at Bay ( 1941 ) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers , George ' Gabby ' Hayes , Gale Storm
0 This is an awful film . Yea the girls are pretty but its not very good . The plot having a cowboy get involved with an Indian maiden would be interesting if the sex did n't get in the way . Well , okay it might be interesting , but its not , because its so badly paced and and only partly acted . I can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen , probably more laughable then they do on TV . ( I wo n't even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest . Never read about that in the old west ) This is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward.<br /><br />I like schlock films but this is ridiculous . There is a reason that I do n't go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good , the plot taking a back seat to breasts . The original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats . The clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent . The comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level , infantile but harmlessly fun . Something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie.<br /><br />The Ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film.<br /><br />I need not watch this again.<br /><br />Of interest to probably no one , the rapist and killer in the film was played by Bobby Beausoleil , a member of the Manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped.<br /><br />Obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives .
0 A cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby Indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the chief 's daughter , leading to much hate and violence.<br /><br />This crackpot nudie feature is fun to look at , though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level . The terrible costumes and the fact that all the Indians are obviously white , makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production that it 's press materials pretends it to be.<br /><br />In short , the plentiful nudity ( the real reason for watching this ) is good . Everything else is not . There 's definitely better examples of both genres.<br /><br />More interesting is that The Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and features not one , but two members of the Manson family , Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil , who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the soda - stained screens of the Pussycat Theater !
0 I figured that it 's about time I let this one out . Pok√©mon fans are suffering in America these days . Why ? Because we rely on Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies . As far as the series goes , they do a pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the Japanese versions to television . So what is their problem when it comes to the movies ? Honestly now , I have seen all three Pok√©mon movies in Japanese and I will definitely be seeing the fourth one . They are excellent movies . They are all enjoyable and fun to watch . And , after seeing Pok√©mon 2000 in theaters , I ca n't help but wonder how these American producers read the Japanese scripts . The way it appears , it seems that they read and see something that says ` Insert empty moral here ' in big bold faced letters . It definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on MSB ( extreme sarcasm there ) and created this crap.<br /><br />*possible spoilers from here on*<br /><br />Well , I guess I should first talk about Pikachu 's Rescue Adventure . My first gripe with this came with no narration . I guess they got enough bad comments on the Pok√©dex narration that plagued Pikachu 's Vacation , and , instead of going with a caring , gentle woman 's voice as appeared in Pikachu no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai , they just cut the narration all together . This would n't have been a problem , except for one thing . Did anyone really understand why the Exeggcute did n't let Togepi go until the end ? Possibly the fans , but I 'm sure not the parents . Then , there 's the theme song . I could n't help but roll my eyes at this one . The Japanese theme song was ` Tankentai wo Tsukurou ' and was sung by Japanese children . It was fun and enjoyable . This one : nauseating . Now , one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing Kireihana . Nice music , fun to watch . That 's changed with the Bellossom . The music sucked for one , but on top of that , they had all the Pok√©mon talk during the music , which turned out to be jumpy , annoying , and just unnecessary . Oh , and then there 's the Poliwhirl who thinks he 's a Poliwrath . You 'd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are . Basically , not much could save this little ill fated dub , which is very unfortunate considering its potential . But , I have n't touched on the worst of it yet.<br /><br />You'd think that the warning signs would 've been apparent to me when I received my issue of Nintendo Power . For some unfathomable reason , I had been placing some faith in 4Kids and the WB . My thoughts were ` well , they screwed up on the first movie , but the second is different as far as the theme goes , so they should do well . ' That in mind , I just did n't pay attention to the warning signs I encountered in the theaters when the trailers said , ` You will believe that one person can make all the difference . ' With the way they said that at every turn , I was hoping that this would not turn into a moral fest like MSB did at the end of the English version . Then comes Nintendo Power , in which I see all my fears realized in the words ` the main feature ' The Power of One . ' At that point , I became a bit more uneasy . ` The Power of One ? ! ' Not a good sign . However , I still kept some of my false faith . Big mistake.<br /><br />Sitting in the theater , I was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which I loved in Japanese being turned into complete and utter junk . I hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle . I can see a point in that since they did n't pander this thing , repeating it over and over like in MSB . However , it did more damage than anything else in this movie . First of all , the legend that was read throughout was changed a bit to read ` the world turns to Ash . ' Ah hah . So , Ash is the chosen one ? Whatever . In the Japanese version , the inhabitants of Arshia needed a Pok√©mon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony . This time , he 's the chosen one . A greater way that this did damage was to Lugia . Lugia was one of the coolest characters in a Pok√©mon movie .... when the movie was ABOUT Lugia . In this one , Lugia is forced to take a back seat to Ash . In the scene where they 're flying back to the main island , Lugia and Ash are discussing the conditions of Lugia 's existence , not that Ash is going to make all the difference . Overall in this category , Ash was n't really the ` one person ' that would make the difference , since he was helped by many along the way.<br /><br />A lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking . Furura 's flute song was n't nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the Japanese one . Jirarudan 's speech to them saying his collection ` started with a Mew card ? ' Ugh . Even worse , Misty 's outrage originally concerned the way Moltres and Zapdos were being held . ` Why did n't you put them in Pok√©balls when you caught them ? This is like caging them to be displayed . ' Much different from whining about him thinking Pok√©mon are things to be collected like stamps . If there were any real redeeming values in this , they came from Team Rocket . Some pretty funny lines . Not really to make me laugh out loud , but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach . Well , that was officially the last American Pok√©mon movie I 'm going to see . I 've imported the third one and find it very enjoyable . I would rather not see another Japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two . I 'll be importing the fourth one as well . Forget you , Kids WB and 4Kids . You have forsaken me for the last time .
0 I recently watched this again and there 's another version which is shorter 1999 . I get the feeling they are the same movie but I would like to know the difference.<br /><br />One is Japanese and no pikachu short is all I can come up with . Ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice ? ? < br /><br />Prof Ivy was rather boring . She sounded as if she was almost asleep , no expression at all with the few lines she had.<br /><br />This was enjoyable enough but there was n't much to it at all . < br /><br />A collector ( who s after Lugia , he has no plan to destroy the world ) and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture Lugia causes a lot of destruction.<br /><br />The pokemon movies that follow are slightly better , deoxys ( poke 7 ) is great , with no . 8 almost here .
0 Much worse than the original . It was actually * painful * to sit through , and it barely held my six year old 's interest.<br /><br />Introduction of some new Pokemon is marginally interesting , but storyline is extra - thin , dialogue is still bad , and music is mediocre . Watch the television show instead - it 's much better .
0 pokemon the movie was a terrible film . unlike the first one , this is not a good film at all . the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it . in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent . the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was bad . tracey really does n't have much to say or do , and unlike brock offers no comic relief . the only good points is you get to see misty actually get jelous over ash , and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining . overall this film is n't worth renting and the short movie before did n't do anything for me or my wife . and we do consider ourselves pokemon fans.oh well , maybe the next one will be better.cant ge t much worse
0 Now i have never ever seen a bad movie in all my years but what is with songs in the movie what physiological meaning does it have . WOW some demented Pok√©mon shows up and they multiply i can get a seizure from this . Animie is pointless the makers of it are pointless its a big marketing scheme look just cut down on songs and they will get a good rating i reckon that this movie would have been fine if they put out a message you must see all the Pok√©mon episodes to understand what s going on and it is not a film . It is just an animation it should be on video.<br /><br />Ps : i 'll give it a 1 because i just got 5 bucks i could not give it a half because there 's no halves .
0 Nintendo ! ! ! YOU # % $ @ERS ! ! ! How could you do this to me ? I ca n't believe it ... this movie is actually worse than the first one . I went to see this at the theatre with my brother because my mother forced me to tag along .... oh God ... where do I even begin ? The plot SUCKED . The voice acting SUCKED . The animation SUCKED . The ending REALLY SUCKED . If you liked this movie , YOU SUCK TOO . And to Futuramafan1987 , who said this was the greatest movie ever , you are a TOOL , PLAIN AND SIMPLE . This is n't a movie for anyone but crack - addled ten - year olds with Game Boys who think Pikachu is God . I 'm still cry to this day thinking about that horrible turd of a movie .... and then there was Pikachu 's Adventure ... don't even get me started on that horrible mess of a film . It is , in all truth , one of the most boring experiences of my entire life . Do n't go watch this at any costs.<br /><br />Bottom Line : Go out , find every copy of this movie that you can , and burn it . Burn them all , and then proceed to rent a GOOD movie , like Aliens ... or Bowling For Columbine ... or even Back to the Future !
0 ' The Curse of Frankenstein ' sticks faithfully to Mary Shelley 's story for one word of the title , which would n't be so bad if the changes were any good at all . The tragedy of the creature destroying Frankenstein 's family has been completely excised and replaced with ... nothing . The heart and moral centre of the story is gone . It does n't help that this Frankenstein is a conniving , devious murderer ; he deserves everything he gets . The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clich√©s . Even taken on its own terms , this is rubbish : a bland , rambling film featuring a shite - looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut . As it 's the first of Hammer 's horror films , directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee , its place in horror history is secure . But it 's crap .
0 The author sets out on a " journey of discovery " of his " roots " in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the ( completely and deservedly forgotten ) movie " Bright Leaf " is about an ancestor of his . Its not , and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and self - indulgent glorified home movie , suitable for screening at ( the director 's ) drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial - or even non - commercial release . A good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios - because they are boring , irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and his / her immediate circles . Avoid at all costs !
0 I was expecting a documentary that focused on the tobacco industry in North Carolina . Instead I watched a man who rues the fact that his great grandfather lost his tobacco empire to the Duke family . And this went on and on . If Mr. McElwee 's family had prevailed over the Dukes I doubt that Mr. McElwee would have any problems with the death toll caused by tobacco - related diseases . I grew up near the area where Mr. McElwee 's family began it tobacco business ; I expected more than McEwee 's continual focus on his family . I learned very little about the history of tobacco in the NC economy and the ramifications to the state 's economy by tighter regulation of tobacco . The countless references to the movie " Bright Leaves " are out of place - So what if Gary Cooper played Mr. McElwee 's great grandfather ? Does the viewer gain any understanding of the role of tobacco in the North Carolina economy by the showing of old film clips of a fictionalized film ? I did n't .
0 I was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was . Was the viewer supposed to learn something , or reflect on anything here ? What was up with the pumpkins ? Was I supposed to be impressed with the motel shots ? Does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel ? Why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews ( it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery ) . The best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished.<br /><br />I am truly amazed . I believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community .
0 Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut should be a fan 's dream come true . At long last , footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life . A director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored . It seems like a winning situation . And then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this " esoteric dream " is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence . While it 's entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project . And it is only a very few times.<br /><br />You know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics . But then we start seeing new footage ( alternates from Superman - The Movie for the trial ) and that first bit of hesitation fades away . Hey , this is pretty neat ! Things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from STM intermixed with new effects for this project , and it does n't convince at all . And from this point on , it never ever lets up . It 's probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects , but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was " You 'll Believe A Man Can Fly " it 's difficult to believe anything shown on screen here . The best effects in this are from the original productions.<br /><br />Another issue with this re - cut . A lot of it just does n't make sense . The only reason any of it really works is because we 've all seen the theatrical version of Superman II , a movie that does make sense . Lester 's Superman II fills in the holes of this assembly . Part of this could be because Donner did n't get to complete shooting , the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little Lester material as possible . What we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes Superman IV look airtight and coherent.<br /><br />After viewing this , one gets the sense that while Lester was faithful and comfortable using Donner material , Michael Thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by Lester . The best scenes in The Donner Cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of Superman II . That includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence , not ironically , both were filmed by Donner . But anything else from that movie filmed by Lester is re - edited in such a hasty fashion , that it now makes Lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing . While Lester honored the Donner material , Lester here is thrown under the bus.<br /><br />So is there anything good in this release ? Well Marlon Brando is in it , and that 's neat to see . In fact watching any of the material shot by Donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as Superman - The Movie . But that only highlights the problems of this release . Any of the major scenes ( really just Lois jumping and scenes with Marlon Brando ) would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section . Instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances ( many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used ) sloppy edits and bad decisions.<br /><br />Watch the opening scene at the Daily Planet . Why are we looking at Jackie Cooper 's back as he calls for Lois and Clark ? At the end why do we have Lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by Jackie Cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on ? I was initially confused by this , because I expected to see Lois . The entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this.<br /><br />Battle scenes are a mess too , with no geography between cuts . It 's just random action . Of course , the major action scenes were shot by Lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of Donner outtakes or alternates . They should have used more of Lester 's footage , but probably had too much pride to admit that.<br /><br />The sloppiness extends to the military missile as well . As noted elsewhere , the missile shown in The Donner Cut bears the designation " XK 10 " while we all know it 's the " XK 101 " ! A blind man in STM knows that ! The producers of this assembly , who tried so hard to honor the original film , dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production . For all the supposed care that was put into this , the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable.<br /><br />The entire affair would probably be easier to digest if Warner 's did n't make this a separate release here in the states . As it is , we 're expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a " Play All " option . It 's really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes , but after that initial viewing , I expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else . I know after my experience of watching this , I had new respect for Lester 's version . It 's by no means perfect , but Lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief . He managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so , while this new re - cut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history .
0 So ... we get so see added footage of Brando ... interesting but not exactly Oscar worthy stuff . Susannah York was hardly a slouch . New scene where Lois finds out Clark is Superman is slightly unbelievable in that he does n't notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets . Real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that ... let 's listen to Donner make fun of Lester 's version that made more logical sense . The president talks of the Zod " defacing " the Washington monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore . Tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd . Superman 's " freedom of the press " line sounded silly compared to " .. Care to step outside " which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to Clark 's earlier scene in the truck stop . Then there is the ending with the " turn back the world to go back in time " effect . It turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for Hackensack , N.J. ever went since it does n't free Zod and company any more .
0 I grew up on the ' Superman II ' theatrical version ( " S2 T " ) and as a kid , I loved it more than Part I since not only did it contain more Superman and three Superman - type villains , it started off with a bang ¬ñ the best Clark Kent to Superman transformations and rescue scenes . Kids no longer had to impatiently wait for Superman to appear on screen , as in part I. Now as an adult , I can see how the mighty had fallen with S2 T ( See : my review . ) I 've always heard of the back - story on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the original 's director , Richard Donner from part II . ( It must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously , now it 's common : ' Back to the Future ' and ' Matrix ' 2 & 3 for example . ) Unfortunately , after finally seeing the Richard Donner Cut ( or , " S2RD " ) I still ca n't fully recommend it . Gone , was the great Superman change scene , the entire Paris rescue , as was the wonderful recap of part I in S2 T 's opening . In fact , they all but wrote the words : " Previously on Superman ¬Ö " in S2RD . The special effects were n't great in either Part I or S2 T , but S2RD , they were mostly downright laughable ¬ñ such as Lois falling from the Daily Planet window . I will admit , some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures , such as any scene in the " honeymoon suite . " Overall , if you grew up on S2 T as I did , and loved it as a child ¬ñ not nitpicking as I do as an adult , you should absolutely see S2RD as it 's almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes . ( Spoiler alert ) Unfortunately , the worst change comes last : gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from S2 T replaced with the exact same ending as ' I. ' This is not only a lazy , unoriginal copout , it does n't make sense on why Clark would go back to that diner , if those events never actually happened . And will he continue to " turn back time " for every confrontation ?
0 I 'm not alone in admiring the first Superman movie , a film that Richard Donner executed masterfully . I am also not alone in scorning Richard Lester 's Superman 2 ... which brings us to the Richard Donner cut of the same movie , sadly it is still an absolute abomination.<br /><br />Superman 's world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses , but Superman 2 stretches things too far . It does n't matter who directed Superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader . In a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do , unlike the original superman . With or without his powers , Superman 's strength ( or lack thereof ) is handled in the least believable manner . There is too much to criticize , so I will not bother . I condemn this movie ... perhaps the slapstick in the Lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on . Super - Duper bad .
0 A little girl 's dead body is found stripped of all possible means of identification . When it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other , it is assumed to be the body of a couple 's missing daughter . After this trauma , the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence . All of this changes when one day , many years later , she receives a phone call from her daughter ! With the help of an ex - cop and a reporter , she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive . " Los Sin Nombre " is a mess plot - wise , moves at an achingly slow pace , and is completely unscary . The saving grace is Emma Vilarasau , who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother . The best part of the movie is the ending , but I 'm not sure it is worth enduring the rest of the film . Beware of the English subtitles on the recent R1 release -- they are n't very accurate .
0 Warner Bros. made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast paced , economical and very entertaining . I really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life . This is one of Warner 's few hard - edged melodramas that simply does n't work . Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the 20-year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences . Robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that do n't cut the mustard . H.B. Warner , Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good , but the bad acting of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie . Starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie . In addition , the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre - code Hollywood . LeRoy 's direction is full of innovative visual touches but he can not overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations . Sol Polito 's camera work is strong . Somehow , this piece of dreck got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture ( in a year that gave us " M , " " Dracula " and " Frankenstein " ) .
0 I gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned . From the domestic violence , to sexuality and many of the taboos therein . Outside of the gore I really would not call this horror so much as I would science fiction.<br /><br />It 's bleak , depressing and hopeless . While I do n't mind a less than cheery ending , I 'm really very tired of the " humans suck " clich√© that 's central to every movie . I know you ca n't get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self - hatred as a member of the human race , but how 's 'bout as a writer / director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the ALIENS KILLING THE HUMAN RACE are evil ! Right now , if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die , just go out , find a lake and swim ' til your arms are tired . This way you wo n't be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me I deserve to die for being alive . It 's silly , not thoughtful , and boring .
0 A huge disappointment from writer Hamm and director Dante . Their previous collaboration on the first season 's " Homecoming " was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways . This poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered . The supposed " payoff " showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing . If the point of the story was an extraterrestrial " cleaning " of the planet of it 's human infestation , why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion ? Why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la Stephen King 's " The Stand " instead of having the male population butcher the females ? I kept hoping the episode would improve as I kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous . The religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear Sam Hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it . I like a lot of both Dante and Hamm 's work but this was just unwatchable .
0 I love the frequently misnomered " Masters of Horror " series . Horror fans live in a constant lack of nourishment . Projects like this ( and the similar " Greenlight Project " with gave us " Feast " - like it or lump it ) are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the minds of directors with a horror bent to develop and bring to maturation food for we who love to dine on horror.<br /><br />This one began with a kernel of really - kool - idea and ran ... right off the edge of " where in the world am I going with this?!!!".<br /><br />I do n't know how to spoil the spoiled but " SPOILER AHEAD " All of a sudden ... no , there was that light drifting across the night sky earlier ... we have long haired luminescent aliens ( huh ? ... HUH ? ) brain drilling males and ... yeah , I get it but ... well ... the worst curse of storytelling - a rousing and promising set up without a rewarding denouement.<br /><br />Cue to storytellers ... your build up has to have a payoff that exceeds build up . Not the other way around . Storytelling math 101.<br /><br />End of Spoilers - Big Oops !
0 Masters of Horror : The Screwfly Solution starts as America is being infected by an airborne virus that affects the male population , when aroused men indiscriminately kill any woman in sight apparently in the name of God . Scientist Alan ( Jasn Priestley ) is brought in by the Government & knows more than most & senses the situation may have gone too far already so he tells his wife Anne ( Kerry Norton ) to take their teenage daughter Amy ( Brenna O'Brien ) & try to survive as the future of the human race may depend on them ... <br /><br />This Canadian American co - production was episode 7 from season 2 of the Masters of Horrror TV series , directed by Joe Dante I thought The Screwfly Solution was pretty bad . I personally think the script by Sam Hamm sucks , it takes itself far too seriously & I do n't really understand why it 's part of the Masters of Horror series , the horror that the filmmakers are going for in The Screwfly Solution is in the actual story itself & themes & ideas it brings up rather than on screen visual horror particularly the tenuous ecological message it sees intent on ramming down our throats whenever it 's gets the chance during it 's short 60 odd minute running time which I felt itself was a problem as the thing just finishes out of what could easily be interpreted as necessity rather than any meaningful attempt to wrap things up . I was n't happy with the inconsistencies with the story either , if men only kill when sexually aroused why does the flight attendant casually break that woman 's neck on the plane ? Was he sexually aroused , I think not . Why does every bloke then think he 's killing in the name of God ? I just ca n't see every single bloke on Earth suddenly knowing the Bible & starting to believe in God , I just found the notion ridiculous & the show also states clearly that there 's nothing religious about what 's going on so what 's the deal with everyone thinking they have a divine to murder any woman they see ? Then there 's the fact people get turned on by different things , what about gays for instance ? Will they kill guys instead of women ? I know there 's a brief scene which makes a joke out of the gay issue but it 's conveniently brushed to one side & then there 's the thing which annoyed me the most . The fact that presumably every bloke on earth has turned psycho & killed all the women they go about their everyday business like nothing ever happened , it just felt so stupid , the plotting is rubbish & to round things off there 's a ending which looks like it was taken from a rejected episode of The X - Files ( 1993 - 2002 ) with a bright neon alien.<br /><br />Director Dante on this showing definitely does n't qualify as a Master of Horror as far a I 'm concerned , the story is badly paced , it 's just so stupid considering it 's played deadly straight & instead of trying to make a proper horror show he turns in more of a thriller with it 's deadly virus on the loose situation & the subsequent mother & daughter on the run because of it , there 's very little here in the way of what I would call effective horror & even less gore . There 's a scene when a woman is stabbed with a broken bottle , a brief scene after when a guy stabs his own groin with said bottle & another woman is stabbed in the stomach but nothing else to write home about.<br /><br />Technically like the other episodes it 's really good & it does n't have the look of a cheap TV series , the special effects are great as usual & it 's well made . The acting is alright but no - one really stood out.<br /><br />The Screwfly Solution is easily the worst Masters of Horror episode I 've seen but bear in mind I have n't seen all of them ... yet . As a stand alone piece of entertainment it did nothing for me & as a show made by a so - called Master of Horror it disappoints me even more .
0 I 've now written reviews for several of the MoH episodes , and this is among the worst . An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll . If watching people things they never would in real life amuses you ( " let 's check out the basement ! " ) , then this is your show . Except , it 's not amusing or entertaining - it 's just annoying.<br /><br />The extent of the virus is never , ever showed . I can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only , as the resulting situation is very , very frightening . But then things deteriorate as daughter lets OBVIOUSLY deranged dad into the home , and ultimately dies at his hands . The woman flees north , and runs into a few tens situations . Then , some sort of spirit or alien or something appears and saves her ( things that make you go HUH ? ) . Or something . Then , she is huddling for warmth . The end.<br /><br />Awful . These directors are mailing this tripe in .
0 I was n't terribly impressed with Dante 's 1st season offering in " Homecoming " , it was n't much of a horror story , but rather a smart political statement with the undead . Screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men 's sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women . The episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists . Then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home . I assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak , but is unclear because this is never revisited . The episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah . It seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end . The worst episode . Well , except for chocolate .
0 All the world said that the film Tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure , but this is not the case . Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake to take as an actress Kareena Kapoor . She was unbearable throughout the film . Her tom - boy look does not really goes well . Even the film the story of the film is not making sense at all . Everyone said that the Quetin Taratino of India is Vijay but its not at all Quetin . The talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this stupid movie . Anil is an actor of large caliber and this film is not . Akshay Kumar has also been a victim of this film as all is Saif . The Style and the Phoormola is not really good in this film i was disappointed
0 This is the biggest Flop of 2008 . I don know what Director has is his mind of creating such a big disaster . The songs have been added without situations , the story have been stretched to fill the 3 hrs gap and most disgusting are the action stunts performed by the actors it 's like everyone are having superpowers they can run in between the bullets are fire and nothing happens to them and one person fighting with 100 people . Only the best performance was by Anil Kapoor man he is all time at his best playing the role of villain with a comic act speaking Hinglish ... Akki is also done a good job .... But the movieee just forget it .
0 I would have liked to write about the story , but there was n't any . I would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but " hinglish " is only funny for like 5 minutes , after that its overkill . I would have liked to swoon over the ' keep - u - guessing suspense ' but it was as predictable as ... um mm , a Yash raj movie ( ? ) . I would have liked to talk of the edge - of - the - seat action , but I do n't like cartoons much . < br /><br />*sigh*<br /><br />All in all , this movie is perfect for : 1 . people attempting suicide - I promise it 'll push you over the edge 2 . Sado - masochists- this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that Silas guy in the Da - Vinci code wore . 3 . People researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4 . Movie Piraters : More power to them . If any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it . 5.Barnacles , most types of plankton & green algae - Because almost all other living things would require an IQ factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers . Afterthought : The director of the movie , obviously , is a species of his own . ( And i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind .. one is enough)<br /><br />Things that could have made this a better movie : 1 . A story 2 . A choreographer 3 . A Screenplay writer 4 . A stunt coordinator 5 . A story ( Did I already say that ? ) 6 . A director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged ( although even one who was challenged could have done a better job ) 7 . Anil Kapoor = Bubonic plague - Avoid at all costs 8 . A statutory warning - " Watching Yash Raj movies is Injurious to your mental health " ? < br /><br />Things I liked about the movie : 1 . Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2 . The English sub - titles - " Mera Dil Kho Gaya " becomes - " My heart is in a void " , " Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya " turns into " I m a flirt , I m a lover , I m a vagabond " .. priceless.<br /><br />In short , Tashan to me , is like the opposite of a Rubrics cube - The cube is supposed to increase the IQ of the player , Tashan promises to lower your IQ , and that .. in a mere 2.5 hours ! Woot!<br /><br />*sigh* .. But that s just me . I could be wrong You 've been warned anyways .
0 Such a long awaited movie .. But it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day .. From the trailers it looked like a action movie , but it turned out to be a out & out comedy(a bad comedy ) . But one thing that deserves appreciation is the acting by these professional actors , they 've done their part of the movie very well . Good acting , but i do n't think that can save the movie .. India has been shot beautifully . Kerala , Rajasthan , ( Ladakh ? ) were all saturated with color , alright . Nevertheless the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was shot made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there ; -)<br /><br />Action sequences were shot very shabbily , no one could make out head & tail of the stunts , they 've used Akki(akshay kumar ) very well but could 've been done much much better .. <br /><br />Animation is the worst i 've seen in recent movies(90 's movies had better animation scenes i guess(initial scene where the car is falling off ' flying should be better word ' the road into lake).<br /><br />And the movies name has been mentioned nearly every 20 to 30 mins , just to make sure audiences do n't forget the movie name i guess ..
0 The sight of Kareena Kapoor in a two - piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching Tashan ¬ó the mega - disappointing , mind - numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend . Bad films are bad films and we see some every week , but Tashan is not just a bad film , it 's a terrible film . Terrible because it takes its audience for granted , terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they 've got big movie stars onboard . Written and directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya , Tashan is what you 'd describe as a road movie , but one that 's going in all the wrong directions . Saif Ali Khan stars as Jimmy Cliff , a call - centre executive who 's hired to teach English to Bhaiyyaji - that 's Anil Kapoor playing an ambitious UP gangster , desperate to go cool . Jimmy 's got his eye on Pooja , the gangster 's pretty young assistant ( played by Kareena Kapoor ) , who uses Jimmy to swindle her boss of 25 crore rupees . Determined to recover his money and also to punish both Jimmy and Pooja , Bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to do the job . So you have Akshay Kumar as Bachchan Pandey , the gangster 's faithful aide from Kanpur , who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that 's hidden across the length and breadth of the country . Much like those bad eighties potboilers , Tashan too is held together by a threadbare script centred on a vendetta plot . But the treatment 's so over - the - top , so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect . Instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three - act structure , you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed . That garish item song in the desert , the bullet - dodging action scene at a Rajasthani fort , Kareeena 's bikini moment , even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks , a water scooter zipping through a dirty naala , and believe it or not , even a Dhanno - style horse - driven tonga . In all fairness , not all these set pieces are badly done - the item song in the desert is quite neat actually - but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture , because you 're just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really . Little do you expect in a seemingly fast - paced road movie , to find a sickeningly sentimental flashback track about childhood sweethearts . You see the problem with Tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making . What 's more , I do n't think they cared either - the film reeks of arrogance . Arbitrarily packing in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work , Tashan is like an overcooked stew . There are films that kill you softly , and then there 's Tashan , a film that kills you with excess . Packaged snazzily with glossy - finish camera - work , exotic locations and fancy costumes , every frame of the film probably cost lakhs to put together , but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story does n't hold . Borrowing narrative from Tarantino and style from Stephen Chow does n't help either because they do n't blend with the film 's wafer - thin plot . One may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging , but Anil Kapoor 's grating Hinglish dialogue makes you want to slit your wrists , and Saif Ali Khan fumbles through the film foolishly , unable to find his feet . Kareena Kapoor , meanwhile , queen of over - the - top delivery , does a decent job . But of course , if Tashan is salvaged to some extent , it 's thanks to Akshay Kumar 's irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character . You cringe when he 's cupping his crotch repeatedly , and you scowl when he delivers those double - meaning dialogues , but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he 's up there . Despite some good music from Vishal - Shekhar , the songs seem like they 're only prolonging your misery . Well that 's because Tashan is a test of your patience . In case you did n't know , Tashan means style . I 'm sorry to say , this film has none .
0 ... for this movie defines a new low in Bollywood and has set the standard against which all c**p must now be compared.<br /><br />First off , the beginning did have elements of style .... and if handled well , could have become a cult classic , a - la pulp fiction or a Desi desperado ... but the plot ( was there one ? ) begins to meander and at one point completely loses it.<br /><br />Throw in a deranged don with an obsession for English , a call center smart Alec , a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a Saree with the same aplomb , a levitating , gravity defying hit - man and a cop with a hundred ( or was it a thousand ) black cat commandos on their trail .... good ingredients in competent hands . But this is where I would like to ask the director : Sir , what were you smoking?<br /><br />Im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of Bollywood film making - for what must never be done - insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers . < br /><br />Possibly the only redeeming feature in this Desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music ... watch the videos ... hear the airplay and you wo nt be disappointed . Vishal- Shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes . < br /><br />How I wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy .... <br /><br />As I sign off , I want to really , badly know how does Akshay 's bullet wound vanish in a microsecond ... what were you editors doing ? Tashan , maybe ...
0 This movie is horrible . THe acting is a waste basket . No crying , no action , hopeless songs . Though the scenery is great . I have always wanted to go to Greece.<br /><br />Anyway , as for Saif , you 'd expect a great performance , but even he let down the people.<br /><br />Akshay Kumar , recognized as the pimp of Bollywood and the voice of Singhs . He was sensational in this movie . For only this performance , Filmfare should introduce another award . The toiletries award for the worst performance . By the way the trophy should be a toilet seat.<br /><br />Kareena Kapoor . She first of all is not comparable to her sister Karisma . In acting , in looks , or in body . She now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her . She comes into this movie wearing bikini 's and tank tops and short shorts . I really wonder why Saif Ali Khan is letting his wife - to - be dress like that . But , she must 've impressed some people dressing like that . And if you ask how , then consider every man is having an erection watching this movie . They are dreaming of having Kareena Kapoor in bed naked with a condom . Including me . Personally I think that she dressed like a whore , but I really liked it.<br /><br />I am forced to give it a 1/10 , but I 'd really give this movie a 0/10 . An unachieved film .
0 The film lacks style , i mean original style . everything looks copied including action , first appearances in the movie , songs , dialog delivery , etc etc . Yes , there the goof - ups were original , like in the beginning a car is shown with number UP * * * * number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number MH * * * * . That was one in many goof - ups of the movie :) Anything good in the movie ? yes , for kareena fans , if there are any , Kareena in bikini . For akshay fans , his dialogs and action stunts . That s it . nothing else . So watch it on your own risk and do n't blame the director or actors . Director is already insane and actors , i pity them .
0 I had never thought the standard of Yashraj films would ever degrade to such an extent ! The film has a nonsense storyline which catches no interest.<br /><br />Saif has over acted . Kareena has improved her figure , but is not a good actress anyway . Akshay is good . Anil is also good . May I say the role was n't good .. <br /><br />Great deal of cheapness is filled in . Wondered if that was supposed to be the " comedy part " of the movie . Just because last few movies were flops does that mean Yashraj films should make this kind of rubbish ? It has a history of so many good films . < br /><br />Overall , I was totally disappointed with the movie .
0 Sometime I fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie ... I had had a trauma after watching Welcome ( 2007 ) and thought that they wo nt do it again . But after loads of amazing promos , Tashan finally ended as heart attack.<br /><br />Such amazing 3 songs in promo - Dil Haara , Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and what u get in the movie ? Zero story , predictable plot , plenty of Akshay Kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching Kareena after her major weight loss ... !!!<br /><br />Music - wise another major disaster ... in the music album , they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they have n't thought of giving the background song of the scenes when Akshay Kumar is doing stunts ... ! that song is such nice , quite comparable to Tashan Mein and that is not taken in the music album ! ! ! :-( If you plan to watch this movie , i would say , watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like ... ' Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ... '<br /><br />Overall very disappointed even with the way Bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad English!<br /><br />Go away man , i need to puke !
0 Absolutely awful movie . Utter waste of time.<br /><br />background music is so loud that you can not understand speech . Well if you really listen closely , whatever they speak is actually unintelligible.<br /><br />Camera work is bad , editing is not present , background score gives a headache , action is shoddy , dialogs are unintelligible , Acting is abysmal and well Kareena used to look like a wrestler , now she looks like a starved wrestler . Hell you can slim down but you can not gain grace.<br /><br />After spending three hours watching a movie I want to like it , but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure . < br /><br />Please if you want to torture yourself , go ahead watch this .
0 If there is one film which is the worst of this year- it 's TASHAN The first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring Dhoom 2 style film , and well i knew first only it would be a bad film whatever it maybe Because of it being a Yashraj film Or maybe seeing the cheesy promo But this film gave me a shock , it was even worst then Dhoom 2 and what i expected First Saif 's introduction which is boring Then Saif- Kareena meet , Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor oh god , what he is doing in such a weird film ? What kinda role it is ? What acting is he doing ? His first scene is alright but then his act gets repetitive and he overacts Then came Akshay who provided some nice scenes , but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated stuff Childhood romance , overdose of childish Rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes The ending is another joke < br /><br />Vijay Krishna Acharya would have got 3 films more to direct , if this film had worked , that s the strategy of yashraj , only money nothing else So Vijay is another addition to their list of crap filmmakers Music ( Vishal Shekhar ) is ordinary < br /><br />Performances Akshay Kumar comes in the film as a whiff of fresh air , he actually provides some engaging moments Saif Ali Khan is irritating , Kareena is equally bad Anil Kapoor hams outrageously and spoils the show even more Rest are okay
0 I was very displeased with this move . Everything was terrible from the start . The comedy was unhumorous , the action overdone , the songs unmelodious . Even the storyline was weightless . From a writer who has written successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom , I had high expectations . The actors worked way too hard and did not help the film at all . Of course , Kareena rocked the screen in a bikini but for two seconds . I think Hindi stunt directors should research how action movies are done . They tend to exaggerate way too much . In Chinese films , this style works because that is their signature piece . But , Hindi cinema 's signature are the songs . A good action movie should last no more than two hours and can not look unrealistic . But , in the future , I 'm sure these action movies will get much sharper . Also to be noted : Comedy and action films do not mix unless done properly . Good Luck next time .
0 The storyline was okay . Akshay Kumar was good as always and that was the only good thing about the movie . Kareena Kapoor looked bad . There was so hue and cry over her size zero but she did not looked good leaner . I do n't know why the hell did Anil Kapoor accepted such a bad role . There was nothing much to do for him in the movie . Just because it is a Yashraj film does not means that an actor should accept the role however bad it is . Said Ali khan was alright . I think that it is high time that Indian directors and producers start thinking of Indian customers as intelligent lot . What are we ? fools ! ! ! ! What do they think , they will show 2 men taking on a SWAT squad to teeters and we will believe them . Is the Indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals .... they take an entire squad of 100 + policemen and no one was there to surround the palace . The action was crap and I have never seen such bad action . Akshay Kumar was between a circle of 30 - 40 policemen all shooting at him ..... and he shooting back at them . None of the policemen 's bullet touched him but he killed all the policemen . Crap . CRAP.<br /><br />I think the fight director who thought of this scene should take retirement.<br /><br />I strongly recommend NOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE .
0 I just saw the movie in theater . The movie has very few good points to talk about . Kareena 's beauty and a couple of songs may be . That s it . The movie is a complete disappointment in all areas . Anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed , even Mumbai Indians too ( just now Chennai has made it to semi - final ) . < br /><br />But the worst I feel about the movie is the action scenes . Now days Bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from Hollywood . But they forget that Hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real . But unfortunately Bollywood directors do not have that much of time . They spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie . Now such too stupid action scenes may work in South as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people . But in Bollywood this is certainly not going to work . All the action scenes I wish I could have forwarded . At the end even some Chinese people appear from nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar . This is height of stupidity . Audience is not paying to watch such stupidity . I think Bollywood now should forget about the action movies . They ca nt make it . The last good action I have seen was from " Ghatak " and " Khiladiyon ka Khialdi " . The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me . Does these people see their movie after completion ? Ca n't they figure out that the slow motion action ( which is done using ropes ) is too unrealistic and childish ? Better not to have action scenes if you ca nt handle it . I just want to go back to Amitabh 's era where movie like Zanjeer and Deewar were having thrilling action scenes . The sound effect was not very effective in those days , but visually it is much better than current era scenes . < br /><br />This movie now should open the eyes of the Bollywood movie directors . Please do n't make any more action movies , until you acquire the art of making it realistic .
0 Tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the movie.<br /><br />This type of movies are actually made for flop . What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces such movies those are worthless than C - grade movies . Or even some C - grade movies have better and pleasing story than Tashan . The much hyped and over - confidently promoted Tashan poorly bombed at the box - office which it certainly deserved.<br /><br />In my view , this is the worst movie ever made from honourable Yash Raj Films ' banner . How come they handled such a heavy project to new Vijay Krishna Acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick ? He tried to imitate Sanjay Gadhvi 's ways of making like Dhoom but he suffered at last . The action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences.<br /><br />The story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences ' hearts . In most scenes Anil Kapoor reminds me of southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions . I am not a fan of neither Saif nor Akshay , but the award of Kareena should have finally gone to Saif ' 's hand instead of Akshay . Just from the starting point I expected of it , but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth . Saif is the main behind the whole adventure , while Akshay joins in the midst . In any movie , the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit . And Tashan loses in this way , and unexpectedly failed to become a hit.<br /><br />Akshay 's has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies . He seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again . In between Saif did a great job in Race , and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie . But he has fully developed himself in the acting field . And last but not the least about Kareena . She looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean . But I myself do n't think so , instead she became slim . Yes slim ! ! ! it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people ( or say , male ) . Beside them it is nice that Saif 's son Ibrahim appears in the beginning & last as young Saif . I hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career.<br /><br />Those who like this Tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood , or say want to be admitted in an asylum . Thumbs down to debutante director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mishandled the project offered by Yash Raj Films . In future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directions.<br /><br />Sorry , I do n't like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies .
0 I had no idea what the film is about before I saw it because Tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted . So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said that " It is the directorial debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the screenplays for Dhoom 1 & 2 and Saif Ali Khan 's son Ibrahim makes his debut in the film by playing him as a child in his flashback".<br /><br />After watching it , I understood that why their was n't a proper trailer because there was n't anything in the film to show . The story was extremely dum and even a 10 year old child can come up with a better story - line . There was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle there is and it 's difficult to figure out that who is killing who . Also the action was daft & unrealistic e.g. 1 man with a handgun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns.<br /><br />While I was watching Tashan it reminded me of 3 films:<br /><br />Sin City : During the opening credits.<br /><br />Koyla : Anil Kapoor 's terrible English like Amrish Puri in Koyla.<br /><br />Jhoom Barabar Jhoom : The outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even a jot funny.<br /><br />I also heard the budget is 40 crores which is the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I do n't know where all the money went to . Anyway if you did not like Dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like Tashan . Race was hot on heels and that is a million times better.<br /><br />The only 2 good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya and both songs are shot in Greece at good locations but what is the use of it in a rubbish film ? Even Anil Kapoor 's terrible English could n't save this discomfiture .
0 I had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a Yashraj Film.<br /><br />Jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach her boss , Lakhan Singh , English . The two fall in love and decide to run away but Pooja tells Jimmy that she ca n't do this as she owes a debt to Lakhan Singh , who is also known as Bhaiyyaji . But they decide and steal money from him and its only then that Jimmy finds out that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a Don . In the meantime , Bhaiyyaji hires a man , Bachchan Pandey , to track down Jimmy and Pooja.<br /><br />Starring Saif Ali Khan , Kareena Kapoor , Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar , the movie is directed by first time director Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra.<br /><br />"Tashan " has to be one of the worse films that I have ever watched . Yes ! The scenery is good and Kareena Kapoor ( and her much publicised weight loss ) looks good . But plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other - hence why I have said at the beginning that I had expected more from this film as it was a Yashraj Production . With reference to songs , unfortunately , there is not one song that I can remember now.<br /><br />There are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif could have definitely done better while Kareena Kapoor played her part well . But this can not be said for Anil Kapoor - it did not suit him at all as a villain . Lastly , never mind Aditya Chopra , who in the past has produced and directed good films such as " Mohabbatein , " what was Yash Chopra doing by producing such a trash movie ? < br /><br />Conclusion : Bad movie , not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression .
0 The action in this movie beats Sunny bhai in Gadar . Akshay Kumar possess the superpowers of Leonidus in 300 , Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman . It is hilarious . Except for the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy I can not see anything positive in this film . The story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write . The movie is so unreal that Anil Kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director . Except for the directors Tashan to make this movie there is no other Tashan . I regret wasting my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anybody . 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb or I would give it a zero .
0 I had some expectation for the movie , since it had a nice star cast and it is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif . Well , I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2 ; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan , I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic . < br /><br />When I saw the credits at the beginning , I felt nice because it was put up in a nice way . Well , the very first scene itself pis*ed me off . Then , the major drawback of the movie is the action sequences . Me and my friends were laughing our guts off watching this crappy fights . It was like Akshay against some 30 thugs and all and the thugs even got machine guns ! Phew ... you got to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are.<br /><br />The other thing about the movie is the far too predictable story . It reminded me of some of the early 80 's movies.<br /><br />Well , the only thing the movie is worth is of sexy Kareena , who looked really hot in this one . And for that , I give a rating of 2 out of 10.<br /><br />Guys , please .. please ... don't see this one thinking that it is a real gangster movie . Well , you can watch this to have some laughs at the terrible fight scenes.<br /><br />Thats all .
0 If this is a 2008 product from one of the biggest production houses of Indian Film Industry ( Yash Raj ) then I am afraid it is a very long ahead for us to reach the right standards.<br /><br />If you can go wrong to this length with such an enormous star cast of Anil , Akshay , Saif and Kareena , then movie making is still to be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film . The film lacks in almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar . He has a few good dialogues to render but that alone can not make you enjoy a flick with huge expectations.<br /><br />The first scene of a car going down into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film . That itself was a clear indicator of the director 's vision . Every actor who otherwise is an asset to a movie is simply wasted . Anil Kapoor 's gimmick of attempting good English falls flat most of the times . And Saif will surely hit himself thinking why he signed this movie.<br /><br />In short IT 'S THE BIGGEST WASTE OF RESOURSES AFTER " JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM " . I would say that even " Aaja Nachle " was a better enjoyable movie than this.<br /><br />One can not understand how and why this kind of script was written and approved . The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshay 's love story . After the faulty script the weakest point of the movie is its music . Vishal Shekhar have given just some filler tunes to each song . The songs start off very well and suddenly the tunes drop drastically . Only one song " Falak Tak Chal " is somehow good of all in the lot . An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar.<br /><br />Regarding the continuity intelligence of the makers just sample this : Akshay and Saif are on the road in the hilly area of a foreign Location ( probably Ladakh ) . In the next scene they are searching for Kareena in Haridwar and then back in the hills with Kareena in the dicky of their car . I am still thinking who wrote this.<br /><br />If you manage to sit till the last then the climax is too long with silly and unnecessary stunts . You can see all the heroes walking through the storm of bullets not hurt as if they are GOD . Are we still seeing a 2008 movie with all these technical heights achieved ? So no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan.<br /><br />Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar , If possible please ask for a preview of your movies after their first copy is out . As artists of such stature , you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and viewers . People still clap for you as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively . I think this kind of movie should not see the daylight as it hampers the reputation of all associated with the movie , the actors and the production house both .
0 First lesson that some film makers ( particularly those inspired by Hollywood ) need to know - just ' style ' does not sell . I guess Tashan when translated will mean style . Second , if you are hell bent on selling style , that does not spare you from having a decent story.<br /><br />Tashan has some story which could have sufficed with some better director . But it is not slick . For example , all three - Saif , Kareena and Akshay - are narrators at different points in the story . But this setup is not utilized to properly . There could have been a better mix and match of their narrations . Actions sequences are from the seventies.<br /><br />Cheoreography of the film is awful . I think Vaibhavi Merchant just sleep walked through this film . Vishal - Shekhar have put up a good score but it does not belong to this film . Why is there a sufi song ( Dil Haara ) in Tashan ? Why is the cool Hinglish song ( Dil Dance Maare ) not on Anil Kapoor when he is the one who is English crazy ? < br /><br />Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the film . But he is in his stereotyped self . You wo n't mind missing this film .
0 Shame on Yash Raj films and Aditya Chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap that s not even worth You Tube standards . I was gritting my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the schizophrenic direction , plot line that never quite materialized and on the last scene I just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati film makers can " THROW AWAY " crores on such stupidity . Shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to . Saif Ali Khan -completely disappointed in your choice of film . Kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and Akshay comes up as the dim - wit . Anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for English . His cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last 15 minutes , it was enough to pop a blood vessel . DON'T WASTe any brain cells , energy or your money to go see this- Go SEE / Rent AMU -with Konkana Sensharma instead- a beautiful piece of independent film that s ever come out of India . Intelligent , poignant and a wonderful story - tale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that all is not lost in Indian cinema making .
0 Summer season is here when the choices in the cinemas are limited to what 's the hottest movie of the week , given 99.9 % of the screens dedicated to screening it . OK , so I may exaggerate on the percentage , but you get my drift . Besides stuff from Hollywood , Bollywood too have their own share of highly anticipated blockbusters , and from some of the trailers shown , I 'm hyped to watch them too . Tashan was billed as one of THE most highly anticipated for 2008 , but I was quite surprised at the lower than low turnout at the cinemas . When I watched Jodha Akbar , it was a full house , but it was n't for Tashan.<br /><br />After watching it , I knew why . It was entertaining , but it was fundamentally weak . Just like it 's literal English title , which means " Style " , Tashan is all style , but little substance . Not that it does n't have the usual star power , but scenes felt forced , and some bordered on a tad ridiculous , even for Bollywood standards I must say . Which is quite surprising given that Tashan is directed and written by Vijay Krishna Acharya , who wrote Dhoom and Dhoom 2 , both of which I enjoyed tremendously . < br /><br />In his rookie directorial outing with Tashan , while you ca n't fault his direction , you 'd probably scratch your head over the plot , which was clunky at best . It tried to force too many things into the story , though credit be given where it allowed you some avenue to question character motivation , but that came a little too late , and only toward the finale , which left you guessing for just a moment before it latched into full blown action mimicking many a Thai action movie , with Hong Kong 's wirework and Hollywood 's ludicrous firearms and gunplay with zero recoil . And in a bid to include everything including the kitchen sink , you have an assortment of vehicles appearing , and the one that took the cake , in a Dhoom 2 homage , was the jetski boat in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />At best , Tashan can be enjoyed as unintentional comedy , and this is attributed to how the cast hammed up with their characters . Saif Ali Khan plays Jimmy Cliff , a call center executive who gives English tuition , only as a platform for fishing out new girlfriend material . His playboy ways gets junked aside when he meets with Pooja Singh ( Kareena Kapoor ) , who 's not exactly who she seems , the meek and sweet natured hottie . She engages Jimmy 's services for her boss , mobster Bhaiyyaji ( Anil Kapoor ) , who probably gets most of the laughs as he speaks broken English and phrases must like how an ah - beng does it . And to complete the quartet , Akshay Kumar plays Bachchan Pandey , an illiterate gangster for hire who got engaged by Bhaiyyaji to hunt down Jimmy and Pooja when they escape with money stolen from Bahiyyaji 's business.<br /><br />So begins a road trip of sorts , with friends who turned enemies , and enemies whom you know will become friends as the road trip wears on . Jimmy Cliff is probably the most implausible of all , because he goes from zero to hero , executing moves that would shame Rambo , in absolutely no time , which is quite out of character . Kareena Kapoor amps up the sex factor as she uses her charms to guile both men , and has plenty of opportunity to do so given the much touted bikini scenes , and other costumes that boast of plunging necklines or hemlines way above the knee . Every character has a backstory created , and I thought Akshay Kumar 's Bachchan Pandey was probably the best , the most touching and the most fun of the lot , even though his character seemed a lot like a non - green Incredible Hulk with his gravity - defying leaps and power packing punches . His wounds also heal automatically , which impressively puts Wolverine to shame . And the best part is his theme song , which is damn alpha - male and played in ra - ra mode each time he takes on adversaries.<br /><br />But sad to say , that 's the only tune that is memorable , something that cheers " Bachchan- Pandey - Bachchan - Pandey " . For most Bollywood movies I watch , I will usually be able to , despite the obvious language gaps , emerge from screenings humming a tune or two . I was n't able to do that after Tashan , because the songs unfortunately just were n't catchy at all . Usually the song / dance routine works well into the storyline without any necessity to bring the characters out of the current scene or location . That I enjoy , versus plucking them out and plonking them into extreme settings high atop a mountain , or atop jagged rocks on the beach front.<br /><br />Tashan probably did n't take itself too seriously , but coming from Vijay Krishna Acharya 's story , you probably wanted something a little more decent rather than the ridiculous , and for continuity to be a little more careful as well . Billed as a blockbuster , now I can start to understand why the crowds have already shunned this one . Despite Akshay Kumr stealing the show , Tashan could have been better on the whole .
0 The worst movie I have seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya . There is no story , no humor , no nothing ! The action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard Akshay Kumar Thumbs - Up advertisements stitched together . Heavily influenced from The Matrix and Kung - Fu Hustle but very poorly executed.<br /><br />I did not go a lot of expectations , but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder " What were these guys thinking??!!".<br /><br />The only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic Kareena in a bikini.<br /><br />The reason why I did not give a rating of ' 1 ' is that every time I think I have seen the worst , Bollywood proves me wrong .
0 Vijay Krishna Acharya 's ' Tashan ' is a over - hyped , stylized , product . Sure its a one of the most stylish films , but when it comes to content , even the masses will reject this one . Why ? The films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby . Script is king , without a good script even the greatest director of all - time can not do anything . Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner ' Yash Raj Films ' and Mega Stars appearing in it . But nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland . Thumbs down ! < br /><br />Performances : Anil Kapoor , is a veteran actor . But how could he okay a role like this ? Akshay Kumar is great actor , in fact he 's the sole saving grace . Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot . She looks stunning and leaves you , all stand up . Saif Ali Khan does n't get his due in here . Sanjay Mishra , Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted.<br /><br />'Tashan ' is a boring film . The films failure at the box office , should you keep away .
0 Kareena Kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmmm.<br /><br />Akshay Kumar ... <br /><br />Anil Kapoor .... <br /><br />Maybe Saif .... <br /><br />Kareena Kapoor in a bikini ..... <br /><br />Good Banner .. <br /><br />Kareena Kapoor in a bikini ..... <br /><br />Not one good reason not to see this movie .... <br /><br />Or so i thought ........ Did nt these people make JBJ ... <br /><br />Why o Why did i forget that.<br /><br />For all the criticism the first half of the movie is n't that bad ... <br /><br />There is some intrigue and YOU FEEL A SORT OF IRRITATION MIXED WITH EXCITEMENT THAT I FELT WHEN SEEING GUY RITCHIE MOVIES LIKE LOCK STOCK AND SNATCH.<br /><br />Kareena Kapoor is sizzling in a very skinny model sort of way.<br /><br />Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar as only he can be.<br /><br />Anil Kapoor is annoying but kind of funny , YOU ALMOST FORGET THAT MOST OF THE TIME YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND HIM.<br /><br />Saif is sidey ala Main Khiladi .. once again.<br /><br />There is the occasional laugh and a few chuckles , and a few goosebumps during the kareena - saif love story ( kareena in the rain , behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm).<br /><br />BUT MOSTLY THIS HALF PROMISES MORE THAN IT DELIVERS ..... <br /><br />WHICH MAKES THE SECOND HALF ALL THE MORE UNBEARABLE .... <br /><br />There was almost a cheer when the interval came not only because because of the wet kareena because of what people thought were the things to come.<br /><br />INSTEAD WE WERE TREATED TO MIND NUMBING TORTURE WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO PUT IN WORDS.<br /><br />Saif suddenly seam like a comic sidekick ... <br /><br />SUDDENLY THE SEXY KAREENA LOOKS ANOREXIC , YOU REALISE THAT THE SECOND LAST FLOOR IS NOW EMPTY AND HER FACE LOOKS TO BIG FOR HER BODY ( only girls can notice this and make other guys notice the second last floor was my observation).<br /><br />ANIL KAPOOR AND HIS SIDEKICKS GET ON YOUR NERVES.<br /><br />Akshay Kumar is the only one who carries off the madness to some extent but even he become intolerable after a while.<br /><br />ALL THE WHILE YOU ARE SUBJECTED TO ONE ABSURDITY AFTER THE OTHER.<br /><br />WHY ? ? ! !

0 The characters are unlikeable and the script is awful . It 's a waste of the talents of Deneuve and Auteuil .
0 " Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow " appears to take place in a spotless netherworld , an era long gone by , where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be in defying the law and getting a traffic ticket . It opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival , who pressures her into a car race . That 's about it for the drag - racing -- this B - flick is mostly concerned with rock ' n roll , man ! The folks at American International were obviously fond of decent , square teens who liked to party and yet did n't mind an adult chaperone . There are a few amusing double entendres and fruity exchanges ( Necking Kid : " We thought we 'd come out for some fresh air" ... Dad : " Where did you think you 'd find it , down her throat ? " ) , but the ghost is a little late in arriving . Brief at 65 minutes , the movie cheats us with a climactic car race that actually takes place off - screen and a pre-"Scooby Doo "- styled unmasking which makes no sense . However , for nostalgia buffs , some mindless fun . * * from * * * *
0 " Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow " was one of the many ' 50s movies about hot - rodding teens encountering the supernatural . In this case , the teens ca n't pay the rent for their hangout and get evicted . With nowhere else to go , they decide on an apparently haunted house . As you may have guessed , once they arrive , some weird things start happening . And there 's a twist at the end.<br /><br />There 's nothing in this movie that you have n't seen in other movies , but it 's nice entertainment nonetheless . My favorite character was the foul - mouthed parrot . Well , let me rephrase that : he did n't talk like a character in a Quentin Tarantino movie , but he said things that we do n't expect out of a bird . The movie 's pure hokum , but harmless .
0 Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical 1950 's teens in turmoil movie . It is not a horror or science fiction movie . Plot concerns a group of teens who are about to get kicked out of their " hot rod " club because they can not meet the rent . Once kicked out , they decide to try an old Haunted House . The only saving grace for the film is that the " ghost " ( Paul Blaisdell in the She Creature suit ) turns out to be an out of work movie monster played by Blaisdell .
0 I saw this movie at a drive - in in 1959 . Until " Howard the Duck " I considered this the worst movie I had ever seen . This movie tried to combine all the genera in one ; comedy , horror , teenage angst , and the hot rod that must have sired " My Mother , The Car . " Maybe it deserves a second viewing to see if it is an accurate reflection of it 's time .
0 A worn - out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally worn - out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out.<br /><br />With such an outstanding case , one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins . But scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity , no character arcs , and inexplicable behavior.<br /><br />The homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary -- or on the other hand , completely unexplored . It seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers . When will Hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture?<br /><br />A regrettably dreadful movie . When will Lauren Bacall pick a good one ? I expected better of her and Kristin Scott Thomas . This one is definitely one to miss .
0 This movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years . Not even woody Harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom.<br /><br />The murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not , nothing is of any interest . The cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful , I just sat in utter amazement during this movie , thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining < br /><br />The producers of this movie were very clever . They made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast . People will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think , Woody Harrison , Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this must be good and rent this movie.(boy are they in for a horrible time)<br /><br />If you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie , some people actually did enjoyed this movie but I like to watch a movie with meaning
0 This film is about a male escort getting involved in a murder investigation that happened in the circle of powerful men 's wives.<br /><br />I thought " The Walker " would be thrilling and engaging , but I was so wrong . The pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow , that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much . Seriously , the first hour could be condensed into ten minutes . That 's how slow it is.<br /><br />The fact that it lacks any thrills or action scenes aggravates the boredom . It 's almost shocking that even argument scenes are so plain and devoid of emotion . Maybe it is because of the stiff upper lip of the higher social class ? < br /><br />It 's sad that " The Walker " becomes such a boring mess , despite such a strong cast . Blame it on the poor plot and even worse pacing .
0 Plot is not worth discussion even if it hints at corruption , murder , power and the rest of thriller related topics . Characters are interesting though sometimes . Not realistic but interesting nevertheless.<br /><br />Development is slow like tea drinking ceremony . Visuals not stunning , but good enough to ease the eye strain . Good movie to watch after dinner before going to bed - nothing shocking too much , nothing overexciting . Movie sitcom style.<br /><br />I liked Woody - excellent performance . Had to fight the plot inadequacy and did the job pretty good . The rest are bearable though very predictable . The whole is watchable and better than most TV shows .
0 This film is one giant pant load . Paul Schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay . And his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process . < br /><br />The worst though is Woody Harrelson , whom I ordinarily like when he 's properly cast . He plays " the walker " , a homosexual man in D.C. who plays social companion to the bored wives of the Washington elite . He could n't have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick . His " southern accent " is that " off the rack " version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers , as though the heat and humidity of the South is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has . It is monotonous . But , his is not the worst accent in the movie . His " boyfriend " , played by Moritz Bleibtreau , attempts to affect some kind of a Mid East accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him . He is incapable of rolling his r 's in spite of the fact that in real life he is German , and speaks several languages - one of them being Italian ! That 's kind of a good reason to cast someone else do n't ya think ? < br /><br />From the story , to the screenplay , to the directing , to the camera work , to the performances by the leads , this movie is bad from beginning to end . The only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses : Lily Tomlin , Lauren Bacall , and Kristin Scott Thomas . Only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact . In fact , all three are excellent , in spite of being trapped in a really bad film . Ufortunately , no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws . If you like these three actresses , watch them in something else . This movie is not worth your time .
0 The film is bad . There is no other way to say it . The story is weak and outdated , especially for this country . I do n't think most people know what a " walker " is or will really care . I felt as if I was watching a movie from the 70 's . The subject was just not believable for the year 2007 , even being set in DC . I think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end . Most did n't stay for the Q&A either.<br /><br />I do n't think Schrader really thought the film out ahead of time . Many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just did n't know how to finish them . He jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on . I really did n't get Woody 's ( Carter ) private life or boyfriend either . What were all the " artistic " male bondage and torture pictures ( from Iraq prisons ) about ? What was he thinking ? I think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for Woody 's character ( Car ) . It did n't work . It did n't even seem to make sense really.<br /><br />The only good thing about this film was Woody Harrelson . He played his character ( Car ) flawlessly . You really did get a great sense of what a " walker " may have been like ( say twenty years ago ) . He was great and most likely will never get recognized for it . < br /><br />As for Lauren , Lily and Kristin ... Boring.<br /><br />Don't see it ! It is painful ! Unless you are a true Harrelson fan .
0 This film is mediocre at best . Angie Harmon is as funny as a bag of hammers . Her bitchy demeanor from " Law and Order " carries over in a failed attempt at comedy . Charlie Sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti - comedy . The only positive thing to come out of this mess is Charlie and Denise 's marriage . Hopefully that effort produces better results .
0 I do n't know who to blame , the timid writers or the clueless director . It seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars ( Angie , Charlie , Denise , Rosanna and Jon ) that there was n't enough left to really make a movie . This could have been very entertaining , but there was a veil of timidity , even cowardice , that hung over each scene . Since it got an R rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year - old woman and not Angie Harmon ? Why does Sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships WITH TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY ACTRESSES in the world ? If they were only looking for laughs why not cast Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead ? This was so predictable I was surprised to find that the director was n't a five year old . What a waste , not just for the viewers but for the actors as well .
0 The second attempt by a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a " Swedish " film - the first being Susan Sontag 's " Brother Carl " ( which was made in Sweden , with Swedish actors , no less ! ) The results ? Oscar Wilde said it best , in reference to Dickens ' " The Old Curiosity Shop " : " One would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of Little Nell . " Pretty much the same thing here . " Interiors " is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers . ( " I 'm afraid of my anger . " Looking into the middle distance : " I do n't like who I 'm becoming . " ) The directorial quotations ( to use a polite term ) from Bergman are close to parody . The incredibly self - involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are , to the point of strangulation . ( " I read a poem of yours the other day . It was in - I do n't know - The New Yorker . " " Oh . That was an old poem . I reworked it . " ) Far from not caring about these people , however , I found them quite hilarious . Much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from Allen 's earlier films - only he 's directed his actors to play the lines straight . Having not cast himself in the movie , he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all of his thespian tics , intonations , and neurotic habits , turning her into an embarrassing surrogate ( much like Kenneth Branagh in " Celebrity").<br /><br />The basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from Bergman 's " Winter Light , " the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst . It all comes through in the shopworn visual / aural tricks : the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper , the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach . etc , etc.<br /><br />Allen 's later " serious " films are less embarrassing , but also far less entertaining . I 'll take " Interiors . " Woody 's rarely made a funnier movie .
0 " It appears that many critics find the idea of a Woody Allen drama unpalatable . " And for good reason : they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of Bergman . And let 's not kid ourselves : critics were mostly supportive of Allen 's Bergman pretensions , Allen 's whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding . What I do n't get is this : why was Allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating Bergman , but the contemporaneous Brian DePalma was excoriated for " ripping off " Hitchcock in his suspense / horror films ? In Robin Wood 's view , it 's a strange form of cultural snobbery . I would have to agree with that .
0 When I was little my parents took me along to the theater to see Interiors . It was one of many movies I watched with my parents , but this was the only one we walked out of . Since then I had never seen Interiors until just recently , and I could have lived out the rest of my life without it . What a pretentious , ponderous , and painfully boring piece of 70 's wine and cheese tripe . Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors but Interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career . In the unmistakable style of Ingmar Berman , Allen gives us a dark , angular , muted , insight in to the lives of a family wrought by the psychological damage caused by divorce , estrangement , career , love , non - love , halitosis , whatever . The film , intentionally , has no comic relief , no music , and is drenched in shadowy pathos . This film style can be best defined as expressionist in nature , using an improvisational method of dialogue to illicit a " more pronounced depth of meaning and truth " . But Woody Allen is no Ingmar Bergman . The film is painfully slow and dull . But beyond that , I simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters . Instead I felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling , whining , nicotine stained , martyrs in a perpetual quest for identity . Amid a backdrop of cosmopolitan affluence and baked Brie intelligentsia the story looms like a fart in the room . Everyone speaks in affected platitudes and elevated language between cigarettes . Everyone is " lost " and " struggling " , desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them . It 's never about resolution , it 's only about interminable introspective babble . It is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience 's ability to connect . Woody Allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out . And for that reason I found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining . I see what he was going for but his insistence on promoting his message through Prozac prose and distorted film techniques jettisons it past the point of relevance . I highly recommend this one if you 're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death . Otherwise , let 's just pretend this film never happened .
0 Sorry everyone , , , I know this is supposed to be an " art " film , , but wow , they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch . Although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent , this story is too painful to watch . The absence of a sound track was brutal . The loooonnnnng shots were too long . How long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking ? Especially when the dialogue is two people complaining . I really had a hard time just getting through this film . The performances were excellent , but how much of that dark , sombre , uninspired , stuff can you take ? The only thing i liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene . Otherwise this was a ripoff of Bergman . And i 'm no fan f his either . I think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1/2 hours of this is , , well , lying .
0 This film lacked something I could n't put my finger on at first : charisma on the part of the leading actress . This inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man . Even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play . It could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors . I just do n't know.<br /><br />But could it have been the screenplay ? Just exactly who was the chef in love with ? He seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant , and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits , than of anybody or anything else . He never convinced me he was in love with the princess.<br /><br />I was disappointed in this movie . But , do n't forget it was nominated for an Oscar , so judge for yourself .
0 Airport ' 77 starts as a brand new luxury 747 plane is loaded up with valuable paintings & such belonging to rich businessman Philip Stevens ( James Stewart ) who is flying them & a bunch of VIP 's to his estate in preparation of it being opened to the public as a museum , also on board is Stevens daughter Julie ( Kathleen Quinlan ) & her son . The luxury jetliner takes off as planned but mid - air the plane is hi - jacked by the co - pilot Chambers ( Robert Foxworth ) & his two accomplice 's Banker ( Monte Markham ) & Wilson ( Michael Pataki ) who knock the passengers & crew out with sleeping gas , they plan to steal the valuable cargo & land on a disused plane strip on an isolated island but while making his descent Chambers almost hits an oil rig in the Ocean & loses control of the plane sending it crashing into the sea where it sinks to the bottom right bang in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle . With air in short supply , water leaking in & having flown over 200 miles off course the problems mount for the survivor 's as they await help with time fast running out ... <br /><br />Also known under the slightly different tile Airport 1977 this second sequel to the smash - hit disaster thriller Airport ( 1970 ) was directed by Jerry Jameson & while once again like it 's predecessors I ca n't say Airport ' 77 is any sort of forgotten classic it is entertaining although not necessarily for the right reasons . Out of the three Airport films I have seen so far I actually liked this one the best , just . It has my favourite plot of the three with a nice mid - air hi - jacking & then the crashing ( did n't he see the oil rig ? ) & sinking of the 747 ( maybe the makers were trying to cross the original Airport with another popular disaster flick of the period The Poseidon Adventure ( 1972 ) ) & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside , either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & it 's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character 's , dull dialogue , lethargic set - pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity . While the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & there 's not as much urgency as I thought there should have been . Even when the Navy become involved things do n't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but there 's just something lacking here . George Kennedy as the jinxed airline worker Joe Patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background.<br /><br />The home video & theatrical version of Airport ' 77 run 108 minutes while the US TV versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence , many more scenes with George Kennedy as Patroni , flashbacks to flesh out character 's , longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator . While I would like to see this extra footage I am not sure I could sit through a near three hour cut of Airport ' 77 . As expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices , I will say no more other than the toy plane model effects are n't great either . Along with the other two Airport sequels this takes pride of place in the Razzie Award 's Hall of Shame although I can think of lots of worse films than this so I reckon that 's a little harsh . The action scenes are a little dull unfortunately , the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as I reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly.<br /><br />The production values are alright if nothing spectacular . The acting is n't great , two time Oscar winner Jack Lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this , one time Oscar winner James Stewart looks old & frail , also one time Oscar winner Lee Grant looks drunk while Sir Christopher Lee is given little to do & there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too.<br /><br />Airport ' 77 is the most disaster orientated of the three Airport films so far & I liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly , the production & bland direction does n't help though & a film about a sunken plane just should n't be this boring or lethargic . Followed by The Concorde ... Airport ' 79 ( 1979 ) .
0 This is the kind of movie that my enemies content I watch all the time , but it 's not bloody true . I only watch it once in a while to make sure that it 's as bad as I first thought it was.<br /><br />Some kind of mobsters hijack a Boeing 747 . ( That , at least , is an improvement over having Boeing hijack a good part of the Pentagon . ) The airplane goes down in the Bermuda triangle and sinks pressurized to the bottoms , a kind of post - facto submarine.<br /><br />It has one of those all - star casts , the stars either falling or barely above the horizon.<br /><br />"We're on our own ! " , says pilot Jack Lemon . He is so right . Except for George Kennedy . He 's in all these disaster movies.<br /><br />Watch another movie instead . Oh , not " Airport " the original . That 's no good either . Instead , watch a decent flick about stuck airplanes like " Flight of the Phoenix . "
0 Towards the end of the movie , I felt it was too technical . I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea . I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers . I guess I should have figured that out before , but I never thought about it . Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is odd and not realistic . The acting was pretty good , since they 're mostly seasoned professionals , but if you 're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen , it should be more like a fantasy , comical , etc . Everything was taken too seriously . At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot , with Buck Rogers , the night stalker , and Dracula also on board . The movie was filled with well known faces . I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama , but it does hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature . That 's why I said it should have been more comical . My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about . They walk around with drinks , setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later , just as if they 're in a building or something , and acting as if turbulence just does n't exist . Also , I know it 's a disaster movie , but suspense does n't have to include a 30 second crash after hitting something . Anyway , the skilled actors and actresses keep this weak script from having been made into a movie that got canned after it 's first screening . I like Lee Grant , but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked ... : )
0 Capt . Gallagher ( Lemmon ) and flight attendant Eve Clayton ( Vaccaro ) are a supposedly hot item in this death trip ; a luxury 747 airliner decked out to look like a nightclub - slash - hotel ¬Ö  there 's even a blind piano player who falls in love . Karen Wallace ( Grant ) is the hysterical b!$3 & who 'll do anything to get attention from henpecked husband Martin ( Christopher Lee ) and , later , the rest of the people on board.<br /><br />Memorable Moments : Boeing 747 doing a belly flop in the Atlantic Ocean , Karen getting her chops busted when she goes too far , and furniture ( and screaming people ) who become ' ball bearings ' in a sinking ' pinball machine.'<br /><br />The action and rescue sequences here are relatively phenomenal , but not much goes on in between . Hitchcock was supposed to have directed this sequel , but I forget the reason why not ¬Ö  He would 've done wonders for the 1970 original , on which this sequel is partly inspired ( ' 77 also got inspiration from ` The Flight of the Phoenix ' ) . < br /><br />Actors Cotten and de Havilland reunite from their days on ` Hush , Hush , Sweet Charlotte ' ( apparently here they are not playing heavies , just reunited ¬ëAutumn Years ' lovers ) . And is n't the actress playing Emily 's companion the same one who played the hammered - to - death maid on ` Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?'<br /><br />TV actors include the girlfriend from ` Mayberry RFD ' ( her character 's daughter wins a drawing contest , or something lame like that ) , ` Buck Rogers ' Gil Gerard and ` Dynasty 's ' Pamela Bellwood.<br /><br / >
0 Although the production and Jerry Jameson 's direction are definite improvements , " Airport ' 77 " is n't much better than " Airport 1975 " : slick , commercial rubbish submerging ( this time literally ) a decent cast . Jack Lemmon is the pilot of a packed airliner which gets hijacked by art thieves and crashes into the sea ( all the publicity claimed it was near the Bermuda Triangle , but there 's no mention of it in the film itself ) . When the rescue ships come to raise the airplane out of the water , we see all their cranes dropping ( rather blindly ) into the ocean and it 's hard not to laugh ( imagining the cranes plugging the plane , the passengers and the waterlogged script ) . NBC used to air what appeared to be the " director 's cut " , with at least an hour of extra footage -- mostly flashbacks -- injected into the proceedings with all the subtlety of a " Gilligan 's Island " episode . Most exciting moment is the plane crash , and some of the players have a little fun : Lee Grant is an obnoxious drunk , Brenda Vaccaro a no - nonsense stewardess , Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland are flirting oldsters . Still , the personality conflicts and the excruciating military detail eventually tear at one 's patience . * * from * * * *
0 I saw this piece of garbage on AMC last night , and wonder how it could be considered in any way an American Movie Classic . It was awful in every way . How badly did Jack Lemmon , James Stewart and the rest of the cast need cash that they would even consider doing this movie ?
0 Hmmm , a sports team is in a plane crash , gets stranded on a snowy mountain , and is faced with the difficult decision to eat the flesh of their dead companions in order to survive . Sound familiar anyone ? I refer to " Alive " from 1993 . The only major difference here , of course , is that a big , white , drunken scare crow of a Yeti shows up a few times to drag off the dead . I guess humans taste better than yaks.<br /><br />Stupid : The man in the first scene does not have a reliable firearm when hunting the Yeti , nor does he have a backup.<br /><br />The plane crash is completely bogus . It would have either exploded in the air , exploded when it hit the ground , or become obliterated . The people would not have survived , but hey , it 's sci - fi.<br /><br />Stupid : They survived , and they are cold . It might be a good idea to harness some of the burning debris nearby so as not to freeze to death . Fire being warm as it is ... <br /><br />WTF : The pilot has frost formed all over his face while he 's alive and talking , but oddly enough , no one else does.<br /><br />Stupid : One of the guys tells the others to look for matches and lighters , but there are scattered parts of the plane ON FIRE all around them.<br /><br />Stupid : They find coats and hoodies , and yet there in the cold of the Himalayas , they fail to use the hoods!<br /><br />Stupid : They 're staring at a pile of sticks when , I reiterate , there are pieces of the plane ALREADY BURNING.<br /><br />Stupid : The Himalayas are notorious for its storms . It would be common sense for them to collect the debris in order to reinforce their structure rather than sitting outside bickering . There are a lot of pine trees around , the branches of which make excellent insulation.<br /><br />WTF : When in doubt , use a dead man 's arm as a splint.<br /><br />WTF : If the one guy knows so much about the hibernation habits of squirrels , bears , and leopards in the Himalayas , then why does n't he know enough to make shelter and set traps right from the start ? < br /><br />Stupid : When attempting to trap wild animals , mindless conversation in the vicinity of said trap always helps.<br /><br />WTF : Do you know how hard it would be to cut a frozen corpse with a shard of glass ? ! < br /><br />WTF : The group was ready and armed to fight the Yeti while the other two were standing there defenseless . The Yeti ripped out the guy 's heart and stomped the girl 's head , and the gang did nothing . There 's love.<br /><br />So two Yetis and a convenient avalanche to bury the evidence forever .... or so we think . Mwuhahahaa ! The story continues into more idiocy but the most action occurs in the last 15 minutes , as usual . Nice thinking with the javelin and the chain , although this is some ingenuity ( with the magically - appearing chain ) that they lacked in the beginning of the movie when they could n't even make fire despite the fact that it was all around them.<br /><br />As is typical for the Sci - Fi Originals , the loving couple kisses at the end like nothing horrible has just happened to them ( not to mention they ate human flesh and have n't brushed their teeth in several days).<br /><br />The very end , however , is quote lame .
0 Yeti : Curse of the Snow Demon starts aboard a plane full of American high school teens who are on their way to play a football game in Japan , unfortunately during a fierce thunder storm their plane crashes in the Himalayas . Unlucky really . With some dead & some alive the survivors have to think about themselves & decide to wait it out until help comes . However just when they think their luck could n't get any worse they soon discover that a huge , hairy Yeti type Abominable Snowman creature wants to kill & eat them all . Trapped , cold , starving & fighting for survival will help reach the stranded teens in time?<br /><br />Yeah , with a title like Yeti : Curse of the Snow Demon it can only mean one thing & that is that someone at the Sci - Fi Channel has made yet another ' Creature Feature ' although to give these things a bit of variety the Sci - Fi Channel here in the UK are now dubbing them as a ' Beast Feast ' ! As if that will make any difference . Directed by Paul Ziller one has to say that Yeti : Curse of the Snow Deamon is a terrible film but a somewhat entertaining one at the same time , sure it 's bad but it 's sort of fun at times too . The basic premise is alright actually , it 's a sort of cross between Alive ( 1993 ) with it 's plane crash & the survivors having to turn cannibal to survive & the excellent gory killer Bigfoot ( another legendary hairy monster ) exploitation flick Night of the Demon ( 1980 ) which I would defend with my last breath & I have to say it 's not exactly a marriage made in heaven but as I said it 's fun at times if not exactly gripping or well written . The character 's are mostly annoying American teens , there 's the expected arguing , there 's the macho hero , the strong female & the coward who thinks only of himself so there 's no prizes for originality . There are some plot holes too , if a plane load of people crash why only send two rangers on foot to search for them ? How are you going to dig a large hole & line it with sharpened sticks in the space of ten minutes ? Why did the Yeti not kill that bird at the end ? It had killed everyone else up to that point so why not her ? The ' there are actually two Yeti 's running around ' twist is n't used to any effect at all either . At least there 's a good pace about the film , it certainly moves along at a fair old pace & I never found myself becoming bored with it . There 's some moderately gory action & the film does have some fascination in seeing whether the kids are going to survive or not & if they are going to eat their dead mates or not.<br /><br />The one thing you can always say about these Sci - Fi Channel ' Creature Features ' or ' Beast Feasts ' is that the CGI computer effects will be laugh out loud hilarious & so that proves to be the case yet again . The plane crash at the start looks awful & the Yeti when it 's CGI looks simply embarrassing jumping all over the place like it 's on a pogo stick . There one or two nice gore scenes including a ripped off arm , a squashed head , a ripped out heart , some dead bodies , some blood splatter & the best bit when the Yeti rips a guy in half & beats him with his own ripped - off legs before biting a big chunk out of them . According to the IMDb the actor playing the Yeti took three & a half hours to get into the suit & the make - up which seems like a long time since it 's actually a pretty tatty looking creation . Apparently the original title was Raksha : Curse of the Snow Demon with Raksha meaning demon in Tibetan Sanskrit , so now you know.<br /><br />This has reasonable production values considering the usual Sci - Fi Channel stuff they churn out although the mountain location looks nothing like the harsh , bleak Himalayas & was probably situated near some ski resort somewhere & during a lot of the daytime scenes it actually looks pleasantly warm . The acting is n't that good & I did n't think any of the girls looked that good either which did n't help.<br /><br />Yeti : Curse of the Snow Demon is another terrible Sc - Fi Channel ' Creature Feature ' if I am honest that any sane person will not like but if your looking for a bit of horror themed fun then this is n't too bad & there are one or two entertaining moments that make it somewhat watchable even if it 's not very good .
0 Ah yez , the Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti another abominable movie . I was particularly taken by the scenes immediately following the crash where , as the survivors desperately searched for matches , at least a half dozen fires burned ¬ñ with no apparent reason ¬ñ at various points of the wreckage . Fire seemed to be a predominate theme throughout . They searched corpses for lighters and matches , and finally finding a box built a fire every day for , apparently , 12 , but no one ever gathered wood . Then when the vegan ( hah ) burned the bodies , what did she use for an accelerant ? I mean these guys were frozen ¬ñ well maybe not . Despite the apparent low temperature everything the yeti ate , bled . Maybe it 's just me , but even in a totally unbelievable tale ( none of the survivors had ever heard of a yeti , or an abominable snowman , until the very end ) , if you take care of the little things the bigger deals become more acceptable . Oh , what did the prologue ( 1972 ) have to do with the remainder of the movie ? And the revolver , warm enough to hold in his hand , froze up and would n't fire . Gimme a break . Well , at least we have Carly Pope , another eminently lovely Canadian lass . And , with little irony , Ed Marinaro as the coach.<br /><br />Well I might as well add , the rabbit they ate ( despite it looking like chicken ) is not a rodent , but a lagomorph . Now if it had been a squirrel ( or a rat ) it would have been a rodent , but it still looked like chicken . And the writers missed a real chance to have someone note " It tastes just like ... "
0 First off , I 'm not here to dog this movie . I find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality . The acting herein is about as abominable as the monster stalking them , although the monster itself is quite well done ... impressively well done , at that . He actually looks kind of other - worldly , like an alien family on vacation landed in the Himalayas and while dad was out taking a ... attending to nature 's call , Spot got loose and they just did n't have time to hunt him down . That , or he 's the Caucasian brother of the Wishmaster . I have n't decided which.<br /><br />Actually , this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow country , yes , but more likely Canada somewhere than China anywhere . The trees and vistas say Canada to me , and it 's okay that the set area never takes on the look or feel of uber - coldness one might expect to find in the Himalayas of China . It 's a Sci - Fi Channel movie , so we can forgive the lack of location.<br /><br />Further , apparently ( as we have just established ) Sci - Fi directors do not travel often , as they are not aware that commercial planes fly above weather like what is featured herein and the subsequent crash actually would not have happened . But as I said , it 's a Sci - Fi Channel movie so we must forgive a few things.<br /><br />The movie is pretty graphic at times , and rotates between " Alive " about the Donner Party , " Predator " about the alien in the woods , and any bad wushu movie where they fly about on wires . The Yeti apparently can leap about like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... remember ? " Run faster ! Jump higher ! Live longer ! " < br /><br />Also , the Yeti has missed his teddy bear . He 's searched high and low for it , but can not seem to make a cadaver work . Poor Yeti ! You ca n't help but feel sorry for it . It has survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to severe teddy bear loss . He 's missed his bear . Or maybe it wants to mate , but that thought is BANISHED ! Do ya hear me ? Well , it does seem to be an unmated male . REBANISHED ! < br /><br />And it 's superhuman . Well , it 's not human ... it 's super - Yeti ! But then again , what 's normal - Yeti ? I do n't know , but he has a definite Michael Meyers quality that is completely unsettling . And he 's got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur . FABulous Dahlink ! It 's spotlessly white at times when it SO should n't be . He 's fastidiously superhu- ... super - Yeti.<br /><br />All in all ? This was a lot of fun to watch , has some great kills and a few honest plot elements . In spite of the horribly gravel - like production style , this is actually quite entertaining . I ca n't help wondering if they 're planning on another one ? < br /><br />It rates a 6.0/10 on the M4TV Scale.<br /><br />It rates a 4.4/10 on the Movie Scale from ... <br /><br />the Fiend : .
0 Having watched this movie on the SciFi channel , I can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives . The film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences , or " delights " as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me . The plot is n't really worth commenting as , but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into Yeti territory . Before the movie is over , we are treated to yetis ripping hearts out , yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters , yetis ripping a man 's legs off and beating him with them , a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin , a yeti surviving several bullets and being set on fire with no apparent harm , a yeti dangling off a cliff by holding to a man 's shoe , yet then jumps off , and a whole collection of further , bizarre occurrences . Basically , if you are n't staying up on a Saturday for the expressed purpose of watching the worst of SciFi channel original movies , avoid this film like the plague . Or as my friend reading over my shoulder says : " It 's the best movie I have ever seen . " To which the friend on my right says : " Only battle techno music could have made it better . "
0 I had the misfortune to watch this rubbish on Sky Cinema Max in a cold winter night . I am not a big fan of horror movies , because most of them are just trash . This one is even worse : it is one of the dumbest pieces of crap i 've ever seen in my whole life . Horror movie ? Yes , there are horrible things in this : the acting , the script and the special effects - Gosh , i laughed at this ludicrous attempt to make a flick for 90 minutes . Actually , had it been a comic movie i would 've given it a 5 . Do n't you even think about renting this unless you want to mock at the producers.<br /><br />Vote : 2 out of 10 - did n't vote one because it made me laugh all the time ;-)
0 Cameron Diaz is a woman who is married to a judge , played by Harvey Keitel , whose life is fine until an ex shows up and things get a little complicated .. While I was watching this movie there were several times i asked myself why I was doing so .. because the movie is so ridiculous and blah and poorly scripted without any believability . Nor does the audience really car what happens .. Even the lovely Cameron ca n't save this one on a scale of one to ten .. 2
0 Turgid dialogue , feeble characterization - Harvey Keitel a judge ? He plays more like an off - duty hitman - and a tension - free plot conspire to make one of the unfunniest films of all time . You feel sorry for the cast as they try to extract comedy from a dire and lifeless script . Avoid !
0 The next time you are at a party and someone asks , " The other day I heard the expression ' Author 's will ' . Does anyone know what it means ? " Tell them to sit through ' Head Above Water ' . The only way Diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by bad writers . There are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs . However the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis . Why does Keitel tie Diaz 's hand in front of her instead of behind ? Why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course . For me the best part of this movie was that I saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop .
0 Have I ever seen a film more shockingly inept ? I can think of plenty that equal this one , but none which manage to outdo it . The cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue . I am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this . Each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot , but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career . Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz do n't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this . Avoid , it 's obviously a style of film that Americans have n't really got a grasp of . Watch the final result if you must , and you 'll see what I 'm talking about , but DON'T say I did n't warn you ...
0 It was a Sunday night and I was waiting for the advertised movie on TV . They said it was a comedy ! The movie started , 10 minutes passed , after that 30 minutes and I did n't laugh not even once . The fact is that the movie ended and I did n't get even on echance to laugh . PLEASE , someone tickle me , I lost 90 minutes for nothing .
0 Jude Law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value . Completely lacking in eroticism , excitement , or leading ladies with appeal . One decent fight , a few moments of mild suspense . And a one - note plot.<br /><br />The movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between Law 's character and a dogged homicide detective , well played by Timothy Spall . But despite their best efforts , both actors are staked to the cross of the film 's banality.<br /><br />With a lesser actor in the lead role -- and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis 's cinematography -- Crocodiles would blend into the sea of low - budget vampire quickies .
0 This movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning , but never fleshed out to it 's expectations . The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas ( typical of the Asian directors ) , but does n't know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it . The story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film , never finding a solid , explainable , interesting angle . Basically , the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases . The acting was very good , however . All the actors gave good performances , and Jude Law was outstanding as he is always is . It is too bad he chose to do such a weak film .
0 The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor , a holocaust survivor , part of Mengele 's experiments on twins , consisting primarily her version of what happened at Auschwitz , and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments . The movie obviously had great reviews . It 's one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about.<br /><br />I too , for a large part of the movie , got sucked into the emotion that the movie - maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on . One of the user reviews on IMDb by Eric Monder ( obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum ) could only find the sweetest nectar . " In one of the many dramatic sequences , as a group of Jews argue with Kor at a Jewish center , the meaning of the word " forgive " is even debated , but the isolated and outnumbered Kor holds her own " But by this time , the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that I could see clearly once more . After the " strong - willed " Eva Kor forgives her " Nazi captors " the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about , at least from the viewpoint of Kor . The movie goes about following her , past her public statement forgiving the Nazis and into new territory . To me , this was the meat of the movie , surrounded by inedible fat of her " act of forgiveness " . Obviously , it was a very sick cow.<br /><br />On a mission to test her theory of forgiveness , in order to heal wounds of the past , she makes her way to the " promised land " to meet with some Arabs , to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue can not lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with Jews in the US on her act of forgiving the Nazis , including one at a Jewish center in Chicago . From then on , anyone not so teary eyed that they ca n't see the screen will find it hard - pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements.<br /><br />Firstly , you immediately notice her body language , defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers . Her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time , effort and money the entire act was . A rather annoyed Dr Sami Advan ( Professor of education at Bethlehem University ) gets it just right when he tells Kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment.<br /><br />Finally , the debate at the Jewish center in Chicago , where she is " grilled " on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so , in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts.<br /><br />I will cut to the chase . By the end of the movie , I was hoping I had n't chosen to watch the movie . The movie was badly made , failing to delve deeper into anything about Auschwitz apart from the purely trivial , just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears . It showed that Kor , the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion . Her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness ( at best ) to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate.<br /><br />Lastly , is everyone so retarded today that they ca n't notice the difference between making peace and forgiving ? Quoting another IMDb user , " I do n't see her forgiveness as being weak- quite the contrary , she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul , she wanted the suffering to be over , so she let it go . " That would be the perfect layman 's definition of MAKING PEACE.<br /><br />I guess , in a world of propaganda , blind faith and political correctness , there is no room to question those that have " gone through more than the human mind can fathom".<br /><br />P.S. The dictionary certainly should go into all those Books - to - buy lists everyone keeps making .
0 Absolutely fantastic . < br /><br />Now , before a legion of cinema purists choke on their latt√©s , allow me to elaborate . Much as I enjoyed it , this is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen and is certainly the worst film I 've seen at the cinema ( an impressive claim , as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen ) . The two leads ( Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert ) were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst . Of course , they were n't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence . The plot ( to stretch the term slightly ) was thin to non - existent and the ' gore ' scenes , whilst undoubtedly brutal , were irrelevant and laughably formulaic . What plot there is revolves around a twenty - something model ( Cuthbert ) who is abducted , imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures , both psychological and physical . The torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience . Whilst there really are very , very few positives to draw from this film , its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film . I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema . Within twenty minutes , the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout . For my part I came out flushed with laughter , buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film - making . Whichever way you look at it , this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film.<br /><br />P.S. I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film free ... so I can afford to laugh about it . I was still tempted to ask for my money back ... it really was THAT bad .
0 The only reason I give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days such that it has at least something to comment on.<br /><br />This film is asinine . It 's like so many other 21st century grind house fodder . The gore is gratuitous and simply revolting . I did n't care about any of the characters , but I did care that some cretin bothered to pen this crap : I 'd complain about the money I spent , but my date and I wisely left after 40 minutes and went to an adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining " Live Free or Die Hard , " which probably got a much higher rating from me simply because I endured the utter poop of " Captivity " for 40 minutes .
0 I 'll keep this short ; thanks to Greg for helping me to put this succinctly : Captivity is about a guy who drugs a girl 's drink , imprisons and tortures her , then poses as a captive to have sex with her . That is the single twist and punchline of the film . It 's torture as slow motion date rape . And , it 's not even a good movie . It 's not so bad it 's good ; it 's just bad.<br /><br />It should also be mentioned that among critics , there is a " spoiler code " that they dare not break , even though some were tempted to on this one because it is so vile . Why NO ONE had the cojones to step up and say , " this is garbage , and this is why , " is beyond me.<br /><br />Don't give your money to these poop - peddlers .
0 When thinking about Captivity many words come to mind . Among them are : uninteresting , unentertaining , unsuspensful , unsexy , unfathomable , and unwatchable.<br /><br />I used to hate those movies from the mid to late nineties that were basically ripoffs of Scream but these new Saw knockoffs are beginning to make those films look like classics . They still pander to the same demographic that those other movies were so successful at doing , but now they add a new level of degeneracy that make the twelve to fourteen year old girls they 're aimed at feel like they 're hardcore AND hip.<br /><br />This movie is a load of boring crap ! What the hell has happened to Larry Cohen ? His name has n't been attached to anything good since 1993 ! Even so , I was still surprised to see that he had anything to do with something THIS bad ! Was anyone surprised when the movie 's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths ? Did anyone not know it when they first saw him ? Only someone who has never before in his or her life , ever seen another movie !
0 It 's one of those dramas that 's so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny , the script is absolutely dire , direction appalling , lighting purely armature , the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it 's good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad ; it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard , but does n't at least destroy any speeches . There 's continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout . And finally last but not least the acting is appalling . For a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to this .
0 Frankly I 'm rather incensed that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to Steven Smith I wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering . Have they all been written by his pals ? The action clunks along , the music is irritating and over used , the script is simply dire and the actors ( with the exception of the gardener ) mediocre at best . I do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying it 's brilliant when it 's not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i.e. continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture . Yes , it 's his first film , low budget etc . - I get it , but it 's also out there for members of the public to purchase and it 's just not up to scratch .
0 Happened upon a copy of this . Not mine and if I had spent my own money on this I 'd be finding those responsible and demanding it back ! All I can say is this would be a terrible student film . Any understanding of the medium of film is absent . Acting is god awful , the story would have been rejected from the original Twilight Zone series as unoriginal and lame , and the change in tone of the lead character 's reaction to the ' ghost ' is laughable.<br /><br />I can only agree that the ' glowing ' reviews of this film are from friends and family . I 'm afraid it 's not even entertainingly bad.<br /><br />Amateur in the extreme ! < br /><br />Avoid ! Avoid ! Avoid !
0 I 'm basing this on my observations of one episode I saw last night ( 9/27/06 ) . I do n't think I 'll be watching again . The acting was totally wooden , the plot completely predictable , the ending totally unrealistic -- I mean who would believe a 30 million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer ? The lead actor ( Victor Garber ) seemed so uncomfortable , almost embarrassed in his role -- perhaps he realized how bad the writing was ! ! I fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor , but they can surely find better writers . Maybe they are outsourcing the writing to India or China ! ! I 'll bet we wo n't be seeing this one next season !
0 To be honest i had heard this was pretty bad before i decided to watch it , but i 'm never one to let others influence my viewings , in fact i 'm more likely to watch something out of defiance!. Bullwhip had one thing going for me before the viewing anyway , the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those gorgeous eyes was in it had me interested right away . The picture is n't very good , and is in fact very morally dubious , all the characters are corrupt and shifty in one way shape or form , all motivated by greed or egocentric victories , this is all well and good if the surrounding film can do justice to a bunch of despicable people and create a taut climax shuddering picture . Sadly it does n't , and as the finale fills your eyes with sugar you ca n't help shouting out that you have been cheated into watching a pretty bad film , nobody in the cast come out with any credit , with lead man Guy Madison painfully wooden in the extreme.<br /><br />Not even the lovely Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone , 3/10
0 This is a well - worn story about a man who marries to escape the hangman 's noose , then sets about " taming " his reluctant bride . It manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time . We never find out , for example , why a woman who won the respect of an Indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband . Or why the members of her team are so eager to get a " real man " in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own . This only made sense in fifties Hollywood.<br /><br />There 's a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whip -- the second time -- then yanks her off her horse . Never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye , which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip ! Then , he prevails in a fight against her Indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp . That 's some second wind . Later , he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty Indians ( as they all are in these flicks ) after they reject her now she 's his " squaw " . Never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and she 's been negotiating with them for years . And the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on him -- yeah , right . Like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail.<br /><br />Finally , neither of the leads is convincing in their roles . Madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky . Fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot , but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy . The only reason you 'd root for her is because you want to see Madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the film 's end . The way that Madison tames Fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blow - up dolls . Even if you do see them as dolls , the total lack of suspense will bore you.<br /><br />Total waste of time . Even the scenery 's kinda dull . Give this one a big miss .
0 " Do n't bother to watch this film " would be better advice , if you like Marilyn Monroe in her other roles . This was a huge disappointment considering the great cast , not just Marilyn.<br /><br />The story was just nothing , certainly nothing like described on the VHS box , of course . There simply was no suspense , precious little excitement and too many dull spots , most of them trying to show why " Nellie " ( Monroe ) was so messed up . This was not a good role for Monroe , even though I did n't need to see this character to know she could act . " Some Like It Hot " alone was good enough evidence for me . But this role just did n't fit her and it 's no surprise it was n't one of her more popular films.<br /><br />It 's also too bad a film had the waste of the talents of actors like Richard Widmark , Anne Bancroft , Elisha Cook Jr. , Jeanne Cagney , Donna Cocoran and others . < br /><br />Summary : it 's not entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game .
0 Now I 'll be the first to admit it when I say something that may be blasphemous or unfair , so I would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much I disliked this movie.<br /><br />That about sums it up too . I disliked this movie . To be more specific , I disliked the concept of this movie . The cinematography was good . The mood was nice . And the acting was satisfactory.<br /><br / > However , the story is fatuous , unacurate and misleading . It is also offensive.<br /><br />I am a quarter Cree Indian , and for some reason I feel insulted , on a personal level , by the nature of Whitaker 's character . First of all , he 's a black guy . And this is n't a racist remark , I swear . The thought of a White , Hispanic or even Native American swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents . The katana represents the soul of a Samurai , imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the Samurai . For Ghost Dog to use his guns instead of the Katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside , and where the heck did he get a Katana anyway ? It must be one of those replicas , which insults the Samurai caste even more.<br /><br />Also , Ghost Dog showed no honor . Near the end of the movie , he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain . Not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy , it 's more like a ninjas way ; silent assassins ; a group that samurais deny exists , but hates none - the - less.<br /><br />Then he tries to kill his boss , when he finds out his boss is a baddie . You know what a true Samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable ? He kills himself , to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master.<br /><br />Everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all Samurai adhere to : Bushido.<br /><br />So , we have great cinematography , good ambiance and so - so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise , ( which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it ) , making it an unsatisfactory overall film , and an insult to everything a honorable bushi(samurai ) holds dear.<br /><br / > 2.5/10 Bleah
0 Spoilers < br /><br />Well , the one line summary says it all . Melville¬¥s " Le samurai " is the original and there are elements of " Leon " . And they are better - much better!<br /><br />In the " Samurai " Alain Delon is a lonely warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs ( with so much suspense in these scenes ! ) . Even the end is exactly the same : the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand . The world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it.<br /><br />Delon is not killing so many people like the Ghost dog . But I guess Jarmusch liked " Leon " very much or even " Desperado " by Rodriguez . So he added this , too . And let me guess : the girl will become a professional like Ghost dog ( like Natalie Portman in " Leon")?<br /><br />So what was Jarmusch thinking after all ? Where is the unique , the original thought in this movie?<br /><br />I can¬¥t see the point in making carbon ( celluloid ) copies.<br /><br />A 4/10 rating by Macaulay Connor
0 I remembered the title so well . To me , it was a Flora Robson movie with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in supporting roles . And it had Vincent Massey 's voice from behind whiskers . Well Flora Robson was great . Her next signature , for me , would be " 55 Days at Peking " . The same role but with different sumptuous gowns . And the same voice . As for the Armada , it was a subtext . I like black - and - white films . Was everything done in Elizbethan times at night ? It was talky and difficult to fathom , at times . I could n't tell which was the love interest . Was it the Spaniard or was it Vivien Leigh ? And I do not believe that Elizabeth I would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that fire ships be sent against the Armada . Apparently it worked for the Empire , but not for the script . This might have been more accurate , historically , but Bette Davis had more engaging scripts . And I missed daylight !
0 Other than the great cinematography by the marvelous James Wong Howe in the battle scenes , this film is a true stinker.<br /><br />This is the second film that I 've seen in recent days directed by Alexander Korda . The first was Charles Laughton 's " Rembrandt . " It was so lousy that I shut it off . This one I 'm afraid is not very much better.<br /><br />Flora Robson is as ugly as ever as Queen Elizabeth . Perhaps , her performance as the virgin Queen was good for 1937 standards but when you compare it to that of a Helen Mirren , it is absolutely no match . In robotic fashion , Robson states her lines . Her battle message to the English troops is so lackluster in spirit.<br /><br />Even a dashing Laurence Olivier ca n't save this utter piece of boredom.<br /><br />Future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here and she does n't really convey anything here . To think , that Scarlett was 2 years later!<br /><br />It 's a shame that history with the Spanish Armada is made out to be so boring in this film .
0 When Sam Peckinpah 's superlative THE WILD BUNCH ( 1969 ) opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra - violence , it did so with a talented ( if whisky - marinated ) hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth , but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by Peckinpah 's epic , and SOLDIER BLUE definitely falls into that category.<br /><br />SOLDIER BLEW , er , BLUE tells the story of foul - mouthed New Yorker Cresta Lee ( Candice Bergen ) a blonde proto - hippie chick who 's been " rescued " from two years of " captivity " among the Cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she 'll be reunited with the fianc√©e she only wants to marry for his money . Also on board the wagon she 's traveling in is a shipment of government gold , cash the Cheyenne need to buy guns with , so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and Cresta flees to the hills , accompanied by Honus Gant ( Peter Strauss ) , the lone surviving cavalryman . Calling Gant by the snarky nickname " Soldier Blue , " Cresta demonstrates that her years among the " savages " was time well spent , outstripping Gant in survival skills , common sense , and sheer balls , and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements , a band of hostile Kiowa , an unscrupulous trader ¬ó played by Donald Pleasance , here giving one of his most ridiculous performances , and that 's saying something ¬ó and , in the tradition of many previous western - set romantic comedies , each other.<br /><br />During the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably ¬ó and predictably ¬ó attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on ¬ó while Gant has a freshly- treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg , no less ¬ó in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that was n't filled with rattlesnakes , mountain lions , or who knows what , to say nothing of the Cheyenne , who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment ( there I go , thinking in NYC real estate terms again ) . < br /><br />Realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave , Cresta leaves Gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge wo n't spare a couple of men so they can rescue Gant ; the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby Cheyenne village , and once Cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby - to - be and makes a beeline straight to the Cheyenne to warn them of what 's coming . < br /><br />What happens next is what gained the film its infamy ; it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead - in to a hideous reenactment of the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre , an orgy of rape , torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of " keeping the country clean , " and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty . Children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets , unarmed people are beheaded ¬ó a nice effect , I have to admit ¬ó women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes , then raped and mutilated ¬ó in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight , so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts , which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act ¬ó and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered , their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs . No joke , this scene would instantly garner an NC-17 rating if released today , to say nothing of possibly spurring Native American interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted.<br /><br />I'm all in favor of westerns that do n't shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won , or stolen if truth be told , but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be ; one minute it 's a heavy - handed pseudo - hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up ( well , DUH ! ) , then it 's a light - hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein Cresta proves herself five times the man Gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho ( with no undies ) , but that all goes out the window when Donald Pleasance shows up with an unintentionally ( ? ) hilarious pair of buck - toothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a sub - plot that goes nowhere , all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax . Any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film , but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film 's promotion and poster imagery . < br /><br />But by trying to be all things to all audiences , SOLDIER BLUE ends up as an incoherent , preachy Mulligan stew of presumably well - intentioned political correctness , but if they were going to tell the story of the Sand Creek Massacre , would n't it have been a good idea to have some Indian characters who were more than just walk - ons with Murphy Brown acting as their mouthpiece ? We get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing " the most savage film in history . " If you , like me , were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its " daring to tell it like it was , " take my word for it and let SOLDIER BLUE slowly fade into cinematic obscurity .
0 First of all , this film can be divided into three segments . A promising opening , with the ambushing of some cavalry by the Cheyenne . This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section , with the totally miscast Candice Bergen and " Soldier Blue " traveling together to reach the safety of an Army garrison . Miss Bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth , and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s Jack Nicholson movie . I mean she maintains zero interest , with zero believability . The third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an Indian village . This is so obviously overdone to lay on the anti - war propaganda , that it comes across as simply long , outrageous , and contrived . Not recommended . - MERK ................................ Jacobe ( comment above ) Here 's an idea . Why do n't you actually watch the movie you are commenting on , instead of chirping your liberal nonsense . This is not a political site , it is for reviewing films . - MERK
0 Soldier Blue is a movie with pretensions : pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man 's inhumanity to man , on the white man 's exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples ; a biting , unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of Vietnam . Well , sorry , but it fails miserably to be any of those things . What Soldier Blue actually is is pernicious , trite , badly made , dishonest rubbish.<br /><br />Another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies . What it is basically is a lame , clich√©d , poorly acted " odd couple " romance - Strauss and Bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other 's lifestyle and falling in love ( ah , bless ) - bookended by two sickening massacres which would n't have been out of place in a Lucio Fulci splatter flick.<br /><br />There is no excuse for the repulsive , prurient , gore - drenched climax , in which cute little native American children are variously shot , sliced , dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close - up , and large - breasted native American women are molested , raped and strung up - no excuse , that is , except box office . ( The massacre itself , whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention , is very badly staged and shot ; a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them , intercut with a few special - effects sequences of beheading / dismemberment - dismemberments , incidentally , which utilised real amputees in their filming . Now that 's what I call exploitation.)<br /><br />Forget all the pap you 've heard ( including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie ) about this being a " protest " , an indictment of American brutality towards the native peoples . This film does n't give a stuff about the plight of the Cheyenne ; had it done so it would have featured some involving native American characters , would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless , faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax . Instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of Bergen and Strauss ( lousy actors both , in this at least ) , with plenty of blood , guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious.<br /><br />Which is a terrible shame , because there is a movie to be made about the Sand Creek massacre , about all of the real life massacres the US ( and Britain , and all so - called " civilised " nations ) have participated in over the centuries ( Iraq ? ) . this just is n't that movie .
0 * * Spoilers contained**<br /><br />I'd heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific . What I did n't expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go . What starts off as a typical cowboy / indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic ' comedy ' about Honus ( Soldier Blue of the title played by Peter Strauss ) and Cresta ( Candice Bergen ) who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the Cheyenne . The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit . Donald Pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason . They then escape and both turn up ( separately ) at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base . As Cresta used to be married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them . So far so ordinary . Then comes the ending . After enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they / won't they get together storyline , the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head . Similarities can be drawn with the Wild Bunch at this point of the film but the Wild Bunch kept the same tone throughout and did n't resort to extreme gratuitous violence . In some ways , Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry 's Last Summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending . I did n't hate Soldier Blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending . If you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents , I would recommend Elem Klimov 's Come and See .
0 A badly - acted two - character comedy - drama abruptly transmogrifies into a weren't - we - awful - to - the - Indians polemic , with lousy special effects , exploitative use of nudity , and ugly violence . It 's as sincere as a politician 's handshake , as obvious as a car salesman 's pitch , one of the worst movies in the history of the universe . Absolute and utter dreck .
0 STRANGER THAN FICTION angered me so much , I signed up on IMDb just to write this review . STRANGER THAN FICTION is a surprisingly complex , touching and thought - provoking movie until the very end . Once you suspend multiple lapses of logic ( why did n't Will Ferrell hear Emma Thompson 's voice 10 years ago when she fist started writing her book ? " The phone rang . The phone rang again . " How could she not know it 's him calling ? etc . ) , the movie challenges one 's thoughts about mortality , fate , and sacrifice.<br /><br />The brief history of literary themes provided by Dustin Hoffman should especially entertain former English majors . And Maggie Gyllenhaal is always a pleasure , even though Will Ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul . Her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith.<br /><br />Ah , but the ending . Until the very end , I would have given 9 out of 10 stars to this movie . The movie as a metaphor for life 's journey , as a tribute to the notion of ' writing true , ' as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy , but not both , is outstanding . The entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of Will Ferrell 's fate . And no matter how endearing a character he may have become , we know full well why we will accept the ending . The last act occurs , the screen goes white , the credits roll . A profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film . An end that would have been debated for weeks.<br /><br />NO ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! No credits rolled . Say it is n't so . Say Hollywood did n't tack on another 10 minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie . Dustin Hoffman got it right when he said , " It 's no longer a masterpiece ; it 's OK . " An apt review of the movie . Except to me , it was n't even OK . I was so offended about the betrayal of ' writing true , ' about the decision to pander the film that I actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie . I do n't often cry . I could care less about most movies , but I am still angry about this one.<br /><br />My questions for Zack Helm , the writer , are this : did the original movie end when the screen went white ? And were you forced by the vapid movie powers - that - be to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie ? Or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself ? I 've read you 're brilliant . I hope your original script ended the movie the first time.<br /><br />I know Zack Helm will never see this review , and I 've been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself . But , please , movie - goers , am I the only one who feels this way about STRANGER THAN FICTION ? One good thing came from me seeing this movie : I doubly admire LOST IN TRANSLATION now .
0 A horribly pointless and , worse , boring film . Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything , no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes , and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way . < br /><br />Will Ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to Jim Carey 's Truman Show , and substitutes his usual shouting routine ( admittedly very funny if you discount Talledega Nights ) for , well , pretty much nothing . < br /><br />Emma Thompson is no more than mildly irritating ( that some reviews I 've read here are talking her up for an Oscar nomination is laughable ) whilst Maggie Gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of Harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy . Please . That she ended up falling for Ferrell 's ' character ' is utterly ludicrous.<br /><br />Marc Forster 's attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with.<br /><br />I had the choice of either going to watch The Prestige for the third time or seeing this . I wish I 'd opted for The Prestige .
0 Dick Foran and Peggy Moran , who were so good together in THE MUMMY 'S HAND , return for this very minor Universal Horror offering . But this time , instead of having Wallace Ford as the comedic sidekick " Babe , " we get Fuzzy Knight substituting as a silly buddy named " Stuff " . But the results are nowhere near as charming , and the scare level is virtually nil.<br /><br />Dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle . Peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride . But there is a tall and skinny John Carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as " The Phantom " who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself.<br /><br />This " phantom " is not very mysterious , and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness . It 's always nice to see perky Moran , but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of Universal 's instantly forgettable misfires .
0 A lot of people seemed to have liked the film , so I feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review . But after sitting through 96 minutes of it , I feel I have to do so . Where the heck is the plot in this film ? ! I must have missed it , I was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened . Sure the ending was " somewhat shocking " but they did n't build up to it . I forgot who was who half of the time , so they did n't really develop the characters . The acting was so - so , most of the time it was believable , but I was able to see through it most of the time . So ... without giving anything away , I must say that unless you like the actors in the film , there is no real reason to watch this movie . I could be mistaken , but I just did n't understand why there was so little , or too much of the film . I ca n't decide which one that would be , so I say judge for yourselves . I do n't even know if renting it would be a good idea , the cost and all ... < br /><br />Plot : 0/10 Characters : 1/10 Acting : 2/10 Overall : 3/10 I feel like that 's too high really , I am staying with my vote up at the top .
0 They must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the Hollywood bus station . They then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived . You know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot , four young boys playing in grainy slow motion , accompanied by voice over narration . Next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion . Once they 're grown , it 's easy to spot the writer / director among the four . He 's the quiet , contemplative , long - haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants . This means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood . Only there 's no writing , or directing talent on display here . And if you still ca n't figure out which one he is , here 's a hint : The auteur and his character have the same middle name . It took over an hour to figure out that these twenty - something men were supposed to still be in high school . What looked like a prison was apparently a high school , the warden turned out to be the principal . Once more , the poor , misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement , murder and pillage , but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father . How about hitting back , kid , like you do everyone else ? Numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose . Howlingly bad dialogue . Many scenes badly out of focus . Cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras , drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience . Overacting in the extreme . And if you do n't quite get the self - important speeches , or the slow - motion scenes , just listen to the overbearing music . It will clue you in and what you 're supposed to feel . Poor Marisa Ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films . The biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies , run over puppies chained to a tree , rob and steal , all the while complaining about their sad , sorry lives . But if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college . Yeah , that 's the ticket . Why is it that every twenty - something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important , so interesting , that the world ca n't wait to see it onscreen ? If this movie is as autobiographical as it seems , then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants .
0 Except for acknowledging some nice cinematography , I can hardly say anything positive about this movie . The single real issue is the protagonist 's dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life . Abundant " emotionally powerful " scenes do not go with this plot and , because of bad acting , they also fail to create the intended atmosphere . The director only manages to introduce Anthony 's dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution . The characters do not seem to evolve , although it is difficult to speak of any characters ... perhaps except for Sonny . Beside him , actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to , they come off as self - indulging amateurs . I wonder what ruined the movie more : the superficial script , throwing away all the potential of the plot , or the bad acting , disturbing any appeal that might be left .
0 Hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once did the majestic and very funny Maitresse ( 1976 ) , and now only seems to do " by the numbers " Hollywood thrillers.<br /><br />This is very lightweight John Grisham material , crossed with the plot of a TV movie . Bullock is Cass Mayweather , a feisty and independent crime investigator specialising in serial killers . Ben Chaplin is her reserved police partner Sam Kennedy , and together they make an uncomfortable duo . Not good , when two unbalanced college maladriots ( Gosling and Pitt ) decide to send them on a wild goose chase - by planting very clever and misleading forensic evidence at a crime scene.<br /><br />Fair enough , but while Bullock and Chaplin fail to create any sparks , we also have to endure a several dull overly - melodramatic flashbacks illustrating an important event in Cass 's history . Then of course there are the frequent shots of a cliff - side log cabin where there 's absolutely no doubt the OTT ending will be set . Oooh ... the atmosphere.<br /><br />Watch any episode of CSI instead . It 's to the point and far more exciting .
0 Having been pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock 's performance in Miss Congeniality , I decided to give Murder By Numbers a shot . While decent in plucky , self - effacing roles , Ms. Bullock 's performance in " serious " roles ( see Hope Floats , Speed 2 , 28 Days ) leave much to be desired . Her character is at the same time omniscient , confused , and sexually maladjusted ( the sub - plot of Sandra 's past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character ) . The two teenage boys gave decent performances , although their forensics expertise and catch - me - if - can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream " We did it ! " Chris Penn as the all - too - obvious suspect is wasted here , as is Ben Chaplin 's token partner / love interest character.<br /><br />***Spoilers Ahead * * * Mediocre acting aside , the biggest flaws can be traced to a TV - of - the - week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place , and as mentioned , the stupid errors ( vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene , an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor , the two boys hanging out together in public , a convenient love interest to cause friction , etc . etc ) cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers . The ending was strictly " By the Numbers " and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie . Using the now - cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film , and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment , the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so - called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it 's conclusion . A somewhat promising concept , but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way . * out of * * * * .
0 There 's something frustrating about watching a movie like ' Murder By Numers ' because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out . However , by the time the credits roll , there 's no saving it . The whole thing is pretty much blown by the " cop side " of the story , where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin 's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on . Although Bullock is strong in her role , it 's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing . Ben Chaplin 's talents are wasted in a forgettable role ( he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated ' Birthday Girl ' ) as well as Chris Penn , who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him . Anyway , the plot really is n't even a factor in this movie at all . The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie . Their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well . It 's too bad they were n't in a much better all - around film . Barbet Schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker . Bottom Line : it 's worth a rent if you 're a genre fan , but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it , except maybe on network TV with convenient commercial breaks .
0 Alfred Hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of : he set the standards so high that any director who makes a suspense movie will be fatally compared to him.<br /><br />The main subject of this Bullock vehicle , all the ideas , almost everything was already in Hitchcock 's classic " Rope" : the two students who commit a gratuitous crime , Nietsche 's philosophy , and the clues that the boys disseminate , the Master was the first to transfer them to the screen . And with an eighty - minute movie which was a technical riveting tour de force.<br /><br />"Murder by numbers " does not take place in a single room , like " the rope " , mind you . And , what a supreme originality , it pits two cops against the evil youngsters;and , you would never guess it , these two cops are very different : actually , Bullock plays the part of woman living like a man , and her partner ( Chaplin ) is as shy as a clueless girlie . The two boys ' performances are not really mind - boggling , not as good , as , say , that of Edward Norton in " primal fear " .<br /><br />Well , you know , " Rope " was so good ....
0 From director Barbet Schroder ( Reversal of Fortune ) , I think I saw a bit of this in my Media Studies class , and I recognised the leading actress , so I tried it , despite the rating by the critics . Basically cool kid Richard Haywood ( Half Nelson 's Ryan Gosling ) and Justin Pendleton ( Bully 's Michael Pitt ) team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them . Investigating the murder is homicide detective Cassie ' The Hyena ' Mayweather ( Sandra Bullock ) with new partner Sam Kennedy ( Ben Chaplin ) , who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene , e.g. non - relating hairs . The plan does n't seem to be completely going well because Cassie and Sam do quite quickly have Richard or Justin as suspects , it is just a question of if they can sway them away . Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills , Chris Penn as Ray Feathers , R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst . D.A. Al Swanson . I can see now the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock 's Rope with the murdering for a challenge thing , but this film does it in a very silly way , and not even a reasonably good Bullock can save it from being dull and predictable . Adequate !
0 So , I 'm wondering while watching this film , did the producers of this movie get to save money on Sandra Bullock 's wardrobe by dragging out her " before " clothes from Miss Congeniality ? Did Ms. Bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the " before " Gracie Hart ? As many reviewers have noted before , the film is very formulaic . Add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest.<br /><br />The two bad boy serial killers have been done before ( and better ) in other films . As has the " good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence " character been seen before . In fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes.<br /><br />One last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising . Murdering one person - even if it 's a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer . You may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer .
0 At first the movie seemed to be doing great , they had the characters profiles set ... the plot seemed to be going in the right direction ... however , as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things ... or just a lot was edited from the movie . The characters ' identities changed for the worse within the movie . Also , there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning -- in other words -- they had things within the movie that did n't seem to fit the movie itself . AND the title ... no where in the movie does the title fit the movie ... I suppose the title works for the previews .... Actors did well with what they had ..... if they had a better director and writer , maybe this would have worked out better . But it did n't . So now there 's a new terrible movie coming out this Friday .... My opinion! .... don't waste your time or money .
0 well , the writing was very sloppy , the directing was sloppier , and the editing made it worse ( at least i hope it was the editing ) . the acting was n't bad , but it was n't that good either . pretty much none of the characters were likable . at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential . it was a great idea , but yet another wasted good idea goes by . it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending . and what was n't predictable was done so badly that it did n't matter . the ending was not worth watching at all . sandra bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies . the movie looked rushed also . the movie just was n't really worth seeing , and had i paid for it i would have been very mad . maybe i was more disappointed because i expected a really good movie and got a bad one . the movie over all was not horrifibly bad , but i would n't reccomend it . i gave it 2 out of 10 b / c i liked the idea so much and i did like one character ( justin i believe , the super smart one ) . and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes . it was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape , it was not pretty . anyway , if you see it , wait for the $ 1.50 theater or video , unless you like pretty much every movie you see , then i guess you 'll like this one .
0 Murder By Numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made - for - TV but is n't . Considering the only actor of any note is Bullock ( although Michael Pitt seems to be moving onto bigger and better things ) , it is n't a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things . Like ... remembering to lock your front door when you go out . Or putting clothes back on when you come out of the shower.<br /><br />Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather , a cop with personal issues ( do n't they all ) . Together with her new partner ( a wet - looking Ben Chaplin ) , she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman . Nothing unusual there except that the perps are a couple of teenage students who think they 've planned and executed the perfect murder . As the investigation continues , a battle of wills emerges between Cassie and the main suspect Richie Haywood ( Ryan Gosling).<br /><br />The crippling issue here is that the two leads are hopeless . Bullock , though she is very nice to look at , is about as believable in the role of a hardened cynical cop as Rodney Dangerfield ( actually , he 'd be better ! ) . Chaplin , for his sins , is a complete non - entity and I feel sorry that he has to put this film on his CV in his attempt to break into Hollywood . At least Gosling and Pitt , as the conniving sneering suspects , acquit themselves adequately . As if dodgy leads were n't bad enough , a story that would send anybody to sleep and a highly predictable ( but illogical ) ending shoot this film in the head before it has a chance to run.<br /><br />"Murder By Numbers " has absolutely nothing going for it , even a pointless nude scene by Bullock would n't redeem it . Well , just a little but still not enough to save it . Forgettable , predictable and redundant - this is one film that is n't going to move the cop genre forward . As Cassie probably says on her next case , there 's nothing to see here people . Move along , keep moving ...
0 This is a typical " perfect crime " thriller . A perfect crime is executed and the investigating police officer , ignoring all the clues , immediately knows who guilty is . The audience has to wait around the whole movie for the guilty to be caught . The result is like every single episode of " Columbo " or " murder she wrote " . The director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer watching an episode of Matlock ! This story barely fills up 90 minutes but the director insists on using all 120 minutes filling with every cliche in the book . Skip this one , you are not missing anything .
0 An updated version of a theme which has been done before . While that in and of itself is not bad , this movie does n't reach the ring like the other " inherent and pure " evil ones do . < br /><br />Predictable , ambitious attempt that falls short of the mark . Not worth sitting through for the tired contrived ending .
0 People , please do n't bother to watch this movie ! This movie is bad ! It 's totally waste of time . I do n't see any point here . It 's a Stupid film with lousy plot and the acting is poor . I rather get myself beaten than watch this movie ever again .
0 When I first saw this film it was not an impressive one . Now that I have seen it again with some friends on DVD ( they had not viewed it on the silver screen ) , my opinion remains the same . The subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak .
0 Totally ridiculous . If you know anything about poker , you will find it absolutely appalling but also entertaining because it is so clueless . The nerd who made this movie is obviously very religious and knows slightly about the game of poker , but I doubt he 's ever played above 3 - 6 . ( I think he also knows nothing of golf . ) Where to start . I 've seen better productions in the Intro to Film class I took freshmen year of film school . The actors to watch in this movie are Queen Momma , Scotty Nguyen , and the loser who can never win at poker . Everyone else is as wooden as they come , like bad porn actors.<br /><br />*Spoiler * The man the movie starts with in the opening sequence is the only reason the film got made . He is a railbird who does n't play poker and never has a line of dialogue , but the actor is the man who obviously paid for the movie . I ca n't think of a more useless waste of money than this man shelling out for this pointless production . It 's fitting that he had such a useless role.<br /><br />There 's very little poker in this movie . Most of the time is spent on useless side characters whose plots are n't resolved in the slightest . Queen Momma does have a show - stealing scene where she throws her loser boyfriend through a window and tries to shoot his brains out . Also the nameless Arabs in the convenience store also give brilliant performances when they debate whether to beat up or kill an older lady who robs them . Their subtle performances are easily among the film 's highlights . It makes you wonder why they bothered getting all these white people to play the leads.<br /><br />In conclusion , complete nonsense . Plan 9 from Outer Space has slightly more coherency . If you play poker though you might want to have a laugh . Also if you 're Christian you might enjoy some of the heavy - handed religious conversation that pepper the movie like pointless pepper . I hate movies made by religious people . Especially ones who think they know something about things they know nothing about . It 's sad that Jennifer Harman and Scotty Nguyen got involved in this travesty as I ca n't help but think less of them . They must be envious of Johnny Chan for getting in Rounders .
0 As a poker enthusiast I was looking forward to seeing this movie - Especially as it had Scotty Nyugen in it.<br /><br />Basically , Scotty Nyugens short spots in this film are all it has going for it.<br /><br />The characters are unlikeable and annoying , the soundtrack is awful and the plot , well , there is n't one.<br /><br />I honestly got a headache and found myself reading the barcode number on the DVD box after twenty minutes I was THAT bored . Its actually ashame that Nyugen was in this movie as otherwise I would n't have wasted $ 16 buying it off Ebay.<br /><br />Take it from me - AVOID like 7 2 offsuit ! ! ! Dire . :(
0 The writer / director of this film obviously does n't know anything about film . I think the DP on this project was tied up and replaced with a monkey , because every seen was either too dark or had the hotter hot spots than the sun . < br /><br />The story was awful , the characters were very one dimensional . For someone to have said that this film was made for poker fans and not film fans , that someone is kidding their self ( it was probably the writer / director ) . No poker fan in this world likes this movie . Even your money man hates this project . To go into a casino and play a few hands does n't give you the experience to write about poker . Keep your day job . And if it 's playing poker , then you must be hurt'n .
0 This 30 minute documentary Bu√±uel made in the early 1930 's about one of Spain 's poorest regions is , in my opinion , one of his weakest films . First , let 's admit that 70 years later , Spain is much richer than it was then ( and when I say this , I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own , like excessive individualism and consumerism , though all in all wealth it 's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here ) . And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Bu√±uel favored , but with Western European style capitalism . But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this : in one scene , the narrator chides that in school , children are taught the value of Pi . Teaching math to poor people , the horror!. Bu√±uel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here , not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation . What is he proposing ? That children are taught exactly what at school ? Does n't Bu√±uel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people ?
0 With this film , Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all of film 's might while stating clearly in the film that his work is one of ' objectivity ' . Obviously , it is not . For one reason , many scenes ' shot by pure chance ' are obvious set - ups ( when that poor goat ' accidently ' falls off the cliff , you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen ! ) . For another , his concealing of one important information : the Hurdes people were the way they were for a specific reason which is just hinted at in the film . That is , goitre , a sickness caused by lack of iodine ( salt ) . This goitre is the cause of their cretinism and had Bunuel only took the time to make his research ( heck , if he checked ' cretinism ' in a medical dictionary he 'd have found ' goitre ' ) he MIGHT have ended up telling the truth about these people ( still , doubtfully ) . Instead , with his film , he judges them constantly , talking about them as ' cretins ' , again and again , dramatizing the action , setting - up scenes to create the spectacle , all of this very unacceptable for a documentarist which claims to work for an all - mighty objectivity . Bunuel talks all the time in this film , not letting one word to the people he is filming . He talks FOR them and , even then , JUDGES them . This piece is flawed to it 's roots , to it 's ideology and it 's a real shame it 's considered a great film .
0 One of the lamer wedding movies you 'll see . Smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters . The ethnic stereotypes are like a Henny Youngman joke , except they just ai nt in the least bit funny here . Molly Ringwald , well what else needs to be said . Give you a clue to the silliness , she destroys a $ 10,000 wedding dress , because " It just wo n't be me " makes it into this rag , with straps and puts on a top hat , and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy , rather than ringwalding her neck . Its a helluva a cast too , check out how heavy Ally Sheedy is . Wheeeew !
0 Dull , flatly - directed " comedy " has zero laughs and wastes a great cast . Alan Alda wore too many hats on this one and it shows . Newcomer Anthony LaPaglia provides the only spark of life in this tedium but it 's not enough.<br /><br />One of those scripts that , if you were a neophyte and submitted it to an agent or producer , would be ripped to shreds and rejected without discussion .
0 After watching this on the MST3 K episode , I have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from . It seems to combine elements of Logans Run , Farenheight 451 , Final Sacrifice and at least several others . At one point I was really expecting Cris Makepease to call Lee Majors ROWSDOWER . < br /><br />I wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot . like the fact that , even though gas is unavailable , there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations , and the stations are located close enough together to keep an F1 race car going all the way across the country .
0 I saw this movie years ago , and I was impressed ... but then again I was only 12 years old . I recently re - watched it and want that time back . This film is pretty bad . While I like Lee Majors , Chris Makepeace ( watch My Bodyguard ( 1980)if you would like to see a GOOD movie that he was in ... of Meatballs ( also starring Bill Murray ) for some laughs ) , and Burgess Meredith , this role does / did nothing for their careers.<br /><br />Anyway , Lee Majors character , Franklyn Hart , is an ex- race car driver who plans on driving his race car ( which he had in storage ) across the country to California . One Problem : The government has outlawed all private transportation . I thought the concept was OK ( not the worse I 've heard of ) , but the execution failed horribly .
0 This juvenile , bland flick is strictly for teenagers in old mens ' bodies , desperate to relive their hormonally challenged teenage years . How ? By burning up gas and equating a fast , reckless car ( or plane ) with freedom.<br /><br />The plot borrows heavily from Mister Rogers ' neighborhood ( if it were run my an oil conglomerate ) and Logan 's Run ( if it were heavily sedated and lacked a clear sense of style).<br /><br />Starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith this film is set in a post - gas - crisis world in which an all - powerful government does n't want you to ( * ahem * ) drive your car and burn gas . Sort of the opposite of today 's Enron - and - Bush , oil - grabbing , SUV - pushing government.<br /><br />This juxtaposition alone makes the film laughable . But wait ... there 's more . Although the film is set in the future , we 're not shown any signs of future technology , beyond a return to bicycles , golf carts and horses . You will believe that the future looks ... exactly like today . Same clothing , same suburban houses , same green lawns as today and when the film was made . There are no solar panels , no windmills , no concessions to alternate energy.<br /><br />The acting is flat and flavorless . Even scenes which could have been gritty or moving , buddy - flick , honor , romance , horror ... all fall flatter than a paper doll under a briefcase.<br /><br />Continuity is lacking-- the jet flown by Burgess Meredith 's character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment as the filmmakers insult our intelligence with unmatched stock footage again and again.<br /><br />The plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a Dukes of Hazzard episode.<br /><br />Even die - hard car - film and SF fans should avoid this film like month - old roadkill , unless you enjoy heckling Exxon executives trying to make a movie as empty as the hero 's gas tank .
0 Stupid , mindless drivel about a jet assembled within hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes ( piloted by Burgess Meredith ) chasing a Porsche race car which runs on decades - old gasoline sludge , driven by Lee Majors , with Chris Makepeace as the runaway techno - wiz who can McGyver spare parts into a radio receiver which can pick up all frequencies simultaneously , and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful society . As moronic as it sounds . Terrible waste of Burgess Meredith , but Chris Makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second film .
0 Where 's Michael Caine when you need him ? I 've seen most of the many seasons of MST3 K , but this rare pre-1st season flick ( episdoe K-20 ) is easily one of the worst movies ever made . Three " stars " , Lee Majors , Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith , struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever , delivering lines which must have been written by a secret Dick Cheney - style workgroup composed of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research . Looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness , possibly on Super 8 . Makes Logan 's Run look like the cinematic Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare . I ca n't imagine watching it without the commentary of Crow and Servo since it 's unwatchable even with it . Clearly what 's needed in Hollywood is some sort of 401 K which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care . With its " rights to pollute and drive " theme , by the end , I 'm half expecting to see a Charlton Heston cameo where he delivers his " cold dead hands " speech . Lee , I could have forgiven you for this in 1989 , but 1981 ?
0 Way back in 1967 , a certain director had no idea about a galaxy , far away or near . He was trying to complete a movie with the title THX etc . this short is a remanufactured history of a certain George . i am sorry it has only cuteness to defend it . This is merely an advertising promo for the director , actors , et . al . It has little intrinsic artistic value . It is a brochure . The lead playing George , is very fine , as is the Leia character , and the ersatz Darth character . All else is plain commercial dross . What a waste . Still , it got the job done I guess . The rest of the movie is merely treading water to kill time I guess . a brochure only .
0 For months I 've been hearing about this little movie and now I 've seen it . I find it cute , cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people 's creative ideas in order to make their own one - joke premise of a movie . Troops , Swingblade , any of the million Blair Witch parodies come to mind . If all that these directors want is a foot inside Hollywood 's door then they 're doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how Hollywood makes films . How many times have you heard the phrase , " It 's Animal House meets Back to the Future " ; " It 's Wall Street meets Dead Poet 's Society " ; or " Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars " ? I remember when independent films meant original and daring not safe and predictable .
0 This is one very dire production . The general consensus has always been that while Princess Margaret may have been spoilt and pampered and may have revelled in the excess of luxury at her disposal , she was a very beautiful young woman . Here was the production 's weakest point , the actress failed to get that across . It also appeared that the production budget could n't stretch to a hairdresser - from the outset , the hair on the Princess Margaret character had a permanent birds nest in disarray look and looked as if she had been dragged through a bush . The actor playing the Duke of Edinburgh appeared to have prepared for his role by watching Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles and was farcical.<br /><br />The production was a flaw ridden , clich√© ridden , embarrassing load of rubbish . I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas !
0 Okay , just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie . Well , at least I did . It started out good but became so boring after the first half hour . * spoiler*<br /><br />It tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants . The only problem is that her daughter 's friend is the girl in the way . She always wins the competitions , therefore pushing the mother further towards " eliminating " her . After talking to a " hitman " , the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit . So actions are taken but she eventually gets caught.<br /><br />The cast is awful and the movie drags on too long with nothing happening . Do n't waste your time watching this.<br /><br / >
0 This movie is so bad it 's funny . It stars Scott Backula as some coach , but that 's not important , what is important is the large black fellow who plays 1st base . First off he has to be at least 75 years old , yet still plays minor league baseball , second he starts out the movie in the outfield despite not being able to walk , let alone run . Coach Backula brilliantly moves him to first citing the fact that when he attempts to run he stays in the same place for too long a period of time . Backula shows more brilliant coaching strategy in the end of the film , ( SPOILER ) , he tells his star player " downtown " to hit a home run , clearly " downtown " viewed this as a good move . He hit the home run and won the game for his team , a minor league squad playing the Twins who were the class of the majors in the movie . Now if only Tony Muser , manager of the Royals , would be as smart a coach as Backula and tell his players to simply hit a home run in every at bat , the Royals would never end an inning let alone lose a game .
0 This movie is a disgrace to the Major League Franchise . I live in Minnesota and even I ca n't believe they dumped Cleveland . ( Yes I realize at the time the real Indians were pretty good , and the Twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the American League , but still be consistent . ) Anyway I loved the first Major League , liked the second , and always looked forward to the third , when the Indians would finally go all the way to the series . You ca n't tell me this was n't the plan after the second film was completed . What Happened ? Anyways if your a true fan of the original Major League do yourself a favor and do n't watch this junk .

0 How did I ever appreciate this dud of a sequel ? All it does is throw balls ! Worst of all , it does n't compare to even the first installment of the series ! The comedy suffers from not being funny . Where did all the unintentional laughter go ? Enough slapstick on - the - field action goes on too long . Bob Uecker literally saved this one from a complete nine - inning shutout . What 's next , MAJOR LEAGUE 4 : RETURN TO THE LITTLE LEAGUE ? Ehh , could be ! Leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the All - Star Game . This one 's had three strikes too many .
0 This is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen , the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film . I am fan of the first two major leagues but this one is lame !
0 MAJOR LEAGUE : BACK TO THE MINORS ( 1998 ) ¬Ω * < br /><br />Starring : Scott Bakula , Eric Bruskotter , Corbin Bernsen , Dennis Haysbert , Jensen Daggett , Written and directed by John Warren 100 minutes Rated PG-13 ( for language and some violence ) < br /><br />By Blake French : < br /><br / > 	 Believe it or not , in the new John Warren comedy " MAJOR LEAGUE : BACK TO THE MINORS " there is one funny scene . It consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face . It 's not much , but with the exception of a few one - liners , it 's all this film has to offer ... enough said . < br /><br />This movie is not only structurally impaired , characteristically undeveloped , predictable and badly written , but also just plain bad . Even non - critical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got . It is so familiar it just is n't funny . < br /><br />How many times does the same movie about sports have to be made ? Last years we saw this same material in " Air Bud : Golden Receiver , " and as bad as that film was , this is even worse . At least " Air Bud " was family oriented . " Major League Back to the Minors " is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a Sunday afternoon . It is too childish for adults . So who is this film for ? Teenagers ? Elderly ? People who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this?<br /><br / > 	 The film , like many others like this , has one basic point it tries to make : teamwork conquers all . Yes it does , and what a great moral to try to prove . Too bad we have already seen and excepted it so many times over and over have such little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in a ballerina costumes . Where the silly announcers form their own " buddy comedy routine " muttering one liners to themselves like " They suck , " " This kids fast ball is timed with an hour glass , " " This guy dropped out of ball for a while to find something he lost -- maybe it was his mind , " " Somebody needs a nap , " and " ever see a sunset as beautiful as that play . " Where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name . And where the only heartfelt lecture scene about teamwork is so unknowledgeable that it is almost funny.<br /><br / > 	 " Major League Back to the minors " is so bad ; it stalls its trite ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence . The good baseball team is on a comeback , they are about to win and -- the power goes out . I was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to a conclusion , but in reality , its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time . The movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many putrid jokes it is are not funny . There is another kind - of - funny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long time outfielder is not wanted in that position any longer . The coach 's answer : " You 're too old , too slow , and too fat . " The player 's reaction is to die for . But that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time , and certainly is not worth a cent of your money . < br /><br />So here is another dreadful entr√©e into this genre of film , another that is doomed with its own script , which is failed before seen , and another which is so familiar it seems like deja vu all over again.<br /><br / >
0 Could n't go to sleep the other night . So I got up , flipped on the tube & this movie was on.<br /><br />Film makers bit off more than they could chew . Just as ambitious in scope as " Forrest Gump " was . But Gump read like an fairy - tale where an extraordinarily lucky man guides us through the era . TGMB just relies on tired clich√©s to tell the story . Almost like a Broadway musical where actors have to ham it up . Every character 's purpose was to fill a silly 60 's archetype.<br /><br />Take how we 're introduced to Finnegan : Hugging his black maid & receiving a framed picture of MLK . Criminey , talk about heavy - handed . Why not just give him a t - shirt saying " I Heart Black People"?<br /><br />Sunshine : " Is n't free love groovay , man ? Oh no , I did n't have my period . " < br /><br />Mary Beth : " I want to go to Berkeley , not square UCLA . " Uh , excuse me ? There was nothing square about LA in the 60s . Rather than take the time to demonstrate what made Berkeley unique , we just hear this brat whine about not going there.<br /><br />Can't even remember the black kid 's name . He was just a prop used to show how racially tolerant the other kids are.<br /><br />Thing is , period pieces do n't have to be this cheesy . Take " Dazed & Confused . " Look how we 're introduced to the football hero , Randall Floyd . We do n't first see him on the football field . In fact , we never see him play football . We 're introduced to him in class , inviting his nerdish poker buddies to a party.<br /><br />In " Dazed " feminism is n't a casual by - product of some chick getting knocked up . It 's much more organic , more serious than that . It 's refined in the ladies ' room over a flip discussion about Gilligan 's Island . Serious ideas can grow in the most mundane settings . But real life is like that.<br /><br />Some of the warm comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant . I agree ! Which is why I feel so disappointed by this piece of Baby - Boomer pornostalgia .
0 I saw this back in ' 94 when it was finally released . Apparently because Orion pictures was in bankruptcy , I think , the movie had not been released a couple of years earlier.<br /><br />I have problem remembering details partly because I have n't seen it in a long time , but I do remember it as a very dull movie . I kept debating whether to walk out of it . The store was not at all interesting or engaging . Was a 3rd rate America Graffiti imitation . < br /><br />None of the performances make it worth watching either . One of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating .
0 No wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie . It 's just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch . Bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a Disneyland attraction . Students fist - fight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue . The Watts riots with a cast of ... ugh ... 10 ? ? Dermot Mulroney tries not to gag while he makes out with a Mary Hartman look - alike with the most annoying smile since ' Mr. Sardonicus ' . Noah Wyle reads Bob Dylan lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift . Drunken virgin Rick Schroder sits in a kiddie rocket on his last night before entering the service . Silly , giggling school girls dress up in leopard stretch pants and walk on the set of ' Shindig ' , sing horribly off key , and actually make it big in the music business . And who wrote this compelling dialog ? : " I 'm going to Burkley and wear flowers in my hair" .... "I think I found someone to buy Stick 's woody!" .... "These people are ' animals ' ! " " These people are my ' family ' ! as the Shirelles sing " Mama Said " . Oh brother , What a mess . This is like a ' Reefer Madness ' of the 60 's except it 's not even funny .
0 When I spotted that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie , I was like , score ! I admit , I was eager to see the movie . And I have to say , the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way . Then it went all down hill . I did n't expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo . They took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story . I was appalled that Noah was involved in anything of the sort , especially his role . Nobody with a fully functional brain would actually accept all that crap about the Vietnam War . If anyone really wants to know how Communism was like , sit down and read a book on it . And not one that praises it or is against it , just the cold hard facts.<br /><br />I only watched a few scenes here and there only because I wanted to see Ricky 's body , but that was all that interested me . Everything else about this movie irritated me .
0 Comparison with American Graffiti is inevitable so save your money and time by renting that timeless classic . Speaking of timeliness , there was an episode of Cheers where Norm and Cliff competed on who can find the most anachronism in a movie . They would have loved this movie everything from some of the songs and some of the clothing were wrong . There were sly reference such as ' they paved paradise to put up a parking lot ' . The filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan.<br /><br />The characters in this movie are incredibly politically and socially astute for teenagers . Almost as smart as the people who were in their thirties and forties when they wrote the darn movie . Very little of what the characters said were believable . Combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail . Although , there were two exceptions Kelli Williams liven things up as the future flower child and , despite what another reviewer said , Rick Shroeder was quite good . Showing that brooding characteristic that would come to full boil in his eventual appearance in " N.Y.P.D. Blues " .
0 The championship game is only a couple of days away , but things in New Orleans are n't as they should be . From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose , life is getting in the way of what should be a memorable , wonderful time . Can things be put back into order and a killer stopped before the big game is ruined ? < br /><br />Despite what you might think when you first read about Superdome , this is not a football movie . In fact football is nothing more than a plot device and an after thought . Instead , Superdome is another of those lousy soap opera - ish 70s made - for - TV movies populated with Hollywood has beens and those that never will be . The cast sleepwalks its way through the thing with no one really looking good . The best ( or worst ) example is Van Johnson in a very small role looking generally lost as to why he 's there . The plot is dull , uninteresting , and unbelievable . Donna Mills as a hit"man " ? Yeah , right ! It 's about as believable as the affair she has with the liquor soaked David Jansen . The movie also lacks any pace . Trying to get all four or five story lines into the film zaps whatever flow Superdome might have had . With no drama or suspense in sight , Superdome ends up being a very poor example of a 70s made - for - TV movie . The lone highlight for me was the voice - over work from the late Charlie Jones - a sportscaster I miss listening to . The eloquent way he overstates the intrigue and over - hypes the atmosphere in New Orleans is pure cheese at its finest.<br /><br />Like most others who have seen Superdome , I also did so courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . It may be one of the KTMA public access episodes , but it 's one of the best examples of the shows early start . So even though I 've only rated Superdome a 2/10 , I 'll give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3 K rating scale .
0 It 's 1978 , and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well ! Fans will be upset and certainly the 75,000 seats will be full , only less happy there are so many black players on the field ! This made for TV Super Bowl movie is watchable . It 's not much more , but it 's really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance ( for the time ) , probably most notably Tom Selleck . Unfortunately any goodness Selleck brings to the screen , is quickly trumped by " actors " like Dick Butkus.<br /><br />It 's a silly story about super bowl betting . PJ Jackson is charged by " New York " ( read mafia ) for ensuring the game ends for their favor , in this case a $ 10,000,000 bet . PJ is innocent enough , and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there . But things seem to fall apart for him . Another person , the unsuspected Lainie , takes charge . For a while , the mystery of murders is n't known for certain , but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that Lainie is the new antagonist.<br /><br />It 's a bad movie , but is watchable . The acting is decent , and the filming is OK . At least there were n't any silly typical 70s car chases ( they have their place just not here ) . Just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you 'll survive.<br /><br />2/10 ( maybe a 2.5 )
0 Superdome is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it was made . The whole plot concerns someone trying to sabotage the superbowl , and all the attempts made to stop them . How Tom Selleck and Donna Mills ' careers managed to survive this is beyond me . However , the most frustrating thing about it was THERE WAS NO FOOTBALL IN IT AT ALL ! Avoid this one if possible .
0 This TV movie goes to show that bad films do exist . The only reason I saw this was it was covered on a KTMA MST3K. It 's Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans . However , no football is played whatsoever and we see the behind the scenes look at basically nothing . With the many stars in this film , it made no difference . I really do n't know why I watched this .
0 If he wanted to be accurate , he should have chosen some Frisco natives and not a bunch of NY actors who know nothing about the Sucka Free ( not Sucker Free ) . I 've lived in SF my entire life , and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did . Everything was over - dramatized , and the only cat I saw from the Bay was JT the Bigga Figga with his little cameo as a rapper . No shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here ( ie his Warriors jersey ) . Not once did I notice anyone wearing any Giants or 9ers gear ; instead he fitted them in some cheesy made - up SF or Oakland jerseys that are n't even sold around here . HP has no bowling alleys , black and Asian gangbangers do NOT wear head or wristbands with the colors of Africa or China 's Olympic team , nor does every Chinese gangster wear a Yao Ming jersey and try and sound black while shooting hoops . Further , while there now is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the Mission , all that was shown was some white dude and a self - proclaimed " 100 % West Coast Boriqua . " This is NOT New York ! Puerto Ricans here are few and far between , and the Latinos in the Mission are very , very different from the ONE that was shown here , who was without a doubt from NY . Also , HP is not the only black neighborhood in the City . An accurate depiction would have shown the drama between HP sets in their own hood as well as vs. Fillmore , Sunnydale , Lakeview , etc . < br /><br />This film could 've been much better if Lee had done some more homework and had a better storyline to work with .
0 San Francisco is a big city with great acting credits . In this one , the filmmakers made no attempt to use the city . They did n't even manage the most basic of realistic details . So I would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a San Francisco movie . You will not be thinking " oh , I 've been there , " you will be thinking " how did a two story firetrap / stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby ? " Some of the leads used East Coast speech styles and affectations . It detracts , but the acting was always competent.<br /><br />The stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles , at least in the beginning . The Chinatown story was the most effective and interesting . The plot is weak , ripped scene for scene from classy Hong Kong action movies . The originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance , they were framed and paced better . But the acting is fun and we get to see James Hong and other luminaries.<br /><br />The white boy intro was pointless . I think the filmmakers did n't know what to do with it , so they left it loosely structured and cut it down . The father is an odd attempt at a Berkeley liberal - really , folks , everyone knows it 's not " groovy " to live in the ghetto - but his segments are the most humorous . They threw away some good opportunities . Educated and embittered on the West Coast , a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in New York . They are equally intolerable but always distinguishable . That would have been interesting ; this was not.<br /><br />The Hunter 's Point intro was the most disappointing . It was the most derivative of the three , and stylistically the most distant from San Francisco . You 've seen it done before and you 've seen it done better . Even the video game was better ! < br /><br />Despite the generic non - locality and aimless script , these characters have potential , the actors have talent , and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction ... about ten minutes before the ending . Good concept placed in the wrong hands.<br /><br />PS , there is a missing minority here , see if you can guess which one .
0 I just saw this at the Venice Film Festival , and ca n't quite decide about it . We were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them . Maybe that was the point , that we are all in a " bubble " of our own , but these people did n't compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates . At a running time of just over an hour , the characters were n't very well developed . Lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment ( forklifts , conveyor belts , shovels ) ; and the slightly - creepy - looking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes , that most of the characters made for a living , were somehow more interesting than the live people . An interesting experiment , but somehow it never quite came together .
0 When thinking of the revelation that the main character in " Bubble " comes to at films end , I am reminded of last years " Machinist " with Christian Bale . The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters.<br /><br />An understated , yet entirely realistic portrayal of small town life . The title is cause for contemplation . Perhaps , we , the audience are the ones in the " Bubble " as we are given no payoffs in the films slim 90 minute running time . Audience reactions were often smug and judgmental , clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves . These characters are the ones people refer to as those that put George W. back in office for a second term.<br /><br />It 's sobering to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when watching an audience jump to their feet for the exit as soon as the credits role . This film has it 's merits , and is deserving of consideration for the things it does n't say outright .
0 This film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California . She thought it was wonderful because it was so real , " Just the way people in the Ohio Valley are ! " I 'm from the area and I experienced the film as " Just the way people in California think we are ! " I 've lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there . We laughed a lot , we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age ; the young people went out together at night . The older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families . The area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else.<br /><br />Aside from the " if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed " condescension , the story lacked any elements of charm , mystery or even a sense of dread.<br /><br />Martha 's character was the worst drawn . It 's doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church , but if she had , she probably would have made friends there . I 've read reviews that seem to assume Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was " younger , prettier and thinner " but if this is the case it is n't shown . All we actually see is Martha learning to dislike Rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender . We see Martha feeling left out during smoking sessions , left out of the loop when social plans are made , used but not appreciated , and finally disrespected and hurt.<br /><br />Just one more thing : Are we supposed to suspect Kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks ? Please . This takes stigma against mental illness to a new level .
0 I really did n't expect much from this film seeing as it has people from Parkersburg WV , which is were I live , acting in it . This town is dull and so is this film . There were a few decent scened in the movie but I was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show . This movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there was n't any . Unless you are from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday , then stay away from this movie . The dialog will put you to sleep , the acting will bore you to tears and Steven Soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this . Its a predictable movie with no surprises . What you see is what you get and that is a 73 minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator .
0 A typical Lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify Lanza 's MGM contract at the time.<br /><br />As reported by member Lastliberal ( above ) Grayson could not stand Lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off ( and sometimes on ) camera . In addition , his gutter mannerism and the continual smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were intolerable . After doing their second ( and last ) film together , " Toast of New Orleans " , the normally quiet Grayson stormed into Louie B. Mayer 's office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with Lanza again ¬ñ period . Mayer felt that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM then Lanza , so Grayson 's statement stuck . Grayson went on to star in a number of widely received ( and far more profitable ) musicals with Howard Keel and others . Later in life when asked to compare Lanza and Keel her reply was that there was no comparison between them , and that Keel was great to work with and had much more appeal to the " real people " in the audiences .
0 More wide - eyed , hysterical 50s hyper - cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti - social , pathological behaviour . Danza and Grayson will leave you begging for mercy.<br /><br />It 's a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead ( or in nursing homes ) . I kinda thought about suing them for torture . As this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor , defenseless ear - drums , I felt instant , strong pain envelop my entire being . That damn muscular vibrato can shatter Soviet tanks into tiny bits , nevermind glass.<br /><br />"Why did n't you switch the channel if you did n't like it ? " , you might ask angrily . Fair point , fair point ... The answer is that I wanted to , but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that I fell to the floor , writhing in agony . With my last ounces of energy , I tried to reach the remote but couldn't.<br /><br />A silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by Niven , who then proceeds to " pigmalionize " him . Lanza is in love with asymmetrical Grayson , but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up . This may seem like a rather thin plot , but this noisy movie is so chock - full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all . This movie is RELENTLESS . Forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with Slayer 's " Reign In Blood " ( as in a South Park episode ) . Whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world , it 's all infantile - as if they were all 6 year - olds impersonating grown - ups . I can only envy people who find movies like this funny . It must be great being easy - to - please : what a world of wonder would open up to me if only I could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious , gut - busting comedy . < br /><br />But let 's examine this phenomenon , the 50s musical . My best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more day - dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into Utopia or Heaven ( depending on whether you 're church - going or Lenin's - tomb - going ) , or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy - inspired places . TTONO is more akin to a representation of Hell , but that 's just me . I do n't seem to " get " musicals . People talk , there is a story - but then all - of - a - sudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened ! When you think about it , musicals are stranger than any science - fiction film.<br /><br />Worse yet , TTONO ( my favourite type of pizza , btw ) is not just a 50s musical , but one with opera squealing . Opera is proof that there is such a thing as over - training a voice - to the point where it becomes an ear - piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure . The clearest example of this travesty is when Lanza and Grayson unite their Dark Side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet . I tried lowering the volume . I lowered it from 18 to 14 . Then from 14 to 10 . Then 8 . I ended up lowering it to a 1 , which is usually so low that it 's only heard by specially - trained dogs and certain types of marsupials , and yet I STILL could hear those two braying like donkeys!<br /><br />Take the scene in the small boat in the river . Danza starts off with one of his deafening , brain - killing tunes , and then ... nothing . No animals anywhere to be seen . Even the crocodiles , who are mostly deaf , have all but left . If you look carefully , you might even see the trees change colour , from green to yellow , in a matter of minutes . No , this was not a continuity error , it was plain old torture of the flora . And those trees were just matte paintings ! Imagine how real trees would have reacted.<br /><br />The reason glass breaks when a high C is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency , but because glass is only human - hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self - explosion . I can listen to the loudest , least friendly death metal band for hours , but give me just a minute of a soprano and I get a splitting headache .
0 i could n't help but think of behind the mask : the rise of leslie vernon ( a massively more amazing film ) when watching this because of the realistic feel to it as well as the great innovative idea . this could have been a GREAT film . the acting is ... from some of the actors alright . from others ... it 's downright horrible.<br /><br />that aside the idea is great and the format is great . the story is pretty good as well , though suffering often from big blows to the logical mind.<br /><br />nevermind that though right ? it IS a horror movie after all.<br /><br />i really want to see this remade ... i really want it to be the fantastic film that it wants to be.<br /><br />however ( and you ca n't really fault the minds behind the movie for this ) this is obviously built upon a shoe string budget . and the fx really hurt the film overall.<br /><br />great movie . ... if you were to swap out for some better acting and slightly better fx.<br /><br />whoever wrote it should keep going though , great idea here .
0 Slashers ..... well if you like horrors its definitely one to see , otherwise do n't even bother . It is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget , For instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere , and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow , trust me you wo nt need to look for them . Also try to ignore the cheesy actors , if that s what you call them!!The basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being 3 killers on the loose and whoever live 's at the end gets rich . Now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days , For example when i watched it i thought to my self i would'nt mind having a go at this game ! especially for $ 12.000.000 . so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind .
0 Its spelled S - L - A - S - H - E - R - S. I was happy when the main character flashed her boobs . That was pretty tight . Before and after that the movie pretty much blows . The acting is like E - list and it 's shown well in the movie . Not to mention it is so low budget that Preacherman and Chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person . The whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of half way decent film . The only other reason I liked the movie was because Chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were funny . They said many stupid things that made me laugh . Other than that if you see this movie at Blockbuster do everyone a favor hide it behind Lawnmowerman 2 . Anybody that thinks this movie is good should be mentally evaluated .
0 I have read several good reviews that have defended and critised the various aspects of this film . One thing I see , over and over , is annoyance with Megan , the idealistic political scientist , trying to change the world . I loved her character . Maybe , because I am a 23 year old political science student and I think I 'm going to change the world too , so I relate to Megan . Besides , she 's cute . She 's no super model , but more of a cute girl next door.<br /><br />OK , so she cried and screamed a lot . It 's very dramatic , and seems overdone , but does n't it fit her character ? She goes on that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point . She thinks people who enjoy such a show are sick . I think she made her argument very well . Of course , being a young naive girl , she is terrified of what she is about to face . I think her acting accurately portrays a young girl showing moral courage despite her overwhelming fear . Furthermore , I think she maintained a certain dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in.<br /><br />As for the movie in general , other than Megan , it was pretty much what I expected . It had excellent gore scenes , by micro - budget standards . The plot maybe took a quick thought , hardly any contemplation . It 's basically just a dark humorist senseless slasher film , which the name implies . I love the sadism of the doctor . He kept ripping Megan 's shirt off , not just for the cause of sleaze ( though largely so ) , but also to torment her , before he kills her . The Chainsaw hick was hilarious . For slasher film lovers , he was probably the best character.<br /><br />I give this film 4 out of 10 . It had a good setting , almost no plot , and a mix of good and terrible acting . I would recommend it for a cheap thrill , but hardly a diamond in the rough that is micro - budget horror .
0 how can this movie have a 5.5 this movie was a piece of skunk s**t . first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw Charlie was so retarded . because in the very beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden hut ( that happened to be about oh 1 quarter of an inch thick ( that really cheap as * flimsy piece of wood ) and he did not even think he could cut threw it)second the person who did the set sucks as * at supplying things for them to build with . the only good thing about this movie is the idea of this t.v . show . bottom line DO NOT waste your hard earned cash on this hunk of s**t they call a movie.<br /><br />rating:0.3
0 SLASHERS ( 2 outta 5 stars)<br /><br />Not really a very good movie ... but I did like the idea behind it ... and the the filmmakers did make it look pretty good considering the tiny budget they had to work with . The movie is ostensibly an " episode " of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed off " danger zone " and has three costumed creeps sent after to them to kill them . The survivor , if there is one , wins fame and fortune ... everyone else just winds up dead . The main drawback to this movie is that the acting is pretty bad . None of the " real " people seem real at all . The actors playing the killers are kind of fun ... because they are portraying cheesy and over - the - top caricatures of popular modern horror movie types ... and that 's exactly how they would be done if this was an actual show . The movie pretends to be done all in one take ... there is one cameraman who follows the contestants around the " danger zone " and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera ... but the lights keep flickering on and off constantly ( to hide the " cuts " from one take to another , I would imagine ) .
0 Being a fan of cheesy horror movies , I saw this in my video shop and thought I would give it a try . Now that I 've seen it I wish it upon no living soul on the planet . I get my movie rentals for free , and I feel that I did n't get my moneys worth . I 've seen some bad cheesy horror movies in my time , hell I 'm a fan of them , but this was just an insult .
0 It has been said , " a city on hill can not hide itself " and Virginia City , Nevada , perched on the side of Mt. Davidson at 6200 ft . west of Tahoe , is a prime example , or in the context of the movie , should be . Virginia City exploded in the American dream as a shower of gold and silver , suspiciously the same year the Civil War began . It was the birthplace of the dean of American letters ; it was where a young reporter named Samuel Clemens began using the name " Mark Twain " and went on to become America 's most famous writer . It was also the birthplace of the great Hearst fortune , and the launching pad of John Mackay , who became the wealthiest man in America , the third wealthiest man in the world . Hey , they should have made the movie about him ! In the 1860 's Virginia CIty was THE boomtown of all boomtowns , the home of the big bonanza , at one time the largest " metropolitan " area west of St. Louis and East of San Francisco . But Virginia City ( the movie ) misses all that and is more about a hogwash North / South duello between the characters played by Errol Flynn and Randolph Scott . Flynn is Capt . Kerry Bradford , a Union officer who is a POW in a concentration camp run by a mean Confederate commander named Capt . Vance Irby , played by Scott . These two are always getting in each other 's way . Bradford escapes and then tries to stop a shipment of gold bullion being " snuck " out of VC by who else other than . . . Irby ! " Hey , what 's he doing here ! ? " Horrible . Bogart plays a laughable Mexican bandit who ca n't decide who 's side he 's on . Miriam Hopkins plays a murky character named " Julia Hayne " , obviously a historical lunge at the town 's first lady , Julia Bulette , who in real life a celebrated prostitute . She goes to Washington and talks Honest Abe about saving BRADFORD ( not Irby ) from hanging and blah blah blah . Go figure . They shoulda hung the writer . In " real life " Twain reports that on the last day of the War , the setting sun caused the American flag atop Mt. Davidson to appear to the puzzled residents to be weirdly on fire , kind of like the movie . Three days later they discovered that on that day the South capitulated . One interesting quirk in the film is how sidekicks Alan Hale and Guin Williams flick their pistols forward when they shoot , like they 're fishing , or trying to make the bullets go faster . Not a bad idea for the movie . The same kind of goofiness is lathered over sap and corn throughout the movie . Gosh , how could they miss the gold madness , profligate wealth , gun battles in the silver mines , Mark Twain getting run out of town and beat up after a showdown , the crooked railroad , the Opera House fire , Artemis Ward , Bulette 's huge funeral , the Chinese tongs , the black saloons , the Auction . . ? All this high on a mountain surrounded by desert ? The truth was unreal . Did its fabulous wealth actually spark the great American holocaust ? Well , if you count this movie , it would n't be the first debacle to come out of Virginia City . It 's a disappointment for Virginia City fans because it misses what made the town a " city of illusions , " where it is said evil seeps out of the ground . . . Okay , other than that it 's a fun movie . Flynn and the gang are always great no matter what history they 're destroying . If Flynn would just play his rotten self I 'd double my rating .
0 Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this film , and be forced to play a part - Mexican or he would have been suspended . Believe me , he made the wrong choice ! Presumably , after the success of " Dodge City " , Warners tried a follow - up with Errol Flynn and his usual list of buddies , like Alan Hale , Guinn ( Big Boy ) Williams , Frank Mc Hugh and the ever - present John Litel , but they made the huge mistake of trying to present Miriam Hopkins as a love interest for Flynn v. Randolph Scott , and as a singer to really make things bad , because she proved one thing , and that is she can not sing . The story was not too bad , but with Bogie clearly miscast also , it turned out to be a poor Western that was overlong , and on a low budget , but in fairness , color would not have helped .
0 I ca n't believe that Steven Segal 's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors . I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does . When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong.<br /><br />The plot is unbelievable as a movie , and even if you excuse the visuals , and had read this story as a novel , you 'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book.<br /><br />Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation . He shows no effort and no enthusiasm , and in some scenes he does n't show up at all.<br /><br />I hate to repeat other peoples comments , but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic . The condition of those scenes chopped in , is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time . The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner.<br /><br />My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie , it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds . I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget ( Segal being paid 5 of that ) and that the movie still came in under budget . I must concur.<br /><br />It is no wonder that this is a direct to DVD movie , as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie .
0 Following the appalling Attack Force , chances were that Seagal could only have a step up with Flight Of Fury . To out - stink Attack Force would take some doing . Flight Of Fury is a marked improvement overall , but still in the grand scheme of thinks , mediocre . Mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for Seagal these days , a sad insight into his movie career 's decline . Where Attack Force was a hodge - podge of plot lines altered drastically from conception , to filming , to post production , Flight Of Fury keeps the plot line more simple . Someone steals a high - tech stealth fighter , planning to use it to fire chemical weapons ( which we later , bizarrely discover , will destroy the whole world in 48 hrs ) . Seagal has to get the plane back . It 's that simple , no annoying sub - plots , and conspiracies weighing the film down like far too many of his recent works . That 's not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though , it 's pretty poor . The introduction to side characters is badly done for example.<br /><br />In filmic terms FOF is bad . It 's badly acted by all involved , and Seagal looks bored to tears almost . He 's just got the look of a toddler who 's been forced to perform the school nativity against his will , and so performs with a constant grimace and air of half assedness . Can we blame Seagal though when the material is so un - ambitious and cruddy ? Not really . This is the final film of his Castel Studio 's , multi - picture deal . The producers ca n't be bothered to make anything remotely good , promising a 12 or so million dollar budget , and ( after Seagal 's obligatory 5 million ) probably pocketing a nice hefty chunk of it themselves ( If the film was made for the remaining 7 million , then I 'm Elvis Pressley ! ) . So in that respect why should Seagal put the effort into a film that 's already got distribution sorted before it 's made . Fan 's though may argue , he at least owes them the effort . He 's seriously looking jaded , and the continued use of stand ins and dub - overs is further indication of this . Michael Keusch directs with some efficiency , while the cinematography is quite good , but in all technical areas ( and as usual with Castel , a bog standard stunt team ) there 's nothing more than mediocrity , and nothing to help the film rise above its material , and bored leading man . Again there 's a few action scenes focusing on characters other than Seagal , which in all truth we do n't want to see.<br /><br />Overall the action is n't too bad . It 's nice and violent , and on occasion we 're treated to a few vintage nasty Seagal beatings , but overall nothing special . Partly due to a poor stunt crew , and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting . For me , Shadow Man was a more enjoyable film , because while ignoring the incoherent , jumbled , plot line , there were more vintage Seagal moments , and more of him in centre stage . He never disappeared for long periods during the film . Seagal disappears bizarrely during one action scene here , and re - appears after , with little explanation . There 's far too much stock footage used . Using stock shots is n't an entirely horrendous thing , but using it as a crutch is . We 're treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships , all the time , which get annoying . Plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place ( just check the backdrops , chopping and changing).<br /><br />The film is just middle of the road . It says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless , and gratuitous girl on girl scene , with two hot chicks . Seagal even perks up briefly then too ! Overall this may be one of the better stock footage based actioners out there , but that 's not saying much at all . This will please many fans , but they should bear in mind , Seagal himself would probably want to forget this one 's existence . * *
0 I usually do n't comment anything ( i read the others opinions ) ... but this , this one I _ have _ to comment ... I was convinced do watch this movie by worlds like action , F-117 and other hi - tech stuff , but by only few first minutes and I changed my mind ... Lousy acting , lousy script and a big science fiction.<br /><br />It 's one of the worst movies I have ever seen ... <br /><br />Simply ... do n't bother ... <br /><br />And one more thing , before any movie I usually check user comments and rating on this site ... 3.7 points and I give this movie a try , now I 'm wondering WHO rate this movie by giving it more than 2 points ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
0 ' Flight Of Fury ' is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring Action Film - I do n't expect a lot from a Seagal Film , all I expect is to be moderately entertained for 90 or so minutes with some mindless action -unfortunately this does n't even achieve that low expectation , The action scenes are few and far between , the plot ( which is totally irrelevant in these Films ) is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout , The acting is truly abysmal - bordering on embarrassing with Seagal and his whispering One expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of 3rd raters - I find it hard to believe that anything close to $ 12 M was spent on this dire mess unless $ 11 M of that 12 was Seagal 's Salary - I somehow doubt it ! The one moment of any interest to Straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that - It 's mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the Michael Dudikoff B - Movies I 've endured < br /><br />1/10
0 Steven Seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close - up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources . To pick on the technical flaws - silver F / A-18s and F-14s take of from a carrier for an air - strike , and miraculously become camouflaged F-16s for the actual strike - would give this movie more credibility than it deserves . Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe , which presumably is available to all users of Final Cut Pro . Putting all your creativity into your own credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu .
0 As Steven Segal movies go this one is bottom of the barrel . His best was just fodder for bored teenagers . This one tips the scales , then falls off . The characters are all cardboard . The story is double lame . I ca n't spoil it by telling you the ending . You already know how all Steven Segal movies end if you have seen one . Here goes . He is a super - dooper government agent who know too much to turn loose so they decide , instead of killing him , to dope his brain until he do n't remember squat . He escapes , of course , gets arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to get back a stealth plane that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in Afghanastan by a rogue Air Force pilot who , surprise , surprise , Segal trained . All the heroes , except Segal 's character and his dusky girlfriend , die heroically and Steve - Baby save the whole world in one swell foop , or fell swoop . Whatever . Made with some surplus Air Force and Navy flying film . And a lot of boom - booms . Get some Popeye cartoons instead .
0 FLIGHT OF FURY takes the mantle of being the very WORST Steven Seagal flick I 've ever seen ... Up to now.<br /><br />It 's a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest , Seagal is n't really trying in this - he 's fat and his voice is dubbed once more.<br /><br />The Co - stars fare no better , being a rather sorry load of 3rd raters.<br /><br />The Direction by Keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he 's also responsible for another couple of Seagal stinkers ( SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE ) The screenplay Co - written by Seagal himself is laughably inept.<br /><br />According to IMDb $ 12 M was spent on this boring load of old tosh - If these figures are correct I sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spent.<br /><br />FLIGHT OF FURY is actually a shot for shot remake of the Michael Dudikoff flick BLACK THUNDER - which has to be better than this tripe.<br /><br />This has NO redeeming qualities whatsoever , Give it a MISS ! 1/2 * out of * * * * *
0 Flight of Fury starts as General Tom Barnes ( Angus MacInnes ) organises an unofficial test flight of the X-77 , a new stealth fighter jet with the ability to literally turn invisible . General Barnes gives his top pilot Colonel Ratcher ( Steve Toussaint ) the job & everything goes well until the X-77 disappears , even more literally than Barnes wanted as Ratcher flies it to Northern Afghanistan & delivers it to a terrorist group known as the Black Sunday lead by Peter Stone ( Vincenzo Nicoli ) who plans to use the X-77 to fly into US airspace undetected & drop some bombs which will kills lots of people . General Barnes is worried by the loss of his plane & sends in one man army John Sands ( co - writer & executive producer Steven Seagal ) to get it back & kill all the bad guy 's in the process ... <br /><br />This American , British & Romanian co - production was directed by Michael Keusch & was the third film in which he directed Seagal after the equally awful Shadow Man ( 2006 ) & Attack Force ( 2007 ) , luckily someone decided the partnership was n't working & an unsuspecting public have thankfully been spared any further collaboration 's between the two . Apparently Flight of Fury is an almost scene - for - scene word - for - word remake of Black Thunder ( 1988 ) starring Michael Dudikoff with many of the same character 's even sharing the same name so exactly the same dialogue could be used without the makers even having to change things like names although I must admit I have never seen Black Thunder & therefore can not compare the two . Flight of Fury is a terrible film , the poorly made & written waste of time that Seagal specialises in these days . It 's boring even though it 's not that slow , the character 's are poor , it 's full of clich√©s , things happen at random , the plot is poor , the reasoning behind events are none existent & it 's a very lazy production overall as it never once convinces the viewer that they are anywhere near Afghanistan or that proper military procedures are being followed . The action scenes are lame & there 's no real excitement in it , the villains are boring as are the heroes & it 's right down there with the worst Seagal has made.<br /><br />Flight of Fury seems to be made up largely of stock footage which is n't even matched up that well , the background can change , peoples clothes change , the area changes , the sky & the quality of film changes very abruptly as it 's all too obvious we are watching clips from other ( better ) films spliced in . Hell , Seagal never even goes anywhere near a plane in this . The action scenes consist of shoot - outs so badly edited it 's hard to tell who is who & of course Seagal breaking peoples arms . The whole production feels very cheap & shoddy.<br /><br />The IMDb reckons this had a budget of about $ 12,000,000 which I think is total rubbish , I mean if so where did all the money go ? Although set in Afghanistan which is a war torn arid desert Flight of Fury looks like it was filmed down my local woods , it was actually shot in Romania & the Romanian countryside does not make a convincing Afghanistan . The acting is terrible as one would expect & Seagal looks dubbed again.<br /><br />Flight of Fury is a terrible action film that is boring , amateurish & is an almost scene - for - scene remake of another film anyway . Another really lazy & poorly produced action thriller from Seagal , why do I even bother any more ?
0 Steven Seagal , Mr. Personality himself , this time is the United States ' greatest Stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military( .. who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base , later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station)if he is able to successfully infiltrate a Northern Afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called Black Sunday , who have commandeered an Air Force stealth fighter thanks to an American traitor . Along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor , Jannick(Mark Bazeley ) , John Sands(Seagal)will fly into enemy territory , receiving help from his Arab lover , Jessica(Ciera Payton)and a freedom fighter , Rojar(Alki David ) once they are on ground . Jannick is kidnapped by Black Sunday leaders , Stone(Vincenzo Nicoli)and his female enforcer , Eliana(Katie Jones ) , and Sands must figure out how to not only re - take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter , but rescue him as well . And , maybe , Sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained , Rather(Steve Toussaint)in the process . Sands has 72 hours until a General 's Navy pilots bomb the entire area . On board the stealth , Black Sunday equipped a biochemical bomb , hoping to detonate it on the United States.<br /><br />Seagal gets a chance to shoot Afghans when he is n't slicing their throats with knives . The film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead . The setting of Afghanistan does n't hold up to scrutiny( .. nor does how easily Seagal and co. are able to move about the area undetected so easily ) and the plot itself is nothing to write home about . The movie is edited fast , the camera a bit too jerky . Seagal is n't as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes , unlike the good old days . One of Seagal 's poorest efforts , and he 's as understated as ever( .. not a compliment ) . Even more disappointing is the fact that Seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film 's chief villains , tis a shame . He does n't even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way( .. sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around , but it 's not as clear a picture as I enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying close - ups ) .
0 This movie should have never been made.<br /><br />What a shame of the budget.<br /><br />Please hire convincing actors , and make a proper movie . Very thin plot , and unconvincing lines . Almost hilarious , and that is a shame for an action movie .... < br /><br />Definitely not worth watching.<br /><br />They keep replaying the same " shots " of an Stealth airplane flying away . You have seen it ones , and that was not worth re - running 3 or 4 times.<br /><br />It is time for Steven Seagal to retire from movie - making.<br /><br />His movies are getting worser every time.<br /><br />Black Dawn , and Submerged were already bad , but this movie is even worse .
0 You 've got ta hand it to Steven Seagal : whatever his other faults may be , he does have good taste in women . If you pick a Seagal movie , chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it . And usually , they do not function as mere eye candy ; they get involved in the action and fight , shoot guns , kill with knives , etc . " Flight of Fury " offers the duo of Ciera Payton ( who has a very sexy face , with luscious lips to match Angelina Jolie 's ) and Katie Jones , and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight AND a little lesbian fondling ! And if it seems like I 'm spending a little too much time talking about them , it 's because the rest of the movie , although passable , is so unexciting that it 's hard to find much else to talk about . Ironically , the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself , who looks as if he ca n't even be bothered to try to pretend to care . This being a military - type actioner , there is very little fighting in it , and he does n't fit into his role ( a stealth fighter pilot , " the best in the world " , of course ) very well , which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking . ( * 1/2 )
0 Over the years I 've seen a bunch of these straight to video Segal movies , and every one holds the same amount of entertainment ; unfortanetley , the entertainment level is at a low . Sure , the action sequences were amusing , but that was pretty much it . Seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like ; Under Siege , Under Siege 2 , and Executive Decision(at least on the action standpoint ) , but during the past ten years , these types of movies that star Segal really do not meet his past qualifications.<br /><br />On the more positive side , the movie did make good use of time , like some of the action sequences and use of wit . Just when the movie seemed to just drag on , a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter . I honestly believe that more of Segal 's movies would do better if he was n't the only one that fans recognize in the movie . Supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing , and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses , maybe the movie will get more popular results .
0 First of all , f117 is not high tech any more and it is not a fighter aircraft.<br /><br />Secondly , the f14 's and f18 's can not change their appearances ; they are not transformers . < br /><br />Thirdly , the f16 has only one m61 cannon , not two . < br /><br />Last but not the least , at the end of the film , Seagle selected sidewinder missile . But somehow when he pulled the trigger , the actual missile fired turned out to be a maverick . As I have the experience of seeing f18 's and f14 's being mysteriously transformed into f16 's , this small transformation of missiles is not a big surprise to me . However , there is still one question I have to ask : How did they manage to use an air to ground missile to shoot down a flying f16 ... <br /><br />When students hand in really bad work , teachers assign 0 's . Now I think for the sake of properly marking this film , IMDb should seriously consider adding a ' 0/10 ' option . Otherwise , it is not fair for those who receive 1 out of 10 ...
0 Nobody could like this movie for its merit but , if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their MST3 quality , then this is for you . It ranks up there with " Road House " for its preposterous characters , sets and story line . The bad writing really cracked me up : " I want you to dust those guys off " instead of " . . . dust those guys . " F-14s take off from the carrier but , when they get into formation , they 're F-16s ! Without a hint of anger or skepticism , Segal goes back to work for the general who , only minutes before , was overseeing a covert " mind wipe " on Seagal . Segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards . So naturally , the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too ! The hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway . The little stealth fighter can fly all the way from California to Afganistan without refueling . Then Segal flies it back to California - the long way , i.e. , by way of Europe - even though there 's a carrier giving him air support 20 minutes away in the Arabian Sea . The CIC in the carrier consists of 3 black PCs , 2 flat screen TVs and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls . What a hoot !
0 I just watched this movie on Starz . Let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved ; the acting , writing , directing , special effects , camera crew , sound , and lighting . It also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie . Apparently back in 2007 , when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $ 75 million . Now - a - days those things cost about $ 3 billion and they ca nt go invisible . Apparently you can fly from the US to the middle east in an hour . There was a completely random lesbian scene , which I did n't mind , but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it . The camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes . Oh yeah , since its a Steven Segal movie , its predictable as hell . All in all I rank it right up there with Snakes on a Plane .
0 Steven Seagal movies have never been Oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse.<br /><br />This one starts with Seagal getting picked up by the FBI because he killed a few people ' in self defence ' he 's active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen Stealth plane that will be used by the clich√© ' evil English villain ' that Hollywood is so obsessed with including these days.<br /><br />Suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent . The story is n't interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story , characters of movie as a whole such as the ' lesbian ' interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet is n't even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it did n't need to.<br /><br />In short a terrible script with bad dialog , delivered by sub - par actors , boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes , and non - relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near - impossible and make the movie even worse.<br /><br />Save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss , even if you are Seagal 's most ardent fan .
0 Unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minutes.<br /><br />The Plot - Even for a Seagal film , the plot is just stupid . I mean its not just bad , its barely coherent.<br /><br />The Acting - Unbelievably wooden . Literally seen better acting in porno 's . Ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a ' lesbian love scene ' which is utterly cringe - worthy.<br /><br />Special Effects - would n't look out of place in a 60 's sword and sorcery flick.<br /><br />Unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures , do n't make the same mistake as i did and buy this DVD , as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back .
0 STAR RATING : * * * * * Saturday Night * * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning < br /><br />The American military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other . A renegade pilot ( Steve Touissant ) steals it and plots to hold the US government to ransom with it . So they are forced to send in their best man John Sands ( Seagal , who else ? ) to stop him , in exchange for his freedom from a detention centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information he 's learned over the years.<br /><br />I skipped Attack Force because I could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what I thought . But I decided to give FOF a go because Shadow Man ( by the same director ) was n't bad and , what the hell , Seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe , just maybe , he could make a great film again . Oh what a fool I was.<br /><br />Dubbing , horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets , awful camera work , cheap production values , risible , unconvincing fight scenes that have become Seagal 's trademark and a boring , sleep inducing plot that does n't go anywhere.<br /><br />Thankfully his next film , Once Upon a Time in the Hood ( which I 'll be skipping ) , apparently marks the end of his contract with Sony , meaning no more of these awful European lensed action films and his next film Prince of Pistols might mark a return to theatres . Hell , he 's done it before and Stallone will have managed to do it before him ( Rocky Balboa . ) < br /><br />This is n't a Flight of Fury . It is n't even a flight of fun . It 's a flight that fails to even take off the ground . *
0 Well , I can once and for all put an end to the question : ' What is the worst movie ever made ... ever ? ' It is Flight of Fury , starring and co - written by Steven Seagal . Sure there are lots of famously bad movies , but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously.<br /><br />It is a Romanian - made film that speaks to just how far Romania has to go to catch up with Bollywood . It also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become . This movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry , knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again.<br /><br />It was released only on video ( I ca n't imagine why ) and I suspect the workers that had to make the DVD 's had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling .
0 I own almost every Seagal movie ( yes even ones like this that are low budget ) , and I must say , this may be the worst , not only of his movies , but of all movies ever made . The only highlight of this film , and only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 , is that A. it is Seagal , and B. Seagal does have some sweet action sequences , specifically in the store , and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife . Next time give me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people , and do n't even bother with a story line , because the storyline not only stunk , but so did the acting , the fact that F-18 's and F-14 's somehow changed into F-16s , and also the fact that the Stealth was as fast as an F-16 . Also the Stealth never had to refuel ? ? ? And since when is Afghanistan considered hostile territory from an Air Force stand point . last I checked , Afghanistan has no Air Force , we ( USA ) control the skies . Also , this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room , yet the Admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret . Also , how did Seagal go from the bottom of the truck , to the top ? PLease tell us why they jailed him , Since when are Air Force pilots great commandos ( unless they are Owen Wilson ? ) And since when are their drunks in Arab countries , considering Muslims do n't drink alcohol ? Also on top of that , since when do Arabs listen to orders from females like the # 2 in charge ? The highlight of the film was definitely Seagal killing people in the store , and the other 50 people he killed with a knife , as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere .
0 I can barely find the words to express how utterly utterly awful this film is . I was sold on the promise of action , with Segal and stealth aircraft , which normally make for an entertaining action movie . I can honestly say I 'd rather gouge my eyes out with a cocktail stick than have to see this film again . The acting was so awful that it was almost funny . The story was insanely weak , with plot holes so cavernously wide you could fly an F117 through them . The script was so poor , if I found out that a 10 year old wrote it I should n't be in the least surprised . The direction and production is so amateur , I would n't even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video . Utter Utter drivel . Those responsible for making this movie have cheapened the art , and they should be ashamed of themselves . Steven Segal should never ever show his face in public again , I ca n't imagine what made him agree to star in this , the worst film I have seen in my entire life .
0 he was my hero for all time until he went along with { if you can call it a movie } I went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money that s how bad my hero 's acting and the hole thing was ............. I ca n't believe that Steven Segal 's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors . I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does . When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong.<br /><br />The plot is unbelievable as a movie , and even if you excuse the visuals , and had read this story as a novel , you 'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book.<br /><br />Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation . He shows no effort and no enthusiasm , and in some scenes he does n't show up at all.<br /><br />I hate to repeat other peoples comments , but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic . The condition of those scenes chopped in , is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time . The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner.<br /><br />My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie , it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds . I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget ( Segal being paid 5 of that ) and that the movie still came in under budget . I must concur.<br /><br />It is no wonder that this is a direct to DVD movie , as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie .
0 This show made me feel physically sick , and totally detached from British society as a whole . It was programmes such as this and Blue Peter that pretended that there were / are no class divisions in Britain . They 'd always say things like ; " Go into your loft and you may find this .. " or " Go into your back garden tonight and ... " - what about us ' scummy ' working class kids who never never had a " loft " , and a " back garden " which was nothing more than a 1 meter square of balcony on the 14th floor of a council block ? Public service broadcasting - yeah right ! And on top of that , it was awfully depressing to see those stupid , middle class , up - their - own - backside kids mess about with bits of old plastic having ' fun ' ... do me a favour , and " why do n't you " go and slit your wrists or do a coke overdose on " Mama and Papa 's " money ... you make me sick
0 Granting the budget and time constraints of serial production , BATMAN AND ROBIN nonetheless earns a place near the bottom of any " cliffhanger " list , utterly lacking the style , imagination , and atmosphere of its 1943 predecessor , BATMAN.<br /><br />The producer , Sam Katzman , was known as " King of the Quickies " and , like his director , Spencer Bennett , seemed more concerned with speed and efficiency than with generating excitement . ( Unfortunately , this team also produced the two Superman serials , starring Kirk Alyn , with their tacky flying animation , canned music , and dull supporting players . ) The opening of each chapter offers a taste of things to come : thoroughly inane titles ( " Robin Rescues Batman , " " Batman vs Wizard " ) , mechanical music droning on , and our two heroes stumbling toward the camera looking all around , either confused or having trouble seeing through their cheap Halloween masks . Batman 's cowl , with its devil 's horns and eagle 's beak , fits so poorly that the stuntman has to adjust it during the fight scenes . His " utility belt " is a crumpled strip of cloth with no compartments , from which he still manages to pull a blowtorch and an oxygen tube at critical moments!<br /><br />In any case , the lead players are miscast . Robert Lowery displays little charm or individual flair as Bruce Wayne , and does not cut a particularly dynamic figure as Batman . He creates the impression that he 'd rather be somewhere , anywhere else ! John Duncan , as Robin , has considerable difficulty handling his limited dialogue . He is too old for the part , with an even older stuntman filling in for him . Out of costume , Lowery and Duncan are as exciting as tired businessmen ambling out for a drink , without one ounce of the chemistry evident between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in the 1943 serial.<br /><br />Although serials were not known for character development , the earlier BATMAN managed to present a more energetic cast . This one offers a group going through the motions , not that the filmmakers provide much support . Not one of the hoodlums stands out , and they are led by one of the most boring villains ever , " The Wizard . " ( Great name ! ) Actually , they are led by someone sporting a curtain , a shawl , and a sack over his head , with a dubbed voice that desperately tries to sound menacing . The " prime suspects " -- an eccentric professor , a radio broadcaster -- are simply annoying.<br /><br />Even the established comic book " regulars " are superfluous . It is hard to discern much romance between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne . Despite the perils she faces , Vicki displays virtually no emotion . Commissioner Gordon is none - too - bright . Unlike in the previous serial , Alfred the butler is a mere walk - on whose most important line is " Mr Wayne 's residence . " They are props for a drawn - out , gimmick - laden , incoherent plot , further saddled with uninspired , repetitive music and amateurish production design . The Wayne Manor exterior resembles a suburban middle - class home in any sitcom , the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel . The Batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing . ( The costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet!)<br /><br />Pity that the filmmakers could n't invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure . While the availability of the two serials on DVD is a plus for any serious " Batfan , " one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box . They capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of BATMAN AND ROBIN combined.<br /><br />Now for the good news -- this is not the 1997 version !
0 ... this would have been what you got.<br /><br />Words alone can not describe how bad this is . If you 're having trouble sleeping pop this in and I guarantee you 'll be out in fifteen minutes.<br /><br />Robert Lowery was a pretty good actor in the 40s-- but he 's phoning it in here . In an interview , Johnny " Duncan " Robin said that in one scene he and Batman had to run from the car to the house and that Lowery was doubled over out of camera range because his girdle was too tight ! Duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle hood than a boy wonder-- in fact he 's more like a guy in his thirties waiting for Lowery to kick off so he can wear the big cape.<br /><br />Driving a Batmobile that looks like it rolled off Honest Al 's Used Car lot at below sticker price-- the Dynamic Duo do n't put a lot of effort into hiding the fact that it 's Bruce Wayne 's car they 're driving-- in fact it 's noted by several characters throughout the serial.<br /><br />The acting is wooden-- the sets are cheap-- the dialogue is horrendous and if there was even a script they were following I 'm sure it read along the lines of " Batman says something here " because it certainly seems like they 're making it up as it goes along.<br /><br />Batman 's Utility belt is made out of thin fabric with no apparent pouches to hold his gadgets-- in one scene when Batman needs a full size blow torch the producers just tuck one in as the scene starts-- never to be seen again . His cowl is so bad he ca n't even see out of it and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the disgruntled easter rabbit than they do anything batlike.<br /><br />In one scene ( I am not making this up ) , Batman substitutes counterfiet radioactive money that will burst into flames the second it is exposed to air as a payoff to some hoods . It 's radioactive so he can trace it-- the reason it 's so highly flammable is n't explained . Well , unfortunately the thugs open the package in a cardboard warehouse-- we know it 's a cardboard warehouse because Batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that look to weigh about six ounces on the hoods to knock them out-- and soon the whole place burns to the ground . Thanks Batman!<br /><br />In another scene after the Batmobile is disabled , Batman flags down a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car-- leaving the man to fend for himself and telling him not to worry because if Batman smashes up the car the police will surely buy him another one ! Yes , you guessed it , said car careens off a cliff within a few short seconds . Not that it matters much to the motorist who has probably died from exposure trying to hoof his way back to Gotham City.<br /><br />There is a tired subplot with Lois Lane clone Vicki Vale who is convinced Bruce Wayne is Batman-- she must have noticed the Batmobile parked outside of Bruce 's house-- or maybe she saw Batman and Robin running up the walk in the clearly densely populated suburban neighborhood.<br /><br />Everything about this serial is bad-- and all but the youngest in the audience will want to hurl toast at the screen . IF you 're looking for bad cinema you could not hit a better mark-- if you want entertainment , try the Burton Batman films , the Adam West Batman TV Series or the earlier Lewis Wilson Batman serial .
0 there is no suspense in this serial ! When one episode ends the acting is so shoddy , the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that the last thing on your mind is how Batman and Robin will save the day . No , in fact , the last thing on your mind is watching the next episode ! This show is so boring that I ca n't see how it ever got made , let alone released on DVD ! Obviously the effects are not up to par with contemporary Batman films , but even the script is awful . An incoherent babbling mess about some evil professor and a ray gun or something like that , I am not quite sure , because it is too awful to follow . Watch the 60s version , or the 90 's versions , or even Batman Begins , just anything over this version !
0 I imagine when Hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together , the talk is not of the Master 's great films like " North By Northwest " or " Strangers On A Train " , but a lesser - known effort like this one from 1931 , obscure and seriously flawed , which showcases the great director in fledgling form.<br /><br />Emily and Fred Hill ( Joan Barry and Harry Kendall ) are a middle - class London couple scrimping to stay ahead . He begrudges their lot ; she accepts it . Change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle , saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury . They make plans for a world cruise . But their problems have only begun.<br /><br />Just ask Richard Hannay , Roger O. Thornhill , or Marion Crane . Well , Marion 's indisposed at the moment , but you get the idea . Travel and Hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight , setting one up for a perilous journey at best . This is perhaps Hitchcock 's earliest foray into this theme , and not his most successful or memorable . Hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element , in this case domestic drama rather than suspense , but the two do not cohere , at least not here.<br /><br />The Hills are a dull , flat couple , with no chemistry or personality . When they find themselves at the Folies Berg√®re , in the form of cross - cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film , they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers . " The curtain 's gone up too soon ! " gasps Emily . " They are n't dressed." < br /><br />When the Hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise , it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing , even if the people they partner off with are drips , too . Emily 's man , Gordon ( Percy Marmont ) carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs , which he suggests be filled by Emily . Fred 's girl " the Princess " ( Betty Amann ) has Clara Bow 's eyes and Wallace Beery 's five o'clock shadow . There 's also an obnoxious fellow passenger , a dowdy spinster whom Hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue . Subtlety was still to come.<br /><br />Everything is shot in an abrupt manner , with confusing blocking and strained dialogue . Hitchcock tries for some early comedy with Fred and his umbrella that does n't come off , and Kendall seems to aim for laughs while Berry plays for tears . When Fred and Emily break off , they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged - together rickshaws , one of many clunky attempts at symbolism.<br /><br />Emily 's the only vaguely sympathetic character , in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with Gordon , but mostly because she 's among the first of Hitchcock 's many magnetic blondes , her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a Botticelli aboard the open deck of a Chinese junk near the film 's conclusion.<br /><br />Matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set - piece for the protagonists to come to grips with , and presumably repair their relationship . Only they are n't active participants in the resolution , and except for the fate of a friendly cat , nothing about the ending resonates.<br /><br />At least you get some enjoyable views of London in the early 1930s , and a chance to see Hitchcock when he was still working for food . " Rich And Strange " is Hitchcock paying his dues , and learning his trade , one for scholars but not casual film goers .
0 Yet another early film from Alfred Hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation . As with Juno and the Paycock , you can tell that Hitchcock had little interest in this movie . There is almost no style or craft to it at all . The story revolves around Fred and Emily , a young married couple , who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage . Emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted , wealthy man who falls in love with her , but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband . This might seem more believable if Fred were n't made out to be a completely insensitive , pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman . The couple ends up staying together , but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene . The third act goes in a completely different direction , with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat . Joan Barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband . That 's about all you can say for this one .
0 Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry ( as Fred and Emily Hill ) receive an advance on an inheritance . They use the money go traveling . Their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic Betty Amann ( for Mr. Kendall ) and lonely Percy Marmont ( for Ms. Barry ) . But , they remain as boring as they were before . Arguably bored director Alfred Hitchcock tries to liven up the well - titled ( as quoted in the film , from Shakespeare 's " The Tempest " ) " Rich and Strange " by ordering up some camera trickery . An opening homage to King Vidor 's " The Crowd " is the highlight . The low point may be the couple dining on Chinese prepared cat.<br /><br / > * * * Rich and Strange ( 12/10/31 ) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall , Joan Barry , Percy Marmont , Elsie Randolph
0 This Hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale . A young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy . They spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence . However , after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence . However , out of no where , when they are on a luxury cruise , the ship sinks and they lose everything -- and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life ! What an odd , silly and preachy film ! Personally , I 'd like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable!<br /><br />The production values are relatively poor compared to later productions -- a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting .
0 The animation in this re - imagining of Peter & the Wolf is excellent , but at 29 minutes , the film is sleep inducing . They should have called it " Peter & the Snails " , because everything moves at a snail 's pace . I could n't even watch the film in one sitting - I had to watch it 15 minutes at a time , and it was pure torture.<br /><br />Save yourself 30 minutes - do not watch this film - and you will thank me.<br /><br />I can only guess that the Oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees . Unfortunately , to vote for the winner in the Best Animated Short ( short ! ) category , the voters will have to sit through the whole thing . I already feel sorry for them - and must predict that there 's no way this film will come close to winning .
0 Acclaimed director Mervyn LeRoy puts drama on film that competes with the best of soap operas . High drama is found in the loves and infidelities in New York 's social set . Oh yes , do n't forget jealousy can bring about tainted hearts and murder . The all star cast features : Barbara Stanwyck , Van Heflin , James Mason , Ava Gardner , Cyd Charisse and Nancy Davis .
0 Wow . I went to the video store tonight because I was in the mood for a bad B Horror movie and I found this Gem . I looked at the cover and I thought it looked like just the movie for my mood . I brought it home and put it on.<br /><br />This movie was not the B Horror movie that I had in mind . This was MUCH worse . I wanted a bad movie but what I got , I did n't know that crap like this existed amongst man . This movie seemed like a 5 year old wrote and directed it and that is being nice about it.<br /><br />I am an aspiring director and this movie made me so mad that someone out there is actually paying this guy to direct movies . He needs to work at a garbage dump shoveling crap where he belongs.<br /><br />If you are thinking about renting this or buying it . I will tell you the same thing that I would tell someone getting ready to commit suicide . " DON'T DO IT , IT 'S NOT WORTH IT ! " I really have nothing nice to say about this movie . DON'T DO IT !
0 I honestly want the last 30 minuets of my life back.<br /><br />The only person that is fit to watch this movie is Helen Keller I kept saying to myself this has to get better this has to get better.<br /><br />Then the zombies finally showed up and they had some raccoon paint on there eyes.<br /><br />They talked like regular people.<br /><br />One drove a car.<br /><br />Some voodoo woman asked what one of the " Zombies " wanted and the " zombie " said ( I want to Dance)<br /><br / > ( THAT WAS IT ) Out came the movie I could n't take it any longer Can I sue for a ¬Ω hour of my life ? ? ? ? ?
0 I have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film . I even got the rental company to give me my money back because I argued that they perpetrated false advertising.<br /><br />It 's not enough that the movie itself is a p.o.s . , but the cover art is what sold me . I 've done better make - up effects on my children at Halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art . Can you say " raccoon eyes?" < br /><br />I'm not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details , but come on , the movie 's main character is an L.A. cop who was born and raised in Alabama - but has a German accent ! ? ! It 's beyond insulting .
0 This is one of the worst films ever . I like cheesy movies but this is simply awful . Where are the images in the film that are on the box ? I think more money was spent on the DVD box illustrations than on the entire film . < br /><br />Why would a company release a DVD that the cover is so misleading ? I feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box . As much as I explore IMDb I should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store . I have no one to blame except myself . I want my money and time back . < br /><br />DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE . < br /><br />Even if curiosity is motivating you , stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead . It will be much more enjoyable . You have been warned !
0 i 've discovered that this film gets rented based off of the packaging . the zombie on the front of the DVD looks cool and scary . then you get to the movie and it 's women with raccoon masks on . zero special effects ... and even the fight scenes you can see them miss punches by 2 feet . the funny thing is that Lommel acts in the movie briefly himself and is worse than the rest of the crap actors in the movie . the only thing i can think is that Lommel is just trying to make such a bad film that people dub it a " cult classic" ... however , i ca n't possibly imagine anyone thinking this is anything but one of the worst movies ever made . the real horror in this film is how bad it is . i 'm embarrassed i rented it and vow never to see another Lommel film again !
0 Every year I watch hundreds of films , including many low budget amateurish straight - to - DVD abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see . I have seen thousands of films in my time , many excellent , many forgettable . Zombie Nation I will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable ' horror ' films I have ever seen ¬ñ in fact I still have n't recovered from the experience of watching it.<br /><br />The day after , it seems like some kind of weird dream . Did I really see what I thought I saw ? Why do the police work out of a warehouse ? Did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the ' zombies ' eat cheeseburgers ? Is it safe ? Is it safe ? Is it safe ? < br /><br />I would n't recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a ' good ' film , and neither would I recommend it as ' so bad its good ' . However , if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever ¬ñ this is for you . Now , whenever anyone asks me what the worst film I have ever seen is , I will say Zombie Nation.<br /><br />Seriously ¬ñ I think it 's a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one , and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude . He really is the Ed Wood Jr. of the digital age , and I for one ca n't wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one .
0 This movie was poorly written , poorly acted and very predictable . It was very low - budget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to video . It was n't even campy fun , it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 1 - 1/2 hours back ! The colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them . < br /><br />The plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing -- what a stretch ! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre . Just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this.<br /><br />ejames6342
0 These were over 80 minutes of semi unexpected boredom . First , I was wondering how it is possible to produce something like that . Then , reaching 70th minute I was convincing myself that it 's only a few more minutes , and I lasted to the very end which I 'm kinda proud of as I consider watching this movie as a great test for human 's patience and crap tolerance . Was it worth watching at all ? Well , as I wrote above , if you want to test yourself , give it a try and if you 're strong willed enough , you may even last to the end ... The movie lacks coherence and characters seem to have no common sense at all . All happenings in the movie , you can be sure you saw somewhere before , and they seem to be put in this movie just to fill the film reel .
0 Awful . This thriller should have buried . What a piece of crap . Terrible writing , characters are less than believable . Horrible Schlock ! ! Stick some B- stars in a terribly written POS to try and give it a little credit , but it fails miserably . If I did n't have to write ten lines about this movie I would have given it a word word review , it starts with ' sh ' and ends with ' it'.<br /><br />Horrible ending , retarded . Who writes this crap . The ending of this film is so contrived , weak it 's as if they had no idea what to do with this story line , or they just ran out of money . Most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie . It 's a good thing that these actors are on the way out , because this would be a career killer . Good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it . At least no one important , like future investors . It could have ended a thousand different ways , but as it is , I feel cheated out of my precious time.<br /><br />Don't bother with this one , you will feel like you wasted time you can never get back .
0 The book is so good that at least the opening of this made - for - tv movie will move you , but then , as it diverges more and more from the book , taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches , it becomes boring . Still , from comments I 've heard , people who have not read the book tend to like it , and if it leads even on child to read A Wrinkle in Time , it will have served its purpose . The most embarrassing change is to make the Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppins ' Uncle Albert ( I love to Laugh ) . Nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny .
0 I have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the Wrinkle in Time Chronicles . My dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading A Winkle in Time , and would think , what an amazing movie this would make . Sadly enough that screenwriter failed , changing characters , throwing in lame humor , and all out destroying the plot . I know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie . But why ca n't you stay true to the book ? Why must you change the way characters think and act ? For those of you who have not read the book , pick it up , find a soft couch , and let your imagination run wild .
0 Disney ? What happened ? I really wish the movie had been set in the 60 's ; like the book was . And I really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption ..... I 'm glad that , maybe , someone might be influenced to read the books ..... but , The Man With Red Eyes interchangeable as IT ? And what 's up with the volcanic upheaval ? Where was THAT in the book ? Peter Jackson ! Save us ! ! ! ! A long time ago ( 1978 ) I heard that there was European version of this film . I sure wish I could i d it . I can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption . This movie needs to be X'd .
0 This ABC straight - to - TV failure does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is A Wrinkle in Time . Ms. Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults alike into a magical , fantastical and original world like no author before her . This novel , the first in her ' time quartet ' , is a beautiful take on life , the universe , and time itself . Yet it is easy for any child or adolescent to understand . Its unwavering morals are prevalent throughout the book . This film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of Ms. L'Engle 's work of art . Honestly , what were they thinking ? The effects look cheap and ridiculous , the plot is mushy and uneven , the dialogue is far - fetched and just about every magical characteristic of the novel has been lost . This was a horrible attempt at bringing this book to the screen . I sincerely hope that someday an intelligent , worthy director ( Guillermo del Toro , David Yates , Alfonso Cuar√≥n ) makes another attempt at bringing this book to the screen and understands it for what it truly is : a masterpiece . This adaptation can only be compared to boring , fake and cheap motel - room art which holds no ground and makes absolutely no impact on its audience .
0 I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it . The movie , however , did not meet my expectations . Having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies . The characters did n't seem to fit very well with the book . The direction was weak . I had a hard time getting into the characters . There was n't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on . The dialog did n't explain adequately what was happening . It just seemed slapped together and rushed through . All in all I was very disappointed with the movie . I suppose if you have n't read the book , it might be ok by itself . At the very least , it might entice you to read the book , which you 'll probably enjoy more.<br /><br / >
0 The " Wrinkle in Time " book series is my favorite series from childhood . I have read and re - read them more times than I can count over the last 35 + years . The characters , with all their virtues and flaws , are near and dear to my heart . This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful , magical , spiritual story that I love so much . To say I was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement.<br /><br />If you have never read the book(s ) I imagine you will enjoy the movie . The acting is passable , the special effects are well done for a made for TV movie , and the story is interesting . However , if you love the books , avoid this movie at all costs.<br /><br />I found this statement at the Wikipedia page of the novel : " In an interview with Newsweek , L'Engle said of the film , ' I expected it to be bad , and it is.'" < br /><br />I , like another reviewer here , feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind .
0 I have read the whole ' A wrinkle in time ' book and then saw the movie . The movie contained all the elements in the book but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours it felt really crammed in with too many effects and bad acting.<br /><br />A wrinkle in time is about a girl named Meg , Charles Wallace , and Calvin must team together to find Meg 's father and get off the island Camazotz . < br /><br />The beginning of the film is really a stinker . The acting is awful , the direction is laughable , and so far the situations are n't necessary . I really was crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engle that wrote the book and created the movie , made a great book , and a terrible film . The acting is worse than any straight - to - video acting . Yes , I got to admit there was cool effects . But seriously they were all done terribly and not serial in any way possible . If you read the book you will be crushed by the movie . I wish could give it a 0 but sadly I can only give it 1 . A half could have been useful .
0 I really did n't like this movie because it did n't really bring across the messages and ideas L'Engle brought out in her novel . We had read the novel in our English class and i absolutely loved it , i 'm afraid i ca n't say the same for the film . There were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just did n't do any credit to the imaginative genius that is Madeleine L'Engle ! This is the reason i gave it such a poor rating . Do n't see this movie if you are a big fan of L'Engle 's texts because you will be sorely disappointed . However , if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes ( or educational as was my case ) then it is an alright movie !
0 ( this may be a bit on the spoilerish side ) I would like to start by saying I did not watch the entire movie , nor could I because it was evident from the first hour that I was going to be incredibly disappointed . That of course is the problem with taking , what many believe to be an amazing book , and turning it into a Disney Made - for - TV movie.<br /><br />A Wrinkle in Time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago . It 's got a great storyline that could hook children and adults . Plus it 's got built in quality sequels . But Disney - fying was not the way to go . The problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book . It is a complicated and emotional story for kids . There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely " psychic " , because that was the easiest way of explaining it . There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs. W 's as added tension , there is enough tension in the story without that . There was no reason to remove Meg 's glasses ... that deprived us of what could 've been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that happens in the book.<br /><br />I could nitpick for days about little things , but I also think larger things , like the art direction was a off . Take for instance the way they made Camazotz look , with its strangely darkened skies . The creepiness that comes across in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth . It looks like earth . It has people on it that look like humans . The skies are blue , the grass is green , and there are children playing . But something is a little bit off . The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie . The lesson of course is that Camazotz could very well be Earth , that is if we forget how to love . It would 've been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they 're walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm.<br /><br />I unfortunately did not watch the end . Maybe someone can tell me how Disney messed up the end as well.<br /><br />Overall an artistic disappointment.<br /><br / >
0 I have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago . And I have read it to every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching . Supposedly a movie had been made in the past , but I 'd never been able to locate it . Well , my students and I were all so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline L'Engle 's excellent book to the screen . < br /><br />As I watched the movie , I had the highest of hopes . As the film went on , I became more and more despondent . They had botched it badly ! Never had I been so let down by a favorite book - to - film adaption . I understand that films ca n't stick strictly to a book , but they do n't need to change things for the sake of it ! Most , if not all , of departures from the book were totally unnecessary ! < br /><br />I kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie . Well , it was n't just me . Nearly every single one felt the same way -- cheated out of the great story that Madeline L'Engle had so skillfully created ! < br /><br />Why , they wondered , did Aunt Beast look like Chewbacca from the star wars movie ? Why could n't Calvin 's hair have been red ? Why did Mrs. Which not have the proper " witch - like " outfit that was such a clever play on her name ? Basically , we all wondered -- why did nearly every single detail have to be changed ? < br /><br />I have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make . I am still waiting for that movie . This one was A Wrinkle in Time in only the broadest of senses . I 'm going to write to Peter Jackson and try to convince him to take on the task !
0 I was browsing through Netflix and stumbled upon this movie . Having fond memories of the book as a child , I decided to check this out . This is a movie that you should really pass on.<br /><br />It is just not worth seeing . It is very boring and uninteresting . I feel that it would even be that way to small children . It has no magic that the book contains . This movie is not horrible , but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into it.<br /><br />There are moments that just come off as weird . The witch character is not very good . The family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening . I know this is a kids movie , so as an older audience we must not look too deeply in things , but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any movie making experience before.<br /><br />The DVD that I had began skipping in the final moments of the film , and instead of trying to fix it I just turned it off and sent it back to Netflix . I really did n't care how it finished . Skip this film and read the book instead .
0 I have never read the book"A wrinkle in time " . To be perfectly honesty , after seeing the movie , do I really want to ? Well , I should n't be reviewing this movie i 'll start off with that . Next i 'll say that the TV movie is pretty forgettable . Do you know why I say that ? Because I forgot what happens in it . I told you it was forgettable . To be perfectly honest , no TV movie will ever be better than " Merlin".<br /><br />How do I describe a TV movie ? I have never written a review for one before . Well , i 'll just say that they usually have some celebrities . A wrinkle in time includes only one . Alfre Woodard(Or Woodward , I am not sure ) , the Oscar winner . < br /><br />The film has cheesy special effects , a mildly interesting plot , scenes that make you go " WTF " . The movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go"WTF " . What did I expect ? It 's a TV movie . They usually are n't good . As is this one . A wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster . To top it off , you 'll most likely forget about it the second it 's over . Well , maybe not the second it 's over . But within a few minutes.<br /><br />A wrinkle in time:*/ * * * *
0 I only recently found out that Madeleine L'Engle 's novel had been turned into a TV movie by Disney and ordered the DVD . The book was a favorite of mine when I was a child and I read it several times.<br /><br />Despite some of the child actors not resembling the characters as described in the novel , the Murry family is well cast , with a likable ( if too pretty ) Meg at the center and a Charles Wallace who is convincing as a child prodigy without becoming irritating . < br /><br />The first half hour is promising enough , doing a good job in establishing the relationships between the lead characters and at setting the scene . Unfortunately as soon as the non - human characters appear the adaptation starts to unravel and once the children leave earth the whole thing falls apart . Alfre Woodward is too youthful looking and much too regal as the eccentric Mrs Whatsit ( think Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright instead ) and Kate Nelligan face is so mask like and inexpressive , she must have visited Faye Dunaway 's plastic surgeon in recent years . For some reason they make her Mrs Which look like Glinda from The Wizard of Oz when she should have resembled a benign Wicked Witch of the West.<br /><br />In the end what lets this down most badly are the terrible special effects and art direction . I understand that this is a TV movie , but the CGI looked like something that could have been done 15 years earlier . Mrs Whatsits ' centaur incarnation is a disaster as is the Chewbacca like suit for Aunt Beast , who in the novel is a velvety , elegant creature instead of the ungainly Big Foot like thing shown here . I could go on and on , nearly every artistic choice is a disaster , presumably because there was n't a large enough budget to do this justice , but also because the design work lacks imagination and good judgement.<br /><br />This really would have needed the sense of wonder Spielberg brought to his early films . What a shame that with the current popularity of adapting children 's literary fantasy series nobody thought of adapting A Wrinkle in Time and it 's sequels for the big screen , giving it the scope it deserves .
0 This movie barely followed the story line of the movie . All of the fascinating points in the book did n't even exist in the movie . They ended up turning it into a cheesy " tween " Disney movie " crush " story between Meg and Calvin . It was so bad it should have been Hillary Duff playing the part , or one of the likes . This movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book . I ca n't believe Disney could even get away with making such a cheap , basic rendition . If you 've ever read the book , I think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of " Lord of the Rings " equivalence . This movie should have never been able to use the title of A Wrinkle in Time . Poorly done .
0 We all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books . While not particularly accurate adaptations , these movies were nonetheless excellent films . Some great examples are the Harry Potter series , the Lord of the Rings trilogy , and , to a lesser extent , almost every Disney film ever made . However , I must regretfully announce that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those movies . Not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of Madeleine L'Engle 's fan base , it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting , acting , special effects and , ultimately , respect for the audience . Mind you , I 'm not trying to be mean ; on the contrary , I went into this affair with an open mind . I figured that a made - for - T.V. movie would make up for its lack of razzle - dazzle in its script . After all , the Star Wars spin - off Ewoks was decent , if a little silly . Come to think of it , the original Star Wars was made on " a lunch money budget " , and look where it took George Lucas ! However , from the first scene onward , disappointment started enveloping me as if I 'd gotten too close to the Black Thing while tessering . < br /><br />The same way Greedo shooting first became the symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition of 1997 ( a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic ) , Mrs. Whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is A Wrinkle in Time . The reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief . Aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting Alfre Woodard ( Star Trek : First Contact and Radio ) as our favorite star - turned - mentor , the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow . That 's right , a crow . Moreover , the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight - year - old ; the majestic half - man , half - horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle . Had I been five , this would have psychologically traumatized me for life . The worst part is the fact that when it spoke , it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync , resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single , unmoving cheek , thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than E.T.<br /><br />Having gotten the most painful part out of the way , I must go on to the tear - inducing one : the characters , the acting , and the story . I , personally , had always imagined Meg to look somewhat similar to Moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter films : plain hair , glasses , and a figure most supermodels would find laughable . She was always a slightly anxious , humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of Nicaragua . In the film , she is an unpleasant know - it - all for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever . In fact , she makes me feel sorry for poor Mr. Jenkins , her school principal , who continuously has to deal with her . Calvin , the kind , intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has become ¬Ö a jock ! The irony is horrible . As for the memorable Happy Medium , they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is " above gender " and likes to look at " funny " things , such as girls falling off of swings . The only three people I can think of who did a decent job are Charles Wallace , Mrs. Whatsit and the Man With Red Eyes ( nicknamed " the Dude With Red Eyes " due to his complete reinvention as a character).<br /><br />The story is a mess . A good comparison to this aspect of the movie is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , which did n't do a good job of retelling the story found in the book , yet kept the sole of the original work . Here , the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with Hades down in the underworld , apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed . As the Dark Lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen , the flat - nosed wookies of Ixchel ( who replace the wondrous beings who hold Aunt Beast among their ranks ) tear the spine up . As the God of the Dead notes how subtle the terror of the Earth - like Camazotz was , the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil . < br /><br />I am very sorry that this film exists . I do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad . It 's the way the characters are written that ruins it . A Wrinkle in Time deserved to be adapted by Lawrence Kasdan , directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg , enhanced at Industrial Light and Magic , scored by John Williams , given its sound at Skywalker Sound , edited by THX and marketed by Twentieth Century Fox . In its current state , the film is unworthy to be shown to self - respecting people . Even Madeleine L'Engle thought it was bad . The book was Good , the film was Bad , and Mrs. Whatsit was Ugly.<br /><br />Score : 0.1/10 ( If I could ) < br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />They got the names right . < br /><br />Cons : < br /><br />It had horrible problems with the Cliffs Notes level of adaptation , script , acting and special effects , not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book . Oh , and the main cover / poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle . Some might say that this symbolizes high adventure . I say it symbolizes the irresponsibility of the cover artist who did n't even bother to Photoshop Meg 's arm on properly .
0 First of all , I am a huge fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books , A Wrinkle in Time . This movie , however , ruined that excitement for me . I am sorry , but Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool . In the movie , she has straight hair and no glasses and is the " sporty type " with a deep voice . This is not how Madeleine L'Engle pictured Meg to be at all . In fact , Meg was based on Madeleine 's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young . This is just one major example how the book and movie are different . So I would say , if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes , watch it but if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series , I would suggest skipping this movie .
0 I was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever . I did n't realize it was Disney until it was too late . I was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story . It was as if someone made a movie out of a 4th grader 's book report on the novel . Meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses . Mrs Murray ( Meg 's mother ) was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all ; they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet . And that 's just the beginning . By halfway through the movie I found myself shouting at the screen , much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who had n't read the book . I wish I had more thumbs so I could give four thumbs down for this one . The only good thing I can say is that for a person who has not read the book , this movie is kinda alright .
0 I just saw Adam Had Four Sons for the first time and the thing that struck me was that I believe that the model used was Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons . They were approximately the same ages as the four boys in this film . Warner Baxter in his portrayal of Adam Stoddard talked about the same values and family tradition that you would have heard from our 26th president without some of the more boisterous aspects of TR 's character . < br /><br />Like TR all of the Stoddard sons serve in World War I , in this case though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed . < br /><br />But what if a female minx gets into this all male household and disrupts things ? That 's Susan Hayward 's job here . In one of her earliest prominent roles , Hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries one son , has an affair with another , and starts making a play for the third . It 's an early forerunner of the kind of a part that later brought her an Oscar in I Want to Live.<br /><br />I suppose that with as powerful a model of decorum as Theodore Roosevelt was and Warner Baxter portrays , everyone is afraid to tell Father what 's going on . The sons and also their governess Ingrid Bergman . Here 's where the plot gets a little silly . Bergman is introduced to us as a governess hired by Baxter and wife Fay Wray for their kids . Wray dies and Baxter suffers some financial reversals in business . Bergman has to be let go . She goes back to France and years later comes back to the family when the kids are grown up . < br /><br />I'm sorry , but I ca n't believe the kids need a governess now . Hayward is quite right when she confronts her that it was n't the kids who brought her back . In the normal course of things , Bergman would have gotten on with her life . < br /><br />One of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the film I have was edited out . Possibly that could be the reason for the many plot holes we have.<br /><br />It 's too bad that Ingrid and Susan could not have done another film together in the Fifties when Hayward was at her heights and Bergman had just made a comeback.<br /><br />Susan Hayward is the main reason to see Adam Had Four Sons . And I 'm willing to believe that a good deal of Ingrid was left on the cutting room floor .
0 You 'd think that with Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter that this film would have been a lot better . Sadly , the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain - addled.<br /><br />The film begins with Ingrid Bergman coming to work for the Stoddard family . Everything is so very peachy and swell -- the family adores Bergman and things could n't be more perfect . Well , that is until the mother ( Fay Wray ) dies , the stock market crashes in 1907 ( wiping out the family 's fortune ) and Bergman is forced to go back home to France . This portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet , but not bad.<br /><br />Later , after the family 's fortunes have improved , Bergman returns . The four boys are now all grown and there is n't really a conceivable reason why they 'd hire her once again as a governess . But , briefly , everything is swell once again . But , when WWI occurs , the four all go to war -- gosh ! In the midst of this , one of the sons ( David ) brings home his new wife ( Susan Hayward ) . Miss Hayward 's character is as black and white as the others , though while they are all good and swell , she 's obviously a horny she - devil . To make things worse , she comes to live in the family home while David is at war.<br /><br />Now here is where the movie gets really , really dumb -- brain - achingly dumb . Hayward begins an affair with one of David 's brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers , Bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her , not Hayward with Jack ! WHY ? ! Why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman ? This was exactly the sort of excuse Bergman needed to get rid of the gutter - snipe once and for all ! This is just a case of lousy writing and made me mad ... and most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941.<br /><br />The rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for Hayward 's evilness to be exposed . This just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess . As expected , however , the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again --- happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut , Hayward.<br /><br />The film suffers because of poor writing . Hayward 's affair made no sense -- at least in how it was handled . And , having characters who are so gosh - darn good or evil ( with nothing in between ) sinks this movie to the level of a second - rate soap . The only thing that saves it at all is the acting --- they tried as best they could with a turgid script . Suffice to say that the Columbia Pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken !
0 By 1941 Columbia was a full - fledged major studio and could produce a movie with the same technical polish as MGM , Paramount or Warners . That 's the best thing that could be said about " Adam Had Four Sons , " a leaden soap opera with almost terminally bland performances by Ingrid Bergman ( top - billed for the first time in an American film ) and Warner Baxter . Bergman plays a Frenchwoman ( this was the era in which Hollywood thought one foreign accent was as good as another ) hired as governess to Baxter 's four sons and staying on ( with one interruption caused by the stock - market crash of 1907 ) until the boys are grown men serving in World War I. Just about everyone in the movie is so goody - good it 's a relief when Susan Hayward as the villainess enters midway through ¬ó she 's about the only watchable person in the movie even though she 's clearly channeling Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh ; it 's also the first in her long succession of alcoholic roles ¬ó but the script remains saccharine and the ending is utterly preposterous . No wonder Bergman turned down the similarly plotted " The Valley of Decision " four years later .
0 Saw this film ran in the wee hours on TCM . Several problems with the film were apparent from what I saw . First , the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years . Several parts of the film had continuity problems & for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the 10 years passed . < br /><br />The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes or so , at least a huge gap with black screen appeared . It is too bad , because even though the script left something to be desired , Bergman & Russell both did fine in the film in their roles . It is a shame the large chunk is missing , but what is here is watchable.<br /><br />I just wish it was all intact . The script makes little sense in that Bergman 's character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults ? Some of the time lines do n't make sense either . There is a stock market crash that resembles 1929 but the kids grow up to fight in World War 1 . All the acting by the support folks in this film is fine . Just wonder what was in the 20 gap of film I could not see as it was missing .
0 The Golden Era of Disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the 90s . This show Quack Pack should n't even be considered a DuckTales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with DuckTales . It 's about a teen - aged Huey , Dewey and Louie as they make trouble for their uncle Donald and talk in hip - hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in DuckTales . I prefer the little adventurous nephews from DuckTales . There are humans in Duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg . There 's no references of Scrooge McDuck . The stories are repetitive , the plot is boring but the animation is good . If you want lots of slapstick humor , I recommend this to you . If you want a better Disney show watch " Darkwing Duck " or " DuckTales " .
0 Jameson Parker And Marilyn Hassett are the screen 's most unbelievable couple since John Travolta and Lily Tomlin . Larry Peerce 's direction wavers uncontrollably between black farce and Roman tragedy . Robert Klein certainly think it 's the former and his self - centered performance in a minor role underscores the total lack of balance and chemistry between the players in the film . Normally , I do n't like to let myself get so ascerbic , but The Bell Jar is one of my all - time favorite books , and to watch what they did with it makes me literally crazy .
0 I rented this movie from the library ( it 's hard to find for good reason ) purely out of curiosity . I 'm a huge Plath fan and this movie was a complete disappointment . The Bell Jar ( 1979 ) is by far one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . The script is horrible , not because it strays from the original novel text , but because it strays without focus or intent . The scenes are ill - constructed and do n't lead the viewer anywhere . What 's with the hokey voice over of Plath 's poetry ? Lady Lazarus has little do with Greenwood 's situation ; Plath 's poetry was completely misused . Marilyn Hassett is completely unbelievable as Esther Greenwood ( or any 20 year old for that matter ) partly due to casting ( she was 32 during filming , the age Plath was when she DIED ) and partly due to the fact that she ca n't act . Hassett is all emotion , no craft , no skill . The direction is mediocre ; the director simply covers what 's there , which is n't much . The only reason I 'm giving the film a 1 is because 0 is n't an option . Sorry Sylvia , you 'll have to wait for someone else to adapt your fine work into something more fitting .
0 This is one of the worst films I 've ever seen . I looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since I loved the novel , and I wish I had n't . I turned it off after a little less than an hour , though I wanted to turn it off after five minutes . I wish I had . It disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors . Unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last 50 or so minutes ( which would be impossible ) I would in no way recommend this . Its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century . I do n't think , as many people say that it is , that " The Bell Jar " is necessarily unfilmable , but this particular rendition could have been done without . I 'd almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice .
0 How did Mike Hammer live - in a penthouse with a GOLF BAG stashed in the corner next to a big screen cathode ray tube TV and a snazzy fireplace ? Nah , he 'd knock back a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered Camels on the couch or floor of his fly - specked office or in the stink of a lousy downtown LA flop house , wiping the dried red crust and oil smeared mud off his face , that 's how . Spillane wrote trash paperbacks , for sure , but how do you make it worse ? Give some desperate scheming producer a blank check because he thinks any Film Noir titled crap will sell at the box office , add some over - the - hill hot tomatoes and just generally screw - up the story - line by some retard , drugged out screen writer , that 's how !
0 This movie is just plain dumb.<br /><br />From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the fatuous climax , the film is an exercise in wooden predictability.<br /><br />Mike Hammer is one of detective fiction 's true sociopaths . Unlike Marlow and Spade , who put pieces together to solve the mystery , Hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth . This film turns Hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well , too dumb to get away with anything . One is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack.<br /><br />Other parts of the movie are right out of the Three Stooges play book . Velda 's dance at the barre , for instance , or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back . And the continuity breaks are shameful : Frau Blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she 's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot . The worst break , however , precedes the popcorn attack . The bad guy stalking Hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero , except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy.<br /><br />To be fair , there were some interesting camera angles and lighting , and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen , which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10 .
0 Man the ending of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my entire film aesthetics class laughed like crazy . Now most of the rest of the film was okay . It had a few unintentionally funny scenes but had a few real good camera shots and editing . Yes Alderich is a great director who made FLight Of The Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane among others . The problem is n't with direction , acting or anything technical . The movie is just destroyed in the third act . Why ? The murders , twists , turns and characters have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL ? What the heck was the writer smoking when he came up with that ? The way it just comes out of nowhere may have been the biggest Deus Ex Machina in history . For all the complaints about Burton 's Planet of the Apes , THe life of David Gale or Notorious I think THIS is the worst ending ever . What a let down .
0 I was really disappointed in this movie . Those that voted this thing a 10 have a screw lose . The acting was ok , kinda wooden and cardboard . The ending was sorry . I just did n't care for this at all.<br /><br />No way could I recommend this mess .
0 Average ( and surprisingly tame ) Fulci giallo which means it 's still quite bad by normal standards , but redeemed by its solid build - up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance.<br /><br />The genre 's well - known weaknesses are in full gear : banal dialogue , wooden acting , illogical plot points . And the finale goes on much too long , while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall I say : limp affair.<br /><br />Fulci 's ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing , though . Yellow clues wherever you look.<br /><br />3 out of 10 limping killers
0 A story of amazing disinterest kills " The Psychic " over and over again . The characters and plot are completely uninteresting ( as is Fulci 's mad camera work , which is usually a redeeming factor in his films ) , and any grasp of suspense is nowhere to be found . It 's padded out to an insufferable degree -- by the end , you wo n't be clamoring with excitement but stricken with boredom ( and , like me , maybe an uncontrollable urge to fall asleep ) . Jennifer O'Neill 's performance deserves occupancy in a better movie . Fulci gorehounds beware -- there 's just not much going on in " The Psychic." < br /><br />3/10
0 What was an exciting and fairly original series by Fox has degraded down to meandering tripe . During the first season , Dark Angel was on my weekly " must see " list , and not just because of Jessica Alba.<br /><br />Unfortunately , the powers - that - be over at Fox decided that they needed to " fine - tune " the plotline . Within 3 episodes of the season opener , they had totally lost me as a viewer ( not even to see Jessica Alba ! ) . I found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish . The new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin . On one of the second season episodes , they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically could n't sleep.<br /><br />The moral of the story ( the one that Hollywood never gets ) : If it works , do n't screw with it!<br /><br />azjazz
0 Awful , simply awful . It proves my theory about " star power . " This is supposed to be great TV because the guy who directed ( battlestar ) Titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtock schtick about a chick . B O R I N G.<br /><br />Find something a thousand times more interesting to do - like watch your TV with no picture and no sound . 1/10 ( I rated it so high b / c there are n't any negative scores in the IMDb.com rating system.)<br /><br />-Zaphoid < br /><br />PS : My theory about " star power " is : the more " star power " used in a show , the weaker the show is . ( It 's called an indirect proportionality : quality 1/"star power " , less " sp " makes for better quality , etc . Another way to look at it is : " more is less.")<br /><br />-Z
0 God , I was bored out of my head as I watched this pilot . I had been expecting a lot from it , as I 'm a huge fan of James Cameron ( and not just since " Titanic " , I might add ) , and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality ( Then again , he also wrote the leaden Strange Days .. ) . But the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration . In all that time , it barely went beyond its two line synopsis , and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere . On top of that , I do n't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular " A - Team " episode . As for Alba , yes , she is gorgeous , of course , but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie ( pouty and surly ) , makes me also get bored of her " gal wit an attitude " schtick pretty soon . You can count me out of this one , Mr. Cameron !
0 Wow , here it finally is ; the action " movie " without action . In a real low - budget setting ( do n't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times ) of a future Seattle we find a no - brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood.<br /><br />There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors ' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies , mainly " Matrix " without having the money to do it right . Yes , we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot - outs ( 45 secs approx . ) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody 's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then.<br /><br />And , yes , we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere , as if the script was thought - out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes.<br /><br />Believe me , it is as bad as it possibly can get . In fact , it does n't deserve to be taken seriously , but perhaps I can make some of you not rent it and save your money .
0 I 'm trying to picture the pitch for Dark Angel . " I 'm thinking Matrix , I 'm thinking Bladerunner , I 'm thinking that chick that plays Faith in Angel , wearing shiny black leather - or some chick just like her , leave that one with us . Only - get this ! - we 'll do it without any plot , dialogue , character , decent action or budget , just some loud bangs and a hot chick in shiny black leather straddling a big throbbing bike . Fanboys dig loud bangs and hot chicks in shiny black leather straddling big throbbing bikes , right?" < br /><br />Flashy , shallow , dreary , formulaic , passionless , tedious , dull , dumb , humourless , desultory , barely competent . Live action anime without any action , or indeed any life . SF just the way Joe Fanboy likes it , in fact . :(
0 I think the show had a pretty good concept to work with . But the execution was poor . The script is poor and acting is bad . There were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way , like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard . The show ca n't be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably . I should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of Muslim community to some extent.<br /><br />Till now second season is worse than the first one . I had my hopes high regarding this show , but I was kind of disappointed . Still I appreciate CBC for putting up such concept in front of the viewers . Anyway I wish best of luck for the future .
0 This show is a perfect example of how the CBC should stick to either news , sports , or satirical sketch comedy . As a developer of situation comedy , CBC has shown it can combine the pizazz of " King of Kensington " with the belly laughs of " The Beachcombers " . It is an embarrassment to great shows like " Kids in the Hall " and " Second City " that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame production.<br /><br />I have to admit , that I did n't give this show much of a chance right from when I first heard of its concept . To start , half of the concept is a direct attempt to rip - off one of the few sitcom successes in English - Canadian history , " Corner Gas " . The rest of the concept -- the cultural clash -- is far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness . The selection of the Muslim religion as the basis for the " fish out of water " characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be " edgy " and " topical " , but comes off as forced . Some of the jokes that are based around the local 's reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved , especially the audience.<br /><br />This show is a perfect example of how CBC just does n't " get it " when it comes to creating Canadian content , especially when presenting Canada as a multicultural environment . Cultural diversity in Canada does not have to be presented in such a heavy - handed and forced way . It would be a refreshing change to see CBC introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity . I doubt that CBC has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle . A comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in Corner Gas -- i.e . the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines . More realistically , their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics.<br /><br />That being said , even as a formulaic fish - out - of - water comedy this show fails . The acting is weak , the comic pacing all over the map , and the story premises that I saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief , even for a comedy . The only saving grace is the talented Derek McGrath , who is horribly wasted here . I doubt that even the addition of guest stars ( Colin Mochrie , for example , as an Anglican archbishop ) can save this dog . I decided to give the show a chance once the CBC 's ' hype ' had died down ; but two episodes were all I could stand -- I could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline . The time - slot would be better served by airing more Coronation Street , Air Farce re - runs , or Dr. Who . Even an infomercial would be an improvement .
0 Once again Canadian TV outdoes itself and creates another show that will go unwatched after its premiere episode . < br /><br />Last time I remember sitcoms were supposed to induce a reaction we in the business call laughter . How funny is it to beat the stereotype of all white people thinking that all Muslims are terrorists ? OK maybe one joke just to stick it to the masses . But not 30 minutes . It 's called beating a dead horse . Even SNL would know to give up after a commercial break.<br /><br />Also , let 's have a little conflict in these scripts . Will she or wo n't she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the fast on Ramadan ? When will Ramadan start ? Ohhhhh this is Emmy winning stuff here . < br /><br />And the characters ! What characters ? ! They are all cardboard cut - outs without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to the next . That 's the point of the situation comedy . We need to have strong , interesting , dynamic characters so that we are constantly drawn to the TV set each week . We have to care about these characters to worry about what trouble they 're going to get into next week . If I never see these characters it 'll be too soon . Thankfully I ca n't remember any of their names ( note to CBC - that 's not a good sign).<br /><br />And the acting is so bland . It 's more so a problem in casting than in the actors . None of these people actually embody the characters they play . They just seem to act their part as though they were working on a movie of the week . Sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character - make us fall in love with them - where they become inseparable from the character the portray . Watch any American sitcom and you 'll see how easily identifiable characters are . Part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as though it might be a platform to bigger and better things instead of being their one big character of a lifetime for whom they will spend the next 8 years portraying . That level of disinterest in the characters and the project shows . But to be honest , considering the lame concept and the horrible writing , there 's not much for the actors to do but say their lines and try not to bump into any furniture . As another commenter mentions , this seems like a TV movie and not a sitcom.<br /><br />And the directing or lack there of ! What can I say , Canada has so much talent , look at what the Comedy Channel is doing with Puppets Who Kill and Punched Up . Look at the Trailer Park Boys ( not the movie cause it bit the big helium dog ) . Look at any American show to see the potentials our talent as that 's where many of our stars go to find decent work.<br /><br />Give credit to the CBC , they really know how to build publicity for a non - event . Remember " The One " ? No - well do n't even try to learn any characters names in this show , as it 's sure to go the way of the dodo.<br /><br />Let 's all hope for a full blown ACTRA strike so that nothing like this emerges from the Ceeb for a good long while .
0 This series just gets worse and worse . Poorly written and just plain not funny ! The premise is excellent , but the writer 's inexperience shines through . By trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone . Now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about , and resorted to that patronizing , smug , " Oh , silly you " style acting that comes with a no laugh script . They roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say , are n't we zany ? Is n't this funny ? Well , no , it 's not actually . Gum disease is less painful . No wonder , with the exception of Corner Gas , Canadians generally avoid Canadian TV . Come on CBC you 're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of Canadian talent . Pull the plug on this amateurish mess .
0 Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I have ever seen . They have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most - easily - offended viewers which for CBC means 85 year old farmers in Saskatchewan . The jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame I ca n't believe it . The performances are very hammy and over acted but I do n't blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the CBC asked for and demanded . Very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as " controversial " well it is less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 Minutes , Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer 's Report .
0 I was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent Indian Candians but i found this show to be not funny at all . The producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it 's getting talked about ! I was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason , they are usually true . But there really was n't anything funny about these stereotypical characters . The " fresh of the boat " dad , who does n't understand his daughter . The radical feminist Muslim daughter ( who by the way is a terrible actress ) , and the young modern Indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can ( he 's a pretty good actor , i only see him getting better).<br /><br />it is very contrived and the dialog does n't flow that well . there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed , and do n't really care to watch another episode.<br /><br />I did however enjoy watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again , she 's always a treat and a natural at everything she does , too bad her daughter in the show does n't have the same acting abilities !
0 If you 're looking to be either offended or amused or both , you 'll probably have to look elsewhere . LMOTP really is n't even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clich√©s . At the end of the second episode I felt a little embarrassed that I actually sat through the contrived mess.<br /><br />Beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise that s attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it 's just another lame , innocuous and anti - septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the CBC typically excels at producing . And once the " ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO ! ! " hype wears out its welcome , the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it 's so shallow when judged on its merits alone.<br /><br />Unless you 're obsessed with Muslim culture in the west and/or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject I really do n't see how LMOTP is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype . Other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in western multi - ethnic societies . LMOTP will never rank among them in entertainment or insight .
0 This show is terrible , the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse . I am one of those people who was never a big fan of Corner Gas but at least I liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two , all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them . Well at least Corner Gas was good at first , Little Mosque on the Prairie is typically awful bland CBC comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1 . Who are the people who are watching this show anyway , I am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies ? Maybe the jokes are for them and they work there ? I do n't know a single person who likes this show and ca n't stand it myself , the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas . Hopefully it wo n't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being Muslim which is different and could / should have led to a great show .
0 I was really hoping that this would be a funny show , given all the hype and the clever preview clips . And talk about hype , I even heard an interview with the show 's creator on the BBC World Today - a show that is broadcast all over the world.<br /><br />Unfortunately , this show does n't even come close to delivering . All of the jokes are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist . All of the characters are one - dimensional . The acting is - well - mediocre ( I 'm being nice ) . It 's the classic CBC recipe - one that always fails.<br /><br />If you 're Muslim I think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters , and if you 're white you 'd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted , ignorant , or both . Not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in that . It 's only a problem when it is n't funny - as in this show.<br /><br />Canada is bursting with funny people - so many that we export them to Hollywood on a regular basis . So how come the producers of this show could n't find any ?
0 Unlike many , I do n't find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive . Its execution , however , is another matter entirely . Like so many B - minus movies , all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers . For most of the 22-or - so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor . Or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers . With a couple of exceptions the acting is awful ; the comical over - emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late - night infomercial , but not a primetime sitcom ( even a Canadian one . ) Notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle , I can not help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the CBC to replicate the success of Corner Gas . Unfortunately , they got the tone -- and the script -- completely wrong for the prairies . The final insult is that they apparently could n't even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town ( Why ? are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan ? ) Did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown Regina exteriors ? As a proud Canadian I hope this thing goes away soon , and that the rest of the world , primed by the CBC 's publicists , quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom .
0 Who likes awful " comedy " shows like Little Mosque on the Prairie ? The only two kinds of people I can think of who watch this are : One , Muslims and self - proclaimed Liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about Muslims that it does n't even matter if the show is good or funny at all ( which it is not ) . Two , old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable , badly written , stale jokes.<br /><br />CBC needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is . If they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen , their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left . I 'd be curious who even writes for this show ? Do you think it 's actually Muslims , or hip , funny young people ? No , I bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960's.<br /><br />When you look at the CBC comedy shows there are , Air Farce was only finally just taken off the air ( thank goodness ! ) but we still have lame ducks like This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer that we are paying for , not to mention this poor excuse for " comedy " Little Mosque on the Prairie . It is supposed to be offencive and funny ? Only the CBC would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny . Shame on the CBC for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother watching .
0 Up until this new season I have been a big ' Little Mosque ' fan . However , the new season had absolutely RUINED it.<br /><br />The new Christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show . It has always been about living together to overcome prejudice . The new vicar ruins that premise and shows Christians in a very bad light.<br /><br />I am neither Christian or Muslim , but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between Amar and the Reverend . Not any more.<br /><br />Just cancel it and be done with it . It 's not worth watching any more.<br /><br />It might still be saved , but a lot of change would need to be made.<br /><br />Bring back the old format .
0 To be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes Muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the Exact opposite . I realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a Muslim uses s a word like this in real life it does n't mean it is a terrorist thing . It also show 's how people give the Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype , by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad Muslims out it does n't mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time , like how hard it was for Amair to get on a plane and how he used words like " Blow up " or Yaser saying we 'll blow away the competition , and people took it the wrong way . Being a Muslim i know that stuff like this do n't usually happen , but they do and many people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq , its not right things are not like that . people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act . I am glad a show like this came on the air . There are many shows that Piotr Muslim people as terrorists , many people do find them funny to my opioion it is OK to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair , but it is done to often and really gives Muslin people a bad name .
0 I ca n't believe that people thought this stinking heap of trash was funny . Shifting the attempts at humor among cruelty , disgust and stupidity , ' There 's Something About Mary ' leaves little reason to stay until the end . Sure , Cameron Diaz is very pretty , but that is never going to be enough to save a movie . Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot , and is obviously very talented , but the movie is a loser.<br /><br />Not once were any of the scenes believable . The shots were badly timed and poorly framed . The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs . I check IMDB to see what they are working on just so I know what to avoid.<br /><br />2/10 ; the bonus is from the one time I smiled . It 's not like I 'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion . My wife hated it , too . The next day we saw ' Rush Hour ' and laughed ourselves silly . This movie just stunk .
0 As someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true - life tale , I was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been.<br /><br />THE BAD - I 'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he has played , but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator.<br /><br />The dialog is insipid and the pretty Kathryn Harrold is real garbage - mouth . From what I read , there were several directors replacing each other on this film , and that 's too bad . You can tell things are n't right with the story . I could n't get " involved " with Treat Williams ' portrayal of Cooper , either . He should have been fascinating , but he was n't in this movie . It 's also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of " folk hero , " but I admit I wound up rooting for the guy , too.<br /><br />Not everything was disappointing . I ca n't complain about the scenery , from the lush , green forests of Oregon to the desert in Arizona.<br /><br />I'd like to see this movie re - made and done better , because it is a one - of - a - kind story .
0 This film was hard to get a hold of , and when I eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming . I mean , this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century : an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and GETS AWAY with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt . With all of this built - in interest , how could anyone make such a lackluster , talk - laden flick of this true - life event . While Williams is always interesting , the screenwriters assumed that the D.B. Cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star , s what we get is a type - without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off . Harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty , but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction . Shame on this film for even existing .
0 As an impressionable 10 year old , I liked the " love conquers all " philosophy of the 70s sitcom " Bridget Loves Bernie . " I did understand the controversy , which was about the romantic complications between a Jewish cab driver ( David Birney ) and an Irish Catholic school teacher ( Meredith Baxter ) and both sets of parents ( Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie 's parents ; Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget 's parents ) who have issues with the young couple 's interfaith marriage.<br /><br />Looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences , I am amazed that the show was even a success for one , albeit , highly - rated season . Created by veteran TV writer Bernard Slade , who a few years after the show 's cancellation would write the successful play " Same Time , Next Year " , " Bridget Loves Bernie " was a very light , superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight.<br /><br />There was no denying the real - life chemistry between Birney and Baxter . But , in later years , both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects ( Birney in his short - lived role in " St. Elsewhere " and Baxter in " Family " and " Family Ties " ) . Here , they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge , which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject.<br /><br />The show aired Saturday nights between two CBS powerhouses : " All in the Family " and " Mary Tyler Moore " . Both of those shows were smart , funny and had enough of an edge ( more so on the former that the latter ) that kept my interest in the situation and the characters . " Bridget Loves Bernie " was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles.<br /><br />This was another example of a show that really was not as good as I remembered .
0 SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgettable action movie , Lorenzo Lamas does his usual tough guy / pretty boy act , and his future real life ex Kathleen Kinmont is ass kicking hot chick Alexa . OJ Simpson is a detective , coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona . Translation : cable TV filler . There is n't enough skin to qualify this as a Guilty Pleasure.<br /><br />The script has some gaping holes . Best / Worst Moment : In one jarring scene , OJ 's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue . OJ responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot , or words to that effect . This vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough ; but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released , it is truly appalling , and therefore entertaining in an unintentional , horrible way . I was so startled that I laughed until champagne came out of my nose . Now THAT 'S a Guilty Pleasure . BC
0 Lorenzo Lamas stars as some type of CIA agent , who captures some exotic beauty named Alexa , kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers . O.J Simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not so talented ensemble . I must admit i 'm not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas , or his movies . He stinks . However when compared to O.J Simpson and Lamas ' comatose wife Kinmont , Lamas seems like ah , Jean - Claude Van Damme . I only saw CIA because of the renewed interest around the O.J Simpson trial , you see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels , you could n't escape this movie . in 1994 you could go to an Amish community and some moron would have this playing in their portable TV . The movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue although the shock value of O.J Simpson jumping after fireballs and exchanging would be one liners do provide some unintentional humor . Also where was Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this a complete camp classic ? < br /><br / > * out of 4-(Bad )
0 " CIA Codename : Alexa " is an absolute horrible rip off of Luc Besson 's classic film " La Femme Nikita"(1990 ) . The film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the CIA and is forced to do a secret mission for them . ( Pretty much the same story structure of La Femme Nikita ) The acting combo of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in cinema history . Lamas ' " acting " is simply a bad Steven Segal impersonation . Watching Orenthal act in this film is an excruciating experience.<br /><br />The writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable . There are so many action movie " conventions " in the film it is ridiculous : unnecessary car explosions , people flying thru glass windows , terrorists , bad ponytails , etc . The musical score resembles David Michael Frank 's score for " Hard to Kill " ( 1990 ) , which furthers the Steven Segal theme of this movie . There is plenty of martial arts in the film , and it is pretty well done for a low budget American production . The mindless action and over the top acting never lets up , and I have to admit I was mildly entertained . < br /><br />Lorenzo Lamas had the look of an action star back in the early 90 's but he is certainly no action star , that is why he is doing soap operas and not action blockbusters . My recommendation is that you skip " CIA Codename : Alexa " and check out " La Femme Nikita " instead .
0 This is really really bad . Lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job . But what makes it worth watching is the scene where OJ angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric " I got the evidence on you ! " . ( Makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren but i could n't find it on iTunes ) . Talk about seeing into the future ... Too funny for words . The rest of the movie is forgettable . The score and songs are more interesting than the script . Ditto the sequel . Which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all . My understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these B movies . Does n't say much for the world 's viewing habits .
0 The " math " aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this TV show apart from the millions of other cop shows . The only redeeming aspect to this show is Rob Morrow , although his career must have been ( undeservedly ) waning after Northern Exposure if he signed up for this schlock.<br /><br />The lame - ness of the " math " aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co - starring Lou Diamond Phillips ( which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned . ) In order to catch a fugitive , the " mathematician " uses some theory about " bubbles " . So , he gives this long explanation that , if we have seen the suspect in places A , B and C , then we can use " bubble theory " to calculate where he might be . He does this all on a chalkboard , or maybe with a stick in the dirt ( I ca nt remember).<br /><br />Anyway , when you look at the finished product , he basically took three spots , and picked a point right in the middle and said " Ok , mathematically , here 's where we are most likely to find the fugitive . " At which point , one other character points out " Oh , that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live . " Is that math ? Its not even connect - the - f**k**g - dots ! ! ! This show reminds me of the math major I used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to " support " points that every one else had already agreed on through either less - complex analysis or basic common sense.<br /><br />It just goes to show -- When you 're a hammer , everything looks like a nail . I ca n't wait til they stick the NUMB3RS team on OSAMA ... They 'll use calculus , call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains , and hit Osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields ... cuz hey ... its all about the numbers.<br /><br />Totally ludicrous TV show .
0 After watching a dozen episodes , I decided to give up on this show since it depicts in an unrealistic manner what is mathematical modeling . In the episodes that Charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models , I thought that my profession was being joked about . I am not a mathematician , instead a chemical engineer , but I do work a lot with mathematical models . So I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to " make - believe " of fairy tales.<br /><br />First , choosing the right model to predict a situation is a demanding task . Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius , but even him would have to spend considerable time researching for a suitable model , specifically for trying to guess what someone will do or where he will be in the near future . Individuals are erratic and haphazard , there is no modeling for them . Isaac Asimov even wrote about that in the 1950 's . Even if there were a model for specific kind of individual , it would be a probabilistic ( stoichastic ) one , meaning it has good chance of making a wrong prediction.<br /><br />Second , supposing the right model for someone or a situation is found , the model parameters have to be known . These parameters are the constants of the equations , such as the gravity acceleration ( 9.8 m / s2 ) , and often are not easy to determine . Again , Charlie Eppes would have to be someone beyond genius to know the right parameters for the model he chooses . And after the model and the parameters are chosen , they would have to be tested . Oddly , they are not , and by miracle , they fit exactly the situation that is being predicted.<br /><br />Third , a very important aspect of modeling is almost always neglected , not only by Numbers , but also by sci - fi movies : the computational effort required for solving these models . Try to make Excel solve a complex model with many equations and variables and one will find doing a Herculean job . Even if Charlie Eppes has the right software to solve his models , he might be stuck with hardware that will be dreadfully slow . And even with the right software / hardware combination , the model solution might well take days to be reached . He solves them immediately ! I could use his computer in my research work , I would be very glad.<br /><br />As a drama , it is far from being the best show . The characters are somewhat stereotyped , but not even remotely funny as those in Big Bang Theory are . The crimes are dull and the way Charlie Eppes solves them sometimes make the FBI look pretty incompetent.<br /><br />For some layman , the show might work . For others , the way things are handled makes it difficult to swallow !
0 As an engineer , I must say this show 's first season started out very promising . Most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible , and the relationships portrayed between the Eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge.<br /><br />But after the first season , the show started degrading , heavily . Most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science & technology for real.<br /><br />The involvement from the actors still feels okay and I can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode , but in the end , this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade C action thriller and CSI style cop show.<br /><br />If you are gon na watch it , go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second . Thereafter I would not waste my time . Myself , I gave the show up midway through season 3.<br /><br />Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars < br /><br />Let 's sum that up to 4 stars . Since Charlie does n't know his math anymore , I wo n't bother with the correctness of mine either .
0 here , let me wave my hands over the keyboard , i 'll tell you what salad she 's going to order . over and over , works like a charm : he 's such a genius , omg how does he do it ? my bullshit detector freaks if i even pass this show when i 'm scanning channels , I have to be very careful ( these days it 's useful far too often , so I do n't need it getting broken on idiotic crap like this ... careful with that remote ! ) . is this supposed to be some fascist propaganda to make people believe in some invisible realm of uberman control and mastery ? or what ? why does it exist??<br /><br />this is THE most inane show , completely unbelievable and contrived , and I can not understand why it 's still on the air . so may geeks give SO much better shows such a hard time ( Sarah Connor Chronicles , True Blood ) , but give this nonsensical drivel a pass . shows like Firefly ( if there were any like that ) fall away after a season , but mindless stuff like this that makes zero logical sense just keeps marching on . yeccch .
0 * * * Comments contain spoilers * * * I was barely holding on to this show as appointment TV when they started the annoying music under EVERY SCENE , when Don Epps was averaging almost a shooting per case , when the very nasally Diane Farr was obviously pregnant ( but we were n't to notice ) and when Colby was a f*****g TRIPLE agent . But now , in tonight 's episode , David is trapped with a paranoid , nut job who is an OBVIOUS amateur with a gun , in an elevator and .... HE CAN'T DISARM HIM . A trained , experienced field agent who has been 1st through the door many times and is experienced in hand - to - hand fighting , CAN'T TAKE OUT A NUT JOB . Not when said nut job blinks , looks away , drops his head , closes his eyes ; not even when he looks up at the fiber optic wire wriggling around the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds.<br /><br />Then the scene came that let me know that as much as I enjoy learning from the chubby , frumpish but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy sidekick / love interest Amita , my Friday nights will be better spent otherwise engaged . Don gives David the " distress word " that is the code for " The s**t is about to go down " ; David is ready , they kill the lights , drop the elevator , startle the nut job and ...... <br /><br />David CANNOT DISARM / KILL / BEAT INTO SUBMISSION THE NUT JOB . The bad guy ends up with BOTH GUNS , David ends up SHOT.<br /><br />I'm done . Hope the NUMB3RS are fun .
0 Since " Rugrats " ' falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years , obviously the tyrants at Klasky - Csupo should be out of ideas . After dumbing down all of the characters , adding even stupider new ones , replacing some voices ( though I like Nancy Cartwright , she is NOT Chucky Finster ! ) , and having no sense of continuity ( ex . : in a Kimi episode I watched the other day , Tommy and Chucky each got a new puppy ; but it subsequent episode , the aforementioned dogs never appear ) , you 'd think the creators could kill the show for mercy . But noooo.<br /><br />All I will say concerning this special is that it sucks ! While not as horrible as the Kimi episodes , everyone is even stupider than they were , including Grandpa ( my God ! He used to be the best character on the show , but now , he has no real purpose ) . The ending is needlessly fluffy , and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes ( ' 98-'01 ) is that the kids can interact with adults . Whoa , what fun!<br /><br />No stars at all for " The Rugrats All Growed Up " . Klasky - Csupo , please DESTROY this show before it gets any worse .
0 It a bit peculiar that a story that is placed in a part of Oslo where a very high percentage of the local residents is from an Asian background does NOT EVEN SHOW ONE ASIAN OR AFRICAN person , not even as an extra . That fact probably describes Norwegian race relations in general . - However.<br /><br />NO SPOILERS - ONLY A BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />Buddy portrays four young people living in a flat - share in Oslo . The protagonist are two young men that do n't manage to direct their life in any serious fashion , and one might say that the film could be about being indecisive and avoiding responsibility - a sort of fear of growing up . The narrative plays on typical teenage dreams and fantasies and lifestyle role models . Quite the clich√© . Although the story is mildly funny , the acting is good and as a ' young person ' one can sort of identify with the characters ` crazy ' situations and complicated love affairs , I do n't find the story or the characters very believable . To polished and lacking in depth . This film uses all the classic audience pleasing tricks to make an entertaining film that has as much intellectual depth as ` Friends ' ( yes that show on TV).<br /><br />Has Norwegian film finally found its identity ? : Audience pleasers in well known American style.<br /><br />How about watching Lukas Moodysson 's Tillsammans ( Together ) .
0 I 'm a fan of arty movies , but regretfully I have to report this movie to be pretentious drivel . Agonisingly slow to develop a non - existent plot based on a promising premise , the experience is , shall we say , trying . Even after bad movies I feel that I learn something , or enjoyed some aspect , but there there was nothing to appreciate . The premise was not uninteresting , but the movie starts and ends there . The acting was OK , though the characters were utterly boring . For the protagonist to aim at such an audacious goal , she is mightily empty . Pity . I usually enjoy movies that are unformulaic , but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content .
0 I have to admit that I stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen , besides the dead body in the first scenes ... and her disposal of him . I was wrong . It was a cinema verite of Betty hits the Beach encased for the first part by Mordant Morven . I really do n't care what young lassies from Scotland do these days , who thy screw , what drugs they take . Visually , the stroll through the Cabo de Gata in Andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me . The nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend . As the movie came to a close I had two thoughts ... 1 . That 's all there is ? 2 . Now I see why her boyfriend killed himself . Rename it . " Bare Bitch Boredom , or What I did on my trip to Spain . " I 'm such a sucker for sticking these things out .
0 Lynne Ramsey makes arresting images , and Samantha Morton can summon feeling with a gesture . So what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered , pretentious lark . < br /><br />Ramsey ca n't bring Callar to life . Her attempts are too arty and oblique . Repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if Morton 's obliterated gaze alone could supply character . We are in a blank Warholian hell of self - indulgence : for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs crawling across the floor , you might think it could get round to fleshing out its protagonist . But how will it do so if she rarely speaks ? Without the novel 's interior monologue , the celluloid Morvern Callar is nobody . Small wonder Ramsey has Morton undress often.<br /><br />That said , the first ten minutes were so impressively acted , shot and edited that my hopes were soaring . Give the film that much : it knows how to make promises , if not how to keep any .
0 When a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible , the cause can invariably be found in the book : either it was pointless to start with , or the point is one not easily conveyed to film , or the movie missed the point , which is the most frequent of these results , and the easiest to happen , especially when the point is one not easily defined . The book " Morvern Callar " has a point ; every reader of the book must have felt this , and felt as if he had gotten it ; but I suspect most of them could not state it in words . I 'm not sure I can , myself , but perhaps it comes to this , or something like it : Things come , things go , such is life , but we carry on ; or at any rate some of us -- people like Morvern -- do . No doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition . But the important fact is that there is a point -- possibly the sum of the entire story is the point -- and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view , and to carry over , in adapting the story to film . The maker of this film evidently missed the point , and does n't substitute one of her own ; and so the film is about nothing.<br /><br />This is not the usual complaint of a book - lover that his favorite text has been violated . The merit of the book is something I conceded grudgingly : in reading it I found it a bloody nuisance , and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly . The narrative is supposed to be the work of the half - educated Morvern , but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect , as if the author were poking at her with his pen ; there are inconsistencies of style and tone , as if different sections had been composed at different times ; and any conclusions I could reach about Morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not : for instance , despite Morvern 's own self - characterization as a raver , am I wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working - class Scots girl , and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past ? In any case , despite my irritation at the author , I could n't deny that his book stuck with me ; and what I could n't get out of my head was his character 's attitude , her angle on the world , which was almost as vivid as a Goya portrait . Morvern is the kind of person who 's always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible ; occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her , like flies , so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging - through , unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical -- and that does n't begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough . The complex of incidents and of Morvern 's responses to them are the substance of the book , and its achievement , in exposing a cross - section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise ; for all my dislike of the book , I can see this.<br /><br />The Morvern just described is not the Morvern of the movie ; or if it is , most of her is kept offscreen . An actress who might have been a good fit for the character , had she been the right age at the right time , is Angharad Rees , from the old TV series " Poldark " . Samantha Morton , then , would seem like good casting : she 's rather the same sort of actress , and in one of her earlier movies , " Jesus ' Son " , she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one . Unfortunately , as the film turned out , she does n't have the character from the book to play . For one thing , the book is one that , if it is to be dramatized , virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience ; without her comments , her perspective , her voice , the story loses most of its meaning . It has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements : the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty , and so Morvern 's responses ( whether of amusement or distaste , depending on her mood ) are missing too , and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story . In short , the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk , edgy serio - comic novel into a genteel art TV film , and chose as her typical image one of Ms. Morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy ; as if the outing Morvern signs up for were a tour of the Stations of the Cross . This is n't at all what the book , or the Morvern of the book , was about . For another thing , the Morvern of the movie is n't Scottish ( the actress said in an interview she had n't had time to study up the accent ) , and she ought to be : it 's important that she , her family , and her mates are all from a single place . And finally the film is missing the end of the story : Morvern 's spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness : it 's winter , the dam has frozen , the power has gone out , and the pub is dark . Minus this , and minus all of the rest , what 's left is a failed art film , a dead film , about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal , or native inability , ever to give in to being dead .
0 It was probably just my DVD --- but I would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a DVD.<br /><br />I had to turn up the volume on my TV to the highest possible level , in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog . Some of the talking still remained sub - audible . If you 're from Scotland , you might have a chance , albeit a slim one.<br /><br />Peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds , including unwrapping a package , footsteps , even puffing on a cigarette . < br /><br />With the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard , I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment , such as a disco . And that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down.<br /><br />There is art and there is art , even in the field of audio mixing . But this effort , in a time of war , would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity.<br /><br />After about a half hour , I gave up , having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture , either .
0 There are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning , and that ignorant fools like me do n't ' get ' it . Obviously this means that we should stick to Hollywood dross.<br /><br />It has every , a - hem , artistic clich√© in the book - I guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few . Almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense.<br /><br />The director of the ( almost equally embarrassing ) movie ' Ratcatcher ' returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense ; it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation . The best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers .
0 Nothing happens.<br /><br />Then characters with no personality do n't develop.<br /><br />Then the end never comes because there 's no beginning and no middle.<br /><br />There are beautiful shots that are made not beautiful because they are n't even allowed to be , because this movie is n't even THERE . There 's no " is " in this movie because there 's no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point . There 's nothing ! < br /><br />There is a good point : it has a good soundtrack . But the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it is n't even worth your time , so if you 're really interested , I 'd suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something . You 'll get everything you can from this movie without all the fatigue , headache , and impatience.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
0 My wife and I watch a film every night with no distractions , and mostly artsy films that require thought . I have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom . My wife has double the attention span that I do . All that being said-- this film is just plain empty and BORING ! It went nowhere . Never blossomed . It started fairly strong with a promising plot ... then she bakes cookies ... goes to Spain .... she sulks , she stares .... the credits roll . Uneven , full of holes , false starts & dead ends . We FF'd through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space . Artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried . Zzzz ...... It 's like a beautifully shot chick - flick that 's pretending to be deep or artsy . You never get to know nor understand Morvern at all . About halfway through you just do n't care anymore . We just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines develop . Do n't waste your time on this . I 'm shocked it scores so high .
0 It has its merit 's ; Morvern Callar is both the merits and the disappointments . She 's so enigmatic , so original . Is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that 's making her so distant and un - relatable ? Or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary ? Personally I 'd call her dysfunctional.<br /><br />Morvern is completely detaching herself . Disposing of her boyfriend , not thinking of informing family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral , she selfishly splashes out on a trip to Spain . She 's seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed . The only element that enables the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her . Although by the end her friend is dumped and Morvern has nothing that ties her down to humanity . She may as well have killed herself.<br /><br />Despite managing to make Spain look as gloomy and bland as the UK the director 's shots were superb , the lighting and color made the film visually stunning.<br /><br />It 's really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest . It 's little over 90 minutes but feels a lot longer . They manage to make Morvern seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you do n't care about the characters or the film .
0 80 minutes , and it felt twice that long ! Brief Crossing is not brief enough . Indeed , the first 50 minutes or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue ( more of a monologue , really ) of a woman approaching middle age , tediously droning about " men , " disappointment , sex , aging , and her recent breakup , to a French teenager she met in the ship 's cafeteria.<br /><br />The tedious monologue continues as they go to duty - free shop , and to a bar , where finally her self - involved rant pushes him away . The " story " ca n't end there , of course , so she persuades him to listen to her drone on more as she brings him to her cabin.<br /><br />What little romance , sex , or for that matter , anything at all this film has besides bitter rantings is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all . Yes , the ending is very nicely done , but it is scant reward to subject yourself to what amounts to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner.<br /><br />Of course , some people like it . I could be wrong .
0 I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay a while ago . I watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again . The excessive amount of watery ' blood ' at the beginning is just plain obsolete - not to mention the " whip - around " wind sounds . My friends and I made a super low budget movie , and the effects still exceeded this crap fest.<br /><br />As for the amount of mistakes in this movie , there are way too many to count . I knew one of the actors - believe it or not , he was my THEATRE teacher . HA ! < br /><br />Final verdict : Do n't bother with this " horror " flick . < br /><br />3 Stars ( out of a possible 73 )
0 This really should deserve a " O " rating , or even a negative ten . I watched this show for ages , and the show jumped the shark around series 7 . This episode , however , is proof that the show has jumped the shark . It 's writing is lazy , absurd , self - indulgent and not even worthy of rubbish like Beavis and Butthead.<br /><br />It is quite possible to be ridiculous and still be fun -- Pirates of the Caribbean , the Mummy , Count of Monte Cristo -- all " fun " movies that are not to be taken seriously . However , there is such thing as ridiculous as in " this is the worst thing I 've ever seen . " And indeed , this is the worst episode of Stargate I 've ever seen . It 's absolutely dreadful , and this coming from someone with a stargate in her basement.<br /><br />Makes me want to sell all of my stargate props , most seriously .
0 First of all I just want to say that I LOVE this show ! ! ! But this episode ... this episode makes a mockery of the entire show.<br /><br />I do n't know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the WORST episode in the entire series.<br /><br />There is no story line , everything is chaotic and the jokes ..... are crap.<br /><br />The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game ..... For example " how do the furlings look like " by creating that stupid " previously on ... " ...... is simply embarrassing.<br /><br />Its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad .
0 This is available on a " Drive In Double Feature " from Dark Sky Films , and since I just had finished up " Barracuda " , I watched this too . This is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time.<br /><br />We begin with two young ladies wandering the streets of some foreign town , but where exactly are they ? They stop to look at necklaces from some Chinese vendor , and try on Chinese - style clothes at a shop , but then we see some Aztec dancers ? And all the while , these girls are being followed by two guys , who eventually drop whatever stealth they did n't have to chase the girls on a wild run though the town , and they finally catch them.<br /><br />It seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around her neck , and these guys want to find the loot , and where did she get it ? So , in flashback , we go back to find out . And how did they know she had this coin ? Hard to say , really.<br /><br />Now , back in the day , when these two women were 10 years old , they were out with their sisters and their sister 's boyfriends on a boat , and after stopped to get air in their tanks , they tow this young boy back to his home dock , only to have his grandpa come out & invite the " young ' uns " up for herbal tea with granny . But not everyone has the tea , Todd has gone back to the boat to check on the young girls , and then when they 're away from it , the boat blows up , and when they get back to the house their friends have mysteriously disappeared . Well , it seems as though these " kindly folk " raise their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to drop by for a spell , and serve it herbal tea.<br /><br />But the girls and Todd did leave the island , but now , they 're returning , escorted by their captors , and they 're there to find the treasure , despite the fact that no one ever showed the girls where it was BEFORE . There also seems to be someone else on the island , and the thugs mysteriously begin to die , one by one , and since there 's only three , it does n't take long . And there 's even a sort of happy ending , which will leave the viewer every bit as baffled as they were throughout the rest of the film.<br /><br />The two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger issues , and combined with no acting ability they 're borderline hilarious . The hillbilly - type family is also devoid of acting ability , despite the fact that the grandpa is Hank Worden , who appeared in many films and TV shows . The action is confusing , the locales are even more confusing , and the island looks like Southern California.<br /><br />So what the hell IS this ? I 'm not sure , but it certainly is worth seeing once so you can think ( or say ) , huh ? 4 out of 10 , very bizarre .
0 Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on . All that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family.<br /><br />This one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that I started feeling bad for poor Hank Worden who truly deserved much MUCH better . As much as I did n't like " Barracuda " ( that 's on the same DVD ) I have to admit that this film makes that one look like Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Eye Candy : one pair of tits ( they might belong to Kirsten Baker ) < br /><br />My Grade : F < br /><br />Dark Sky DVD Extras : Vintage ads for various drive - in food ; and Trailers for " Bonnie 's Kids " ( features nudity ) , " the Centerfold Girls " , " Part - time Wife " ( features nudity ) , " Psychic Killer " , & " Eaten Alive " . The DVD also comes with 1978 's " Barracuda "
0 Although , I had no earthly idea on what to expect from this movie , this sure as hell was n't what I would have had in mind , had anything actually come to mind . Once I heard of its existence , all I knew was that I had to own a movie called Please Do n't Eat The Babies . unfortunately , I could only find a copy under its alternate title , Island Fury . Looking back , I guess I could call it a lose - lose situation . On one hand , I still do n't get to be known as the guy who owns a movie called Please Do n't Eat The Babies , and on the other hand , Island Fury would ultimately reveal itself to be an awful , pointless , boring , unwatchable piece of garbage . Yeah , definitely lose - lose.<br /><br />I'm not even sure what genre they 're going for here . Just early 80 's badness , with a flashback that might actually be longer than the non - flashback . First up , two teenage girls are being chased by two bad guys , once caught , the bad guys bring to our attention that one of the girls have a coin on a string , around her neck , and somehow , these bad guys know of a lot more of these coins hidden on an island somewhere . And this is where things start to get weird , somehow these guys know of a trip the girls took to some island , years earlier , when they were only 10 . I guess this is supposed to mean that the girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is . So , now , we 're in the past , while the girls try to retrace their steps , so these bad guys do n't kill them , although , I would n't have minded if they had . In the flashback , the 10 year old counterparts are on a boat trip with their sisters and the sisters boyfriends , eventually stopping by an island for some air , they get mixed up with some kid and his killer grandparents . Any potential suspense or reasons to keep on watching never shows up , but the flashback was undeniably better than the present , which , still , is n't saying much.<br /><br />For a while there I had forgotten about the original story , At one point , I Ithought maybe the director had too , and when the flashback ended , that would be the end , which would have worked for me considering this disappointment would have been a half - hour shorter . This pointless movie within a pointless movie does eventually end , and real stuff does happen , but it 's stupid . I guess I did n't exactly expect a movie filled with infants being devoured , or anything like that , but I did expect some form of outlandish B - entertainment , mostly just a confusing , inept storyline , unsure of its genre . My advice would be to seek out something worthwhile like Attack Of The Beast Creatures . If anyone , I would only recommend this one to serious B - movie collectors who must have them all , anyone else interested probably has brain damage . What really gets me is that I still have no idea why they called it Please Do n't Eat The Babies . 3/10
0 Having seen men Behind the Sun I guess I hoped for an evolution in style & technique to match the larger scale of this movie . I was also quite interested to see someone make a hard - hitting fact - based fictionalised account of what happened during this most notorious of Japanese atrocities , but this is not it . This plays like a bottom - to - mid tier European Nazi exploitation movie from the 70s - e.g. SS Experiment Camp etc ( perhaps more like Deported Women of the Special Section actually ) . Granted it has a greater scope and more people running around , but it resorts to the same cheap and cheerless device of lots of hapless non - actors limply falling over to the sound of ridiculously fake gunshots , spiced up with the occasional poorly executed ' shock ' sequence . The admittedly horrible documentary footage is roughly spliced in between scenes so hackneyed that even these real images are robbed of much of their power . Watch channel 4 's ' The Holocaust ' ( aired recently ( still running ? ) , as of 1 No 2006 ) for a genuinely disturbing documentary on the evils of war ( featuring excellent in - context use of actual footage ) . This is the type of treatment the horror of Nanjing deserves , not this hackneyed exploitation garbage ( a better executed exploitation movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine , but again this is not even a very good exploitation movie ) . Rating : 3 ( 5 as exploitation , 1 as a treatment of the subject ) .
0 I hate to sound like an ' old person ' , but frankly I have n't seen too many movies that I like that were made after 1960 ... generally , movies just seem to get worse and worse ( although I quite enjoyed the Scott Baio vehicle " The Bread , My Sweet " , except for the ' de rigeur ' sex scene which added NOTHING of value to THAT movie ) . This movie makes the mother , a former Las Vegas chorus girl , seem to be incapable of surviving on her own , although she is clearly in her 50s ( though hinted at being in her 40s ) . I did n't buy it . I 'm 57 and like all the women I know in their 50s and 40s , more than capable of surviving on my own ( as I have been doing since I graduated from high school at 13 , got legally emancipated and set off on my own life 's journey . ) < br /><br />The daughter is not believable in her job role ... she gets a promotion she does n't deserve ( a great opportunity ) and drops that ball too , but when another female employee steps up to the plate and is ready to deliver , the writers shoot her down as an ' opportunist ' , when she was just doing what any career - oriented person would do -- taking advantage of a wide - open opportunity created by the lack of self - discipline of her coworker , a girl who apparently does n't understand the concept of honoring her promises ( to her boss , in this case).<br /><br />The daughter grudgingly ' allows ' her mother to stay with her , on a temporary basis , but then treats her mother ( the woman who gave her Life and raised her to ' adulthood ' ) like a pariah . Apparently the ' writers ' of tripe like this do not understand that it is NOT ' the common thing ' for PARENTS to act like children , and then be treated AS children by THEIR children . That is just more of the societal ' baloney ' that Hollywood keeps trying to force down our throats as though we , their public , were stupid for desiring to be entertained by their creative offerings.<br /><br />This is a sad movie with a stupid ending . If the young male restauranteur had been real and not a two - dimensional ' tv character ' , he 'd have stayed with the MOTHER , who was not that much older than him and quite attractive . But in the end he ' falls ' for the daughter , a shallow , rather uninteresting girl who has that cuteness of youth , but in an ordinary , bland way . ( The ' opportunist ' young woman who worked with this nothing girl was far more attractive , physically.)<br /><br />There was no believable reason presented to the audience as to why the restauranteur preferred the daughter ( who was an uptight , selfish , self - centered b*tch who treated her mother with unbelievable disrespect ) to the mother -- a woman who was kindhearted , sweet - tempered , humorous , and had a joie de vivre the daughter could not even begin to comprehend . Of course the mother had her own flaws ... she had reacted to her husband 's demise by drinking herself into a stupor for a year or two afterwards which supposedly created the rift between her and her smarmy daughter.<br /><br />Regardless of the way the characters were or were not developed , this is a baloney movie and a waste of your valuable viewing time unless you actually LIKE baloney . ( Where 's the mustard ? )
0 I was n't expecting this to be a great movie , but neither was I expecting it to be so awful . I hated the mother character so much I had to turn the channel . I turned it back , hoping it was just one part of the movie , but no . And for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed , or almost done out of a job , or driven to madness inside her own home ? Are you kidding me ? I was raised to respect ( and even fear ) my mother but I 'd put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in MY house . I was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother 's house , after all.<br /><br />I did n't buy any of it . I tried giving it several chances , I really did . Sorry .
0 Carly Pope plays JJ , a newly promoted Food Critic whose flamboyant , overbearing mother moves in with her . JJ , aghast at this turn of events , then blackmails restaurant owner , Alex , to entertain her mother in exchange for " maybe " reviewing his dying restaurant . Alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother . There are numerous problems with this movie , the characters are universally 2-dimensional . JJ is a self - serving , hateful character , her mother superficial and shallow . JJ 's colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic . The underlying message of an over-50 woman unable to make it on her own , without male assistance is bad , bad , BAD . The acting is uniformly dull , the script uninspired . The films only saving grace is the setting of New York City . I would so NOT recommend this film .
0 Did HeidiJean really see this movie ? A great Christmas movie ? Not even close . Dull , bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart . I kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that Carly Pope could play the lead in this movie ! The woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance . Baransky was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing . Probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with . Maybe I 'm expecting too much for a Lifetime movie played 15 days from Christmas but I sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting JJ with an actress that at least could elicit sympathy this could have been quite a cute little movie .
0 This movie was so terrible it was almost good ... almost . We love musicals , but not this one . Even with the terrible sound quality , poor cinematography , and many actors who ca n't sing or dance , Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance ( especially toward the end ) . The character Marjorie , a drunk lady , was enjoyable to watch , too . < br /><br />The plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music . Admittadly , some of the songs ( fantabulous ) are pretty catchy ( but not in a good way).<br /><br />Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful ! We think it might be a good stage musical ( with excellent actors ) .
0 the single worst film i 've ever seen in a theater . i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004 , and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival . it was an interesting premise , and seemed like it could go somewhere , but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything . first of all , if you 're going to do a musical , find someone with musical talent . the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming . the lyrics were terribly written , and when they were n't obvious rhymes , they were groan - inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work . and you 'd think you 'd find people who could sing when making a musical , right ? not in this case . luckily they were half talking / half singing in rhyme most of the time , but when they did sing it made me cringe . especially when they attempted to sing in harmony . and that just addresses the music . some of the acting was pretty good , but a lot of the dialog was terrible , as well as most of the scenes . they obviously did n't have enough coverage on the scenes , or they just had a bad editor , because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film . at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical . i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again .
0 I feel totally ripped off . Someone needs to refund the $ 4.95 I spent at Blockbuster to rent this homemade mess . This is NOT a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening . What I do n't get is why did this get distributed in the first place??? ... somebody MUST have been doing some heavy drugs the night that deal was made . I 've seen better films come out of film schools and I have been to film school so I can say that as a fact . The quality of this work is also just SO VERY bad to view ... shot on DV ? ? ? Nuff said . The songs are not songs but just banter that sounds the same in every section . Want to see a good musical ? THEN DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE .
0 So you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film , and you might be thinking to yourself , " Huh . There were sure a bunch of RAVE REVIEWS posted on December 30 . " Funny thing is , most of these rave reviews sound like they 're coming from the same person , or at best a small , coordinated group of " Open House " groupies . The truth , my friends , is that this film is truly unwatchable . Just because it 's " independent " does n't mean it gets a free pass . If you 're going to make a musical , whether on film or on stage , whether on Broadway or at the local community playhouse , you should probably make sure that ( a. ) your actors can sing , ( b. ) your actors can dance , ( c. ) you have decent sound equipment , ( d. ) you have a well - written score , and ( e. ) you have lyrics that are witty and charming . Even Anthony Rapp ca n't save this one . It 's one of those unfortunate movie - going experiences where I actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved .
0 The premise is amazing and the some of the acting , notably Sally Kellerman and Anthony Rapp , is charming ... but this film is near unwatchable . The music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap . Most of the singing is off - key . I think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it ... The dialogue is really stupid and trite . The movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical sub - plots . I found myself checking my watch after ther first twenty minutes and after 40 wondering ' when is it ever going to end . '
0 In Texas , seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the Halloween night before going to a party . Meanwhile , they call the American Nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears . A serial killer , who is listening to their confessions , makes their nightmares come true , killing each one of them in a sadistic way . " American Nightmare " is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning : without any previous explanation , a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area , as if it were Friday , 13th . Then , the story shifts to a bar , where seven friends are celebrating Halloween . From this moment on , the story has a great potential , and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance , showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies , as usual in this type of C production . However , the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse Jane Toppan , giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting . With a better beginning and conclusion , this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie . My vote is four.<br /><br />Title ( Brazil ) : " Agonia " ( " Agony " )
0 When it comes to horror movies , I am more than willing to suspend disbelief , ignore sub - par production values , and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare . This movies simply has no good scares to offer . It ca n't even be enjoyed as camp . Bad dialogue , bad acting , bad direction , the kills were predictable and poorly staged , the music was annoying , the camera work was wretched , even the costumes were bad . I felt really bad for the actors , who were obviously trying , but who had to deal with terrible , contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction . I doubt they got any rehearsal , either . It 's embarrassing to watch , and so boring than making it through to the contrived " surprise " ending requires tremendous endurance . It 's quite easily one of the worst movies I 've ever seen.<br /><br />I do n't normally write reviews , but this one was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others . This movie is a complete waste of time . If you must watch this movie , do n't miss the " Making of "- featurette . The writer / director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold , daring move . ( Seen it . ) He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it 's a new - age " Citizen Kane . " It 's like listening to a group of third - graders take you behind the scenes of their Christmas pageant . They truly think they 've created something of substance . It 's sad , really ¬Ö  The only reason I gave this movie a " 2 " is because I think " 1 " should be reserved for true atrocities , like " Manos : Hands of Fate " and " Space Mutiny . " So " American Nightmare " is n't the WORST movie I 've ever seen , but I 'd have to say that it 's somewhere in the bottom fifty .
0 When I read the back of the DVD case , I thought that it sounded really interesting ... so ... I had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the " 4 for 20 dollars " section at Blockbuster . When we got home and popped in the movie ... twenty minutes into it , we found ourselves turning to each other going " this sucks . Let 's put in something else . " I 'll admit , a few of the lines from the friends at the caf√© made us smile a little bit . But come ON , at least get some decent actors ! Every once in a while in a movie , if the acting is bad and the movie is n't going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting , I can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they 're over(or under)doing their lines . But I can only take so much . Crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter , there was no delivery for their lines ... amateur does n't even come close to the acting in this film.<br /><br />Anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some REALLY good drugs while they were watching the movie . It 's the most pointless thing I 've ever had the displeasure of watching . DO NOT WATCH OR BUY THIS MOVIE ! ! ! ! !
0 This movie had to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen . The acting was terrible , Horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot ! I will never watch this movie again nor will I recommend this movie to anyone . What a waste of time ! First , as soon as the movie began I realized what I got myself into . All they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie . The prank phone calls , halloween night , a psycho , and one knife ! Its absolutely ridiculous . I was not scared at all during the movie , which I thought horror movies were supposed to do . As for the making of the movie , its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary . I mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of " Scary Movie " for example . At least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie .
0 " American Nightmare " is officially tied , in my opinion , with " It 's Pat ! " for the WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.<br /><br />Seven friends ( oddly resembling the K - Mart version of the cast of " Friends " ) gather in a coffee shop to listen to American Nightmare , a pirate radio show . It 's hosted by a guy with a beard . That 's the most exciting aspect of his show.<br /><br />Chandler , Monica , Joey , and ... oh wait , I mean , Wayne , Jessie , and the rest of the bad one - liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded DJ . Unbeknownst to them , a crazed nurse / serial killer is listening ... <br /><br />Crazy Nurse then proceeds to torture Ross and Rachel and ... wait , sorry again ... by making their fears come to life . These fears include such stunners as " voodoo " and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures.<br /><br />No . Really.<br /><br />This movie was , in a word , rotten . Crazy Nurse 's killing spree lacks motivation , there 's nothing to make the viewer " jump , " the ending blows , and -- again -- voodoo?<br /><br />If you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones , rent " American Nightmare " with them.<br /><br />If you care for your loved ones -- even a little bit -- go to your local Blockbuster , rent all of the copies of " American Nightmare " and hide them in your freezer .
0 this movie is outrageous . by outrageous , i mean awful . i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke . the acting got progressively worse as the " movie " advanced , and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached . when misty was shot to death she decided that it would be prudent to blink post mordem . that was not intelligent . truthfully , stevie wonder could have caught that with his eyes closed . if you are deciding between playing with a nail gun while intoxicated and watching this movie , bear in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends .
0 Without a doubt this is one of the worst films I 've ever wasted money on ! The plot is , erm sorry , did I say there was a plot ? The scariest moment was when ... , nope ca n't think of one ! The best special effect that had me hiding under the bed covers was ... , nope ca n't think of one for that either . You knew who the killer was right from the start . There was nothing scary about the whole movie , in fact the only two vaguely interesting bits were when you saw the kid sister , Misty , in the shower and when you saw Nurse Toppan take her top off . This film should only be watched to get an idea of how NOT to make a horror movie ! ! !
0 This piece ai n't really worth a comment .. It 's simply the worst " horror " movie i have ever seen . The actors are bad as bad can be and the whole plot is so silly it nearly made me cry . Shame on you I say ! !
0 1st watched 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10(Dir - Jon Keeyes ) : Over - the - top rehash of 70 's supposed horror flicks like Friday the 13th(versions 1 thru whatever ¬Ö ) . I ca n't think of much redeeming here except(or can I think of anything ? ) ¬Ö The story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an ' homage ' to this , supposedly . But , lo and behold , one of the stupid people , have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murdered(again , how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this ) . Guess what ? The murderer is at it again and we 're tipped off from the very beginning who it is(so there goes any mystery whatsoever ) . And besides all this , where are the ' cops ' and why does n't someone call them . I ca n't believe this movie was financed by someone and made . You would think that by now the American people would be judged a little higher , at least in their movie - going experience , but not so by this filmmaker .
0 Kirstie Alley , looking a bit slimmer , but only a bit , is in this mess along with a man who is a MacGuyver lookalike , bleached blond hair and all . The premise of the movie is about an older woman ( 50 ! ! ! ) who can not get her screenplay produced due to age discrimination so she sends in her younger nephew to pose as the writer . Not an original idea and not a very good movie with lousy acting , inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot . There is another plot concerning a writer with a crush or admiration for Kirstie 's character and why this is included is a mystery . The actor who portrays Kirstie 's brother is so wooden and miscast , it was torture to watch their scenes . What is there to say about this film . Avoid it .
0 The head of a common New York family , Jane Gail ( as Mary Barton ) , works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin ( as Loma Barton ) at " Smyrner 's Candy Store " . After Ms. Grandin is abducted by dealers in the buying and selling of women as prostituted slaves , Ms. Gail and her policeman boyfriend Matt Moore ( as Larry Burke ) must rescue the virtue - threatened young woman.<br /><br />"Traffic in Souls " has a reputation that is difficult to support - it is n't remarkably well done , and it does n't show anything very unique in having a young woman 's " virtue " threatened by sex traders . Perhaps , it can be supported as a film which dealt with the topic in a greater than customary length ( claimed to have been ten reels , originally ) . The New York City location scenes are the main attraction , after all these years . The panning of the prisoners behind bars is memorable , because nothing else seems able to make the cameras move . < br /><br / > * * * * Traffic in Souls ( 11/24/13 ) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail , Matt Moore , Ethel Grandin
0 Yes , The Southern Star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner Matt Monro . It pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature , stunningly miscast with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond . Add in Harry Andrews ( with a strange accent , no less ) chasing an ostrich , tons of stock footage of wildlife , and poorly composed and dull photography by Raoul Coutard , and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of Senegal .
0 Now , I flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching - in the same way that you watch a car crash ... <br /><br />I appreciate the fact it 's a spoof , but that should not stop me from criticising the god - awful directing , acting and dialogue . Seriously , this rated as one of the poorest movies I have seen - it looked more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper , and a poor one at that ... <br /><br />Okay - a few criticisms ( 1 ) when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster ( we never see the monster attack him , so we assume its a heart attack ) , the army then launch shells , rockets , bullets at the monster - which was feet from the doctor - yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive ( 2 ) the army attack from about 100 yards away , and we see a flame - thrower being used - geez , those things have a range of no more than 30 metres ! ( 3 ) when the monster tries to take the professor , the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling ; the monster drops the kid , and the soldiers do n't try to shoot the monster ? ? ? come on ! ( 4 ) the monster looks like it something out of Power Rangers ! ( 5 ) there is one scene where the five " good guys " ( the priest , the girl , the doctor , the reporter and the kid ) all look shocked and we get reactions ( along the lines of hand to mouth ) one after the other - so natural ! ( 6 ) the general just runs away , time after time ( 7 ) the general refuses to try electricity and would n't listen ( 8) the acting is awful ( 9 ) did I mention the rubber suit monster ? ? ? ? ( 10 ) that god - awful music , non - stop !
0 Wow , I just saw this on T.V. as one of the " scary " movies they show around Halloween . Was this rated G ? There was n't really anything to make this movie scary , or worth watching . Also , other people say this is a spoof , but I do n't think so . For a spoof , you need something called " humor " . This low - budget crap - fest did n't have a shred of humor , and it did n't make much sense , either . You basically have a goofy looking monster ( man in rubber suit ) coming out of closets , killing people , I guess , since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath . The spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster , so I guess that 's good enough.<br /><br />The military tries feebly to kill the monster , which is n't much larger than a man . They have very bad aim . Then the military FLEES ! Wow , did this movie make the U.S. military look pathetic or what ? The monster , while hard to kill , does n't do much besides shuffle around and roar . Oh , and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks . It was a slightly interesting , yet a total Alien ripoff.<br /><br />What was the deal with the scientist playing the Xylophone to attract the monster ? It was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality . Also , why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long ? Why did n't the monster go into the closet when it had a chance ? Why do I insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless ?
0 This movie was terrible!I rented it not knowing what to expect . I watched the 1st 5 minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb . The acting was bad and there was no plot . The monster is soooooo fake . It growls and its mouth does nt move . Also why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster . Just plain bad do n't even waste your time.(1 out of 10 )
0 I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial . The commercial was great , but it I found out later that it had every explosion or ' special effect ' in the entire movie ( about 4 ) and even some that were n't in the movie . There was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as I remember . It was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people . I guess my world of innocence ended that day , when I found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies .
0 The Earth is destined to be no more thanks to Father Pergado and a bunch of Nuns . Christopher Lee ( who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved ) is Father Pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine . The cast are not too bad , though most have now retired from acting . The film has terrible sound effects ( mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems ) and it ridiculously pondering at times - showing a scene of the sky , for instance , for what feels like hours at a time . Despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world - is - doomed sort of way and the production is adequate . Interestingly one scene features Albert Band and wife Jackie ; Meda Band ; Writer Frank Ray Perilli and Charles Band 's assistant Bennah Burton . Despite its plodding nature I genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it .
0 This film had a great cast going for it : Christopher Lee , Dean Jagger , Macdonald Carey , Lew Ayres -- solid b - movie actors all . But this downer of a movie did n't use any of them to any sort of advantage , with none of their characters even meeting on screen ( though Christopher Lee does get to play opposite himself in several scenes).<br /><br />The motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change at the drop of a hat . First , they just want to repair their ship and leave , then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need . Then , out of nowhere , this " peaceful " race decides they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many " diseases " ( though they do offer the main character and his wife a spot in their society).<br /><br />Most of the film is spent watching the man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit at desks doing nothing . You almost wish they had gotten taken out with the rest of the planet at the end , just in vengeance for boring us to death.<br /><br />Unless you really like Chris Lee or seventies low - budget sci - fi , I 'd give this one a miss . It falls into that narrow range of wasted celluloid between Star Odyssey and UFO : Target Earth .
0 Your mind will not be satisfied by this no¬óbudget doomsday thriller ; but , pray , who 's will ? A youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as Church people.<br /><br />Small _ apocalyptically themed outing , END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely ' 50s similar movies . And it 's not only that , but EOTW plays like a hybrid¬ónot only doomsday but convent creeps as well . The villain of the movie is a well¬óknown character actor.<br /><br />This wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of convent¬óexploitation , that significantly ' 70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated . Anyway , the convent 's secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco ! Christopher Lee is the pride of End of the World ; but the End of the World is not at all his pride !
0 It 's got Christopher Lee , it 's got huge banks of 1970s computers that make Teletype noises as letters appear on the screen , it 's got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises , it 's got volcanoes ! evil aliens disguised as nuns ! tidal waves ! earthquakes ! exploding cars ! exploding coffee machines ! and as a climax the entire planet blows up . How on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly , mind - numbingly DULL ? The answer , my friend is because 90 % of this movie is made up of establishing shots , most of them involving long tracks , pans , or zooms in combinations , or occasionally all three , that do nothing except give the crew something to do . There are endless shots of our protagonists driving , getting in and out of cars , driving again , walking around looking at stuff , getting in cars and driving ... I just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering " Say something , please somebody , just say something ... DO something ... anything! ... " < br /><br />The dialogue , when it does come , is terrible.<br /><br />"Maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours . " was a typically meaningless line . The script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage , justified in this speech from Lee as the head alien:<br /><br />"The planet Earth has emitted an over - abundance of diseases , they are contaminating the Universe . All the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed ! " < br /><br />This is is Neanderthal SF script writing . This is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950 's Japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds . It is , and I collect such things , the most god - awful line from an English language SF movie since Buster Crabbe retired . It beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters.<br /><br />Lee , who always struck me as a smart , useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits , delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek . I do n't blame him .
0 Spoilers < br /><br />Wow , END OF THE WORLD is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience.<br /><br />Here is the full story : a scientist is getting messages from space ( a la INDEPENDENCE DAY ) . The messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in China . He starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so he 's trying to figure out who 's receiving the messages ( and who 's also sending out messages in space ) . He and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent . They visit it . Everything looks normal , including the priest played by a bored Christopher Lee . But the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent . So he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens , disguised as priests and nuns . They are held against their will and the alien played by Lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet . Once the alien get the special element , the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform . Lee , being the last alien left , tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens . Lee walks in the transporter and he 's gone . The couple , looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world , decide to follow the aliens . Because earth is doomed , the couple does n't see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear . The last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding . The end.<br /><br />That 's it . < br /><br />I've never seen such a dull movie in my life . It 's the most underwhelming movie I 've ever experienced . The scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen . They do n't care about anything . They see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide " what the heck , who needs earth anyway ? " They do n't even try to stop them or do something to make things better . This kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent . The actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces , so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work . I was n't expecting much with this movie because it IS a Charles Band production , but I did n't expect it to be this bad.<br /><br />Christopher Lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned STARSHIP INVASIONS . Well , I 'm sorry Chris but STARSHIP INVASIONS was actually goofy fun . STARSHIP INVASIONS is terrible but terribly entertaining . END OF THE WORLD is MUCH , MUCH , MUCH worst : it 's beyond dull and inert , with NO entertainment value whatsoever .
0 Christopher Lee is one of my favorite actors ! I 'm trying to view all of his work . He has been known to single - handedly save movies with his presence . Unfortunately , this is not one of them . This movie suffers from a low budget and it 's production values are disturbing . Please ... for the love of Christopher .... avoid this film !

0 A good deal of running around . A badly conceived adversary with very little complexity . A scientist who works in communications sending off signals into space and receiving them , gets caught up with aliens . Along with his pretty wife , he invades their territory and is given secrets about them . He becomes rather traitorous in the process . Granted , he is given little choice anyway . There is a scene where he gives them everything they want . This is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens . The plot is n't technically bad . It 's just that we are usually following a car , a trip through a woods , investigating a building . This is what editing is all about . I suppose the story would n't technically support much more . Not much here .
0 Dull , cheap sci - fi thriller , made with an almost total lack of conviction ( a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is run by only ONE MAN , and is VERY poorly guarded at night ) , and full of campy sound effects . Christopher Lee is not only wasted , but he also gives one of his few " I 'm here strictly for the money " performances . ( * 1/2 )
0 What can I say about this film other than " do n't see it " . I waited and waited and WAITED for someting ( or anything ) to happen and it just did n't come . Watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie . What are they doing ? Are they solving a mystery ? Are they gathering clues ? Possibly , it 's just hard to tell . At the end of the movie , after a lot of radio signals are decoded ( illegibly on some sort of PET monitor ) and this guy gives some lectures , the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible . Some aliens want to get back to their home world utopia and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth ( I guess they do n't like sharing the wealth ) . My guess is they finished filming and saw their 35 minute work or art ( garbage ! ) and decided that they 'd let the editing crew turn it into an 88 minute feature film . Watch at your own peril , it 's not even funny because it 's so bad , it 's just bad .
0 end of the world looks like a good movie on the box cover but be warned its bad.being a big fan of mega star actor Christopher lee i was fooled . like tentacles(77)a good cast does not mean it 'll be a good film.the beginning looks promising then it turns to tedium , many parts of the movie are too dark to see what s going on.the rest of the cast is shown briefly like;Lew ayres , dean Jagger , and MacDonald Carey as a security guard.i would expect better from Charles band who made good fun movies like the re - animater and dolls.i heard Christopher lee was tricked into making this film.he was told his co stars were going to be Jose ferrer , john carridine , and dean Jagger.well dean Jagger is there but the other two never made it(lucky them)if you make a movie about the end of the world use a bigger budget and better storyline.dean Jagger went on to do two good movies afterwards;alligator(80)and game of death(79 ) sue Lyon(Lolita)is also in the movie minus her lollipop.if you are a glutton for punishment then watch end of the world i dare you to say awake during the whole movie.1 out of 10 .
0 This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen , its horrible . Christopher Lee is good but he is hardly in it , the only the good part is the opening scene.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the title . " End of the World " is truly a bad movie , I stopped watching it close to the end it was so bad , only for die hard b - movie fans that have the brain to stand this vomit .
0 End of the World is an uneventful movie , which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth . The main character is some kind of scientist , I 'm not exactly sure what kind . He has two jobs at a government ( ? ) facility guarded by four security men . His first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space ( although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job # 2 ) . Job # 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room ... at least that 's the best I can figure . Apparently the " plant " is not exactly top - secret , as the scientist brings his wife there . She hangs out ( they 're on their way to a dinner ) while he discovers a message from space : Major Earth Disruption , repeated over and over . He says something about it being the first message from space he 's ever been able to decipher ; his wife tells him they 're going to be late for the dinner party . So they leave and go to the party ( ! ? ! ) . Moments later he finds out that China has suffered a major earthquake . From there , the movie goes ... nowhere ! Yes , Christopher Lee is in it , but that really does n't help much . Besides , Lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in Howling II . This movie is boring , but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like Christopher Lee or Z - grade sci - fi . Plus , there 's lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed .
0 I expected alot from this movie . Kinda like Lee as a Naustradamous like caracter but instead all I got was a waste of time and a boring movie . I ca n't even explain this movie . It had wooden acting , terrible script from pieces from the Bible like hurricanes , tidal waves and earthquakes . But that was at the end ! The rest of it I had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it did n't . This movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in China where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest . The convent end up being the key to the misshappenings . The whole movie is missleading and boring . One of Lees worst .
0 I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word , there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and $ 100 bills ! # 2 If I ever let anybody use a room for some ' afternoon delight ' time I 'd be fired on the spot ! The organization to which I belong ( Les Clefs d'Or ) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously . # 3 Similarly untrue was the concept , at the end of the movie , of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them . There is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization.<br /><br />This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary . In short it does a disservice to our organization . I welcome any comments .
0 This is the biggest pile of crap I have ever watched . DO NOT RENT ! The makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie . It starts with some what of a plot , then fades fast to nothing . I think I would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover . The actors were awful , the plot faded fast , filming left to much work to be done . Not one good thing to say about this crap movie . If you rent this movie you will waste your money . I really enjoy National Lampoon movies , but this was a waste of time . Learn to write , learn to act , learn to produce , and learn to direct . I feel I should sue these a - holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time lost .
0 This movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together . Well there 's nothing wrong with that , except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together . 90 percent of the cast are white males about same age . It 's almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves . The movie has no plot . It simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath . There are some funny scenes and comedic bits . But they do n't redeem the flat monotony.<br /><br />The graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do , and not done very well at that . Anything that ca n't be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation.<br /><br />I went to see this film after seeing the trailer , which makes it look like a Tarrentino piece . Well , the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get . Ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane , inane comedy . It works at times , but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over . It 's more like a string of Satuday Night Live skits than a movie . It 's a hit - you - over - the - head - with - it kind of comedy . I can see where the story idea is intriguing . But , in this film post apocalyptic America is much like Medevil England . In fact Wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era . He plans to make a Part 2 . I guess he thinks he 's Tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing.<br /><br />At the opening in LA , Wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2 . He was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one , to which he replied , well yea , sure .
0 This is an incomprehensible horribly low budget piece of awfulness.<br /><br />I do n't even have the vocabulary to say how dire , turgid , boring , confusing , and just plain strange this effort is ( Hey what d'ya know I do .... ) Set in a post - Apocalyptic America some guys meet on a beach and slaughter and chaos ensue - it was all so incomprehensible I could n't make head or tail of any of it.<br /><br />Seriously how this got picked up by National Lampoon totally defeats me : it really is awful.<br /><br />And not in a its so bad it 's good cult way.<br /><br />It is just awful , awful , awful , awful.<br /><br />Honestly . If you still do n't believe me then watch it with every intention of loving it then come back here and tell me what you think . Even gerbils on acid could n't hope to understand this.<br /><br />Avoid or even better destroy ...
0 I love all types of films , especially horror . That being said , Survival does not live up to ANY of the hype surrounding it.<br /><br />I ca n't give it any points on originality . There is nothing wrong with exploring the same themes , or remaking what others have done . It has just become a cop out for indie films to take us on a slasher journey through the woods , a crazed killer , and as of lately , throw in some crazy family . On those lines I have to compare it with the likes of Texas Chainsaw , Wrong Turn ( though the twist in that one is obvious ) , and others . Survival falls up way short against comparable films . The plot was just not original in ANY way . Some films can get by with a weak ( and way over - done ) plot with superb acting , special fx , or a slew of other factors . Survivial does n't have any of that to bank on . If you will , note the following : The acting in the movie never took off . I do n't knock or blame the actors for that , nor the director . The dialogue was at best mediocre , and the actors involved never showed ( not saying did n't HAVE ) the talent to pull it off . I mention 2 standouts . The leading man in this film certainly has the look , but I seriously thinks he needs to consider more training before he is ready to carry a film . The actor who portrayed Greg also had potential , but we never got to see any of it ( watch the movie to see why , you wo n't believe it .. ).<br /><br />The grainy film look . Ah yes , that little tid - bit of film making magic designed to take us to the glory days of " Grindhouse " films . In today 's film making , that has become a gimmick . It either works or it does n't . In this case it just does not work . There are too many other flaws going on , so it winds up distracting from the film , not adding to it . That being said , I think they did a good job of adding that grain . That is some good , quality grain . I think with a different script , better direction , and possibly actors , they should try another " Grindhouse " attempt . They will probably pull it off.<br /><br />As far as the tech aspects , in my opinion , they never quite gelled for me either . Better care could have been taken with audio ( sounds like it was fed directly into the camera , but there is nothing wrong with that ) and for being shot on DV , it was too soft for my taste.<br /><br />That is all I have to say about that .....
0 I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy ! I know I would n't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc.<br /><br />But , everything in this movie is bad . Farting jokes , people getting eaten , and the skit about the President all make the movie one of the worst of all time.<br /><br />It 's a really bad film that you have to stay away from . All the " jokes " are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid . The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old.<br /><br />I'm surprised the Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this .
0 On Steve Irwin 's show , he 's hillarious . He does n't even try to be funny and he just is but his movie was n't even what I would call a movie - I mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he 's just saying ' Oh , this is one nasty bloke ! ' and looking straight into the camera . He put his face in the camera too much ! And then when the guy falls off the car would n't you expect him to be dead ? And Terri had the worst acting I 'd ever seen ! Like when the crocodile almost ate Steve she just says ' Steve ' . She did n't sound scared or anything , it was just ' Steve ' . I mean I hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing . I love Steve Irwin but his movie was just too stupid .
0 A difficult film to categorize . I was never giving it 110 % concentration & consequently as simple as the plot appeared I could n't say for certain exactly who was doing what amongst the American FBI characters & what their roles were . Nor could I take the Irwins seriously as film characters when their lines & scenes were all in the style of one of his shows , not acted out.<br /><br />This is nothing more than a glorified episode of a Discovery TV show , with a largely insignificant sub plot going on , which just seemed to get in the way . However as any Irwin show is always worth a watch , this film is well worth a look too , but not on Christmas Day . Talking of which , I 've better things to do too than be on here.<br /><br />A high 4/10
0 I would love to have that two hours of my life back . It seemed to be several clips from Steve 's Animal Planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script . Do n't Go , If you must see it , wait for the video ...
0 If you like bad movies , this is the one to see . It 's incredibly low - budget special effects ( you 'll see what I mean ) and use of non - actors was what gave this film it 's charm . If you 're bored with a group of friends , I highly recommend renting this B movie gem . It 's mulletrific !
0 I notice that the previous reviewer ( who appears to be still at school ) gave this movie a very good review and I can only assume that this is because the reviewer has n't seen the far superior 1989 BBC adaptation of this classic novel . The major problem I had with this ( 1999 ) version was the casting of Anthony Way as Tom Long . Anthony Way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the TV mini - series " The Choir " . I can only assume that he was cast for the role of Tom Long on the strength of his excellent acting in " The Choir " . Unfortunately the small boy who appeared in " The Choir " had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time " Tom 's Midnight Garden " was filmed and as such Anthony fails to convince as schoolboy Tom . It is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that Tom ( as played by Anthony ) would befriend the far younger Hatty . In the 1989 BBC version Tom and Hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable . For a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 TV effects . The casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic . As a final observation I would point out that the VHS of the 1989 BBC version fetches well over ¬£ 20.00 second hand whereas a new DVD of this version can be bought for under ¬£ 5.00 , need I say more ?
0 I have absolutely no knowledge of author Phillipa Pearce or any of her novels and if TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical of her work I probably would have had little interest in her books as a child . When I was a child I wasn`t really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count < br /><br />Judging by this film version of TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN I guess Pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist Tom Long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one . Having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didn`t have in the 1950s so I guess there`s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere . There`s also a romance involving a young girl called Hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories ? Perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative < br /><br />This is a childrens film that seems dated by its source . It`s inoffensive but I`m surprised by its high rating by the IMDB voters . I wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were 10 year olds who`d just seen the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy ?
0 Elvis has left the building and he 's lucky because he did n't have to watch this unfunny stinker . Scene after scene director Joel Zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing . Filled with unfunny deaths , trite gay characteratures , and hack jokes , this film is more desperate than amusing . This is the sort of film that makes one hope Kim Basinger follows Doris Day into premature retirement . Let us remember her the way she was ( talented ) and not what she 's become . David Leisure , the delicious Dennis Richards and the rest are all wasted talents here . Zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn . The guy playing Elvis sounds more like Gomer than the King . The only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays Basinger as a preteen . She really looks like her and is actually pretty good . The only other reason to watch this film at all is to look for the Tom Hanks cameo . The cameo is n't all that funny , but at least its not painful . One has to wonder if Zwick has incriminating pictures of Hanks or something that would make him do this movie .
0 OMG ! The only reason I 'm giving this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because Tom Hanks is funny as an Elvis - in - the - box . Apart from that , how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie ? ? Maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time ... There are no laughs to mention , the stereotypes are pathetic , the cast is wasted , the direction is amateurish . Now that I think about it , most of the blame probably lies with the director , Joel Zwick . He brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved . Do n't waste your time like I did ; but then , I enjoy a good train wreck . Geez , now the system is telling me I need more lines-- here ya go : This movie should be called Return to Sender . Okay , now THAT was funnier than anything in the movie ...
0 My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get credible actors to work on this movie ? Impressive cast ¬ñ even for the supporting characters , none of which helps this movie really . I have to admit though , Tom Hank 's cameo almost made it worth it ¬ñ what was that about Tom ? Did you lose a bet ? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic ! The premise is good . Basinger 's character , struggling with existence as a Pink Lady , is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales . This happens as Corbett 's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex - wife motivated by ¬Ö .what else ¬Ö .extortion . As they both make their way , they have numerous run - ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas . Soon , the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer . Unfortunately , premise does n't mean the movie was good.<br /><br />When watching this movie , imagine you are back in the first grade ¬ñ when story lines and continuity are n't really important . It is much more enjoyable to just watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit rather than wondering why what she is doing does n't really make sense . The movie tries hard , but ultimately falls way way way short . Ultimately , it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny but in practice were not that funny.<br /><br />It is n't the worst , but you may find you yourself feel like leaving the building when watching this one ¬Ö¬Ö  Do n't say I did n't warn you !
0 Darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman , with odd ties to Elvis Presley , running into a sea of Elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own . Kim Basinger , a still - attractive actress of considerable merit , likes to pick quirky movies to play in , but this dreadful screenplay ( by Mitchell Ganem and Adam - Michael Garber ) has n't an iota of good humor . The stereotypes and low - ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy , but even on a shambling , shameful level , the picture is crude and sloppy . If you do watch , see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of Basinger behind the wheel of her pink Cadillac , hands always in the same position and a non - plussed look on her face . Hopefully both she and Elvis were well paid . NO STARS from * * * *
0 Being an Elvis fan , I ca n't understand how this proyect could be done . Is by far the worst Elvis related movie of all time , totally unfunny , silly and plenty of mistakes about The King . Come on , Elvis ' grave in a public park ? A mention about Suspicious Minds in 1958? ... and these are just two examples . Some people in the cast tries to do their best , Mike Starr is funny ( specially as an impersonator ) , the Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise , but the guy playing the young Elvis sucks . Overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute . If you want to see an ultra cheap , insane but absolutely funny little film related to Elvis , I truly recommend you " Bubba Ho - Tep " instead of this mess .
0 I saw this movie on a westbound American Airlines flight . It was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer . The plot had potential ( who would n't love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every Elvis impersonator she meets ? ) but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing . Towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of Elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking he 's going to return , then a group of stars moves together to form an " Elvis " constellation , which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators , sending them crashing through the roof . Bad ... REALLY bad . Which is the theme for the whole movie . I 'd avoid this one at all costs .
0 One of the worst films I have ever seen . How to define " worst ? " I would prefer having both eye balls yanked out and then be forced to tap dance on them than ever view this pitiful dreck again . Somehow , One - Hit Wonder Zwick manages a film that simultaneously offends Elvis fans , Mary Kay saleswomen , Las Vegas , gays , FBI agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a shoddy , sloppy farce so forced it deserves to be forsaken ed . How Elvis Presley Enterprises could allow the rights of actual Elvis songs to be used in a film with a central premise that seems to be " The only good Elvis Presley Imitator is a dead one " is beyond me . The worst part of this mess - and that takes some work - is the mangled script : In 1958 , Elvis ' words and songs that he would speak / perform in the 1970 's are quoted ! Worst special effect ? That Oscar would go to the moron who decided that Elvis ' grave , potentially the most photographed / recognizable grave in the world , resembles a pyramid with a gold record glued atop and is situated in the middle of a park somewhere . Potentially , this film 's biggest audience would be Elvis fans . However , the rampant stupidity ( Nixon gave Elvis a DEA badge , not FBI credentials ... and I could go on and on ) actually undercuts THAT conventional wisdom . Ugh . I used the word " wisdom " to describe this stupid movie . This is truly a horrible , horrible film .
0 The film is poorly casted , except for some familiar old Hollywood names . Other performances by unknown names ( i.e. , Jennifer Gabrielle ) are uninspiring . I have seen other films by this director , unfortunately this is one of his worst . Perhaps this is a reflection of the screenplay ? < br /><br />In a positive note , Kim Bassinger 's and Pat Morita 's performance saved the movie from oblivion . I enjoyed Pat more in Karate Kid , though . There are many good movies to see , and in short , this one is not one of them . Save your money and the celluloid . < br /><br />Jason Vanness
0 It has a great name , but that s it and you wo nt get more than that for your money , in fact the first 30 - 40mins of the movie you might find it some kind of funny but after that the story goes from one side to another with no particular reason and you just ca nt understand what s happening until the action its gone.<br /><br />And yet the producers ( Roberto Angel Salcedo ) calls him an actor , but i do n't think the way he does could be called nothing but overacting!! .... period . The little kid who plays as his son has totally no sense of acting and i believe it was just a favor he did or something because he had no clue of what he was doing.<br /><br />For some reason while doing the casting they thought that by casting comedians they could made it , but they did n't ! ! and sometimes the tasteless cheap humor its so bad , i do n't buy it.<br /><br />But hopefully this is as bad as it gets . To make people accept those DVD 's to the good taste public they will have to offer some food with it , that might work out.<br /><br />Maka
0 I was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons . For the first half hour it 's actually pretty decent . Although the acting is n't any better then that which you would find in a rap video , its kinda funny and the production value does n't seem half bad . In fact I almost thought this would be almost as good as Perico Ripiao ( another recent Dominican film ) which turned out to be MUCH MUCH better than I expected . The plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in Dominican society as a whole , which makes for a good premise especially in The Dominican Republic . Unfortunately I do n't think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter , and they f'ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them . About 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits . Not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge , space age , CGI effects dating to what I 'm guessing would be the 70 's , but the whole plot just goes down the drain . The rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations , and clever one liners . To top it all off ( and I guess I should warn you now * * SPOILER ALERT * * ) it all turns out to be a dream . Oh my who did n't see that coming ? Oh man I almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie . Well after about an hour into it I start thinking " ¬Ö hmmmm something just does n't seem right about the sound track but what can it be ? ? " ¬Ö and then it hits me HALF OF THE MUSIC IN THE MOVIE WAS TAKEN FROM A VIDEO GAME CALLED KING OF FIGHTER 95.<br /><br />When oh when DR will you give us a film we can call a work of art ? ! ? ! Perhaps a comedy to match France 's Amelie , or an action flick to match Thailand 's Ong - Bak , an animation as Akira was to Japan , a witty crime thriller as Layer Cake was to England , or a socio - awakening journey as Waking Life had here in the states.<br /><br /> ... i would give it a 1 but i 've seen much worse come out of DR , search Los Jodedores and you 'll know what I 'm talking about .
0 I sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of Dominican Movie Industry . The first 30 minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society ( men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do ) the movie falls . Becoming boring and not funny at all . They let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable . I did n't like the way as a Roberto Angel played his character and his little either . I went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but I went out really disappointed.<br /><br />I do n't recommend this movie .
0 < br /><br />I would highly recommend seeing this movie . After viewing it , you will be able to walk out of every other bad movie EVER saying " at least it was n't The Omega Code." < br /><br />Forget my money , I want my TIME back !
0 I 'm a Christian . I have always been skeptical about movies made by Christians , however . As a rule , they are " know - nothings " when it comes to movie production . I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen . However , they did a hideous job of it . The acting was horrible , and unless one is familiar with the Bible in some fashion , one COULD NOT have understood what the movie was trying to get across . Not only was the movie terribly made , but the people who made it even had some facts wrong . However , in this " critique " , those facts are irrelevent and too deep to delve into . In short , the Omega Code is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen , and I would not recommend it to anyone , except for comic relief from the every day grind .
0 I am a youth pastor 's wife and we took some youth to see this film . We then spent an hour trying to explain it to them . They did n't get it and I did n't enjoy it . It is based on a concept that has run through all three of the major religions of the world ( the Bible Code , the Torah Code and the Code in the Koran ) and is so questionable as to be laughable . This is not a step forward for Christians in the arts , it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door .
0 The Omega Code was a model of cinematographical inconsistency . There was a bit ( but precious little ) of good acting , primarily by the two prophets and Rostenberg , who only appeared once and had no lines . Otherwise the acting was decidedly bad . The plot line was rather weak , and only partially based on already questionable Biblical interpretation . Certainly not one of the year 's best .
0 I went to see the Omega Code with a group of other Christians totaling about 15 people . We all expected a good piece of Christian film - making . What we got was an excruciatingly painful , drawn - out , and pretty boring attempt at a film . It has good looking production values but also has poor acting , a weak script with lousy dialogue , and no real sense of direction . From the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night . We all hated it , and some people in our group placed this movie as reeking of more cheese than " Anaconda . " None of us could believe that the movie lasted less than 2 hours . Flashy effects and crisp looking cinematography ca n't save this bad , bad movie . I 'd give it a 3 out of 10 , and the rating is only that high because I rented the abominable " movie " Werewolf ( 1996 ) the night before I saw this movie .
0 I should have known I was in trouble with Casper Van Diem as the lead character . Words can not describe , nor do they do justice to just how terrible this movie was . But please allow me to try to describe it : Horrible acting , terrible dialog , corny situations and through it all you get the feeling that you are being force - fed the beliefs and propeganda from the Trinity Broadcasting Network . Its a weak attempt at trying to show Hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep , religious message attached to it . They failed miserably . It was clearly the worst movie I have seen in a long time .
0 Quite honestly , The Omega Code is the worst movie I have seen in a very long time . During the first 30 minutes I sat stunned in my seat , trying to decide if I should demand a refund . But since I had n't paid to see it in the first place ( passes ) , I figured I might as well stay . And I did n't think it could possibly get any worse.<br /><br />It did . I will quickly run through the low points ( includes some spoilers ) : The horrible miscasting of Casper Van Dien as Gillen Lane , a motivational speaker with two PhDs . The characterization was inconsistent ; for example , Lane , despite his credentials , is a complete nitwit . Then there 's the lame - o depiction of the fulfillment of the Biblical prophecies ; we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated Biblical Code . Also , terrible " action " sequences : Lane escapes from tough situations without explanation , and the one time Lane actually does seem to be in danger , it turns out to be a dream sequence ! That 's cute for grammar school writing assignments , but it 's an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture . The pacing was bad : after a long opener , the first third of the movie changes scenes every 90 seconds . Later , the pacing improves , but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around . And as someone else mentioned , years pass yet no one ( not even Lane 's young daughter ) ages . That was disconcerting.<br /><br />There are a few good things , though . The quality of the film ( e.g. lack of graininess ) is high and very attractive . The outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism . Also , there are a few moments in the last part of the film when Lane calls on God ( finally ) to help him - this proved to be quite exhilarating - even to me , someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior . But I liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie . Unfortunately , it was followed by major incomprehensibility.<br /><br />The characters , dialogue , direction and acting were ALL poorly done . Michael Ironside had nothing to do , and Michael York was just weird . I think the producers wanted to do too much ; if the plot had been tighter and more focused , and the characterization more fleshed out , the film would have been far better . < br /><br />In a nutshell , The Omega Code disappoints . Definitely do not pay to see this . I give it * * out of ten stars.<br /><br / >
0 What else is left to say?<br /><br />I've read all the reviews here and most are right on . . However , one person even went so far as to call this movie evil and that Satan tainted it ( or something along those lines ) . Evil ? ! Wow , what a shocker . . I mean , TBN basically made this film . Open your eyes please.<br /><br />Anway , this was the very lowest grade of propoghanda nonsense that has come along in years.<br /><br />The most terrifying thing about Omega Code is how much money they spent to make it . If this movie can be made , there are no limits , and therefore , we have no choice but to get ready for " Yentl 2 " , and " Ernest Loses the Omega Codes." < br /><br />For those of you who are into the biblical stories , the new movie Dogma will pickup where Omega Code never started .
0 Yes I admit I cried during this movie . It was so incredibly disappointing , that I could n't help myself but cry . TBN ( Trinity Broadcasting Network ) has done it again . First with having the Million Dollar Man ( ex - professional wrestler ) on their program , and now this.<br /><br />The Omega Code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies . It was quite amusing , yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate . The movie follows what is known as " the bible code " rather than following actual biblical scripture . This film is extremely poorly made ; from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting . Its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie . It appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the USA channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend you do not watch this movie , even if your life depended on it .
0 I did n't know what to expect from the film . Well , now I know . This was a truly awful film . The screenplay , directing and acting were equally bad . The story was silly and stupid . The director could have made a smart and thought provoking film , but he did n't . I squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad . Where was the focus to the film ? Where was anything in this film ? Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it . It was shabbily done and a waste of my money . Do not see this film .
0 If there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become , this one would take the prize . The plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of power - seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world . Just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be ? < br /><br / > The acting was bad at best . Casper Van Dien wasted his talent doing this film . Michael York 's work was a fair match for the role , since he was the center of the film , and did a good job . < br /><br / > This plot was sickening and very disturbing . No tender or immature minds should see this film . This is how a basic good vs. evil plot can go astray.<br /><br / > There must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles , who look for ways to market this type of junk . There must have been something censored out to get a PG-13 rating , but it was still awful .
0 The more I analyze this film , the worse it becomes . First of all , why a motivational speaker ? That part was just stupid . I mean , why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker ? Is Alexander Stone really that disorganized ? First he ca n't decide what he wants to do to control the world , so he looks to the Bible for ideas . Many of these ideas , I might add , really have no reliability(For example , the part of the " The houses of Ishmael and Isaac shall scream out in terror " could have already happened . It could have been have been the synagogues burned during Krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in Baghdad or something . ) And Gillen Lane 's family ! They had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water ! I might add that since Casper van Dien / Gillen Lane is only in his twenties(or that 's the impression that I had)and has a ten year child , he had his child during high school . Yeah , there goes TBN 's family values . Also , why did this film have to be so damn propaganda - like ? I 'll repeat what an earlier reviewer said . The Indiana Jones flicks use Christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated . This film does n't do that . The beginnig starts off well , with Michael Ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy 's Omega Code . Then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of , the two prophets tell him " Tell your master that we are here ! " . Dominic(Ironsides ) replies " He already knows " and points to a small surveillance camera . That part sent chills up my spine . Had only it gone on like that one scene I would have loved this film . I 'll give Michael York credit : he does a fine job of acting out his character , as does Michael Ironsides . But the good guys are horrible . I 've already went on about Lane 's family < br /><br />. Now that I 'm over the acting , I 'll get on to plot . This is obviously a Baptist film , since our beloved Pope of the Vatican is portrayed as an oaf . The world domination plot I liked and found plausible and subtle , as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well - done . Also another diatribe against the Vatican , their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded , since Gillen explains to the Pope that it 's not the end of the world , but the beginning of a new one Also , the Vatican ( or Israelis)says their going to secede from the World Union aince they used the Omega Code to control the world . Whoever it was , they would n't just secede , they 'd send over commandoes and kill them . This is the equivalent of America knowing about the KGB going to kill the President and simply saying " We 're not going to talk to you any more ! " . Come on ! I did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards Israel and see them again on the monitor . Mediocre in short .
0 I truly wish I was not writing this review . I 'm a Christian , so I waited anxiously to see this movie . It seemed great -- a Christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing ( not that I buy the Bible Code itself -- you can make it say anything you want . I do , however believe everything inside the Bible ) . So I 'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews , when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes . I had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while I was in the theater ( I would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable Tension Scenes , I 'm sure ) . Once the final credits began to roll , however , I could reflect . There were many parts of the movie I liked -- some mostly unexpected plot twists , some effects that were indeed special ( I 'm not counting the Visions . Those were poorly done ) , and some interesting technical work -- fades , sets , that type of thing . Unfortunately , I got the distinct impression that if I read the book of Revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour , I could 've gotten a better script . And the music was beyond cheesy ( even for a Bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue ) . So I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater -- like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was -- but I 'm not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a Biblical shell and slaps a Christian stamp on it . I need a good plot and believable dialogue before I can enjoy most movies , and this just did n't have either . I 'm sorry , but I would n't recommend this film to anyone . And that 's the tragedy . When will we see some intelligent Christian fiction ? It has to be out there somewhere ...
0 This movie is not based on the bible . It completely leaves Christ out of the movie . They do not show the rapture or the second coming of Christ . Let alone talk about it . It does not quote from scriptures . The end times are called the great tribulation . The movie does not even show bad times . The seven bowls , seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing it 's structure . The anti - Christ was killed 3 1/2 years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended . The only part they got correct was there was two prophets . The did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures . The worst part of it was I really wanted it to be a good movie . I wanted to take unsaved people to it . I feel that the movie is evil . It is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does . I just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books.<br /><br />The second problem with the movie is it was just bad . Bad acting , bad special effects , bad plot and poor character development . I have seen better episodes of Miami vice .
0 This film had so much promise . I was very excited about this film . In the end , it was laughable at best , painful at worst . The acting styles ran the gamut from really , really , flat ( the angels , the wife and daughter ) to over - animated ( Casper 's character ) . I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other . Pay special attention to the scene regarding " the bug " . It 's pretty much an insult to the audience 's ability to figure things out . In defense of that scene , though , it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie . I had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations . Too bad they did n't make use of it . I did n't feel like I was transported to exotic locations . Anybody could insert stock footage of the Coliseum in Rome . However , to end on a positive note , I thought the sets were pretty good . I really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers . It is my opinion(and that 's all it is ) that if the SCHMALTZ factor would have been much much lower and the ACTION factor would have been greatly increased , this film would have been good .
0 What was this about ? ? Pre - destination , you can not change the future cause it has already been written ? ? < br /><br />I'll give it this much . I did want to see what happened next and therefore watched the whole movie . This movie took a concept and made it watchable.<br /><br />If you 're looking for a recommendation , See it at matinee prices . No thrills but an interesting concept . They should have left the Y2 K reference out ....
0 Interesting to read comments by viewers regarding Omega Code ... many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from TBN broadcasts ... the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video , to be stocked besides the three - part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the 70s .. do nt remember it ? You wo nt remember this one either in a year or two . This is the first movie I have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls ... very shameful ... this just goes to show that if you are a televangelist 's son , you too can play high - roller Hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe money ...
0 The idea had potential , but the movie was poorly scripted , poorly acted , poorly shot and poorly edited . There are lots of production flaws ... for example , Dr. Lane 's daughter who never ages despite the passing years . Wait for video , but do n't expect much .
0 Disjointed , unclear , bad screenplay , poor photography and direction ... all in all very obviously an ill - conceived first effort at commercial film - making by the good people at TBN.<br /><br />TBN Pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring " China Cry " , the story of Nora Lam , to the big screen . But " The Omega Code " is an unfortunate miscue . As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming and who loved " China Cry " , I still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone . They do much good with their ministry , but this is n't an example of it . Do n't waste your money ... go rent " China Cry " instead .
0 I went into this film with expectations , from the hype , that it would be insightful and uplifting . Certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band " Wilco." < br /><br />Instead we get a lot of moping and whining about " the process , " a dishonorable and no doubt one - sided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singer / songwriter , a gut - wrenching confession by the fallen member 's friend -- for like 18 years -- saying the " friendship had run its course , " and this whiny , uncompelling story about how one record label " hurt their feelings " by dumping them , only so that the band could immediately get 50 offers from other labels ( oh , the tension ... not ! ) They tried their best to make it look like it was a strain , but I suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that did n't exist . This does n't even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline , insight or even a decent job at cinematography . The strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch.<br /><br />From the film , this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they do n't have and think they 're some kind of guardians for the art of music , which they most definitely are not . And I thought the music sucked , and I could n't even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singer.<br /><br />I give it a 2/10 .
0 What can I say ? I 'm a secret fan of ' over the top ' action and horror films . Especially when it comes with a lot of lots of humour and innuendo , but I 'm not a fan of Snake on a Plane.<br /><br />There are three potential draws to this film : ¬ï The comedy of the situation ; ¬ï The horror ; and ¬ï The novelty of hundreds of snakes being of a plane . < br /><br />Firstly , this film is n't written as a tongue - in - cheek horror or a comedy , and there are only 1 or 2 points in the film where you 'll smile to yourself . If you want to get the feel of the film , the trailer genuinely represents the movie , a horror.<br /><br />Secondly , if you 're expecting a film full of action and shocks , you wo n't be disappointed . It does n't stand out above other movies , but it always keeps your attention.<br /><br />Thirdly , Although the novelty of Snakes of a Plane does n't wear off , but you 'll leave the cinema thinking " what was all the fuss about".<br /><br />I know this movie has a high rating , but it does n't add up . A ) Many of the reviews where written before the film was released and , B ) The breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal 77 % of people rating the movie 10/10 , with only 7 % of people giving it 9/10 - Why such an enormous gap ?
0 I 'd give this a negative rating if I could . I went into this movie not expecting much , but I had an open mind . The whole thing is stupid ! The snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson . Oh how original ; if I were a 12 year old boy I might laugh at that . I have no idea how this movie became so popular . Seriously , the worst thing I 've ever seen . I was n't entertained , it was n't funny , I was n't even bored ! I was n't anything . It was n't even so bad it was good , it 's just bad . Ridiculous actually . Please do not waste your money on this movie . Do n't even rent this movie . No clue how it 's getting such a high rating .
0 $ 25,000 Pyramid Clues : Deep Blue Sea . Tremors . Slither . Eight Legged Freaks.<br /><br />Pyramid Category : Movies that were funnier and more thrilling than Snakes on a Plane.<br /><br />Hell , with that definition I 'd have to include the relatively harrowing journey of Ted and Elaine in Airplane ! as superior to Snakes in both laughs and thrills.<br /><br />The sad truth is that this is n't even close to the mother of all unintentionally intentional funny snake movies : Anaconda ! Besides the never to be seen again casting of JLo - Cube - O.Wilson - Stoltz - Wuhrer in the same flick , you had Jon Voight pulling off the all - time cinematic heist . His final scene alone represents everything SOAP tried and failed to do as a " so - ludicrous - it's - fun " movie.<br /><br />In the end , Snakes on a Plane is definitive proof that studio execs and fanboys make the worst collaborators possible . Every big scene had been discussed and dissected so much the last year , all that was left to amuse by opening night was the amount of fanboy flop - sweat that had to be mopped up at my theater . I heard more forced laughs here than at a studio taping for " According to Jim " .
0 when discussing a movie titled ' snakes on a plane ' , we should point out early that the snakes are pretty darn important to the plot.<br /><br />what we have here are very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes . snakes are scary because they appear to be slimy , they crawl they slither . these snakes do nothing of the sort . they glide along like they would in a video game . they are cartoon snakes . i would go as far to say that even someone that had a major phobia against real snakes would not find these ones scary < br /><br />why on earth then would you want to include extreme close ups of these cgi failures ? why not rely on suspense .. the whole ' less is more ' ethic . or better still , why not just make them look good in the first place ? and then maybe still use them sparingly < br /><br />take one look at john carpenters ' the thing ' . here we have real slime , and gore of eerie proportions . 20 years go by and we get this pile of stinking sfx crap ' snakes on a plane ' . when are these people going to wake up and smell the coffee ? special effects are going backwards!<br /><br />sure you could say .. but the movie is a joke , get it ? sure i 'm with that idea , but do it well ! in addition to the above , this movie has crap dialogue . and the music and sound effects are not creepy or memorable in any way.<br /><br />i could handle every other actor being part of this movie , except for jackson . what was he doing there ? the man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago . is this career progression ? are you offering people value for money ? no . i 'd like to know what Tarantino thought when he was half way through this stinker of a movie < br /><br />the current generation seem to have very low expectations . and Hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want . on leaving the cinema i saw a number of advertisements for some truly horrendous looking future releases including ... DOA : dead or alive , ( another ) cgi animal film called ' flushed away ' , and another crap looking comedy named ' click ' . in addition to that i saw some awful trailers , including one for ( another ) crap British horror / comedy . i 've truly not seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time < br /><br />expect to see this movie for sale in the DVD bargain section for ¬£ 1 in 6 months time . and if you 're expecting to see a black comedy with tonnes of great looking snakes , and some bad ass cool dialogue coming from samuel l jacksons lips . forget it .
0 This movie deserves more than a 1 . But I 'm giving it a one because so many fricken fan boys have given it a 10 resulting in it getting a rating that 'll take it into the top 100 list . Seriously it 's not that great its not that bad . Its a stupid cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it 's ridiculous . These are the types who probably still laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and still say " I 'm rick james b!tch " No matter how old or annoying it gets . I dread having to hear " I 'm tired of MFn snakes on this MFn plane " months from now from idiots trying to be funny . Its crappy plot crap acting etc . Its Okay to love a bad movie , but you still got ta admit its a bad movie.<br /><br />Wait for the Marine starring John Cena if you wanna see a real movie
0 I saw the 10 p.m. showing and I must say that this movie was nothing special . Although I did not leave the theater wanting my time back ( as I do n't actually pay for movies anymore ) I did n't really find any redeeming qualities.<br /><br />There were a few lines and such that made me chuckle , but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger ( in mind more than age as this film is rated R ) male audience . The fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well . I know you all want to hear Samuel L. say his infamous line , but let 's be honest , it 's a whole lot of hype for very little pay off . The only truly horrible part of the film was the CG , which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen.<br /><br />Now I am a reasonable man , I knew going into the theater that I was n't going to be seeing " Casablanka , " and I am at least thankful that this film is an original ( albiet inane ) idea and not some re - make or franchise spin off . However to be honest , if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months .
0 I am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie " rocked " . It is pure CG over - acted CRAP ! Do n't send an Assassin , it 's much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored , aggressive , venomous Snakes on a Plane ! The only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to . It is not " so bad it 's good " It 's so bad I 'd rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again . I honestly thought was going to be a COMEDY like AIRPLANE ! A spoof ! Was I wrong . It 's that whole " It sucks , get it ! " Or Samuel A. Jackson yells " Snakes on the Plane ! thing . Well I 'm sorry , I do n't get it . It looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like Triple X and Die Hard . If you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought William Hung 's CD , still live in their mommies basement , and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn , then rush to the theater and ask for one ( since I doubt you have a girlfriend ) ticket for Snakes on a stupid - butt Plane . To hell with movies like Full metal Jacket , Pulp Fiction , True Romance , 12 Monkeys , Clerks , etc . There 's no irony in watching good movies . The true decline of the western civilization . Calling this a cult film is an Insult to true Cult classics like Repo man , or even Orgazmo . I 've said enough here .
0 This movie was the worst movie I have seen since " Date Movie . " I was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared . It was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example , the eye , the tongue , the butt , the breast . If we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wo nt stay clinched on the body once they bite . For each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person . I believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior . I ca nt believe I wasted my money on this movie . So I do n't recommend this movie trust just wait until it is at the dollar theatre or rent it .
0 This is not a film you can really analyse separately from it 's production . The audience became the film - makers to an extent unprecedented in the history of the American film industry ; we felt so involved that viewing it becomes like watching the work of a friend . How is it possible to be objective ? This is our movie , is n't it ? Or is it ? There may be nothing more disingenuous than a film - maker who promotes himself as the audience 's friend , giving them all the naughty treats that the nannyish critics would deny them . Just look at that prime self - publicist Eli Roth , promising gore - hounds all the viscera missing from literally gutless mainstream horror films , only to churn out a watered down and technically incompetent piece of work like ' Hostel'.<br /><br />David R. Ellis may not have spawned the monster that was the internet response to his film , but he was , quite understandably , quick to engage with it . He took the carnival - huckster school of film - making to a new level , getting the fans to build what they would eventually buy . So many have enthused over this interactive , democratic approach to film - making that they seem to have missed the point - that this is the most cynical form of film - as - marketing . Nothing is included that the film - makers know the fans wo n't buy , and any old suggestion that will get bums on seats is incorporated . The fact that the pitch became the title tells you all you need to know.<br /><br />Isn't this just the evolution of the focus group approach ? Individual creativity , talent , craft , ideas , all are sacrificed before the inane chatter of the masses . It 's a critical commonplace that focus groups and test screenings do n't make for good movies - why should the preemptive intervention of internet enthusiasts be any different ? Because we happen to be film fans ? Well , thank god for us , because otherwise I might not have seen a topless woman get her nipple bitten by a snake.<br /><br />So , yes , I had fun at the movie - a midnight showing , fresh from the pub and with a bucket of ice - cream - but it actually had relatively little to do with the film , and quite a lot to do with the atmosphere . Like Christmas , everyone seemed determined that they would have fun , no matter what . There was laughter , but I do n't know if it was with the film , or at the film . With a film as calculated as this one , is that even a meaningful distinction ? There are some genuinely good aspects to the film . Samuel L. Jackson gives a well - judged performance , pure self - parody but with a real sense of pleasure . Rachel Blanchard and Lin Shaye are decent in limited roles , and there are one or two inspired moments - the fate of the lap dog is genuinely funny black comedy that the rest of the film fails to emulate.<br /><br />The stock characters are to be expected , but the total lack of suspense is n't . What 's the point of a film that combines two great phobias if there 's no creeping menace ? There are several snake - jumps - out moments , but they 're incredibly badly staged . Only the annoying British man gets a decent pulpy death scene - the other killings are oddly flat . The demise of the honeymoon couple , for instance , is shamefully botched . Most of the actors fail to make an impression ; it 's a shame that a charismatic actress like Julianna Margulies should seem so tired ( when she tells two kids to close their eyes and pretend the turbulent flight is a roller - coaster , she could be talking to the audience - the film falls far short).<br /><br />There are worse movies , but there are many , many better ; another reviewer on this site compared this film with ' Lake Placid ' , and it 's as apt a contrast as any I can think of . That film worked so magnificently because the performances were excellent , the jokes were funny , the suspense sequences were scary , and it was n't devised by committee . That the characters had a little depth and shading was an unexpected bonus . I do n't need a post - pub midnight showing to have a good time with that film.<br /><br />This film will , in time , fade to become a mere footnote in film history . If it sets a precedent , however , I 'm genuinely worried about what might be crossing our screens in a couple of years time . In all probability , nothing much will come of it . Perennial popcorn favourites - ' Raiders of the Lost Ark ' , ' Alien ' , ' Halloween ' and of course , ' Star Wars ' - just are n't produced by group - think.<br /><br />In the mean time , I 'll tell you what - I have n't half got a craving for some Ingmar Bergman .
0 Oh Dear Lord , How on Earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone ? It reeks of cheese from start to finish , but it 's not even good cheese . It 's the scummiest , moldiest , most tasteless cheese there is , and I can not believe there is anyone out there who actually , truly enjoyed it . Yes , if you saw it with a load of drunk / stoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way , but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen . I watched it with an up - for - a - few - laughs guy , having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film 's expected crapness . We got the crapness ( plenty of it ) , but not the chuckles . It does n't even qualify as a so - bad - it's - good movie . It 's just plain bad . Very , very bad . Here 's why ( look away if you 're spoilerphobic ) : The movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death . OK , I was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was , but I think I grasped the ' this guy is a bit of a badass who you do n't want to mess with ' message behind the ingenious scene . Oh , and a guy witnesses it . So , we already have our ultra - evil bad guy , and wussy but cute ( apparently ) good guy . Cue Hero . Big Sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion , saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish , i.e. Hero is immune to bullets , everyone else falls over rather clumsily . Cue first plot hole . How the bloody hell did Sammy know where this guy was , or that he 'd watched the murder . Perhaps this , and the answers to all my plot - hole related questions , was explained in the 2 minutes before I got into the cinema , but I doubt it . In fact , I 'm going to stop poking holes in the plot right here , lest I turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese ( which we all know is good cheese ) . So , the ' plot ' ( a very generous word to use ) . Good guy must get to LA , evil guy would rather he did n't , Hero Sam stands between the two . Cue scenery for the next vomit - inducing hour - the passenger plane . As I said , no more poking at plot holes , I 'll just leave it there . Passenger plane . Next , the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie , and what makes it everything it is - Snakes . Yay ! Oh , pause . First we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have . Hot , horny couple ( see if you can guess how they die ) , dead - before - any - snakes - even - appear British guy ( those pesky Brits , eh ? ) , cute kids , and Jo Brand . For all you Americans that 's an English comic famous for her size and unattractiveness . Now that we 've met the cast , let 's watch all of them die ( except of course the cute kids ) . Do n't expect anything original , it 's just snake bites on various and ever - increasingly hilarious ( really not ) parts of the body . Use your imagination , since the film - makers obviously did n't use theirs.<br /><br />So , that 's most of the film wrapped up , so now for the best bit , the ending . As expected , everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face . Yep , Ice - cool Sammy included . But wait , we 're not all off the plane yet ! The last guy to get off is good guy , but just as he does he gets bitten by a ( you guessed it ) snake ( of all things ) . Clearly this one had been hiding in Mr. Jackson 's hair the whole time , since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier , despite the 200 ft constrictor ( the one that ate that pesky British bugger ) being unable to . So , Sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop . At this point I prayed that the movie was about to make a much - needed U - turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort . But no . In a kind of icing on the cake way ( but with stale cheese , remember ) , it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest . How anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago , let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me , but it did well in summing up the film.<br /><br />Actually , we 're not quite done yet . After everyone has sucked face ( Uncle Sam with leading actress , good guy with Tiffany , token Black guy with token White girl , and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia ) , it 's time for good guy and hero to get it on .... In Bali ! ! ! Nope , it was n't at all exciting , the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll . Yes , the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred , and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times . That 's it . This is the first time I 've ever posted a movie review , but I felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography . If you like planes , snakes , Samuel L.Jackson , air hostesses , bad guys , surfing , dogs in bags or English people , then please , please do n't see this movie . It will pollute your opinion of all of the above so far that you 'll never want to come into contact with any of them ever again . Go see United 93 instead . THAT was good .
0 I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb . But a lot of people either have really poor taste or someone 's been fixing the score.<br /><br />Either way it was a real disappointment . The movie is exactly as stupid and far fetched as the title would suggest . There really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes : it felt like someone had been thinking : " Would n't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane ? And then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff ? ! ? " And that 's about it ! The plot is thin and unoriginal . The snakes are bad CGI ( but it makes sense to cut corners on a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone ! ) . The acting is poor , and all people are unbelievable stereo types.<br /><br />To sum it up : It 's one of the worst movies I 've ever seen - stay away !
0 B movie at best . Sound effects are pretty good . Lame concept , decent execution . I suppose it 's a rental.<br /><br />"You put some Olive Oil in your mouth to save you from de poison , den you cut de bite and suck out de poisen . You gon na be OK Tommy." < br /><br />"You stay by the airphone , when Agent Harris calls you get me ! " " Give me a fire extinguisher." < br /><br />"Weapons - we need weapons . Where 's the silverware ? All we have is this . Sporks!?" < br /><br />Dr Price is the snake expert.<br /><br />Local ERs can handle the occasional snakebite . Alert every ER in the tri - city area .
0 This must be one of the worst movies I 've ever seen , the graphics are ridiculous , and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process.<br /><br />I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie , so I ca n't say I 'm picky . I have been struggling to find something to compare it to , but I just ca n't think of anything that matches this , maybe starship troopers 2 . Witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my DVD player , but compared to this its effects are great . The acting superb and the script should be awarded . You know when a movie is bad in a funny way , well folks this is n't one of those this kills your soul minute by minute .
0 the only thing great about the movie is its title . In this case , " Snake On a Plane " is example of not judging the book by its cover , the title says nothing about the movie . When I went to the theater , I was n't expecting Citizen Kane , I was expecting Independence Day , a movie that 's pure popcorn fun , but instead , I got that horrible Roy Liotta movie called " Turbulence " Yes , this is how bad SOAP is . The only thing make SOAP better is its title . And it 's not even the apporiate title for the movie , the was n't even a glimpse of " snake " or " plane " 40 minutes into the movie ! What a false advertising ! If it was n't for its title , SOAP would be just another unforgettable cheap B - grade summer movie . And the R rating ? It has to be the most undeserved R rated movie of all time ! The makers of the movie only add a few f word to make this a R , All of the violence are kept pg-13 level . You know what 's really R rated ? The R rated superstar Edge ! See him at Summerslam instead of waste your money on a snake !
0 I saw an early screening of this film in New York and I , along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience , were vastly disappointed . The movie was n't even so bad it was good ; it was as lifeless as a snake - bite victim . Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame . It reminded me of one of those cheesy SciFi movies , except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy . It all seemed worn , flat , and overtly formulaic . I 'm shocked to say I actually think Anaconda was more fun . It 's easy to understand that SOAP realizes it 's a piece of s*it and plays along with it , but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense . It 's the worst kind of lame movie : it 's joyless .
0 All internet buzz aside , this movie was god awful . I expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything . Instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller / horror movie , and they completely missed . There were only a few good parts , and a couple good lines by Samuel Jackson . Other than that , it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes . All of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie . Now that the movie has actually come out , hopefully this joke will die . Do n't waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash .

0 I stopped watching this POS as soon as the snakes started " taking over " the plane.<br /><br />At first I thought maybe it should get a " one " for the comic relief . But then I realized I could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more ! < br /><br />Whatever respect I might have had for Samuel Jackson has been irreversibly destroyed . And Hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are . When I was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun . The only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay . And no amount of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change that.<br /><br />This movie is n't worth a trip to Blockbuster . Be warned : if you pay for it , the only " victim " is your dumb ass.<br /><br />If you want to be really scared , I suggest the Descent . If you want humor , go to your local stand up comedy club . Their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash .
0 Unless you are between the ages of 10 and 14 ( except for the R rating ) , there are very few things to like here . One or two lines from Kenan Thompson , David Koechner ( we really should see him more ) and Sam Jackson are humorous and Julianna Margulies is as good as she can be considering her surroundings , but sadly , that 's it . Poor plot . Poor acting . Worse writing and delivery . The special effects are dismal . As much as the entire situation is an odd and awful joke , the significant individual embedded situations are all equally terrible . If we consider the action portions , well there are unbelievable action sequences in some films that make you giddy and there are some that make you groan . This movie only contains the latter kind . This leaves little left . I 'm so glad I did not pay for this.<br /><br />Despite any hype , I can read and think , so as I sat down to watch , I did not expect anything good . I had no expectations , but was somewhat worried going in . Yet , like a train wreck , one can not merely look away . And even with no expectations , I was let down . Bad . Not even ' so bad , it 's good ' material . I 'm _ very _ tolerant of bad movies , but this makes " Six String Samurai " ( which I liked ) Oscar worthy.<br /><br />No , this piece of over CGI'd rubbish is in the same company as Battlefield Earth , Little Man and Gigli . How this is currently rated a 7.2 completely mystifies me . Brainwashing or somehow stacking the voting system is all that I can think of as answers.<br /><br />I could go on and on but suffice to say that tonight , I witnessed a train wreck . I need to go wash my eyes . 1 of 10
0 I 'd like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot ( ! ) for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest , crappiest movie I 've ever seen!<br /><br />I have no idea what 's wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here ( imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings ) ... the only thing I can imagine is that people must 've voted during one or more conditions:<br /><br />1 . While being shitfaced / stoned out of their minds 2 . They 've received hard cash for the votes 3 . Under gunpoint < br /><br />I ca n't believe I wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie .
0 the movie sucked , it was n't funny , it was n't exciting . they tried to make it so bad that it would be good , but failed . and thinking it 's cool to like this movie , next to the hype , are the only reasons that this movie is a success ... <br /><br />the fact that at this moment 50 % voted a 10 out of 10 for this movie seems pretty concerning to me , either the movie going public is going insane or this vote is unrealistic which can have numerous causes , and should be dealt with . anyway it is a less than average movie which bloomed through mouth to mouth advertising . It 's success can only be described as a marketing marvel .
0 Admirably odd , though mean - spirited comedy - drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome . Robert Altman - directed quasi - comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with weirdos that it starts to creak early on from the weight . Some of the cinematography is evocative , Shelley Duvall is a stitch in her debut as a tour guide , and Sally Kellerman looks every inch the glamourpuss as Bud Cort 's vision of a " mother bird " ( imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining that role to her ! ) . In the lead , Bud Cort is -- once again , after " Harold & Maude "-- a true original ; not off - putting like , say , Michael J. Pollard , Cort manages to be geeky , wacky and inoffensive , a tough act to pull off . Unfortunately , this is one of Altman 's misfires . He can put together a cast and a showpiece like no one else , but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he spirals downward . * * from * * * *
0 The 1930s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world , with an emphasis on wild animals , exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures . Despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place , and then bringing 'em back alive ( with the film footage ) , such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional Hollywood features ... because there were no expensive sets , costumes , or high - priced movie stars.<br /><br />The most successful makers of such films ( artistically and financially ) were the team of Martin E. Johnson and his wife Osa , who made several documentaries ( sometimes with blatantly staged events ) in Africa and Asia . The Johnsons ' safari films were extremely popular , inspiring several parodies ... most notably Wheeler & Woolsey 's " So This is Africa " , in which the very sexy Esther Muir plays a character named Mrs. Johnson - Martini ( instead of Martin E. Johnson , geddit ? ) . Although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time , the Johnsons ' films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour . Viewed from our own more enlightened ( I hope ) standpoint , this is a serious flaw in the Johnsons ' documentaries : there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana Johnson and his wife.<br /><br />One definite asset of these movies is the presence of Osa Johnson . Ten years younger than her husband , she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter . While certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond Esther Muir , Osa Johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co - produced with her husband.<br /><br />'Congorilla ' is probably the best of the Johnsons ' films . The shots of the Congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in 1930 . The shots of the Pygmies and other natives are also interesting , although these suffer from the Johnsons ' penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look ' wild ' and alien.<br /><br />The best ( and funniest ) scene in ' Congorilla ' is an improvised sequence in which Osa Johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some Pygmy women . ( The dance is the Black Bottom , no less ... the same dance which Bob Hope famously taught to Daisy and Violet Hilton , the conjoined twins . ) Wearing jodhpurs , riding boots , and a pith helmet , Osa Johnson starts scat - singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the African women . Meanwhile , they just stand there staring at her , apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish . It 's a very funny scene , but it has unpleasant undertones . Osa Johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black Americans : the implication seems to be that black Africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration ( using natural rhythm , I guess ) because it 's in their blood , or something.<br /><br />I'll rate ' Congorilla ' 4 points out of 10 . This film says a little bit about African life in the 1930s and rather more about American cultural perceptions in that same decade .
0 With these people faking so many shots , using old footage , and gassing animals to get them out , not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors , what 's to believe ? Old film of countries is nice , but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films . I know , racism is OK in these old films , but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility . Portrayed as fliers , they never flew their planes , Martin Johnson was an ex - vaudevillian , used friends like Jack London for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties , denying his wife 's apparent depression , using her as a cute prop , all this makes these films unbearable . They were by no means the first to travel to these lands , or the first to write about them . He was OK as a filmmaker and photographer , but that 's about it .
0 Did I step in something or is that bad smell coming from Daybreak 1 + 2 ? God was behind everything ? What has God got to do with Sci - Fi ? God is only the answer when you ca n't think up a sensible explanation for something . In fact , this is exactly the problem with the series finale - they obviously could n't think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how Kara Thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper , how her old viper and charred body ended up on Earth 2 , why Baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head , why 6 has an imaginary Baltar in her head , etc . so they explain it with " angels " or just do n't explain it at all.<br /><br />The plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a Basestar through . For example , why does Galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl ( Hera ) , particularly after Adama said there was no way he 'd attempt a rescue ? Because they found out the location of the Cylon base ? That 's not a good reason to sacrifice the crew 's lives . And how did Anders know the location ? And what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters ' lives before the war ? It 's like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment.<br /><br />The people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series . Feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical Christians on a mission to spread ' The Word ' . Forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot , the important message the writers wanted to get across is : do n't put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction ; God is your ultimate salvation ( tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment).<br /><br />Imagine in the final movie of the Star Wars series they tell you there is no " force " ... instead , a Jedi actually gets his power from Jesus . Then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the Ewoks . Would this be a good ending ? No it frakken ' would n't .
0 The fight scenes were great . Loved the old and newer cylons and how they painted the ones on their side . It was the ending that I hated . I was disappointed that it was earth but 150k years back . But to travel all that way just to start over ? Are you kidding me ? 38k people that fought for their very existence and once they get to paradise , they abandon technology ? No way . Sure they were eating paper and rationing food , but that is over . They can live like humans again . They only have one good doctor . What are they going to do when someone has a tooth ache never mind giving birth ... yea right . No one would have made that choice .
0 Horrible ending - and I ca n't believe Moore spent a year coming up with it . Smacks of L. Ron Hubbard and Dianetitcs , which Hubbard claimed to pen in just three weeks . This was actually disappointing enough for me to toss my discs from the first 3.5 years . Now , the first 1.5 hours were action packed , though absurd in the premise , and then it deteriorated into a slow , painful , sophomoric dissolution of the series . Unbelievable how slow and drawn out that last hour was . Were we to think more deeply ? If I wanted a lesson in a - materialism , I would reread Daniel Quinn 's Ishmael . Absurd to think 38 K people would give up everything for a " fresh start " . Absurd to throw in a disappearing Kara , and a reappearing Baltar and Six . Absurd to throw in the Mitochondrial Eve . Just absurd .
0 I loved the first season . The quality went down a little bit in the second season , which however had a great middle ( Pegasus ! ) . Third season was fairly novel and original and was OK . Fourth season started going downhill fast , because they never even began giving us any explanations , when by now we were really starting to need them . What the hell was the Cylon plan ? Why were there two Cylon factions ? What was the point of Angel - Kara leading the fleet to a devastated Earth-1 ? What kind of a past did the last five Cylons have , and how did they survive , or were they reincarnations ? Questions everywhere , answers nowhere.<br /><br />And then comes the end . Earth-2 ( our Earth ) in the past . Well , okay . But destroying the fleet ? ! Giving up technology and giving up any kind of urban life , and spreading a few thousand people paper - thinly across the planet ? ! That 's not only anti - science , it 's anti - reason and anti - life . And the philosophy of the show then seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle going from nature romanticism to a decadent capitalist society inventing destructive A.I. that ruins everything . It is without vision , without hope for a grander future for humanity , and it is antithetical to proper science fiction . And do n't even get me started on the angels ! Religious claptrap of the worst kind ! The ultimate disappointment!!<br /><br />The whole " all this has happened before and will happen again " thing should have related to the previous incarnation of the series , not just to Earth as we know it . Making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive stroke of genius . Frakkin shame.<br /><br />1 out of 10 .
0 There are many good things about the new BSG : There 's the multiple Cylon roles for Model 8 and 6 , for example , which the two actresses played superbly . There 's the old school feel of industrial design aboard Galactica ( " My ship will not be networked , over my dead body ! " ) Also , all the space battles , the special effects ( even though the seasoned sci - fi watcher will acknowledge the cartoonishness of it all ) The darkness of the characters , their essentially flawed nature.<br /><br />That makes it all the more bitter that the ending was so childish.<br /><br />Yes , the first part , the scenes in space , the raid on the Cylons and all that was very good . But the mushy ending ? I always watch films and shows these days with the timer hidden , so I never know how much time is left until the end . So for me it was a special kind of torture , to see the end happen over and over again . Every time I thought , oh this is the final scene , the final shot , I got one more . Every frakking character got its complete ending ! That was n't really necessary.<br /><br />What really highlighted the schoolboy amateurishness of it all : The young Roslin scenes . Why is important for us to know that : { a } she lost her sisters and father in a horrible accident and { b } that she has a one night stand with a former pupil / student ? What does that bring to the story ? Where was the linkage ? Now , I 'm all for a more European - ish style approach , and a random acts of whateverness in films and shows , and all that , but this was just ridiculous . This did n't bring anything meaningful to the story.<br /><br />Also , I 've seen the " Last Frakkin special " and in it Ron revealed his own cluelessness about the plot : he could n't come up with a good ending for the story , so .... he just did n't ! It 's never as much about the characters as they made the last episode to be . The whole " this was thousands of years in the past " idea , the mitochondrial Eve thing , was also used in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy , and believe you me , there are a lot of BSG watchers who know that particular H2G2 storyline . And speaking of Hera , now there 's a storyline that WAS NOT worked out well , AT ALL . Instead we get Roslin is doing her former pupil who 's 20 years younger . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm all for older women with younger men . The more power to them . But this ... just made no sense.<br /><br />All in all , ( the writing in ) this series is as flawed as they intended its characters would be . That goes even moreso for the last episode . I hope Lost and 24 do better , with their series finales .
0 The first half was OK , but the last half really , really disappointed . It 's funny the producers even admitted they did n't have a clue for the ending , and it really showed . What s really sad is i have to write ten lines of comment minimum to be able to post this . I really did n't want to include spoilers to qualify my remarks since the show is n't really worth that effort . When Battlestar galatica first came out I was really excited with the prospect of a better remake , it did n't happen that first season border on being space porn . They eventually cleaned it up a bit and actually had some pretty fair drama , so I started watching again . But to end the series with kara being a cyclon god angel , same with baltar and six was pretty dumb .
0 Did anyone else feel as betrayed as I did ? The first hour or so was pretty solid but the last . Oh my god . It seemed like it was predictable and cheesy . Not grandiose and epic like the entire run of the show has been . Most reviews have read have been glowing but I really ca n't understand why . I had seriously predicted that general ending WAY earlier on but then retracted it because I thought " No , they would never do that , that 's FAR too lame . " I can hardly stand it . I feel so unsatisfied . I think i 'm about to walk out the door to go sell every season I own . Someone please . Change my mind . I want to love this . SO bad . Someone tell me why I 'm wrong . Great show . Terrible ending .
0 Well , they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied . I do n't know if Stella James ( Sean Young ) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac , but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men . She 's still exploring , trying to find " more data " so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it , though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now . ( I ca n't agree , however , with anyone who says Young is too old for the role . If she is , we should all age so nicely . ) For the most part this film left me cold , though it 's by no means the worst of its type you 'll ever see . And unlike the recent ' Eyes Wide Shut , ' at least something happens in this one .
0 I hate this movie . It is a horrid movie . Sean Young 's character is completely unsympathetic . Her performance is wooden at best . The storyline is completely predictable , and completely uninteresting . I would never recommend this film to anyone . It is one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to see .
0 This movie is great , mind you - but only in the way it tells a very BAD story . Stella is so terribly crude , and never learns better . Her husband is incredibly snobby and small - minded . Neither ever learns better . Is this realistic ? Somehow , Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her gaudy manners & dress , yet can not understand that she just needs to tone it all down ? I do n't think so . Stella is a GOOD woman , and a VERY GOOD mother . Giving up herself , so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting . < br /><br />Much of what we see might have been normal for the times - people having a beer or two , enjoying a player piano , dancing - but it is made out to be some sort of moral inferiority . " I ca n't have our child living this way ! " Spare me . < br /><br />This story tells me one thing : that the Unwashed Working Class can not ever hope to aspire to the heights of the Upper Classes . And that is simply a load of hogwash .
0 i should love this movie . the acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me . the movie makes working class people look low and cheap .the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy . Barbara Stanwyck as the mother worships the daughter but the daughter forgoes a mothers love to find happiness with her well to do fathers family . i wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way about it.again the acting was very very good and worth watching . i really do n't like the story line . just a personal preference .thank you
0 so ... it 's really sexist , and classist , and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie , like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change . well , he certainly changed his tune , and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit . what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers . the end of the movie does not make her a hero , it makes the whole thing sad . and its sad that people think it makes her a hero . perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away . positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience . yuck .
0 Firstly , I am not easily scared by ... Anything except for my few phobias , but this movie is absolutely horrific . This is not appropriate for children at all ! I had my mouth open the whole time it just shocked me I. Could n't believe how gory it was for a children 's movie , bunnies being brutally murdered ! It 's just unnecessary to be so horrifying and be rated G. I recommend being over 8 to see this . But do n't get me wrong , it was probably a good movie if I was n't scarred mentally as a child . I can not believe a parent would allow a , let 's say , 4 year old child to watch this . It 's just to intense and complicated , not to forget gory , for young kids . I 'm wayy over 4 and I was shocked by the violence . I do n't recommend
0 I saw this movie as a very young girl ( I 'm 27 now ) and it scared me witless for years . I had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to ( obviously ) the violence . My parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie . I think they only say that knowing that I have such strong feelings about it ; 0 ) I am currently reading the book ( out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it 's a classic ) and it is really a great story . However I do n't think that it should have been made into a cartoon . Ever . Well , maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and I still have a hard time seeing rabbits drawn in a similar way . Gives me a little heart palpitation every time . Yah I am a wuss but I strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids , read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they approve of the content . Not everyone finds it as disturbing as I did but we are out there ; 0 )
0 OK , I know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as Watership Down is a " classic " and a standard part of most people 's childhood , but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18 , I must admit : I really hated it.<br /><br />We watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it , and many people who whimpered at the very words " Watership Down"- their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams- recommended it . To be honest , I wish I had n't bothered . I gave it the benefit of the doubt ; generally I do n't like to stop watching a film half way through . This was an exception . It was really , really , excruciatingly , sickeningly dull . This film was possibly the slowest thing I 've ever watched ( imagine a doped - up snail in space ) , and really did n't " do it " for me . The art was alright ; the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee , yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into huge details about the storyline ; basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area . Generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment , it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across . For me , I kind of wished that they would get gassed , not because I 'm a horrible sadistic person , but because the characters were uninspiring , annoying , dull and generally quite rude ( oh I 'm so terribly English ) . I found that I was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film , and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened , and even that was a terrible anticlimax.<br /><br />If I were to praise it in any way , I 'd have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well - meaning . Maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy , but the message it 's trying to put forth is good in its nature . The musical score was not bad , too.<br /><br />So , to conclude , this film is pretty poor . I could n't watch it the whole way through , or I 'd probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom . Granted , it is n't " Torque " bad , but it still does n't rate highly in my eyes , so I 've given it a 2/10.<br /><br />Hope this helps .
0 Probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this:<br /><br />1 . They might not have read the book . 2 . They might enjoy gore and violence in a film . 3 . They might be very young and therefore not understand the violence . 4 . People might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book . 5 . There are sure to be many other reasons not covered here.<br /><br />The only thing I liked about this film is the song " ' Bright Eyes".<br /><br />If perchance , you happen to be one of those people who has read the book , enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence , you are sure not to like this . Otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this.<br /><br />Like in the book , a rabbit called Fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come . Only a few rabbits - including his brother Hazel - believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live ...
0 THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN 'S MOVIE!!!<br /><br />This movie is like a " bad acid trip " for kids under the age of 5 . For a month my 4 year old from time - to - time would ask me " Why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth " or " Why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits ? " . ( And that was n't the worst of it ) . We stopped it about a 1/2 hour in but the damage had been done . Intensely morbid , oppressive , violent . Fortunately he 's finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing . Whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges . ... ( Go ahead censure me , my conscience is clear . ) .
0 This would 've been a * great * silent film . The acting really is good , at least in a Look Ma , I 'm Doing Really Big Acting ! sort of way.<br /><br />Everything is HUGE . Every line is PROFOUND ! Every scene is SHATTERED BY HUMAN TRAGEDY!<br /><br />Mostly , I felt like gagging . Yet , like any train wreck , I could n't tear my eyes away . This dialogue might 've worked on the stage , although I doubt it . On the screen , it was cluttered , haphazard , hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work.<br /><br />If you enjoy your melodrama in huge , heaping doses , you * might * enjoy the movie . Be prepared to wait , however . For all that melodrama , this thing sure plods along at its own pace.<br /><br />This script must 've sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves . It simply does n't work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera.<br /><br />IMDB does us a great disservice , at times , when it uses its goofy computer - controlled " weighted score " . Curse of the Starving Class deserves less than a 1.<br /><br />Character - driven fiction is great , but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution , it is n't character development ! Your characters must have a motivation . Being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is * not * character development . That 's a plot contrivance.<br /><br />Stay away from this movie . Or at the very least , watch it muted . Perhaps you 'll get some amusement from all the arm - waving the characters do.<br /><br />Oh , and word to the wise -- to prove that this is truly an artsy film , you see James Woods in all his dangly male " look - at - me , I'm - the - figurative - and - literal - representation - of - the - naked - vulnerability - of- man " glory.<br /><br />Don't say you were n't warned .
0 Before seeing this movie , I would 've said that I loved everything Kathy Bates has done . Now it 's everything - minus - one . James Woods is pathetic ... not his character , his acting . Someone should 've told him that " poor " is not synonymous with dirty , nor ignorant , nor cliche . Ditto for Randy Quaid 's stereotyping . The only redeeming feature is Henry Thomas , who is n't a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess . If you enjoy the country , you 'll enjoy the scenery . That 's the best I can give it.<br /><br />I'm a serious fan of both independent and quirky films , but this is simply terrible .
0 2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that is being overly generous.<br /><br />I thought with a cast of James Woods , Cathy Bates , Randy Quaid , Lou Gossett , Jr. , and Henry Thomas - how could it miss . I was wrong.<br /><br />I can only wonder what drugs Sam Shepard was on the week - end he cranked out this piece of dribble . I 'd long suspected Sam S. of being kind of nuts , this film , based on his play , confirms it.<br /><br />This is the kind of artsy b.s . that actors LOVE to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote . However , for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash , there is absolutely NOTHING to love about this movie.<br /><br />You have n't seen dysfunctional families until you 've seen this bunch . Pa is crazy , Ma is crazy , the son is crazy and the daughter is , oh yeah , crazy . They also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush , especially the teenage daughter.<br /><br />In addition to the above , as if that were n't enough , the plot -- and it 's so thin you could read thorough it -- has a hole in it the size of Alaska.<br /><br />Ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm . As it turns out so is Pa. Now I do n't claim to be a real estate expert , but the last time I checked , property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold . If only one of them owned the property , then the other could not legally sell it , so it would be pointless for that person to do so . Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact , and therefore , his plot does not work.<br /><br />Not that anything else was really working anyway.<br /><br />The only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity , and I ca n't imagine why anyone would want to .
0 This is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the West Indies and it stars Puddy from the " Seinfeld " show ! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he 's noticeably slimmer here . Oliver Reed got top billing but he 's hardly in the film at all . Warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him . Eartha Kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they 're is so much nudity in the film . If its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they 're turn with him . Then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there 's the bloody standoff . No real political message like the film " Burn " but just another contrived plot device to move the story along . Incredibly they made a sequel and Warburton and all the rest of the cast came back ! I hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad . The nudity keeps it watchable and Warburton 's lack of any accent make it at times laughable . Very bad film but I got to admit that I want to see the sequel .
0 There are no reasons to watch this movie . Should you have won and extreme amount of money and having spent your time discovering life 's every pleasure and have come to a point where by chance you are at a loose end and have some time to kill ( like that would ever happen ) then get this movie from the video shop ( if you can find it AND put up with the assistant laughing at you then ask for this movie . Be prepared however for you mind to be invaded by extremely wooden acting by absolutely everyone ( in fact the best acting was by the people who said nothing ) . Oliver Reed tops off his grand career by playing a drunk - go figure . But wait I forgot there is one reason to watch this movie - Claudia Udy showing her chest ! Sadly no other reason than that !
0 this film is in the MANDINGO & DRUM type < br /><br />they were both dreadful BUT they are 100 % better than this tripe,<br /><br />Badly acted & made Oliver Reed is the main name & Eartha Kitt also is in it . Tis a pity . Rating is 1/2 * about as low as yu can get < br /><br />as always < br /><br />jay harris
0 It 's funny . I 've seen a bunch of Fassbinder films and I have found some to be extremely creative and interesting , while others are repellent and self - indulgent messes -- like this film . For me , it ranges from great to crap -- without much in the middle . I know he has a lot of fans among the " sophisticated " , but I ca n't help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype . From my point of view ( and I know I will get a lot of negative ratings for this ) , he made too many movies too quickly and was too self - indulgent . His gay or gender - bending films ( like this one ) tend to be really bad -- sloppily done , sometimes quite boring ( such as QUERELLE and THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT ) and sometimes just gross ( like this film ) . Could n't his message about acceptance of a person 's gender - confusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered ? Show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympathetic -- then , maybe , I 'd care about the films . < br /><br />I'm honestly at the point after watching this film that I might not bother with any more Fassbinder films -- the bad seems to be out - weighing the good .
0 This is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues . That is no exaggeration : you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it.<br /><br />I sincerely thought Fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does Erwin / Elvira suicides at the end , but instead of this , in every scene somebody is trying to explain : " when he was young , this happened ... " and " he just came back from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there ... " , etc.<br /><br />Soon in the movie , Erwin / Elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute ( certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat ) , and while telling her the story of Elvira 's life , Fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other . It is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying . Of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of " I have suffered much in my life , and am about to die".<br /><br />In one of the sparse moments where actually happens something , Erwin / Elvira encounters a former lover , that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys ( as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality ) is that he recognizes Elvira.<br /><br />There are some interesting shots and ideas , I must admit ( such as when the nun tells the story of the young Erwin ) , but everything on the movie is wasted due to Fassbinder 's self- indulgence .
0 As if the storyline was n't depressing enough , this movie shows cows being butchered graphically in a slaughterhouse for all of five minutes while the protagonist is narrating her early life as a butcher . Weird stuff . Then there 's the core premise of the hero / heroine who goes and cuts his dick off because a he 's besot - ten with at work says he would have gone with him if he was a girl . Is this person a psycho , a masochist , just a doomed queen who takes things too far ? And what sort of traumatic childhood did he have ? Just that he did n't get adopted and had to live it out with nuns who at first loved him and then later hated him because he was unruly . He tries to explain to us the reasons he did what he did , but it 's really really so hard to empathize . Such sad and unusual self destruction . Was it supposed to be funny ? What was it all about really ?
0 If Fassbinder has made a worse film , I sure do n't want to see it ! Anyone who complains that his films are too talky and claustrophobic should be forced to view this , to learn to appreciate the more spare style he opted for in excellent films like " The Bitter Tears Of Petra von Kant " . This film bogs down with so much arty , quasi - symbolic images it looks like a parody of an " art - film " . The scene in the slaughterhouse and the scene where Elvira 's prostitute friend channel - surfs for what seems like ten minutes are just two of the most glaring examples of what makes this film a real test of the viewer 's endurance . But what really angers me about it are the few scenes which feature just Elvira and her ex - wife and/or her daughter . These are the only moments that display any real human emotion , and prove that at the core of this horrible film , there was an excellent film struggling to free itself . What a waste .
0 I found Tremors 4:The Legend Begins , to be dull and boring . All the action scenes were stupid . The so called " GRABOIDS " are reduced to the size of a modern day house cat , if not smaller . The acting was horrendous , and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the Tremor saga , because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed , the story is so dumb and useless . Also , if you want to tell a story WAY back in time , make sure you use the SAME ACTOR(Michael Gross ) , to be someone in the past , when he 's someone in the present in the other Tremor movies . Geez ... If you have n't seen this film , do n't waste your time . Stick to Tremors , 1 , 2 , and 3 , for a good time . This film however , make sure you 're remote is sitting right next to you with the STOP button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense .
0 Warning : This review contains minor spoilers.<br /><br />Well the writers of the first Tremors are officially out of ideas . I 'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are pretty good for straight to video fare . Tremors 4 : The Legends Begins , however , is a very dull movie . Where the heck are the Graboids ? ? ? < br /><br />Due to the relative lack of Graboids through the first 90 minutes I 'm convinced that this entry into the series is suppose to be a " character study " . Unfortunately there is n't one interesting character in the movie except for Billy Drago 's character who is given too few lines , too little to do and in the end too little screen time . What saved the 2nd and 3rd movies was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer . Whenever there was n't any action on the screen you could rest assured that Burt Gummer was going to be interesting to listen too and/or watch . However in this movie Gross plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and boring substitute . < br /><br />On the plus side when the Graboids ( Dirt Dragons in this movie ) are on the screen they do look good but that is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed at 101 minutes long . Pretty good for straight to video . But after watching it I 'm sure that this movie is a good 15 minutes too long . There are long stretches of dialogue that is boring and does n't further the plot any . Was there a rush to get this movie made ? I think not , more time could have and should have been spent on the script.<br /><br />I thought I had hit a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packaged for sale with .... Tremors ! ! ! What luck I thought , pay for # 4 get # 1 for free . Well after watching Tremors 4 I like to think I paid for the original and got this mess for free , I ca n't imagine paying a single dime for Tremors 4 . For fans of the series it 's best to forget that Tremors 4 : The Legend Begins even exists.<br /><br />Tremors 4 : The Legend Begins rates a 3 out of 10 .
0 The fourth " Tremors " feature goes back in time , to the year 1889 . " The Legend Begins " in the small city of " Perfection " , which was then " Rejection , Nevada " . As the story begins , seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly " Graboids " . Some of the characters in the present - day " Tremors " films have ancestors , both figurative and literal , in the past . Most obvious is the ever - returning Michael Gross ( as Hiram Gummer ) . Unlike his descendant , Mr. Gross is inept with firearms ; so , he hires gunslinger Billy Drago ( as " Black Hand " Kelly ) to shoot 'em up some " Dirt Dragons".<br /><br />This one takes some getting used to - as it takes place in the distant past . It 's like a western with miniature versions of the original film 's monster " Graboids " . These tamer " Dirt Dragons " are nowhere near as terrorizing as their " Tremors " ( 1990 ) counterparts . Consequently , in this film , the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground , which would not have happened in the original movie . And , it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly , when Gross temporarily decides to leave town . Why so helpless ? Why did n't Brent Roam ( as Juan Pedilla ) immediately rally the people to fight without Gross ? Disappointing.<br /><br / > * * * * Tremors 4 : The Legend Begins ( 2004 ) S.S. Wilson ~ Michael Gross , Brent Roam , Billy Drago
0 This , the direct - to - video death rattle of the Tremors series , features sixty inspired seconds ( sawblade : you 'll know it when you see it ) and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at . Tremors 4 was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget . That means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm - on - human violence , tops . The lackluster , cliche - spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the Tremors 4 experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long . Only hardcore Tremors fans will be able to sit through , much less enjoy this film . If you are n't among them- do n't bother .
0 Just a few words .... This movie really sucks . It 's like those TV Movies with bad cast and plot . It 's amazing how they could make this sequel worse than the III . Do n't waste your time watching this crap , even if you like the tremors movies .
0 Well ... tremors I , the original started off in 1990 and i found the movie quite enjoyable to watch . however , they proceeded to make tremors II and III . Trust me , those movies started going downhill right after they finished the first one , i mean , ass blasters ? ? ? Now , only God himself is capable of answering the question " why in Gods name would they create another one of these dumpster dives of a movie ? " Tremors IV can not be considered a bad movie , in fact it can not be even considered an epitome of a bad movie , for it lives up to more than that . As i attempted to sit though it , i noticed that my eyes started to bleed , and i hoped profusely that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the TV and kill me . did they really think that dressing the people who had stared in the other movies up as though they we 're from the wild west would make the movie ( with the exact same occurrences ) any better ? honestly , i would never suggest buying this movie , i mean , there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well .
0 Dear dear dear dear dear ... me ! I had the strength to see it through ... But why?!<br /><br />The first two films where fun and actually somewhat good . But this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing . This was some kind of Tremors for kids . I ca n't believe this movie was made at all .. seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind ( for kids ) and they just did whatever they could with it.<br /><br />What audience is this movie for ? I can only think of 12 - 14 year olds . If you 're older than 14 you 'll have serious problems with this movie . It 's not only slow , but it 's so utterly boring . The characters are overacted ( not just a little either ) and so stereotyped it 's fun for a while .. but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen . You know everything that is going to happen too , cause yes ... you've seen it a BILLION times before in any hero series on TV for kids . I picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced . It 's so bad .. so wrong .. so ... crap.<br /><br />But OK , we did get a laugh now and then . Not just at the silly plot holes , but some scenes where worth a replay or two ... or one scene that is , where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys .. It 's really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly . Still makes me grin when I think about it . But that only happened one more time sadly .. and that 's when the " badass " gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully ... that and one comment " They spring from the ground like some DEMONIC TROUT ! " At this point we where almost crying with laughter . But after that .. nothing could ever top that .. (?) .. so it 's pretty much downhill from there . < br /><br />So tops here are demonic trouts and overacting . If anybody ever tells you this is a good movie ... he 's either a " plant " , vegetable or someone very evil . This movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far . Looking forward to seeing Tremors 3 , it 's bound to be box office hit compared to this ... this ... *goosebumps * no .. I'll leave it at that .
0 Enough is enough ... sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead . The first Tremors movie was great . The second one was ridiculous . The third one was nauseating . The tv series was depressingly awful . And this movie just drives the stake deeper.<br /><br />Basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry , now we have the series set in the Wild West , in the 1800 's , and they fight graboids . Like a rehash of the first one , they have to learn how to beat them all over again . Mildly entertaining I suppose . Otherwise this straight - to - video release , just like Tremors 2 and 3 , is just going way too far . Oh and I continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place ... did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event ? I think something like this would be history - making , so our pals in the first film would n't be so unprepared . < br /><br />Movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy . Avoid this garbage .
0 One of the major flaws in this film is that while the mocking of pretentious yuppies is satisfying , it fails to realize that the movie makers themselves are guilty of being one of those that deserve to be mocked . One of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they ( the yuppies ) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art . While the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning , I find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner . If these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home , I would bet that American Psycho would be one of those movies .
0 There 's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets . It 's just that some are better than others . This is very poor . The acting is awful , the script dire ; and the special effects overrated.<br /><br />Why does Hollywood treat it 's audience with such contempt ? And why have they made a sequel ?
0 Simply not the quality I expected from Morris ( love Brass Eye and Blue Jam ) . This is very much like a not so bad student film . What concerns me , in all this is WHY DID IT WIN A BAFTA ? ? ? Morris makes fun of ' enshrined mediocrity ' ( Ayn Rand ) in much of his work ( Nathan Barley ) and yet with this piece is urinating down the backs of the talented and telling us its raining ! < br /><br />I just hope as he has chosen a subject I would love to tackle ( the humanity of terrorism - Four Lions ) that he is n't going to cock that up , wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of mainstream ignorance and opinion on this emotive and heavily spun phenomena .
0 Being a filmmaker myself , and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour , I thought I was in for a treat when I took home " My Wrongs ... " ( not that the DVD cover gives anything away , instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director , Chris Morris , " a short film including scenes " ) . I should have known better really , and avoided this insipid ( and often offensive ) piece of twoddle.<br /><br />The scene in the church is repulsive to watch ( especially since we are all too familiar with Morris 's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series , Brass Eye ) and serves no purpose other than to shock . How this film is labelled a comedy I will never understand.<br /><br />The runner 's commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle ( having been a runner myself , it 's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process ) , however this is sadly not the case here . Instead , we are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film , before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs . This is all very interesting , but not worth a single frame of celluloid.<br /><br />To say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement . It relies far too heavily upon its heightened style , at the expense of plot , character and dialogue , leaving the viewer strangely perturbed and unfulfilled . Its over - simplified message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both glaringly obvious and poorly illustrated.<br /><br />The film does have its moments of pseudo - Kafkaesque surrealism , but ultimately , it fails to convince , to entertain , to enlighten and just ends up being irritating . If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking , I strongly recommend " Franz Kafka 's It 's A Wonderful Life " , by Peter Capaldi .
0 Quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom.<br /><br />A group of top quality actors , in the main well cast ( with a couple of notable exceptions ) , who give pretty good performances . Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley as Diana . All do well with the scripts they were given.<br /><br />So much for the good . The average would include the sets . Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book , although bizarrely the house they use for the Dower House looks remarkably like it . It is clear then that the Dower House is far too big . In the later parts , the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the UK , presumably to save money , although with a little imagination I have no doubt they could have recreated Ceylon.<br /><br />Now to the bad . The screenplay . This is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it . Edward does not die in the battle of Britain but survives , blinded . He makes a brief appearance then commits suicide - why ? ? Loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with Gus to a sensible farmer 's wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear ( less emotional than Brief Encounter ) . Gus , a man besotted and passionately in love , is prepared to give up his love without complaint . Walter ( Mudge in the book ) turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man . Jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who wo n't speak . Aunt Biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification . The Dower House is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess who has a fear of armed soldiers . Whilst Miss Mortimer 's breasts are utterly delightful , I could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward . The delightfully named Nettlebed becomes the mundane Dobson . The word limit prevents me from continuing the list.<br /><br />There is a sequel ( which I lost all interest in watching after this nonsense ) and I wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story . It is difficult to image that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book ; presumably she lost her control when the rights were purchased .
0 With Knightly and O'Tool as the leads , this film had good possibilities , and with McCallum as the bad guy after Knightly , maybe some tension . But they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants . It was of course totally superficial , beautiful English country and seaside or not . The number one mistake was dumping Knightly so early on in the film , when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older , instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part . They missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast , and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low - cost heartstring elements .
0 Okay , you have:<br /><br />Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone - Tweed , B.B.E. ( Backbone of England . ) She 's killed off in the first scene - that 's right , folks ; this show has no backbone!<br /><br />Peter O'Toole as Ol' Colonel Cricket from The First War and now the emblazered Lord of the Manor.<br /><br />Joanna Lumley as the ensweatered Lady of the Manor , 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous ( Brit spelling , not mine ) enough to have a toy - boy on the side . It 's alright , they have Col . Cricket 's full knowledge and consent ( they guy even comes ' round for Christmas ! ) Still , she 's considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy - boy her own age ( what a gal!)<br /><br />David McCallum as said toy - boy , equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze . Pilcher could n't come up with any cover for him within the story , so she gave him a hush - hush job at the Circus.<br /><br />and finally:<br /><br />Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups , Venerable Headmistress of the Venerable Girls ' Boarding - School , serving tea in her office with a dash of deep , poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation . Her best bit of advice : " I 've only been to Nancherrow ( the local Stately Home of England ) once . I thought it was very beautiful but , somehow , not part of the real world . " Well , we ca n't say they did n't warn us.<br /><br />Ah , Susan - time was , your character would have been running the whole show . They do n't write 'em like that any more . Our loss , not yours.<br /><br />So - with a cast and setting like this , you have the re - makings of " Brideshead Revisited , " right?<br /><br />Wrong ! They took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well . After all , acting is one of the oldest temp - jobs there is ( YOU name another!)<br /><br />First warning sign : lots and lots of backlighting . They get around it by shooting outdoors - " hey , it 's just the sunlight!" < br /><br />Second warning sign : Leading Lady cries a lot . When not crying , her eyes are moist . That 's the law of romance novels : Leading Lady is " dewy - eyed." < br /><br />Henceforth , Leading Lady shall be known as L.L.<br /><br />Third warning sign : L.L. actually has stars in her eyes when she 's in love . Still , I 'll give Emily Mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes ( I wonder . did they use contacts?)<br /><br />And lastly , fourth warning sign : no on - screen female character is " Mrs. " She 's either " Miss " or " Lady." < br /><br />When all was said and done , I still could n't tell you who was pursuing whom and why . I could n't even tell you what was said and done.<br /><br />To sum up : they all live through World War II without anything happening to them at all.<br /><br />OK , at the end , L.L. finds she 's lost her parents to the Japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic . Meanwhile ( there 's always a " meanwhile , " ) some young guy L.L. had a crush on ( when , I do n't know ) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by Lady of the Manor ( must be some street if SHE 's going to find him there . ) Both war casualties are whisked away to recover at Nancherrow ( SOMEBODY has to be " whisked away " SOMEWHERE in these romance stories!)<br /><br />Great drama .
0 I 'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there 's almost no plot , anyway . I 've seen several reviewers call ISOYG an ' anti - rape ' film or even a feminist statement , and I just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims.<br /><br />First of all , what do we see on the cover of this movie ? That 's right : a shapely woman 's behind . Whether it was Zarchi 's attempt to make an anti - rape statement - and I absolutely do n't believe it was - is entirely beside the point . The film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic ( everything but actual penetration is shown ) that NO ONE but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it.<br /><br />The rape(s ) in the film is uncomfortable , brutal and hard to watch . There 's something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light , but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes , none . There was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed ( mere moments before he 's murdered ) so the scene is n't at all engaging on an emotional level . Really , it 's just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies ISOYG is associated with on IMDb ( Caligula , Cannibal Ferox , etc . ) that it attracts only the exploitation crowd.<br /><br />Finally , a few reviewers have commended Zarchi 's so - called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack . But considering how inept everything else in the film is ( acting , script , etc . ) I suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn - caliber actors do their thing.<br /><br />I'm not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of ISOYG . I 'm all for exploitation / horror and love video nasties . In fact , I 'm giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films . However , it 's also poorly made and after the rape occurs , just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho - hum , mostly gore - less murders and wait for the credits to roll.<br /><br />This is probably worth watching once if you 're a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but I 'm telling you , the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation .
0 I 've seen the Gator Bait films , and this is almost exactly the same thing as those . A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them . The thing that sets this movie apart from those ones ( although not very far ) is that the sexual content is not glorified . There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film , but not for a second is it ever sexy . Some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive , but that 's only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience 's need to see this woman seek revenge.<br /><br />This is a weak film , it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers . I Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral , but I was glad to see that , since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead , it was not meant to pass off as a T&A film.<br /><br />B - movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality , and while I Spit On You Grave is unmistakably a B - movie and contains more than its share of nudity , the nudity does not drive the plot . On the other hand , the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists . These men are evolutionary drop - outs just like they were in the Gator Bait films , and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them , but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless B - movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind , but instead it simply satisfies the audience 's desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve . < br /><br />The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks . Oddly , the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity ( although not by much ) , but it is by far the most painful to watch . We are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible ( it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller , staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord ) , but again , this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with.<br /><br />(spoilers ) You know that this is all the movie means to do , since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed . The woman does not live happily ever after , she does n't write her book , she does n't leave and never return to that nightmare place , she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks . But hey , what more did you expect?<br /><br />Oh , and did you read the tagline ? If you decide to waste your time watching this , try and find any man getting broken or burned . I was really looking forward to those ¬Ö
0 I just rented and watched this movie just to see what 's all the fuss about . So here 's what my reactions to it are . It 's easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors . The main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists . This concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film . However , the movie does n't shock or disturb me at all . It just bored me . This movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes . All lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time , like those scenery scenes and some scenes I described below.<br /><br />************Contains spoiler * * * * * * * * * * * * I find the rape scenes quite tame . I do n't know if I have watched the cut or uncut version , if there is actually such a version . I also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot . Here 's a list on top of my mind.<br /><br />Why do n't the rapists rape Jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are . That would be an excellent time.<br /><br />Why do n't they just gang rape her , instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening Jennifer 's ordeal by such a long time . It would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way.<br /><br />I found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house . Maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles.<br /><br />These rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right , they should n't send a coward imbecile to do the job.<br /><br />Why did n't Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left ? Which should be the first thing that pops up in most people 's mind , especially for someone who is a writer . < br /><br />Why did n't these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw Jennifer is alive?<br /><br />I find it really amazing that a slender lady like Camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Ends spoiler************<br /><br />But hey , this movie is not without its merits , Camille Keaton is gorgeous and I get to hear one of the funniest line I have recently heard when Matthew protest of going back into the house and kills Jennifer , ` Why me ? Why Me , I did n't even c^m ! ! ! '
0 Director Kevin Connor and wannabe action - hero / romantic lead Doug McClure , re - team in this ghost story set in Japan . They had been moderately successful together in the 1970 's , with the likes of ' The Land that Time Forgot ' ( 1975 ) , ' At the Earth 's Core ' ( 1976 ) etc . Without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though , the results are shabby and derivative in the most corny way.<br /><br />The film begins with a prologue set in the 19th Century , with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide . A move forward to the present introduces married couple Ted & Laura , visiting Japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place.<br /><br />No surprises as to what happens next , with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend Alex ( McClure ) assuming the role of the wife 's lover.<br /><br />Everything rumbles clumsily along with the elegance and grace of a charging elephant , to an inevitable ( but surprisingly downbeat ) conclusion . Main points of interest are two feeble decapitations ( ' The Omen ' has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set - piece ) , and the love - making scenes featuring the doe - eyed but extremely kinky Susan George . The first is a long ' Do n't Look Now ' inspired piece with her hubby , complete with piano music ; the second a much shorter ( probably at her insistence ) entanglement with McClure , both looking pretty uncomfortable . Anyway , every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show of her fantastic knockers so all is not lost.<br /><br />Overall I ca n't decide whether ' The House where Evil Dwells ' is rubbish , watchable rubbish , or entertaining in a masochistic kind of way . If you 're not into the genre there is nothing here at all , but for horror fans there is probably enough to provoke the odd rye smile and appreciative nod of respect for effort.<br /><br />BEST SCENE - in any other film the big , black , tree - climbing , Japanese - muttering mechanical crabs would have stolen the show . They are eclipsed though by the legendary family meal scene , where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup . On seeing this apparition she asks what kind of soup it is ( ! ! ! ! ) , to be told beef and vegetable , before uttering the immortal line " Ugh - there 's an awful face in my soup " . If this was n't enough the reply is " C'mon , eat your soup for Daddy . " Laurel & Hardy rest in piece .
0 From reading all of the comments posted here on IMDb , this movie seems to get ragged on a lot , but I did n't think it was THAT bad . I 've seen much worse , actually.<br /><br />"The House Where Evil Dwells " is a ghost story about a husband and his wife , Ted and Laura Fletcher , and their daughter , Amy , who move into an old house in Japan . Little do they know , a Japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover , and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword . As strange things happen in the house , the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living , and plan on re - enacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years back.<br /><br />I saw this movie and decided to give it a chance , from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story . It was routine , and it was corny , but I 've seen worse in my day . The ghost sequences were a little over - done , we get to see the translucent blue - tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family , and take over their bodies . To be honest , the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland . I may be mistaken , but after watching this , it seemed to me that the Japanese horror film " Ju - On : The Grudge " and the American remake of that film ripped this off a little . The old Japanese home where a brutal murder took place , ghostly activity , curses put on the home , etc . But I may be wrong.<br /><br />To sum it up , this is a pretty corny ghost story . Do n't go out of your way to see it , but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on TV you can give it a shot . 4/10 .
0 Giant crabs cursing in Japanese ? What was in that drink ? A terrible movie , but laughable . I love the invisible Samurai ghosties running around . Drink much beer before you see this movie .
0 This could have been interesting ¬ñ a Japan - set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly - installed American family ¬ñ but falls flat due to an over - simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director.<br /><br />The film suffers from the same problem I often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare , i.e. the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they 're expected to ! Besides , it does n't deliver much in the scares department ¬ñ a giant crab attack is merely silly ¬ñ as , generally , the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way , such as Susan George seducing diplomat / friend - of - the - family Doug McClure and Edward Albert force - feeding his daughter a bowl of soup ! < br /><br />At one point , an old monk turns up at the house to warn Albert of the danger if they remain there ¬ñ eventually , he 's called upon to exorcise the premises . However , history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created ¬ñ leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which Albert and McClure , possessed by the spirits of their Japanese predecessors , engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death ! At the end of the day , this emerges an innocuous time - waster ¬ñ tolerable at just 88 minutes but , in no way , essential viewing .
0 At the beginning of the film , you might double - check the DVD cover and re - read the synopsis a couple of times , but no worries . It 's NOT " Memoirs of a Geisha " that you purchased ; just a movie with an intro that is much more classy and stylish than it has any right to be . Still , the opening is by far the best thing about the entire movie , as it shows how in the year 1840 a Samurai sword master catches his wife committing adultery . He decapitates the two lovers before doing some hara - kiri ( ritual suicide through disembowelment ) . Cut to present day , when the American Ambassador in Japan welcomes a befriended family and drives them up to the same house where the aforementioned slaughter took place nearly one and a half century ago . From then onwards , this becomes a seemingly routine haunted house flick yet the utterly retarded and implausible script still makes it somewhat exceptional . Let 's start with the good aspects , namely the original Japanese setting and the presence of the delicious Susan George who is my all - time favorite British horror wench ( well , together with Britt Eckland , Linda Hayden and Ingrid Pitt ) . The bad aspects simply include that the screenplay is incoherent , imbecilic beyond repair and full of supposedly unsettling twists that only evoke laughter . The restless spirits of the house soon begin to entertain themselves by perpetrating into the bodies of the new tenants and causing them to do and say all sorts of crazy stuff . The spirit of the massacred adulterous woman particularly enjoys squeezing into Susan 's ravishing booty and transforming her into a lewd seductress ! In this " possessed " state , she even lures the American ambassador outside to have sex in the garden of a high society diner party full of prominent guests . So , strictly spoken , it 's not really " evil " that dwells in the house ; just a trio of sleazy ghosts with dirty minds and far too much free time on their long - dead hands ! Obviously these scenes are more comical than frightening , especially since the light - blue and transparent shapes remind you of the cute ghost effects that were later popularized in " Ghostbusters " . " The House Where Evil Dwells " is probably the least scary ghost movie ever . Throughout most of the running time , you 'll be wondering whether director Kevin Connor ( who nevertheless made the excellent horror films " Motel Hell " and " From Beyond the Grave " ) intentionally wanted to make his movie funny and over - the - top , like " Motel Hell " maybe . But then again , everyone in the cast continues to speak his / her lines with a straight and sincere face , so I guess we are nevertheless supposed to take everything seriously and feel disturbed . " The House Where Evil Dwells " is never suspenseful or even remotely exciting and it does n't even contain any grisly images apart from the massacre at the beginning . I am fully aware of how shallow it sounds , but the two scenes in which Susan George goes topless are the only true highlights . Well , those and maybe also the invasion of cheesy and ridiculously over - sized spiders ( or are they crabs ? ) in the daughter 's bedroom . How totally random and irrelevant was that ? If you ever decide to give this movie a chance notwithstanding its bad reputation , make sure you leave your common sense and reasoning at the doorstep.<br /><br />Trivia note for horror buffs : keep an eye open for the demon - mask that was also a pivot piece of scenery in the brilliant Japanese horror classic Onibaba .
0 .. IT 'S THIS ONE ! Very cool premise , right off the bat.<br /><br />Has an excellent first scene , got ta give credit where credit 's due.<br /><br />Has solid characters and a decent enough script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me : Whenever the ghosts appeared , which I really liked by the way ; how it was done , how it looked ... the only thing was the ghost 's relationship . Because of the way things went down in the first scene you 'd think their dynamic would be different.<br /><br />Things slowed down a little too much in the middle I felt , and the crab / spider scene was just not good . BUT then the ending is actually very good ! Sure , ' The Grudge ' basically told the same story with a polished lens but no samurai 's and that 's what I liked about this movie comparatively.<br /><br />Please , someone one with a tempered style remake this movie.<br /><br />Fans of ' Silent Rage ' would absolutely love this movie .
0 This can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you do n't take it seriously . It is a bit dated and the effects are lame , but it is so enjoyable . There are giant crabs that attack a girl . oh , and the crabs sing Japanese . It is amazingly bad . And the ending , which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome . Predictable , but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat . Do n't even give this film a chance and you will love it . Susan George is fun to watch and yes , she does appear naked . Her daughter is n't quite worth putting up with , but she does get attacked by giant crabs . They are the size of large cats . This is a 2 , but I love it . As a movie , my God , but for entertainment , I give it a 7 . Did I mention there are giant crabs ?
0 The film opens with a peaceful shot of a traditional Japanese house complete with thatched roof that sits on the side of a small hill and an on screen caption appears that reads ' KUSHIATA KYOTO , JAPAN 1840 ' . A young Japanese trainee Samurai named Masanori ( Toshiya Maruyama ) walks up the winding path to the house , inside waits Otami ( Mako Hattori ) with whom he is having an affair behind her husband , Shugoro 's ( Tsuiyuki Sasaki as Toshiyuki Sasaki ) back who happens to be Masanori 's teacher . Shugoro unexpectedly arrives home to find his wife and student having very intimate relations with each other . His honour destroyed the enraged Samurai brutally murders both Otami and Masanori before committing suicide . Over a century later and Ted Fletcher ( Edward Albert ) arrives in Japan on a working holiday with his wife Laura ( Susan George ) and their young daughter Amy ( Amy Barrett ) . Their close friend Alex Curtis ( Doug McClure ) who works for the American consulate helps them out by finding them a place to stay , you do n't need me to you where ! He jokingly says it 's going so cheap because it 's haunted , to which both Ted and Laura laugh off as they obviously do n't believe in ghosts , at least for the time being that is . Almost immediately the film goes into clich√© mode . Lights turn on and off by themselves , Laura has an uneasy feeling about the place and a local Zen Monk ( Henry Mitowa ) gives them an ominous warning for them to leave before it 's too late which they ignore , of course . The spirits of Otami , Masanori and Shugoro were doomed for eternity to remain within the walls of the house because of a Majyo witches ( Tsuyako Olajima ) curse put upon them . But there may be a way they can break the curse , unfortunately for the Fletcher family it could potentially cost them their marriage , daughter and possibly even their very lives . < br /><br />Directed by Kevin Connor I thought this was a pretty average film , OK to watch once if you 've got nothing better to do but after a day or two you 'll probably have completely forgotten it . Nothing sticks in the memory as being particularly bad but on the other hand there 's nothing particularly good about the film either . The script by Robert Suhosky from the novel by James Hardiman is a little on the dull side and strictly by - the - numbers , a lot of ghostly goings on happen throughout the film but none of it is very interesting or exciting and the flat characters and direction does n't help things . There are couple of silly sequences like the giant plastic crabs that try to get Amy and her babysitter , Noriko ( Mayumi Umeda ) . And there is a scene where the Zen Monk exorcises the house and the ghosts are banished outside unable to get back in , however that is until Ted simply opens the door and they just walk right back in , some exorcism ! One more thing , I think it was a bad idea to have Doug McClure who was 47 when he made this , try his hand at Kung - Fu and oriental sword fighting ! George gets her ample breasts out a couple of times including a very unerotic sex scene with McClure , although great pains and a couple of bed sheets that stick to them like super glue were taken to ensure no below the waist nudity was present . Apart from a couple of mostly off screen decapitations there 's no blood , gore or violence to speak about . The ' transparent ' ghost effects are OK but they ai n't going to impress many people these days . It 's professionally enough made and looks quite nice but the potential in the Japanese setting and myths is squandered as this film could have been set in America , England or any Western country without having to change a thing . An OK time waster .
0 Dull haunted house thriller finds an American family moving into a 200 year old house in Japan where a violent murder suicide love triangle occurred . < br /><br />Novel setting is about the only element of interest in this very slow moving horror flick by the director of Motel Hell . The film generates zero suspense and is composed of somewhat choppy scenes that rarely seem to be leading anywhere overall . < br /><br />One obvious example is a fairly early scene where the male lead visits a temple after realizing that his house is haunted as the monk had earlier warned . The monk recounts the history of the house ( which the viewer is already familiar with from the opening sequence ) and then the film simply cuts away to something else . Earlier the monk had offered to help . Well , where is the help ? The family continues to stay in the haunted house as things get worse and worse and no mention of the monk is made until nearly the very end when he turns up again to do what he should have done an hour earlier -- try to drive the spirits out of the house , although by this time it 's difficult for the viewers to care.<br /><br />There are some ( probably ) unintentional campy laughs in seeing the American actors at the end become possessed by the Japanese spirits and suddenly start doing bad martial arts , I say probably because the scene is more than a little reminiscent of the chainsaw duel from the same director 's Motel Hell which was more obviously meant to be amusing , but on the whole this is a forgettable dud .
0 I do n't think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it 's over if you were ever scared . This does n't really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film does n't tack on one of those happy endings . Story is about an American couple who travel to Kyoto , Japan so that Ted Fletcher ( Edward Albert ) can write a book and he brings along his wife Laura ( Susan George ) and their daughter Amy ( Amy Barrett ) . Their friend Alex Curtis ( Doug McClure ) who works at the American Consulate helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted . About 140 years earlier in the same house a Samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide . Their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the Fletcher 's arrive it does n't take long before strange things start happening.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />At times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the Fletcher 's and they start to act like the Japanese people that they were before and Laura starts to flirt with Alex which leads to an affair . Meanwhile , Ted starts behaving more strict and after he pours soup down the throat of Amy he goes to ask a Monk for help . Unfortunately the ghosts get Ted , Laura , and Alex to play out their death scene like it happened 140 years earlier.<br /><br />This film was directed by Kevin Connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with McClure on some of them . While this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that I liked . First , it does n't have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after defeating the demons . Instead , it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone succumbs to the evil of the ghosts . Secondly , it has Susan George in the cast ! I 've always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch . Also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she does n't have classic features she does have a unique tomboy like look about her and it 's one of the reasons why she was so popular . But after appearing in silly films such as this I think it led to her getting out of the business or working only sporadically . This is n't a bad film but it 's never convincing and watching the ghosts scurry around when the Monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a giggle or two . The bottom line is that this is silly and I hope George decides to resume her career .
0 Film starts in 1840 Japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide . It 's a very gory , bloody sequence . Then it jumps to present day ... well 1982 to be precise . Ted ( Edward Albert ) , wife Laura ( Susan George ) and their annoying little kid move to Japan for hubby 's work . They rent a house and -- surprise ! surprise -- it just happens to be the house where the murders took place ! The three dead people are around as ghosts ( the makeup is hysterically bad ) and make life hell for the family.<br /><br />Sounds OK -- but it 's really hopeless . There 's a bloody opening and ending and NOTHING happens in between . There is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious ! They look so fake -- I swear I saw the strings pulling one along -- and they 're muttering ! ! ! ! ! There 's a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes ( probably just to show off George 's body ) , another one about 40 minutes later ( but that was necessary to the plot ) and a really silly exorcism towards the end . The fight scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen to be believed.<br /><br />As for acting -- Albert was OK as the husband and McClure was pretty good as a family friend . But George -- as always -- is terrific in a lousy film . She gives this film a much needed lift -- but ca n't save it . I 'm giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing . That aside , this is a very boring film .
0 While the premise behind The House Where Evil Dwells may be intriguing , the execution is downright pathetic . I 'm not even sure where to begin as I 've got so many problems with this movie . I suppose I 'll just number a few of them : < br /><br />1 . The Acting ¬ñ When you see that Edward Albert , Doug McClure , and Susan George ( and her teeth ) are the stars of your movie , you know you 're in trouble ? Not that it matters much to me , but these are hardly A - List names . Susan George may have been in a couple of movies I enjoy , but I 've never considered her the greatest actress I 've ever seen . And in this movie , her acting is embarrassing . As for the other two , the less said the better.<br /><br />2 . The Ghosts ¬ñ The ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride.at Disney World . And , they are about as frightening . And why did they have to be so obvious ? Subtlety is not a characteristic of The House Where Evil Dwells.<br /><br />3 . The Plot ¬ñ How predictable can one movie be ? The outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters . If you could n't see where this movie was headed after about 15 minutes , you need to see more movies.<br /><br />4 . The Convenient Priest ¬ñ What are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of Japanese monks ? Not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over , knocks on the door , and asks if you need help removing evil spirits . Absurd is a word that comes to mind.<br /><br />5 . Everything Else ¬ñ It 's very difficult for me to think of any positives to write about . I suppose I 'll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the house 's architecture . That 's a sure sign of a winner ¬ñ noting the architecture as a highlight of any film does n't say much about the actual movie.<br /><br />I'll stop . You should be able to get the idea from what I 've already mentioned . And , I have n't even mentioned the annoying little girl or the Invasion of the Crabs or a multitude of other problems . Be warned , this thing is horrible .
0 Aside for being classic in the aspect of its cheesy lines and terrible acting , this film should never be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia . I ca n't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a " good movie . "
0 I saw this film at a pre - release screening at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills . As I recall , the film 's producers and director were in attendance , presumably to gage our reaction.<br /><br />Many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience , which would have been fine if it had been a comedy , but it was supposed to be a horror film.<br /><br />If the audience was n't scared , it seems the filmmakers were . They delayed release for over a year . Out of curiosity I saw it again to see if they 'd re - cut it ; as far as I can tell , they had n't . It was the same lousy movie , just a year older.<br /><br />It almost qualifies as " so bad , it 's good , " but it 's slow - paced and boring .
0 This is a rotten movie . The cast seem to know just how bad it was.it starts badly and by the end is truly bad.the acting is woeful.the script could of been written on the spot.and although the movie is a horror film it has no scary scenes . Crap 1 out of 10
0 A family moves into a old house in Japan . But there 's a catch it 's haunted ( BOO ! ! ! ) . Aw , did n't mean to make you jump . It 's only a review . Settle back down . Ahem , now anyways it 's haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife & her lover in slow motion . This naturally makes a 3 minutes scene stretch out to about 7 or 8 . Horrid acting . Horrid story . But How bad can it be you ask ? Well it was SO bad my brain started to melt & leak out through my nose in thoughtful drips . It was SO bad whenever Doug McClure came on - screen I prayed that i had flashbacks of Small Wonder ( Yes , i know Doug was in " Out of this world " & not " small Wonder " , but it 's pretty much the same damn show , & i can hum the " small wonder " theme better ) There are movies that are so bad they 're good . this is n't one of those < br /><br />Where i saw it : Showtime Beyond < br /><br />My Grade : F-<br /><br />Eye Candy : Mako Hattori gets topless , Susan George gets 2 love scenes ( one nude , one just topless)<br /><br / >
0 This is one of those films that I could only sit through once . Charlotte Henry is fine -- in fact , all the actors were fine . The problem was in the script , the dialog , the direction , the editing , the sets and the special effects . Granted , this was 1933 , but it really creaked . Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen , Gary Cooper , W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable ( there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming ) . The movie just clumped along with no cohesion . Much of Lewis Carrols spirit , humor and continuity are missing . What a pity ! It 's such a great book . I would recommend Disney 's 1951 version .
0 I enjoyed the first reviewer 's comment far more than I did the film when I saw it at a second - run theatre in the early ' 80 's . I was impressed then by the care taken to create costumes modelled so closely after the Tenniel drawings . But to me , the cast was largely squandered , their personalities muffled by the masks , while the direction I think of as being unusually static , and the photography murky . The rating jotted down at the time was a nought , which means " not worth sitting through even once".<br /><br />Still , I too would jump at a chance to have a second look .
0 Or " Marlowe At Sea " . Yet another ridiculously overrated old film with Bogey . Quite talky , too . Bogey basically plays the same character as in the Marlow films ; always in control of a situation , never nervous - no matter how dangerous a situation , calls women " slim " and " dames " and other such nonsense , is the only " real male " i.e. alpha male in the movie ( the only other alpha male male being the head of Gestapo - but he is only a fat alpha male male ) , and - naturally - every attractive young woman who comes his way can not resist his charms and wants his penis within hours of their initial introduction . The character clich√©s are all here . Bogey is supposed to be the same type of cynic - about - to - reform as in " Casablanca " , and naturally he often refuses money or other valuables when being offered them - but how does that fit in with the tough cynic in him ? It does n't , so he ca n't be a cynic ; Hawks wanted it both ways : a character who is both the " cool lone cynic " and yet a well - meaning humanitarian . I do n't think so ... Bacall does her non - chalant " cool babe " routine for the first time , and there are plenty of overrated , not all - too interesting so - called " sexual innuendo " exchanges between her and Bogey ; these dialogues sound silly by today 's standards . " Just purse your lips and whistle ... " . A load of crap ... She was 19 when this was made but looks a lot older , and is far less attractive than the female stars of the day . Her bony face , with its sharp features , is nowhere even close to radiating the kind of feminine beauty of a de Havilland , the cuteness of a Myrna Loy , let alone the likability of an Irene Dunne . Bacall was more suited for playing vampires , not femme - fatales . ( In real life she is very much like her face : a Hollywood bitch . ) There is a scene in which Bacall breaks into tears ; very unsuitable for her character . There are two or three bad musical numbers - but my fast - forward button was ready.<br /><br />If you 're interested in reading my " biographies " of Bogart , Bacall , Huston , and other Hollywood personalities , contact me by e - mail .
0 I regret every single second of the time I lost while watching this movie , really . Unhappily , I always find it hard to switch off a movie once I started watching it . Especially , when it 's such a classic or what people use to call a classic . I think that this is one of those movies every movie - lover should have watched at least one time , so that was why I watched it . Do n't get me wrong , I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as actors , but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion . No really good plot , neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story . Well , not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres . Only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether ' Bogey ' and Bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another . I think " To Have and Have Not " is very overrated and Bogart was in many better films during the 1940s .
0 As a writer I find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face . Talk about insulting . I was writing better stories than this in 8th grade . Bad acting , bad writing , bad directing and when added all together the result is complete and total failure . < br /><br />The only thing this movie manages to accomplish is tricking the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time . Who would green light something so poorly written ? It 's not artistic , clever , smart , suspenseful , mysterious , scary , dramatic - NOTHING.<br /><br />The characters are flat and boring with no development . The plot is as recycled as an aluminum can . They somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next " Pulp Fiction " . This script should have been used to line a bird cage , not a movie . < br /><br />Oh and last but not least , a 5'2 105 lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a struggle and in a single blow . < br /><br />Avoid this bomb like it will infect you with an STD .
0 This " movie " is such a bad work ! Nothing seems to even try and be realistic . Plot is weak , acting - miserable , actors wondering around like in a 1st year production , trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning . What a flop ! What a waste of time , money and effort to all concerned including the audience . Well , as in any thriller , here too are murders , corpses and blood . Just imagine someone who 5 minutes ago , committed a murder with a knife , and came out calm and smiling , not to mention clean as a whistle , as if slashing one 's throat is done by a virtual agent . Also , this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male , and she cut his throat ! ! ! Did she ask him , politely , to bend down for her ? Much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one . Continuity is another huge problem as for instance : The eager - hungry groom is lying in bed , waiting for his virgin - bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while , falls asleep ( ! ? ! ) . Next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception - area , asking for guidance to scenery spots ! NOT A WORD ABOUT LAST NIGHT ? ? ? Such a waste of time even to try and write about this low - low supposed - to - be " movie " .
0 " Three Daring Daughters " is a sickly sweet , rose - colored look at divorce , remarriage , and single - parent living . Obviously , social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted , takes a cruise , and then dates and marries a band conductor . Even when the " its just a movie " phrase excuses the script from addressing real - life problems , ' Daughters ' suffers from too many incoherent high - note songs , children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader Hose Iturbi playing himself . Is n't it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married ? < br /><br />Admittedly , this movie was released in the nineteen forties . Only a love for old style Hollywood romance and comedy could make ' Daughters ' a tolerable film .
0 I actually have a fondness for Christopher Lee , but this just was n't up to his other performances ... and he was one of the better actors.<br /><br />The film does not live up to its premise . It 's not that scary , it 's overly melodramatic , and it draaaaaags . Every time I thought , " Oh , HERE comes the good part " the good part never quite arrived.<br /><br />The Evil Ones are n't at all convincing . Most of the other characters were also lacking in depth.<br /><br />Perhaps if I 'd been in the proper frame of mind , I might have enjoyed some MSTie - fication at this film 's expense , but .... Naaahhh ... Did n't really seem to be worth the effort . It was n't really very good , it was n't really very bad , it was just mediocre .
0 I wo n't add to the plot reviews , it 's not very good.<br /><br />Very improbable orphanage on Bala.<br /><br />Cushing and Lee at their height.<br /><br />Some nice scenery.<br /><br />Good for face spotting , and I quote , " look at the mouth , that is Cassie from Fools and Horses".<br /><br />Otherwise , a poor example of the British film industry.<br /><br />Fulton MacKay was far better in Fraggle Rock , Keith Barron was better in anything else and Diana Dors did what she did best.<br /><br />Redeeming feature ? It was free to watch on the Horror channel prior to its going over to subscription . I wo n't be subscribing on this effort .
0 In spite of having some exciting ( and daring ) sequences , NBTN just never gets going . There are exploding boats , hat pin murders , mass suicides , pathologists with body parts , and all sorts of classic mystery / horror scenes , but they 're interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition . Everybody in the movie looks bored . This is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmed.<br /><br />Add to this the " too - proper " Brit characters and you feel like you 've drifted into a Sherlock Holmes movie.<br /><br />Finally , the cinematography is very ordinary . There are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside , or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire , but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull.<br /><br />Definitely only for Lee and Cushing fans .
